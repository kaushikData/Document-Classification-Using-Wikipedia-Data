'''Alec Naylor Dakin''' (3 April 1912 &amp;ndash; 14 June 2003) was a Fellow of Oxford College, a cryptologist at [[Bletchley Park]], an [[Egyptologist]] and schoolmaster.

==Early life and family==
Alec Dakin was born in [[Mytholmroyd]] in the [[West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]] in 1912, the son of [[inventor]] and sawmaker, Bertram Alexander Dakin and his wife Annie Louise Naylor who were married in 1908 in [[Todmorden]]. He came from an inventive family since his father, who was born in 1879, was an [[inventor]] (of carving knives, saws, pan handles and wall coatings).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1437141/Alec-Dakin.html&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to Heath School, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]].

==Academic career==
At school he won a second scholarship, this time to Queen's College, Oxford. There he read [[Greats]] and took walks with his fellow Yorkshire scholarship-boy and [[Nonconformist]], [[Harold Wilson]].
Alec's tutor, [[Oliver Franks]] encouraged him to begin the study of Egyptology, and he was also guided by Professor [[Battiscombe Gunn]], an English [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and [[philologist]] who had published his first translation from Egyptian in 1906 and, in 1934, was appointed [[Professor of Egyptology (Oxford)|Professor of Egyptology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] just a few years prior to Alec's time there where Battiscombe devoted himself to his pupils and his classes, at the expense of his own research.
In 1936 at the age of 24, Alec became a [[Fellow]] of [[University College Oxford]].

==Cryptology==
During his studies Alec had acquired fluent German, which would later turn out to be extremely advantageous to his career.
He was clearly destined for a distinguished career as an Oxford Egyptologist but just two years later in 1940, his life took an unexpected turn when he was recruited by her Majesty's government to work as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park - to assist the war effort. 
He worked in complete secrecy in [[hut 4]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/bletchleyjews.html]&lt;/ref&gt; alongside many others at Bletchley, including the well known cryptographer, [[Alan Turing]] who was put in charge of all of them by [[Winston Churchill]].He later described this period as the happiest time of his life and especially
enjoyed the challenge of the early days, before the [[Colossus computer]] took over the decrypting.

==Enigma==
Alec was responsible for rapidly translating the decrypted German naval [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] signals for the [[Admiralty]] to determine which ones were most important.

==Memorable decryptions==
One such signal was from the [[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]] which read "Most immediate. Torpedo hit right aft. Ship unmanoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Fuehrer."
Another might simply inform a numbered rating on a U-boat that his home in Germany had been bombed.

Dakin was one of the first people to read the message "The Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is dead." although this was somewhat premature as Hitler actually survived the assassination attempt that this signal presaged.

==Total secrecy==
As with other Bletchley Park staff he was obliged to take an oath of secrecy, never speaking to anyone of his war work, even his wife Joan, whom
he married in 1953. 
Hee tried to join the Royal Navy, but was prevented on the grounds that he knew too much to risk his being captured.

==Codebreakers book==
Together with Ernest Ettinghausen, [[Walter Eytan|Walter Ettinghausen]]'s younger brother, he described
the work of Hut 4 for secret Foreign Office files. It was so secret that he was not even allowed to consult it himself when eventually
he wrote his chapter on the work of Hut 4 for "''Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park''", an
inside story account of Bletchley Park, edited by [[F. H. Hinsley]] and
[[Alan Stripp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Hinsley | editor-first = F.H. | editor-link = Harry Hinsley | editor2-last = Stripp | editor2-first = Alan | year = 1993 | origyear = 1992 | title = Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park | publication-place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-280132-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar career==
After the war he decided to become a schoolmaster instead of returning to Oxford.
He thought that he could more directly help to build the world by influencing young people at their most formative stage. 
In 1946 he joined the staff at Kingswood School, Bath, teaching [[classics]], and remained there until his retirement in 1969.

'''Alexander Gus Spanos''' (September 28, 1923 – October 9, 2018) was an American [[billionaire]] real estate developer, founder of the [[A. G. Spanos Companies]], and the majority owner of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).

==Early life and education==
Spanos was born in [[Stockton, California]] to a [[Greek Americans|Greek]] family,&lt;ref name=LATimesImpoverished&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-11/sports/sp-34046_1_alex-spanos Los Angeles Times: "ALEX SPANOS : How the son of an impoverished Greek immigrant borrowed $800 and turned it into a business and sports empire worth $160 million" by CHRIS COBBS] March 11, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Greek immigrants, Constantino and Evanthia Spanos.&lt;ref name=UnionTribHateLosing&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20020512-9999_1n12spanos.html San Diego Union Tribune: "Alex Spanos 'I Hate Losing'" by Roger M.

Spanos' mother even left the family home for two years and attempted to take two children with her, but his parents reunited when he was a teenager and remained married until his death. Spanos, who played a large part in mediating the conflict between his parents, stated that his turbulent home life was the reason he strove to provide a stable environment for his own children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pM6ZPeBOIWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=alex+spanos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil9du1uareAhVvIjQIHQMdAxAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=alex%20spanos&amp;f=false|title=Sharing the Wealth: My Story|last=Spanos|first=Alex|last2=Seal|first2=Mark|last3=Kasparian|first3=Natalia|date=2013-02-05|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781621571032|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pM6ZPeBOIWIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=alex+spanos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil9du1uareAhVvIjQIHQMdAxAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=faye&amp;f=false|title=Sharing the Wealth: My Story|last=Spanos|first=Alex|last2=Seal|first2=Mark|last3=Kasparian|first3=Natalia|date=2013-02-05|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781621571032|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he dropped out of college at the [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic School]] and joined the [[Army Air Force]] training as a pilot but left the program and instead served as a tail gunner during World War II.&lt;ref name=UnionTribHateLosing /&gt; Spanos earned varsity letters in swimming and diving at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in Stockton and later distinguished himself as an amateur golfer.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Career==
In 1951&lt;ref name=UnionTribHateLosing /&gt; he borrowed $800 from a local banker to buy a truck which he then used to sell sandwiches to migrant farm workers in the [[San Joaquin Valley]].&lt;ref name=LATimesImpoverished /&gt; By 1955 he had made his first million dollars.&lt;ref name=UnionTribHateLosing /&gt; He invested his earnings in real estate and at the suggestion of his tax accountants, started to build apartments.&lt;ref name=LATimesImpoverished /&gt; In 1960, he founded [[A.G.

In 1984, Spanos bought 60% of the [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] (now Los Angeles Chargers) from majority owner [[Eugene V. Klein|Eugene Klein]] for $48.3 million.&lt;ref name=UnionTribHateLosing /&gt; Over the next 10 years, he bought out the shares of several small co-owners, bringing his control of the team to 97%.

==Philanthropy and political contributions==
Spanos donated $500,000 to renovate the [[Fox Theatre (Stockton, California)|Fox Theatre]] in downtown Stockton, and with the approval of the City of Stockton, renamed the facility the Fox California Bob Hope Theatre.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The [[Alex G.

Spanos was one of the largest contributors to [[George W. Bush]]'s re-election campaign in 2004.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} By contributing $5 million to 527 groups that supported the Bush campaign in 2004, Spanos ranked among the top five GOP donors.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} President Bush appointed Spanos to the [[Kennedy Center]] board in 2004.

'''Alexander Wilson''' (25 May 1953 – 26 October 1993) was a writer, teacher, [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]], and [[Community organizing|community activist]].

Born in [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]], [[Illinois]], Wilson grew up in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. In 1977, he moved to [[Canada]], where he lived and worked in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

Wilson advocated restoring indigenous plant species to the urban landscape, thereby promoting urban biodiversity and reconnecting urban dwellers with the natural history of the place in which they live. He believed that combining ecological restoration and [[community gardening]] could be a way to nurture and improve not only [[urban ecosystem]]s, but also social and economic relations. In his book, ''The Culture of Nature: North American Landscape from Disney to the Exxon Valdez'' (1991), he dealt with the ways in which culture informs and constructs our understanding of "nature", and he examined the colonisation and appropriation of nature by the city (particularly via the automobile).

Wilson established the Garrison Creek Planting Company with artist [[Stephen Andrews (Artist)|Stephen Andrews]] (his [[life partner]]) and horticulturist Kim Delaney. He also designed the landscaping for the AIDS Memorial, Cawthra Park, itself designed by Patrick Fahn. Following Wilson's death from [[AIDS]]-related causes, his own memorial plaque was added to the others in the park.

On an urban lot near his house Wilson created a reclaimed garden that, after his death, friends tried to buy and preserve. Though they were unsuccessful in that project they did find another downtown lot on which a garden was created and named in his memory, the Alex Wilson Community Garden, which opened in June 1998 at 552 Richmond Street West in Toronto.

A plaque in the park includes a quoted passage from ''The Culture of Nature'':
::'' "We must build landscapes that heal, connect and empower, that make intelligible our relations with each other and the natural world." ''

[[File:Algic langs.png|thumb|375px|Pre-contact distribution of Algonquian languages]]
The '''Algonquian''' are one of the most populous and widespread [[North America]]n [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] language groups. Today, thousands of individuals identify with various Algonquian peoples. Historically, the peoples were prominent along the Atlantic Coast and into the interior along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and around the [[Great Lakes]]. This grouping consists of the peoples who speak [[Algonquian languages]].

[[File:The village of Pomeioc, North Carolina, 1885, color - NARA - 535753.jpg|thumb|A 16th-century sketch of the Algonquian village of Pomeiock.]]
Before Europeans came into contact, most Algonquian settlements lived by hunting and fishing, although quite a few supplemented their diet by cultivating [[maize|corn]], [[bean]]s and [[Cucurbita|squash]] (the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters"]]). The [[Ojibwe]] cultivated [[wild rice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raster|first=Amanda|last2=Hill|first2=Christina Gish|date=2016-05-24|title=The dispute over wild rice: an investigation of treaty agreements and Ojibwe food sovereignty|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10460-016-9703-6|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=267–281|doi=10.1007/s10460-016-9703-6|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Algonquians of [[New England]] (who spoke [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]]) practiced a seasonal economy. The basic [[social unit]] was the village: a few hundred people related by a [[clan]] [[kinship]] structure. Villages were temporary and mobile. The people moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or gathering as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of cross-tribal mobility, especially in troubled times.

In warm weather, they constructed portable [[wigwam]]s, a type of hut usually with [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] doors. In the winter, they erected the more substantial [[longhouses of the indigenous peoples of North America|longhouses]], in which more than one [[clan]] could reside. They cached food supplies in more permanent, [[Root cellar|semi-subterranean structures]].

In the spring, when the fish were spawning, they left the winter camps to build villages at coastal locations and waterfalls. In March, they caught [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] in nets and [[Weir|weirs]], moving about in [[birch bark]] [[canoe]]s. In April, they netted [[alewife]], [[sturgeon]] and [[salmon]]. In May, they caught [[cod]] with hook and line in the [[ocean]]; and [[trout]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[striped bass]] and [[flounder]] in the [[estuaries]] and streams. Putting out to sea, the men hunted [[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[walrus]]es and [[pinniped|seals]].[[dubious]] The women and children gathered [[scallop]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[clam]]s and [[crab]]s, all the basis of menus in New England today.

From April through October, natives hunted [[bird migration|migratory]] birds and their eggs: [[Canada geese]], [[Brent Goose|brant]], [[mourning dove]]s and others. In July and August they gathered [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]] and nuts. In September, they split into small groups and moved up the streams to the forest. There, the men hunted [[beaver]], [[caribou]], [[moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]].

In December, when the snows began, the people created larger winter camps in sheltered locations, where they built or reconstructed longhouses. February and March were lean times. The tribes in [[southern New England]] and other northern latitudes had to rely on cached food. Northerners developed a practice of going hungry for several days at a time. Historians hypothesize that this practice kept the population down, according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]]. Northerners were food gatherers only.{{what?|date=November 2018}}

The southern Algonquians of New England relied predominantly on [[slash and burn]] agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson W. Fletcher, ''Pennsylvania Agriculture and Country Life 1640-1840'' (Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, 1950), 2, 35-37, 63-65, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Day, Gordon M. |title=The Indian as an Ecological Factor in the Northeastern Forests|journal=Ecology|volume= 34|issue=2|pages= 329-346|doi= 10.2307/1930900|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New England and New York areas 1580-1800'', 1953.

Notes that the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) in New Jersey used fire in ecosystems.&lt;/ref&gt; They cleared fields by burning for one or two years of cultivation, after which the village moved to another location. This is the reason the [[England|English]] found the region relatively cleared and ready for planting. By using various kinds of native corn (maize), beans and squash, southern New England natives were able to improve their diet to such a degree that their population increased and they reached a density of 287 people per 100 square miles as opposed to 41 in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cronon |first=William |date=1983 |title=Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHclmuykdBQC&amp;pg=PT57&amp;lpg=PT57&amp;dq=%2241%22+%22287%22+#v=onepage&amp;q=%2241%22%20%22287%22&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |page=42 |isbn=0-8090-0158-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with mobile crop rotation, southern villages were necessarily less mobile than northern ones. The natives continued their seasonal occupation but tended to move into fixed villages near their lands. They adjusted to the change partially by developing a gender-oriented [[division of labor]]. The women cultivated crops, and the men fished and hunted.

Scholars{{who|date=January 2015}} estimate that, by the year 1600, the indigenous population of New England had reached 70,000–100,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Colonial period==

At the time of the first European settlements in North America, Algonquian peoples occupied what is now [[New Brunswick]], and much of what is now [[Canada]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]; what is now [[New England]], [[New Jersey]], southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Delaware]] and down the Atlantic Coast through the [[Upper South]]; and around the Great Lakes in present-day [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]] and [[Iowa]]. They were mostly concentrated in the New England region. The homeland of the Algonquian peoples is not known. At the time of the European arrival, the hegemonic [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, was regularly at war with Algonquian neighbours.

==Tribal identities==

===Canada===
The French and later English encountered the [[Maliseet]] of present-day [[Maine]], [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]]; the [[Abenaki]] of Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire; the Mi'kmaw [[band government]]s of the [[Maritimes]] lived primarily on fishing. Further north are the Betsiamite, [[Atikamekw]], [[Anishinaabe]] and [[Innu]]/[[Naskapi]]. The [[Beothuk]] of Newfoundland might have been Algonquians, but as their last known speaker died in the early 19th century, little record of their language or culture remains.

===New England area===
Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]], [[Massachusett]], [[Nipmuck]], [[Pennacook]], [[Penobscot]], [[Passamaquoddy]], and [[Quinnipiac]]. The [[Mohegan]], [[Pequot]], [[Pocumtuc]], [[Tunxis]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] were based in southern New England. The [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]] were located in northern New England: present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in what became the United States and eastern Quebec in what became Canada. They had established trading relationships with French colonists who settled along the Atlantic coast and what was later called the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Mahican]] was located in western New England and in the upper Hudson River Valley (around what was developed by Europeans as Albany, New York). These groups practiced agriculture, hunting and fishing.

===Mid- and south-Atlantic===
The [[Lenape]], also called ''Delaware'', were ([[Munsee language|Munsee]]) and [[Unami language|Unami]] speakers that were in what is now known as the eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, [[lower Hudson Valley]] and western Long Island areas in New York. They encountered the European explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in what is now [[New York Harbor]] in 1524. 

Further south were the traditional homes of the [[Powhatan]], a loose group of bands numbering into the tens of thousands, who were among the first to encounter English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay region. Historic people also included the [[Nanticoke tribe|Nanticoke]], [[Wicocomico]], [[Secotan]], [[Chowanoke]], [[Weapemeoc]], and [[Chickahominy people|Chickahominy]].

The southernmost Alqonquin peoples were clustered around [[Pamlico Sound]] in what is now North Carolina, including the [[Pamplico]], [[Chowanoke]], and [[Roanoke tribe|Roanoke]].

===Midwest===
The French encountered Algonquian peoples in this area through their trade and limited colonization of New France along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The historic peoples of the Illinois Country were the [[Shawnee]], [[Illiniwek]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Menominee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]]. The latter were also known as the Sac and Fox, and later known as the Meskwaki Indians, who lived throughout the present-day Midwest of the United States.

During the nineteenth century, many Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River were displaced over great distances through the United States passage and enforcement of [[Indian removal]] legislation; they forced the people west of the [[Mississippi River]] to what they designated as [[Indian Territory]]. After the US extinguished Indian land claims, this area was admitted as the state of [[Oklahoma]] in the early 20th century.

===Upper west===
Ojibwe/Chippewa, [[Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]], and a variety of [[Cree]] groups lived in [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Western Ontario]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]], and the [[Canadian Prairies]]. The [[Arapaho]], [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] and [[Cheyenne]] developed as indigenous to the [[Great Plains]].

===Western areas===
Algonquian peoples in the present states of Wyoming, Colorado, southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas were ancestors to the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]].&lt;ref&gt;Frink, Lisa.

'''Andrés de Jesús María y José Bello López''' ({{IPA-es|anˈðɾes ˈβeʝo}}; November 29, 1781 &amp;ndash; October 15, 1865) was a [[Chile]]an-[[Venezuela]]n [[Humanism|humanist]], diplomat, poet, legislator, [[philosopher]], educator and [[philologist]], whose political and literary works constitute an important part of [[Spanish America]]n culture.  Bello is featured on the old 2,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar]] and the 20,000 [[Chilean peso]] notes.
There is also a decoration, the Venezuelan Order of Andrés Bello.

In Caracas, where he was born, Andres Bello was Simón Bolívar's teacher for a short period of time and participated in the process that led to Venezuelan independence. Being a diplomat for the new independent government that helped establish, he went with Luis López Méndez and Simón Bolívar on their first diplomatic mission to London, the city where he lived between 1810 and 1829.

In 1829, Bello went with his family to Chile. He was hired by the Chilean government and made great works in the field of law and humanities. In Santiago he held positions as a senator and a professor, as well as directing several local newspapers. As a legislator, he was the main promoter and editor of the Civil Code, one of the most innovative and influential American legal works of his time. In 1842, Under his inspiration and with his decisive support the University of Chile was created, an institution of which he became the first rector for more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Oses, Darío. «Biografía de Andrés Bello».

==Biography Information==

=== Life in Venezuela (1781-1810) ===
Bello was born in [[Caracas]] and grew up studying at the academy of Ramón Vanlonsten. He was the first son of the lawyer don Bartolomé Bello and Ana Antonia López, whose parents descended from people from the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elguanche.net/Ficheros3/emigracionytrascendenciaagm8.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305184218/http://elguanche.net/Ficheros3/emigracionytrascendenciaagm8.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}.

After the monk's death in 1796, Bello translated Book V of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref name="BTH"&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portales/traducciones_hispanoamericanas/traductores/ Biblioteca de Traducciones Hispanoamericanas]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied [[Liberal Arts]], [[Law]] and [[Medicine]] at the [[Central University of Venezuela|University of Caracas]] and graduated on May 9, 1800 with a degree of Bachelor of Arts.  As well as having unfinished studies in law and medicine, he also learned English and French on his own. He gave private classes, with the young [[Simón Bolívar]] among his students. His translations and adaptations of classic texts gave him prestige, and in 1802 won, by contest, the rank of officer Second Secretary of the colonial government. During the period 1802-1810, Bello became one of the most intellectually influential people in the society of Caracas, standing in performing political work for the colonial administration, besides gaining notoriety as a poet, translating the tragedy Zulima Voltaire. He later became known for his early writings and translations, edited the newspaper ''[[Gazeta de Caracas]]'' and held important offices in the government of the [[Captaincy General]] of Venezuela. He accompanied [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in a part of his Latin American expedition (1800) and was for a short time Simón Bolívar's teacher.&lt;ref name="Arismendi10"&gt;Arismendi Posada, Ignacio; ''Gobernantes Colombianos'', trans. Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd.; Italgraf; Segunda Edición; Page 10; Bogotá, Colombia; 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  His relationships with both men became a major factor in cultivating his ideas for his intellectual career.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Bello spent ten years after his formal education in his homeland of Caracas. He authored two pieces of literary work, ''Calendario manual y guía universal del forastero en Venezuela para el año de 1810'' and the ''Resumen de la historia de Venezuela''
.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gregory Weinberg "Andres Bello" UNESCO: International Bureau of Education, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Both works became widely accepted in Venezuela, and from this point Bello started his career as a poet. As time progressed, Bello further expanded his notions on [[humanism]] and [[conservatism]]. From his theories and ideas, Bello was eventually hailed as one of the foremost humanists of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proyectovlp.com/interesante/andres-bello-uno-de-los-humanistas-mas-importantes-de-america|title=Andrés Bello, uno de los humanistas más importantes de América - Proyecto VLP|last=VLP|first=Proyecto|access-date=2018-11-27|language=es-es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 1810, Bello participated in events that helped to spark the independence of Venezuela, including the dismissal of Captain General Vicente Emparan by the Cabildo de Caracas. The Supreme Junta of Caracas, the institution that governed the Captaincy General of Venezuela following the forced resignation of Emparan, and immediately named Bello First Officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On June 10 of that year, he set sail on a diplomatic mission to London as a representative of the new Republic. He was commissioned, together with Simón Bolívar and Luis López Méndez, to obtain British support for the cause of independence. Bello was chosen for his knowledge and command of the English language, which he had acquired predominantly on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://estudiarmucho.com/andres-bello-y-simon-bolivar-3975/|title=Andrés Bello y Simon Bolivar  Ejemplo de Ensayo|last=|first=|date=|website=estudiarmucho.com|language=es-ES|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life in England (1810-1829)===
[[File:58 Grafton Way, London 03.JPG|thumb|Blue plaque commemorating Bello on 58 Grafton Way, London]]
As First Officer of [[Venezuela]]'s Foreign Secretariat after the coup on April 19, 1810, he was sent to [[London]] with [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[Luis Lopez Mendez]] serving as Diplomatic Representative to procure funds for the revolutionary effort until 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Crow (1992:431).&lt;/ref&gt; Bello landed at [[Portsmouth]] as an attache to Bolivar's mission in July 1810.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Bello had an admittedly hard life throughout his stay in England, though he managed to further develop his ideas and took a particular interest in [[England]]'s social changes from the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] and [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In order to earn a living while in London, Bello taught Spanish and tutored Lord Hamilton's children.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; In London, he met [[Francisco de Miranda]] and became a frequent visitor of his library in Grafton Way, as well as of the [[British Museum]]. Along with Bello, Bolivar and López also became friends with Miranda and used their opportunity to become known thanks to Miranda's accomplishments. During his lengthy stay in England, he curbed his feelings of homesickness and became contemporaries with thinkers and intellectuals such as [[José María Blanco White]], [[Bartólome José Gallardo]], [[Vicente Rocafuerte]] to name a few. He stayed in London for nineteen years acting as a secretary to legations and diplomatic affairs for [[Chile]] and [[Colombia]]. In his free time he was involved in study, teaching and journalism.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;"Bello, Andrés." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2008. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 28 Oct. 2008  &lt;http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9015290&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] commemorates Bello at 58 Grafton Way, his Fitzrovia address.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/bello-andres-1781-1865|title=BELLO, ANDRÉS (1781-1865)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, Andrés Bello suffered economically as he tried to return home to Venezuela. The earthquake that occurred March 26, 1812, prevented Bello's family to help him financially in his return. Besides this, the fall of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|First Republic]] ended the mode of financial support he received from Latin America and the arrest of Francisco de Miranda did not make any thing better. 

In 1814, Andrés Bello married Mary Ann Boyland, whom he had been with for 20 years. He has three children, [[:es:Carlos|Carlos Bello Boyland]] (1815), Francisco Bello Boyland (1817), and Juan Pablo Antonio Bello Boyland (1820). His family situation is constantly affected by his financial situation which is why he is always finding new jobs. He managed to work for the government of [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]] in 1815 and to the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata|United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] the following year. In 1821, his wife died of [[Tuberculosis]] and shortly after his son, Juan Pablo died as well. 

In 1823, Bello published the ''Biblioteca America'' with Juan Garcia del Rio which was widely hailed in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In 1826 he published the journal ''Repertorio Americano'' to which he frequently contributed as both editor and poet.&lt;ref name="Crow"&gt;John Crow (1992), ''The Epic of Latin America'', California: [[University of California Press]]. p643&lt;/ref&gt; His two epic poems by which he was made famous, entitled ''Las Silvas Americanas'', were originally published during his time in London around 1826 and documented the emerging culture of the [[New World]]. The second of the poems ''la agricultura de la zona tórrida'' is the most famous of the two, and is a poetic description of South America's tropical lands in a style reminiscent of [[Virgil]], a poet of great influence for Bello.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; His situation temporarily got better in 1822 when Antonio José de Irisarri, a Chilean minister in London, named Bello interim secretary of the legation.

On February 24, 1824, Bello remarried Isabel Antonia Dunn, whom he had 12 children with (3 born in London and the rest in Chile). Bello was able to become interim secretary again but for Colombia and took charge on February 7, 1825. This job was not what he expected as he was paid irregularly due to the financial crisis in Latin America. 

In December 1826, Bello wrote a letter to Bolivar asking him to help out with his financial situation in London. Not only did write because of his economic crisis but because he believed that his friendship with Bolívar had disappeared. In April 1827, Bello wrote to Bolívar again but his situation did not get any better. Their friendship eventually came to an end when Bolívar gave Bello's position to someone else and Bello had to find another job. In 1828, the government of Chile offered Bello a job in the Ministry of Finance and on February 14, 1829, he finally left the United Kingdom.

=== Life in Chile (1829-1865) ===
[[Image:Andrés Bello y esposa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Andrés Bello and his wife Isabel Dunn in 1862]]
In 1829 he accepted a post in the [[Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in Santiago, Chile under the administration of Chilean minister [[Diego Portales]].&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; While a surprising candidate considering his Venezuelan birth, he gladly accepted the post and was later named Senator of Santiago. As Senator, Bello founded the [[University of Chile]] in 1843 and held a position as Rector for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt;  Until his death at the age of eighty-three, Bello worked tirelessly to train the young minds of the new [[republic]].&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt;  Such brilliant thinkers and writers as [[José Victorino Lastarria]] and [[Francisco Bilbao]] were influenced by their time with Bello.&lt;ref&gt;Crow (1992:644)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[s:es:Gramática de la lengua castellana destinada al uso de los americanos|Gramática de la lengua castellana destinada al uso de los americanos]], or ''Castilian Grammar Intended for the Use by Americans'' (''Americans'' referring to Castilian- or Spanish-speaking inhabitants of the Americas), finished in 1847, was the first Spanish-American Grammar, with many original contributions, a product of long years of study. Republished over the years with many revisions, the most significant of which are by [[Rufino Jose Cuervo]], this is still a valuable reference work. Bello was accepted in the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Language]] as Correspondent Member in 1861.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

== Accomplishments ==

* One of Bello's most famous accomplishments was his promulgation of the 1852 [[Civil Code (Chile)|Civil Code of Chile]], passed by [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] in 1855. It served primarily as a governing code similar to Europe's [[Napoleonic Code]]. He worked on this Code for twenty years, and it was later adopted by both Colombia and [[Ecuador]].
* In 1883, a Colombian city adopted his last name (Bello in Antioquia) because the residents there believed that the name Bello was the best example of his legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Municipio [[Bello, Antioquia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[File:Logouchile.png|thumb|Universidad de Chile]]He is also revered by the [[María Lionza]] religion of Venezuela. In 1953 the [[Andrés Bello Catholic University]] was founded, named in his honour. Chile's Diplomatic Academy is also named after Andrés Bello. Several of his descendants have even worked there as teachers in the many years since its founding, most recently [[Jesus Rafael Bello]] Brito -a part-time diplomat and reclusive investor.

[[File:Unab. 400x350.jpg|thumb|Andrés Bello National University]]

* A raised bust has been erected in Andres Bello's honor at [http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/ St. Antony's College], a world-renowned centre for research and teaching in global and regional issues at Oxford University, with an inscription that reads: 'Poet, Jurist, Philosopher, Philologist, Educator: Born Caracas 1781. Died Santiago de Chile 1865. From 1810-1829 he served the cause of South American Independence'.

* Bello is featured on the old 2,000 [[Venezuelan bolívar]] and the 20,000 [[Chilean peso]] notes. There is also a decoration, the Venezuelan Order of Andrés Bello. In 2014 a new column in [[The Economist]] covering Latin America was named "Bello" in his honor.
* In 1988, a private university in Chile adopted his name, [[Andrés Bello National University]]. 
* In 2008, the [[University of Chile]] created a magazine in honor of Bello called, "Public Bello" where it discusses popular themes about human society.

'''Ann Moore''' (31 October 1761 – 1813) was an [[England|English]] woman who became notorious as '''the fasting-woman of Tutbury'''. From 1807 to 1813, she claimed to have [[fasting|eaten nothing]] at all, but her claims were eventually shown to be a [[hoax]].

==Life==
Ann was born in [[Rosliston]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2Y4AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=ann+moore+tutbury&amp;source=web&amp;ots=876tOJFZKL&amp;sig=qn-_fZ_qzcthl4K71YIjo5UBqtM One source "The Cabinet of Curiosities: Or, Wonders of the World Displayed" says she was born at [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] near Ashbourne.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derbyshire]], the daughter of a day-labourer named Peg or Pegg. In 1788 she inveigled into marriage a farm servant, James Moore, who soon deserted her. She then lived on her looks and became the mother of a large family.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; About 1800 she made her way to [[Tutbury]] to find employment.

Reduced to dire poverty, she subsisted on the minimum amount of food necessary to support a human being, and the astonishment created locally by her long fasts doubtless encouraged her to undertake the imposture which made her notorious.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; It was given out that she had lost all desire for food from November 1806. Six months later the interest taken in her in the neighbourhood was sufficient to warrant her in taking permanently to her bed. On 20 May 1807 it was reported that she attempted to swallow a piece of biscuit, but the effort was followed by great pain and vomiting of blood. 'The last food she ever took was a few [[blackcurrant]]s, on 17 July 1807,' and in August 'she gradually diminished her liquids.' Details were multiplied in the pamphlets which narrated her case. One learned writer proved that she lived on air, another that the phenomenon was due to disease of the oesophagus, while a third was convinced that her condition was a manifestation of the supernatural power of God. [[Joanna Southcott]] declared that the advent of the fasting-woman presaged a three years' famine in [[France]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

An investigation was set on foot in September 1808, and a succession of four hours' watches, undertaken by the chief inhabitants of the district,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=ann+moore+tutbury&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=iEnrHG0wi6&amp;sig=fLkHdrpdB3HtpfCt-vKG_NMasMw#PPR11,M1 A Statement of Facts, Relative to the Supposed Abstinence of Ann Moore] By Legh Richmond Accessed 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; was arranged to cover a period of sixteen days. Bulletins were posted from time to time in Tutbury, to record progress, and a list of the watchers was published. At the commencement of the ordeal Mrs. Moore was described as terribly worn and emaciated, but as it progressed she sensibly improved in health and spirits. Robert Taylor and John Allen, two local doctors made communications on the subject of the case to the [[Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal]] &lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal|date=1813|volume=9|publisher=A. and C. Black|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHIBAAAAYAAJ|page=3|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November and December 1808.

The report of the committee was generally held to be conclusive evidence of Ann's veracity. For the next four years she continued to attract crowds of visitors&lt;ref name=how/&gt; many making a substantial offering.&lt;ref name=how&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kfgDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=ann+moore+tutbury&amp;source=web&amp;ots=G39m8Dmq-z&amp;sig=76Og1LQCT6rCBDdzH25jtFgeaC0#PPA130,M1 My own story; or, The autobiography of a child] by [[Mary Howitt]] p131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Howitt]], then Mary Botham, was taken to see her as a child as she explains in her autobiography. She says that her father told her that not many believed that she ate nothing but that she did eat very little. Mary said that she could only think of the following poem:
&lt;poem&gt;
There was an old lady all skin and bone
This old lady was very well known
She lay in bed as I've heard say
For many years to fast and pray
When she had lain a twelvemonth's space
The flesh was gone from hands and face
When that another twelvemonth was gone
She was nothing at all but a skeleton&lt;ref name=how/&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1812 she deposited [[pound sterling|£]]400 in the funds, but in the summer of that year [[Alexander Henderson (physician)|Alexander Henderson]] (1780–1863) Physician to the Westminster General Dispensary, wrote an able ''Examination ' of the imposture'',&lt;ref name=hend&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I-hZJK99gRsC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=ann+moore+tutbury&amp;source=web&amp;ots=G3IZgQgRBQ&amp;sig=4wrUSBKG9kdg_e0M7oAXaeHMZvE#PPA24,M1he Alexander Henderson in Journal of Foreign Medical Science and Literature] edited by Samuel Emlen, accessed October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; showing the inconsistencies and absurdities of the woman's statements, and the curious parallel between the case and that of [[Anna M. Kinker]], a girl of [[Osnabrück]], who practised a similar imposture in [[Germany]] in 1800. Henderson reported that Ann claimed to have not eaten solid food for "upwards of five years" and had not drunk liquid for four years. She claimed that she did not pass urine or any other matter.&lt;ref name=hend/&gt;

Having survived one watch, Ann was subjected to another to check her claims. This one commenced on 21 April 1813, and continued till the 30th, when she was shown to be a cheat. She died a few months afterwards, aged 53 years.&lt;ref&gt;Whites 1857 Directory of Derbyshire&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret methods==

The first set of doctors who investigated Moore were easily duped. According to skeptical writer [[Bergen Evans]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The credulousness of the first set of watchers was revealed in her admission that during the whole sixteen days of her first observation she had been fed by her daughter while the watchers were in the room. The younger woman had soaked towels in milk and broth and wrung them into her mother's mouth while washing her face. She had also conveyed food from her mouth to her mother's while kissing her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bergen Evans|Evans, Bergen]]. (1955). ''The Spoor of Spooks: And Other Nonsense''. Purnell. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Anna Margaret Glenn''' (née '''Castor'''; born February 17, 1920) is an American advocate for people with disabilities and communication disorders as well as the widow of former [[astronaut]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Glenn]].

== Early life and education ==
Anna Margaret Castor was born on February 17, 1920 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] to parents Homer and Margaret Castor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johnglennhome.org/about/annie-glenn/|title=Annie Glenn|website=johnglennhome.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father was a dentist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.osu.edu/find/collections/ohio-congressional-archives/john-h-glenn-archives/biographical-resources/biography-of-annie-glenn/ Ohio State University Libraries, Ohio Congressional Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1923, the Castor family moved to New Concord, Ohio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There, Castor became childhood friends with [[John Glenn]]; the pair later became [[high school sweetheart]]s. After graduating from high school, Castor attended [[Muskingum University|Muskingum College]] where she majored in music and education&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with a minor in secretarial skills.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/02/23/the-unsinkable-annie-glenn/916508d8-10eb-458c-9e9e-e60b37edad38/|title=The Unsinkable Annie Glenn|last=MacPherson|first=Myra|date=1984-02-23|last2=MacPherson|first2=Myra|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated in 1942.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though she received an offer for a [[pipe organ]] scholarship from [[Juilliard School|the Juilliard school of music]], Castor declined the offer,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glenn.osu.edu/about/annie-glenn/|title=John Glenn College of Public Affairs {{!}} Annie Glenn|website=glenn.osu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing instead to stay in Ohio with Glenn. Castor and Glenn were married on April 6, 1943.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Speech impairment==
Like her father before her, Glenn has experienced a [[Stuttering|speech stutter]] throughout her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When she was young, it was determined that her stutter was present in eighty-five percent of her verbal utterances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At age 53, Glenn found out about and attended an intensive three-week treatment course at Hollins Communications Research Institute in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] to help with her dysfluency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/12/09/to-john-glenn-the-real-hero-was-his-wife-annie-conqueror-of-disability/|title=Annie Glenn: ‘When I called John, he cried. People just couldn’t believe that I could really talk.’|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the course, her speech was greatly improved,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; however, she does not consider herself "cured" of stuttering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After attending the treatment course, she was able to interact verbally with others in a way that had been previously impossible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In time, she was able to give speeches at public events&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and at rallies in relation to her husband's political career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life and activities==
At the time of her husband's death in December 2016, Annie and John Glenn had been married for 73 years and eight months.  During the course of their marriage, the couple had two children and two grandchildren.  Glenn's children are: John David, born in 1945, and Carolyn Ann, born in 1947.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Activities and involvements===
Organizations in which she is involved include:
*Delta Gamma Theta Sorority ([[Muskingum College]])
*The Ohio Board of Child Abuse
*The Board of Columbus (Ohio) Speech and Hearing Center
*The Society of Sponsors
*The Board of Trustees of [[Muskingum College]]
*The Advisory Panel of the Central Ohio Speech and Hearing Association
*The Advisory Board for the National Center for Survivors of Childhood Abuse
*The Board for the [[National First Ladies' Library]]
*The National Deafness and other Communication Disorders Advisory Council of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

== Awards and honors ==
In 1983, she received the first national award of the [[American Speech and Hearing Association]] for “providing an inspiring model for people with communicative disorders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1987, the National Association for Hearing and Speech Action awarded the first annual Annie Glenn Award for achieving distinction despite a communication disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Glenn presented the award to [[James Earl Jones]] as its first recipient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was inducted into the [[National Stuttering Association Hall of Fame]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsastutter.org/pdfs/newsletters/m_478.pdf|title=NSASTUTTER.ORG|website=www.nsastutter.org|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[The Ohio State University]] renamed 17th Avenue (on its campus) to '''Annie and John Glenn Avenue'''. The road is located in close proximity to the [[John Glenn College of Public Affairs]] and crosses through the heart of The Ohio State University’s academic core.

Glenn is an [[adjunct professor]] with Ohio State’s Speech Pathology Department. In 2009, the university awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Public Service to recognize her work on behalf of children and others. The department awards the “Annie Glenn Leadership Award” annually to someone who has displayed innovative and inspirational work in speech/language pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.osu.edu/news/2015/11/05/17th-avenue-renamed/ |title=Ohio State to rename 17th Avenue in honor of John and Annie Glenn; The Ohio State University |publisher=osu.edu |date=2015-11-05 |accessdate=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals in popular culture==
Glenn was played by [[Mary Jo Deschanel]] in the 1983 movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''.  The film highlighted her stuttering problem, particularly in a scene involving then-Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during the buildup to John Glenn's ''[[Friendship 7]]'' flight. In the 2015 ABC-TV series ''[[The Astronaut Wives Club]]'', Annie is portrayed by [[Azure Parsons]].

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Poet_Oz.JPG|thumb|Arnold "Poet" Jackson]] --&gt;'''Poet''', played by [[muMs da Schemer]], is a fictional character in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

==Character overview==
''Prisoner #96J352. Convicted February 15, 1996 - Armed robbery, attempted murder, possession of a deadly weapon. Sentence: 16 years, eligible for parole in nine. Granted early release in 1998. Returned as inmate #98J448, convicted July 20, 1998, on one count of 2nd degree murder. Sentence: 26 years, eligible for parole in 19.''

Poet is a [[heroin]] addict imprisoned for armed robbery and attempted murder. He composes and recites free verse poetry and regularly practices and performs in front of other inmates. He gets [[parole]]d early with the help of [[Kareem Saïd]] and [[Tim McManus]]. His freedom is short-lived, however, as he soon kills a drug dealer who came after him to collect the money he owed. When back in prison, he becomes a full-fledged member of the Homeboy gang, often acting as the second in command to whoever is in charge.

Poet is one of the most incompetent members of the Homeboys, as he relies heavily on other gang members and inmates to solve problems. This is seen through Poet making little to no effort to sell drugs, and daring to get into fights only with backup from [[Kenny Wangler]], [[Junior Pierce]], or [[Reggie Rawls]]. Nevertheless, Poet remains as the gang's second in command throughout the series due to his intelligence and diplomacy.

==Season 1==

Poet has a limited role in this season, often reciting poems for the other prisoners during mealtimes. His poems often reflect the social problems and political decisions which adversely affect [[African-American]] men and their wider communities, as well as everyday life in prison.

==Season 2==

Let back into Emerald City as one of the Homeboys, Poet is enrolled in the [[GED]] program in Oz. [[Tim McManus]], the unit manager of Em City, believes Poet is very talented and gets [[Muslim]] leader [[Kareem Saïd]] to help publish his work. He dedicates one of these poems to Kareem Said and another to the graduating classmates of his GED class while in prison. Poet does very well in the GED program, finishing at the top of the class even though he is made fun of frequently by [[Kenny Wangler]]. As a result, Poet is paroled early and sells several of his poems as a known author that are published in a book 'Unheard America'. However, Poet is still a heroin addict and spends all his profits on drugs. Drug dealers come after him to collect a debt at one of his book signings during his book promotional tour and he kills one of them in self-defense. However, since Poet was carrying a weapon without a permit and shot the dealer six times while on parole, he is in violation and sent back to Oz for murder-in-the-second-degree to serve twenty-six years.

McManus and Saïd are both disappointed and the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] congratulates Poet for messing up and getting sent back to Oz. While back inside as punishment, he must work in the morgue and is only accepted by [[Kenny Wangler]] and [[Junior Pierce]].

==Season 3==

Poet is now referred to by his birth name of Arnold. Following the orders of [[Kenny Wangler]], their attempt to murder [[Simon Adebisi]] is put on hold under orders from [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] leader [[Antonio Nappa]]. Feeling guilty for wasting Said's efforts to have him paroled, a contrite Poet asks Said for permission to begin writing poetry again. Said gives Poet his blessing, but after Muslim [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]] beats Poet's friend and fellow homeboy, [[Kenny Wangler]], in boxing Poet publicly recites a sarcastic poem about Said's new relationship with a white woman. Because Said's behaviour has now become a public humiliation to the Muslims, he is eventually deposed and replaced by [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]].

Meanwhile, when Wangler leaves temporarily to attend his girlfriend's funeral, Adebisi makes a deal with current Italian head [[Chucky Pancamo]] to take Wangler's spot in the drug trade. With the help of the Latinos, Adebisi burns Poet and Pierce with hot soup, putting them out of commission for a few weeks. When released from the infirmary, Poet and Pierce both have white spots all over their skin since the burn wounds burned off part of their flesh and caused a temporary change in complexion. Poet jokingly remarks "I might be able to get a cab now" since his skin for the time being appears whiter.

In Unit B, they tell Wangler that Adebisi must die but they are temporarily dissuaded when they learn that Adebisi is going to get [[Tim McManus]] replaced by an [[African American]] unit manager.

==Season 4 Part I==

Poet, Wangler, and Pierce are transferred back into Em City after Adebisi makes a request to Warden Glynn. Inside they torment a new inmate named [[Guillaume Tarrant]]. Adebisi puts a smuggled gun under Tarrant's bed, and the young man murders Wangler, Pierce, and a C.O., before turning the gun on himself. Poet is very upset that his best friends have died and Adebisi then suggests that Poet join him to take down all the white inmates. Poet remains loyal and as a result, when an [[African American]] named [[Martin Querns]] is hired in Tim McManus' position, things look up for Adebisi and his followers; they may do whatever they wish as long as there is no violence in Em City.

Several transfers are made; mainly white and Latino inmates and guards being traded for blacks. Poet is asked to supervise [[Desmond Mobay]], a [[Jamaica]]n inmate wanting into the drug trade whom Adebisi does not trust. Poet and Supreme Allah are named trustees after the Italian and Latino inmates are transferred out of Em City. Poet becomes disgusted with what has happened in Em City under Adebisi's leadership (He is most disgusted by Adebisi's sexual behavior towards young black inmates) and secretly assists Saïd in taking him down. Homeboy member [[Leroy Tidd]] notices this and warns Adebisi, who decides to lie low until Saïd actually reveals what he is doing. Querns is fired and Adebisi dies when trying to kill Saïd, so Poet has now become the leader of the Homeboys by default.

==Season 4 Part II==

When a news crew comes to Oz, Poet makes statements that convince them that Oz is full of corruption. When inmate Burr Redding arrives, the older man informs Poet that he has been doing "a shit job" and convinces him to hand over leadership of the Homeboys. Unfazed, Poet willingly serves as Redding's lieutenant and sets up an attempted murder on Supreme Allah, who has been expelled from the Homeboys. Poet schedules a visit with [[Tug Daniels]], the brother of Supreme Allah's murder victim, and smuggles a knife made from a sharpened toothbrush into the visiting room. Allah narrowly survives Tug's attack, however; Daniels is sentenced to prison for attempted murder, and [[Warden Leo Glynn]] sends Poet, protesting his innocence, into solitary confinement as punishment for assisting Daniels.

When Daniels arrives at Oz, he assists Poet and Redding in a plan to murder all the Italian and Latino inmates. However, a worried [[Augustus Hill]] tips off the authorities, the S.O.R.T. team is swiftly mobilized and the Homeboys plans are ruined, with Hill then expelled from the Homeboys. When Tug Daniels is later discovered to be conspiring with Supreme Allah against Redding, Poet pays off the guards to allow Redding to stage a [[kangaroo court]] that ends with Daniels' death. Hill approaches Poet with some information pertaining to Supreme Allah's weakness; he is allergic to eggs. In the cafeteria, they mix several eggs into Supreme's food, who then dies swiftly and painfully. Poet then tells Redding about their success, and Redding allows Hill back into the Homeboys.

==Season 5==

Em City is reopened and Poet is among one of the Homeboys let back in. The Italians are taken down in a side battle with the Aryans. Redding calls a truce with [[Enrique Morales]] and the Latinos and agrees to work with them. Poet does not really like the Latinos and calls them [[Spic (slur)|spics]] behind their back. In the meantime, Redding gets control of the kitchen and the Italians removed so the Homeboys are now looking better. A guide dog program for the visually impaired then comes to Oz and Poet states his dislike for dogs being around him.

A depressed Hill asks Poet and the Homeboys for some drugs. Hill accidentally snorts a lethal amount of heroin and goes into septic shock. Angry, Redding searches for the men responsible for drugging Hill and Poet is his first accusation. Poet lies, telling Burr to look at his enemies the Italians and Latinos instead of his friends among the Homeboys. Poet then uses Hill's [[overdose]] as an excuse to kill an Italian inmate as a means of drawing suspicion away from himself. With the help of Latino inmate [[Carmen Guerra]], Poet gets [[Agamemnon Busmalis]], a witness with no vested interest to lie about the Italians overdosing Hill. An Italian inmate named [[Salvatore DeSanto]] is falsely accused, and dies from an overdose of [[LSD]] Redding had put in his food. Hill then tells McManus that DeSanto did not give him the drugs and Poet, afraid for his life gets Busmalis to say the Latinos supplied Hill. The Latinos and Homeboys are no longer allied after the accusation is brought up and as a result, Morales now hates the black inmates.

Meanwhile, Poet is paid by prison dentist [[Dr. Tariq Faraj]] to spread the word about a gum transplant that Aryan Brotherhood inmate [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]] receives. Amused by the fact that the gums are from a black man, Poet and [[Ryan O'Reily]] humiliate Robson in the cafeteria asking him first if he wants any "Chitlins and Gravy" with his lunch, then they announce that he got a pair of "ghetto gums" from the dentist. The Brotherhood is humiliated and kicks Robson out. Desperate to get back in with the Aryans, Robson buys cocaine from Poet, using it to numb the pain as he tries to remove his gums. The cocaine is woefully inadequate as a pain killer.

As Augustus leaves the hospital and Redding is released from the solitary ward, Poet then begs Hill not to inform on him, to which Hill agrees. Hill dies during an attempt on Redding's life made by the Italians and Latinos, who have reformed their alliance.

==Season 6==

The Homeboys begin attacking inmates at random since Redding is too badly injured to lead them. Poet and fellow inmate [[Reggie Rawls]], among others, are constantly robbing inmates and trying to sell drugs to get the gang back under control. Redding then tells them they are going to leave the kitchen and work as [[telemarketer]]s. Poet, Rawls, and Kenaniah Maxwell, among others, are reluctant to do so. On the phones, Poet insults a woman for calling him a "[[List of ethnic slurs|spook]]" over the phone, and Redding fires him when he refuses to get back to work. The rest of the Homeboys follow Poet. Unknown to Poet, Redding requests that the Italians stop any drug transaction the Homeboys attempt to pull. This goes enforced as one of Poet's connections is run over 37 times by the Italians on orders of [[Chucky Pancamo]]. Poet then asks former [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member Jahfree Neema to lead them who refuses, saying the Homeboys give black people a bad name. Desperate for work, they go to [[Zahir Arif]] who is running the prison printing press.

Poet and Rawls offer to help new inmate Stanley Bukowski sell marijuana, but the Italians discover this and kill Bukowski. Redding destroys the book industry and forces the Homeboys to come back and work as telemarketers. As they come back, Poet is forced to beg his way back in as a worker. Poet, however, saves the Homeboys when he develops a plan to steal [[credit card]] numbers and have his cousin sell them on the street and give the homeboys a cut.

At the end of the series he is last shown evacuating Oswald with the rest of the prison population. His survival establishes himself as the last of the original members of the Homeboys and one of the few inmates who survived the entire series run and had been in Oz prior to the beginning of the series.

==Career==
From 1981 until 1984, she worked as the [[Company secretary|Company Secretary]] of the ''Uganda Mining Corporation'', a government [[parastatal|parastatal company]]. From 1986 until 1996, she served in the Ugandan Parliament as a Member of Parliament. In 1988, she was appointed [[Northern Region, Uganda|State Minister for Northern Uganda]], which required her to take up residence in [[Gulu]], the largest city in the Uganda's Northern Region. She was tasked with convincing the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) guerilla rebels to lay down their arms, following the failure of military efforts to defeat the rebels. Bigombe initiated contact with the LRA leader [[Joseph Kony]] in June 1993. In 1993, she was named Uganda's Woman of the Year for her efforts to end the violence. Despite meeting with Kony, the talks collapsed in February 1994.&lt;ref name="O’Kadameri"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2 March 2015|

Following a ten-year stint in the Uganda Parliament from 1986 until 1996, she failed to win the parliamentary seat for [[Gulu|Gulu Municipality]] in 1996 and left government service. In 2011, fifteen years later, she bounced back by winning the parliamentary seat of Amuru District Women's Constituency, on the [[National Resistance Movement]] party ticket.&lt;ref name="AMRU"/&gt;

In 1997, following her graduation from Harvard, she took up employment with the [[World Bank]] in Washington, DC, as a Senior Social Scientist with the Post-Conflict Unit. Later, she served as a Consultant to the Bank's Social Protection and Human Development Unit. In 1999 and 2000, Bigombe provided technical support to the [[Carter Center]] in a successful mediation effort between the governments of Uganda and [[Sudan]].

Following the February 2004 [[Barlonyo|Barlonyo massacre]], Bigombe took a leave of absence from the World Bank and flew to Uganda to attempt to restart the peace process. From March 2004 to 2005, Bigombe was the chief mediator in a new peace initiative with the Lord's Resistance Army, personally financing much of the logistics of bringing Ugandan government ministers and rebel leaders together. The last meeting on 20 April 2005, fell through. However, the failure of the Bigombe mediation is seen as laying the groundwork for the [[2006–2007 Juba talks]], which were mediated by the government of [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Woman"/&gt; Those talks collapsed at the last minute when Joseph Kony refused to sign the peace agreement.&lt;ref name="Peace"&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa's Peace Seekers: Betty Bigombe|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0913/p01s04-woaf.html|accessdate=2 March 2015|first=Abraham|last=McLaughlin|

In 2007, she received the Peacemakers in Action Award from the [https://www.tanenbaum.org/ Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding].

She was appointed the chairman of the National Information and Technology Authority in Uganda (NITAU) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/692891|title=Bigombe To Head IT Authority|accessdate=2 March 2015|date=30 August 2009|first=Davis|last=Weddi|newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123114/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/692891|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, she was appointed by [[Yoweri Museveni|President Yoweri Museveni]] as State Minister for Water Resources, a position that she held until June 2014, when she resigned to take up her current assignment at the World Bank.&lt;ref name="Resigns"/&gt;

'''Charles Gunn''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Joss Whedon]] for the [[television series]], ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' and introduced by writer Gary Campbell in the episode "[[War Zone (Angel)|War Zone]]".  The character is portrayed by [[J. August Richards]], and was named by Whedon after filmmaker [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] and actor [[Sean Gunn]], both of whom had worked with Whedon.  Gunn is introduced as the leader of a street gang which protects its neighborhood from vampires.

==Biography==

===Character history===
Gunn was born in the Badlands, a section of inner-city [[Los Angeles]] where the police would not go, and looked after his sister, Alonna, from a very young age.  Although he had a few brushes with the law, he acted as a modern day [[Robin Hood]] to keep the streets in his neighborhood safe.  In his teens (although now Gunn is in his early 20s), Gunn rose through the ranks to become the leader of a group of street-fighters who protect their turf from [[vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]] using [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics.  Possessing the mind of a military strategist and the strength of a  brawler, life in the city hardened Gunn to the extent that his life became less important than the cause, resulting in him trading his soul for a truck in a deal with a demon named Jenoff when he was only seventeen, because he believed he had no future (cf. "[[Double or Nothing (Angel)|Double or Nothing]]").

===Angel Investigations===
Gunn is introduced in the Season One episode "[[War Zone (Angel)|War Zone]]", when he observes the [[vampire]] [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] roughing up a [[blackmail]]er and tries, unsuccessfully, to dust him. Later on, a gang of vampires, who are at war with Gunn's group, attack their hideout, [[kidnap]]ping several group members in the process, including Gunn's sister Alonna. Eventually, Angel wins Gunn's trust, but unfortunately not in time to save Alonna from being turned into a vampire.  Gunn has no choice but to stake his own sister, a decision which continues to haunt him through the series.  It is this loss that forces Gunn to question his own motives and become more receptive to Angel's help, realizing he cannot do everything alone. Angel recognizes Gunn's strength and often calls on him if he needs back up in battle or if he needs protection for the people he cares about when he cannot protect them himself.  Although he initially regards his time with [[Angel Investigations]] as a "paying side-gig," Gunn eventually becomes a full-time member of the gang, gaining mutual respect for those he fights side-by-side with while finding his place in the world.  However, his work with his new 'family' often leads to conflicted loyalties; in the episode "[[Belonging (Angel)|Belonging]]",  [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] is accidentally sucked into a portal to [[Pylea]] while a member of Gunn's old street crew, George, succumbs to the bite of a vampire.  Gunn feels responsible for his friend's death, believing that it would not have happened if he had still been around to help in the fight.  Yet even in his grief, he realizes that he could not commit the same crime twice and allow Cordelia to suffer the same fate, so he joins Angel, [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]], and Lorne to rescue her.

A short time after their return from Pylea, demons across the city are being [[wikt:massacre|massacre]]d - regardless of whether or not they actually did anything to deserve being killed in the first place - and Gunn comes to the conclusion that his old gang is responsible for the deaths, currently being led by a man named Gio, who has a serious grudge against supernatural entities due to an unrevealed event in his past (cf. "[[That Old Gang of Mine (Angel)|That Old Gang of Mine]]").  He realizes that his ties with his old life are gone and that his loyalty now lies with the vampire with a soul.  In a showdown with one of his lifelong friends, Gunn finally chooses the mission of the Angel Investigations team.  Without realizing it, Gunn finds the future he thought he would never have.  He has friends, loyalty, respect, and a mission to pursue.  He even finds love in the arms of the new girl [[Winifred Burkle|Fred Burkle]], but his past still comes back to haunt him in the episode "[[Double or Nothing (Angel)|Double or Nothing]]," when the demon Jenoff decides it is time to cash in on a deal made years earlier by claiming Gunn's soul.  The Angel Investigations are able to defeat Jenoff.

Fred becomes the most important person in Gunn's world, and in "[[Supersymmetry (Angel)|Supersymmetry]]", he kills Professor Seidel (who deliberately sent Fred to Pylea) in order to save Fred from having to carry the burden of doing it herself.  The guilt of what he had done for her plagues Fred and instead of bringing them closer together, it begins the rift that leads to the end of their relationship.  Although no longer romantically linked, Gunn and Fred continue to fight side-by-side, and Gunn has a [[Casual relationship|fling]] with the [[electric]] [[Gwen Raiden]] in the episode "[[Players (Angel)|Players]]".  When [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]] want to cut a deal to have Angel take over the L.A. branch, Gunn is led into the mysterious [[Wolfram and Hart#White Room|White Room]] where he is exposed to the mysterious conduit to the [[Senior Partners]], who impresses Gunn with his immense power.  Soon, he undergoes a remarkable transformation at [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]].

===Wolfram &amp; Hart===
Feeling undervalued by his friends, Gunn submits to a procedure at the hands of [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]'s Medical Department that enhances his mind with a comprehensive understanding of the law (and [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]], to help improve his voice and diction), making him the only member of Angel's team who can work inside the system seamlessly (cf. "[[Conviction (Angel)|Conviction]]").  When his mental abilities begin to diminish, Gunn, fearful of losing his new talents and respect, makes a pact with Dr. Sparrow and gets a permanent upgrade in exchange for signing to release an ancient curio stuck in customs.  When this curio results in the death of Fred and the resurrection of Illyria (cf. "[[A Hole in the World]]"), a guilt-ridden Gunn willingly offers himself to take [[Lindsey McDonald]]'s place in a hell dimension in order to get information on how to stop the Senior Partners (cf. "[[Underneath (Angel)|Underneath]]").  While the team have no clue how to free him, Illyria saves Gunn with ease.  He then returns to the fold, changed and seeking redemption for his sins.  In the show's finale "[[Not Fade Away (Angel)|Not Fade Away]]", he spends his potential-last day alive helping Anne Steele out at her youth help center, and then slays [[Helen Brucker|Senator Helen Brucker]], one of the members of the [[Circle of the Black Thorn]], but is seriously injured in the process.  While preparing for one last fight against the army of the Senior Partners, Illyria states that he has only minutes to live with Gunn quoting, "Then let's make them memorable."  Joss Whedon later discussed the final battle in SFX Magazine: "Gunn is dead.  Illyria keeps fighting.  Angel loses an arm.  [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] gets Shanshu.  And [[Xander Harris|Xander]] loses another eye, which is funny, because he isn't even there."

[[J. August Richards]] later revealed in an interview that Gunn was intended to have become a vampire either in ''Angel'' season six or the proposed ''Spike'' spin-off movie had either project gone ahead: "I’d probably have him come back as a vampire and then kill himself," "That’s always how I wanted it to end for my character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffy-boards.com/showthread.php?t=25124|title=Amy Acker Says Angel Spinoffs Won't Happen - Buffy-Boards|work=Buffy-Boards|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Fall===
In issue one of the ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' comic series (which is the canonical continuation of the ''Angel'' series), Gunn and a group he has assumed leadership of storm a stadium and kill Kr'ph, one of the demon lords of L.A., who has taken up residence there.  The group frees humans, who were forced to fight each other by the demon. Gunn then makes a suggestive comment to the demon's female captives. At the end of the issue, Gunn is revealed to be a vampire, having been turned either during or after Team Angel's battle with the Senior Partners' army at the end of "Not Fade Away", who feeds on the women and turns the "rescued" men into vampires as part of "Team Gunn".

However, in the second issue, Gunn insists that he is still a good guy. He resents being a vampire, though he is prone to murderous impulses due to his lack of a soul.  He reveals that he blames Angel for his condition, believing he had allowed him to be turned, and that he intends to save L.A. to prove that one doesn't need a soul to be a champion. As part of his plans, he kidnaps the psychic fish Betta George and imprisons him, forcing George to tap into his psychic ability to freeze Slayers in their tracks and contact people outside of Hell/Los Angeles.

In a later issue, he is seen making mystical plans; the intent is to have Angel come to the conclusion he sent Gunn to die, then Angel himself will die moments later.  As part of his revenge against Angel, Gunn destroys the Wolfram &amp; Hart building, Angel's headquarters in the war with the Demon Lords, which also forces Wesley back to the Senior Partners for a short time. Gunn later bears witness to Angel's defeat of the Lords, hanging back to ensure that not all of the people are slaughtered should Angel fail. Shortly after the team moves back into the Hyperion Hotel, Gunn confronts them and reveals his vampire nature.

Upon seeing what has become of Gunn, Angel tells him he is sorry.  Gunn says he figured he would say that, and tells him to table that for now.  Gunn takes Angel around his base of operations, explains what happened to him.  When Angel sees that Gunn thinks he is doing the right thing, Angel cautions him that the beast is the one in control, not him.  Gunn attacks him, angered that Angel thinks that Gunn isn't himself.  Gunn proceeds to remove all of the magic that had kept Angel alive, and realizes that Angel was actually now a human.  Gunn decides to let Angel lie there and die slowly, only to be confronted by Wesley's "ghost", who reveals to him that the visions he has been receiving are from the Senior Partners rather than the Powers That Be. Ignoring this revelation, Gunn continues to attack his former friends, his team of Slayers apparently staking Spike- although Spike is later seen alive thanks to Illyria's timeslips- before he is kicked out of a window by Connor while trying to kill Angel again. Confronting Illyria, he tricks her into transforming into Fred so that he can shoot her, reverting her to her true form in the hope that he can convince her to use her powers to rewind time so that the Fall never occurs, only for Illyria to vow to unmake time itself. Realizing that the Senior Partners cannot allow him to die, Angel provokes Gunn into killing him, thus forcing the Senior Partners to reverse time to the original battle in the alleyway, giving Angel the opportunity to save Gunn before he is sired, the group subsequently taking Gunn to the hospital, where he falls into a [[coma]]. In ''Aftermath'' #18 Gunn is shown driving a sports car. Gunn seems to be recovering from his wound well, but was stated not to be ready to rejoin the team yet.  In ''Aftermath'' #23 Gunn is spotlighted. It is explained how he was cured so quickly from the attacks at the end of the series and he and Illyria come to a mutual agreement and strike a [[friendship]] of sorts. In the end Illyria and Gunn take off to find adventure, slay demons, and find a new direction in their lives.

Gunn eventually returns to [[Angel Investigations]], though he nonetheless faces multiple difficulties upon his return, as Spike and Connor still regard him as a traitor due to his actions in Hell and are distrustful of him. When Connor takes over the leadership of Angel Investigations after Angel is captured by Innovation Labs, a [[biotechnology|biotech]] company seeking to duplicate Angel's status as an immortal with a soul, Gunn, while still loyal to Angel's mission, left the team due to escalating disagreements and arguments with Connor. Gunn departs with the intent of starting his own crew and fighting the good fight his way, though he nonetheless intends to return when Angel is found.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, his attempts to start anew are briefly halted when he is attacked by Eddie Hope, an ice-manipulating devil who has been hunting down people for crimes they committed while Los Angeles was in Hell, while at a diner.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the [[Angel &amp; Faith]] series Gunn reconvenes with Angel, Faith and Willow after they come to LA from London in the Family Reunion arc. Gunn has been sending reports to Angel on Connor's normal life as well as updating him on the status of his other friends from LA. Gunn stays in the Hyperion Hotel to protect the tear in reality when the other four enter Qour'toth. He appears pleased at the positive place Angel and Connor's relationship has finally reached.

==Powers and abilities==
In the television series, Gunn is a normal human with no supernatural abilities, but he has strength and [[martial arts]] expertise due to his years as a vampire hunter, often being described as "the muscle" of Angel Investigations. Episodes such as "[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]" and "[[Reunion (Angel)|Reunion]]" have proven that Gunn is also a talented and intelligent investigator. In Season Five, he is given a "legal upgrade" by [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]'s which gives him knowledge of all legal codes, both human and demon, as well as fluency in some demonic languages, knowledge of [[golf]] techniques and all [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] light operas. In the canonical comic book ''Angel: After the Fall'', Gunn is depicted as having become a vampire, acquiring superhuman strength, speed, reflexes durability, virtual immortality, accelerated healing, vulnerability to holy items and sunlight and the necessity to feed on blood to maintain vitality. He claims that his "inner demon" is partially subdued by his earlier Wolfram &amp; Hart upgrade. By devouring a [[prophecy|prophetic]] demon, Gunn also acquired its power to receive visions, which he believes come from the [[The Powers That Be (Angel)|Powers]] but in fact come from the [[Senior Partners]]. At the end of the series, time is reversed and Gunn is an ordinary human again.

Gunn is a fan of pop culture and often displays a detailed knowledge regarding [[comic books]]:
*In the episode "[[Supersymmetry (Angel)|Supersymmetry]]", Gunn threatens a college student in a school book store by referencing the specific issue of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' (#181) in which [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] kills [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], even quoting from the cover blurb which reads "...One wins, one dies."
*When commenting on how fast [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]] appears to move when using her time-warping abilities, Gunn compares her to three different incarnations of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]: [[Jay Garrick]], [[Wally West]], and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The reference elicits little response from his confused friends, so he merely says that it was "like she was movin' really fast".
*Despite Gunn's knowledge of comic books, in the episode, [[First Impressions (Angel)|First Impressions]], he claims that, "I haven't bothered to see a movie since Denzel was robbed of the Oscar," referring to [[Denzel Washington]]'s [[Malcolm X (1992 film)|portrayal]] of [[Malcolm X]].

==Appearance==
Following his mental upgrade, Gunn sheds his street look for the sleek, professional suits of a legal powerhouse.  He also lets his hair grow slightly, having had it shaved in all previous seasons, which comes as a surprise to Cordelia in the episode "[[You're Welcome (Angel)|You're Welcome]]".  In the final episodes, Gunn comes full circle, returning to his roots, taking back his street clothes, and reawakening his purpose as a soldier in the fight against evil.

==Relationships==

===Romantic interests===
* '''Veronica''' — Gunn had a romance with this girl prior to becoming a full-time member of [[Angel Investigations]].  She appears briefly in the "[[First Impressions (Angel)|First Impressions]]", in which her non-fatal injury at the hands of a vampire brings back painful memories and feelings of guilt about Alonna.
* '''[[Winifred Burkle|Winifred "Fred" Burkle]]''' — Gunn and Fred fall in love and continue a strong relationship throughout much of Seasons Three and Four, which was ruptured when Gunn murdered a human being in order to protect Fred's innocence.  Nevertheless, he retains strong feelings of friendship for her and is devastated by her death, for which he is partially responsible.  Unlike the other characters, who usually referred to Gunn by his surname, Fred always called him Charles and continued to do so following their break-up.
* '''[[Gwen Raiden]]''' flirts with Gunn in her first two appearances, and they have sex in the episode "[[Players (Angel)|Players]]" when, with Gunn's assistance, Gwen gains the ability to touch people without harming them.

===Friendships===
* '''[[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]''' — During Angel's temporary absence from the group in Season Two, Gunn and Wesley develop a brothers-in-arms bond.  This friendship continues to develop, but is strained by romantic rivalry over Fred (cf. "[[Waiting in the Wings (Angel)|Waiting in the Wings]]").  The friendship between Gunn and Wesley deteriorates further after Wesley misguidedly attempts to kidnap Angel's son [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] and is accordingly fired from the agency.  However, in Season Four, Wesley is gradually reintroduced to the AI team and the pair are friends again by Season Five.  The Beast's attack on Los Angeles requires Wes and AI to join forces, and Wes saves Gunn's life in their first confrontation with the creature.  Unfortunately, this friendship is again put under stress when the creation of Illyria (for which Gunn is indirectly responsible) causes Fred's death; Wesley stabs Gunn with a scalpel. The pair eventually do reconcile.
* '''[[Cordelia Chase]]''' advocated bringing Gunn into "Team Angel", and pushes for him to start getting paid as well as making sure the team begins to see him as an equal.  Gunn began quickly to respect her and not just think of her as a "[[Barbie doll]]" as he did in the beginning. Over the years a solid friendship was formed.

==Appearances==

===Canonical appearances===

The '''head gardener''' (also known as a [[curator]]) or as a [[Master Gardener]]  is an individual who manages [[gardener|the staff]] of a large [[garden]], [[landscape]] or park, such as a [[residential garden]], [[botanical garden]], [[theme park]], [[public park]], [[museum]] or roadside embankments and islands.

A head gardener's responsibility may therefore cross over into the managing of or communicating with individuals from other disciplines, such as [[landscaping]], [[construction]] and [[cooking]] and not be limited to [[gardening]], the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. A [[great house|large or stately property]] may include several different types of garden, such as the [[formal garden]] (also [[English garden]]), [[lawn]]s, [[white garden]], [[Japanese garden]], miniature or [[bonsai]] garden, [[tropical garden]], cold climate garden, [[rockery]], [[fernery]], [[water garden]], [[herb garden]], [[orchard]], and the management of related buildings and setups such as  [[greenhouse]]s (hothouses, glasshouses and [[shadehouse]]s), water features and [[aquarium|aquaria]].

A head gardener may also be the directing gardener on a lifestyle [[television]] show; compare [[celebrity gardener]].

'''''I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie''''' is a 1987 memoir by former [[groupie]] [[Pamela Des Barres]].

==Overview==
The book tells the story of Pamela Ann Miller, a groupie who gets a kind of fame in the 1960s by having wild nights with musicians and actors. Pictures of famous musicians and actors accompany the many stories of her time in Los Angeles, California during the late 1960s and early 1970s. She recounts tales of moments shared with girlfriends [[The GTOs]] which they use as a way to outwardly express themselves. She becomes [[Frank Zappa]]'s nanny as well as has relationships with [[Jimmy Page]] and with [[Don Johnson]]. 

Her escapades include travels to England where she spends time with [[Mick Jagger]] and others. She also travels to Europe before coming back home. She later falls in love with [[Michael Des Barres]], an English glam rocker. She ends the books with the story of their wedding and the birth of her son Nicholas Dean Des Barres.

==Publishing history==
The book was described by Kirkus Reviews as "a classic account of rampant [[narcissism]] among guitar egomaniacs", and enjoyed considerable success, being issued as an audio book in CD in 1995, then reissued as a paperback in 2005, with an Amazon Kindle edition the same year.

'''Israel Vibration''' are a [[reggae]] harmony group, originating from [[Kingston, Jamaica]].  Lascelle "Wiss" Bulgin, Albert "Apple Gabriel" Craig, and Cecil "Skelly" Spence all overcame childhood [[polio]], and went on to be one of the most successful roots groups to form in [[Jamaica]] in the 1970s. The trio initially met as children at a rehabilitation center.  

==History==
Bulgin (born 1955), Craig, and Spence (born 1952) first met as children at the Mona Rehabilitation Clinic, all sufferers of polio in the epidemic that spread through Jamaica in the 1950s, but it was several years later that they formed Israel Vibration.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae &amp; Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, p. 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Joe (1991) "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1048499.html Reggae Culture Has Vibrations]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 8 February 1991, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Block, Melissa &amp; Siegel, Robert (2004) "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103235913.html Interview: Gary Himmelfarb discusses a reggae adaptation of some of Bob Dylan's songs]", [[NPR]], 27 August 2004, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig attended the [[Alpha Boys School]] but ran away at the age of fourteen, living on the streets.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Spence was a member of the band Hot Lickers, appearing on Jamaican television with the group at the age of twelve.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He also played in the Jamaican [[wheelchair basketball]] team, but was forced out in 1969 after adopting the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] faith, something which the three had in common when they were later reunited.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; 

Spence and Craig got together in Kingston and sought out Bulgin, who at the time was working as a tailor.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; They formed a vocal group, initially adopting the name Israel Vibration Israel Vibrates, soon becoming simply Israel Vibration.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; They survived on money earned singing in the streets for several years, and in 1975 attempted to launch a recording career at [[Channel One Studios]], but the track they recorded there ("Bad Intention") was not released.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Funding for their first album came in the form of a grant from the [[Mansions of Rastafari#Twelve Tribes of Israel|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] branch of Rastafarai after Hugh Booth, a member of the Twelve Tribes, had overheard the three men singing in a wooded area outside Kingston. Apple and Wiss were living in the area, which they had converted into a home. Recorded at the [[Treasure Isle]] studio in 1976, their debut release was the single "Why Worry", released on the Twelve Tribes label late that year.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrow"&gt;Barrow, Steve &amp; Dalton, Peter (2004) ''The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-329-4}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The single was successful enough for the group to be offered support slots at shows by artists such as [[Dennis Brown]], [[Inner Circle (band)|Inner Circle]], and [[Bob Marley]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

They then began working with producer [[Tommy Cowan]], releasing "The Same Song" (on which they were backed by members of Inner Circle) on his Top Ranking label in 1977, and an album of the same name followed in 1978.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrow2"&gt;Barrow, Steve &amp; Dalton, Peter (1999) ''Reggae – 100 Essential CDs: The Rough Guide'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-85828-567-4}}, p. 83-4&lt;/ref&gt; The album, and its [[Dub music|dub]] counterpart, ''Israel Tafari'' (aka ''Same Song Dub'') were a success internationally, leading to a deal with [[EMI]] label [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] to reissue the album in the UK, the label also releasing a second album, ''Unconquered People'' in 1980.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

For their third album, ''Why You So Craven'' (the title track aimed at their former producer Cowan), they worked with [[Henry "Junjo" Lawes]] but disagreements meant that they left the album unfinished, with Lawes getting [[The Tamlins]] to complete it.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

The group relocated to New York in 1982 to seek professional health care, and escape the growing [[dancehall]] movement in Jamaica, but struggled to break through there and they split up.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Mark R. (1999) "ISRAEL VIBRATION "Pay the Piper" RAS Records", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 19 March 1999, p. N7&lt;/ref&gt; They each attempted to launch solo careers, with Bulgin releasing the ''Mr Sunshine'' album in 1985, but by 1987 they decided to relaunch Israel Vibration.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Having all been turned down when they approached Gary "Dr. Dread" Himmelfarb, founder of [[RAS Records]], during their solo period, they received a positive response when they approached him as a group.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; They were flown to Washington, D.C. to record a new album at the Lion and Fox Recording Studios in [[College Park, Maryland]], backed by the [[Roots Radics]]. ''Strength of my Life'' was the group's fourth album.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; The band stayed with RAS into the 21st century, releasing more than a dozen albums for the label.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;  

In 1997, Apple Gabriel left the group to pursue a solo career, releasing the album ''Another Moses'' in 1999.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lien"&gt;Lien, James (1999) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=9GreOBSSF_QC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22israel+vibration%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mGJwIV90qs&amp;sig=_cLBZRJLhdKU-OSLzSJVqRCno9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VYxVUL6rCsOr0QX-qIFw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22israel%20vibration%22&amp;f=false Apple Gabriel ''Another Moses'']", ''CMJ New Music Report'', 3 May 1999, p. 35, retrieved 16 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Skelly and Wiss continue to record albums and tour the world as Israel Vibration, backed by longtime associates Roots Radics.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;Joyce, Mike (2003) "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-272132.html ISRAEL VIBRATION "Fighting ...]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 May 2003, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinn"&gt;Brinn, David (2008) "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-151470905.html Reggae legends make Israel a Pessah destination]", ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 14 April 2008, retrieved 16 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 they were reportedly recording a new album set for release in early 2015.

}}'''James H. Burton''' (August 17, 1823 – October 18, 1894) was born in Shenandoah Spring, [[Virginia]]. Educated at the [[Westchester Academy (Pennsylvania)|Westchester Academy]] in [[Pennsylvania]], Burton entered a [[Baltimore]] machine shop at age 16. In April 1844, he went to work at the [[Harpers Ferry]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]], serving as a machinist. He subsequently served as Foreman of the Rifle Factory Machine Shop, where he gained a considerable amount of knowledge and respect for the work of [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John H. Hall]]. Hall pioneered mechanized arms production and interchangeable manufacture at Harpers Ferry between 1820-1840. According to Burton, Hall's Rifle Works housed "not an occasional machine, but a plant of milling machinery by which the system and economy of the manufacture was materially altered." During the next three decades, Burton followed Hall's example by furthering the mechanization of arms production.

==The Minié Bullet==
In 1849, Burton was promoted to Acting Master Armorer. During the next four years, Burton experimented with improved designs for the [[Minié ball|Minié bullet]] at Harpers Ferry. The Minié bullet, introduced in 1848 by Captain [[Claude-Étienne Minié]] of the [[French Army]], was a conical slug of lead slightly more than half an inch in diameter and about an inch long, with a hollow base which expanded when the rifle was fired. This prevented leakage of the powder gases, and served to expand the base of the bullet outward into the riflings of the gun barrel. Its effective range was from 200 to 250 yards – a significant improvement over previous bullets.

Burton carefully documented his work in a set a detailed drawings. These drawings show that he was experimenting with several different Minié bullet designs. According to Colonel [[Benjamin Huger (general)|Benjamin Huger]] of the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Department]], Burton was studying the "tige" and Minié principles (the "tige" bullet had a steel stem designed to expand the bullet into the weapon's rifling). Burton designed a barrel which used a hard metal plug to expand the bullet into the rifling, and developed a hollow-base bullet design that worked even better. In 1855, Burton's modified design for the Minié bullet was adopted by the [[United States Army]].

==James Burton at the Enfield Armory==
In 1854, Burton left Harpers Ferry to take a job with the Ames Manufacturing Company of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]], which supplied both federal armories with precision machinery for the manufacture of firearms. Just one year later, in June 1855, Burton accepted a five-year contract as Chief Engineer of the [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Royal Small Arms Manufactory]] in [[Enfield Lock]], [[England]]. Here, Burton was responsible for setting up new production machinery purchased in the United States, much of it from Ames.

Burton returned briefly to Harpers Ferry in June 1859 to marry Eugenia Harper Mauzy. The wedding took place in the Harpers Ferry [[Presbyterian Church]] on Shenandoah Street in the Lower Town. Just four months later, after their return to England, James and Eugenia Burton learned the startling news of John Brown's Raid in a series of emotional letters from Eugenia's parents, George and Mary Mauzy.

==James Burton at the Richmond Armory==
The sectional divisiveness brought about by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown's]] Raid soon affected the life of James H. Burton. On January 21, 1860, the Virginia assembly passed a bill "For the better defence [sic] of the State." The old [[Virginia Manufactory of Arms]] – renamed the [[Richmond Armory]] in 1861 – was reactivated after being shut down for 38 years. When J.R. Anderson &amp; Company was awarded a large contract to supply machinery for the reactivated manufactory, the firm engaged Burton to engineer the Richmond Armory contract in November 1860. On December 4, Burton returned to Harpers Ferry to obtain model [[rifled musket]] patterns and components for his new employer, returning to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] with a large portfolio of drawings.

In June 1861, Burton was appointed superintendent of the Richmond Armory, where his complete familiarity with the machinery for manufacturing [[United States]] firearms proved indispensable to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. In fact, much of the machinery at Richmond had been confiscated from the Harpers Ferry Armory by Confederate forces in June 1861 under Burton's own direction.

Burton was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel in the [[Confederate States Army]] in December 1861, and placed in charge of all Southern armories. In June 1862, Burton left Richmond for [[Macon, Georgia]], where he established a new armory for the Confederacy. One year later Burton traveled to England to "purchase and contract for the machinery, tools and material required for the new Armory." Burton returned to Macon in October 1863, where he awaited delivery of several shipments of machinery from the firm [[Greenwood &amp; Batley]] of [[Leeds]], England. The machinery and tools were finally shipped to [[Bermuda]] in late 1864, where they awaited reshipment to run the Union naval blockade. But then the Civil War ended.

Burton was taken prisoner along with the Confederate garrison at Macon in April 1865. He subsequently signed the "Oath of Allegiance to the United States" and on October 4, 1865, was granted a Presidential pardon by [[Andrew Johnson]].

==After the Civil War==
After the war, Burton returned to England to superintend a new armory for Greenwood &amp; Batley. Returning to the United States in 1868, Burton took up residence in [[Leesburg, Virginia]]. He returned to Leeds, England in 1871 to engineer a firearms contract for the [[Russia]]n Government. But ill health intervened, and in 1873 he returned to Virginia for good and took up farming near [[Winchester, Virginia]]. Here, James H. Burton died on October 18, 1894, far removed from the weapons technology he had been so instrumental in developing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11500">'''Jean Skipwith, Lady Skipwith''' (February 21, 1747 or 1748 - May 19, 1826) was a Virginia plantation owner and manager who is noted for her extensive garden, botanical manuscript notes, and library. At the time of her death, her library was perhaps the largest existing library assembled by a woman.

==Early life==
Born Jane Miller, February 21, 1747 or 1748, in Prince George County, Virginia, youngest of four children of Hugh and Jane (Bolling) Miller, tobacco grower, merchant, and vestryman of Old Blandford Church of Bristol Parish, Petersburg, VA.;&lt;ref&gt;The Vestry Book and Register of Bristol Parish, VA, 1720 - 1789 (transcribed and privately published by Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne 1898), [https://archive.org/stream/vestrybookandre01chamgoog#page/n6/mode/2up].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;Ann Leighton, American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century, "for Use and for Delight", 262-283 (Univ. Mass. Amherst 1986), available on google books, a source which provides a biography, and reproduces many of Lady Skipwith's plant lists.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Miller returned to Scotland with his family before December 8, 1760.&lt;ref&gt;in The Vestry Book and Register of Bristol Parish, VA, 1720 - 1789 (transcribed and privately published by Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne 1898), [https://archive.org/stream/vestrybookandre01chamgoog#page/n6/mode/2up].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap"&gt;Skipwith Family Papers, 1760 - 1977,Swem Library, Special Collections Database, College William &amp; Mary, [http://scdb.swem.wm.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=7098&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=73661#id73661].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and marriage==
Jean's older sister, Anne, had married Sir Peyton Skipwith, 7th Baronet, in 1765. Anne died in childbirth in 1779.&lt;ref name="Leighton" /&gt;

While it is unclear where or with whom Jean Miller was living in Scotland between 1760 and 1786, the Skipwith Family Papers show bills and receipts for Miller's book purchases in Edinburgh in 1781, and Miller was back in Virginia by 1786. On September 7, 1788, Sir Peyton wrote to Jean Miller (then living at Sir Peyton's Elm Hill Plantation), expressing his wish "to complete a union on which my future happiness so much and so immediately depends."  He requested her permission to tell his daughter that, on a journey to Cototoman, he would be accompanied by "Lady Skipwith and not Miss Miller . . . by their [new] mother and not their aunt." They were married on September 25, 1788 in Granville, North Carolina, and by April 1789, Lady Skipwith was corresponding with [[Samuel Goode]] regarding hop roots.  Lady Skipwith's first daughter, Helen, was born June 25, 1789 at Elm Hill Plantation.&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap"/&gt;

In January, 1788, letters to Sir Peyton began to be addressed to him at his new house, [[Prestwould|Prestwould Plantation]], in Mecklenberg County, named for [[Prestwold Hall]], the country home of the Skipwith family.  Originally, the plantation had been acquired by [[William Byrd II]] and named "Blue Stone Castle." On November 6, 1765, Sir Peyton paid [[William Byrd III]] 200 pounds for the plot of Blue Stone Castle land that would become Prestwould (deeded Oct. 30, 1765).&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Elliott. "Sir Peyton Skipwith and the Byrd Land." The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 80, no. 1, (Va. Hist. Soc. 1972), pp. 52–59. [www.jstor.org/stable/4247695].&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Prestwould in 1797, a Georgian-style house sitting above the [[Roanoke River]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hudson, Exec. Dir. Prestwould Foundation, "Prestwould:  Gracious Living on the American Frontier, 1790-1830 (lecture, Va. Hist. Soc. 2009)[http://www.vahistorical.org/read-watch-listen/video-and-audio/prestwould-gracious-living-american-frontier-1790-1830].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter Pinody, et. al., Prestwould Plantation - 1797, Historic Home Plans, [http://www.historichomeplans.net/Product_pages/CO010_Prestwould_Plantation_Colonialhomeplan.htm?hash=item20ad3bc6a9&amp;_trksid=p4634.c0.m14.l1262?refid=store (plans, elevations, and history)].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Prestwould|Prestwould Plantation]], its outbuildings, and its grounds are now a National Historic Landmark and are open to the public, including what may be the earliest known slave house in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Stamford"&gt;Pamela A. Stamford, "[http://research.history.org/DigitalLibrary/view/index.cfm?doc=ResearchReports%5CRR0393.xml Archaeological Investigiations] of the Prestwould Slave Quarter, Mecklenburg County, Virginia (44MC534), Williamsburg Foundation Library Research Report Series - 0393 (Williamsburg, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a working tobacco plantation with farm and livestock, a mill, blacksmith shop, store, ferry, and where thoroughbred horses were raised.&lt;ref name="Stamford"/&gt; The plantation's records reflect many skilled laborers, as well as meticulous bills of sale for slaves.&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aahistoricsitesva.org/items/show/349?tour=7&amp;index=22 Prestwould Plantation, African American Historic Sites Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of Sir Peyton Skipwith's death in 1805, the Skipwiths owned over 200 slaves.&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt;  

Prestwould's extensive archives are held by The [[College of William and Mary|College of William &amp; Mary]], [[Earl Gregg Swem Library]] Special Collections. These include plans for the house and gardens.&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt;

==Garden==
It was at Prestwould Plantation that Lady Skipwith had her garden built by enslaved laborers overseen by Samuel Dedman.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Cornett, Thomas Jefferson Center for Historic Plants, "In the Company of Gardeners:  The Flower Diaries of Jefferson, Skipwith, and Faris" (Monticello, Jan. 2000),[https://www.monticello.org/site/house-and-gardens/company-gardeners-flower-diaries-jefferson-skipwith-and-faris].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt;  A receipt signed by Samuel Dedman on April 24, 1801 states that Dedman had received "Twenty two dollars in part for my services in building [the] Garden."&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt; Dedman must have worked closely with Lady Skipwith to carry out her design, for two sketches in Lady Skipwith's hand map out several garden plots. Her sketches feature highly-organized garden plots crisscrossed by "boardwalks," some wide enough for wheelbarrows, pony carts, or couples taking exercise to pass through.&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt; The plans also indicate where Lady Skipwith intended to plant verbena, strawberry, crocus, phlox, violets, pansies, and portulaca, as well as annuals and shrubbery.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Martin, The Pleasure Gardens of Virginia:  From Jamestown to Jefferson, 126-130 (Univ. Press of Virg. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The archives include records of Lady Skipwith's orders for vegetables, roots and bulbs, which she grew in raised beds. She ordered from [[William Robert Prince|Prince Nurseries on Long Island]], as did [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].  

Lady Skipwith often corresponded with neighbors, requesting cuttings of plants she could then add to her own collections, or offering gardening advice of her own. "Plumb Stones," for instance, were acquired from "General Parsons." Her extensive botanical notes also describe where each kind of plant was grown at Prestwould, what the ideal conditions for its growth were, and how it should be cared for. She listed the many wildflowers she collected, including trillium and viola, identifying them from [[The Gardeners Dictionary|Philip Miller's Gardener's Dictionary]]—and noting when they were not in that source. For instance, she recorded that "The Sealy Pink coloured root from the Point of the Island" was of the "9th Sort -- Miller." She kept records of her fruit crops, notes on how to raise trees from cuttings, and lists of what she planted. "Wintering plants," including "Oranges, Lemons, and Limes" were grown in a glass-walled orangery abutting the garden. Lady Skipwith's botanical notes often connected a plant with its use. Of a particular kind of apple, the "Maryland Red Steeck," Lady Skipwith noted that it "Makes a fine strong Cyder and keeps through the winter better than almost any other apples."&lt;ref name="SkipFamPap" /&gt; 

Lady Skipwith was a keeper of lists.  She listed "Shrubs to be got when I can".  Among her house plants she listed, not only oranges, lemons, and limes, but also oleander, dwarf myttle, rose geranium and chrysanthemum, observing that those would "live in the garden through the winter though the first frost would destroy the flower."  Living, as she did, far from markets and major trade routes, Lady Skipwith also listed, for example, "Bulbous roots to get when in my power. . . . [[Meadow saffron]] a bulbous root about the size of a tulip, flowers in autumn and the leaves continue green all winter. Called by the common people Naked Ladies, great varieties may be obtained from seed".&lt;ref name="Leighton" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
After her husband's death in 1805, Lady Skipwith managed Prestwould Plantation for the next 21 years.  

Lady Skipwith died on May 19th, 1826. Of her death "after an illness of 3 days," Dr. Robert Redd of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, noted that "she, to the last, would not allow a Physician to be sent for. The character of this truly unique woman is well known. -- May her everlasting life be as happy as her days here were profitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redd|first=Robert|last2=Wilson|first2=George P.|date=1936|title=From a Virginia Physician's Place-Book, 1825-1827|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1918802|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=16|issue=2|pages=234–240|doi=10.2307/1918802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By her death, Lady Skipwith had acquired a library of more than 850 volumes.&lt;ref name="Stamford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Kerrison]], The Novel as Teacher:  Learning to be Female in the Early American South", The Journal of Southern History, vol. 69, no. 3, (Univ. Ga.) 2003, pp. 513–548. [www.jstor.org/stable/30040009].&lt;/ref&gt;  Her library was, perhaps, the largest library assembled by a woman of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Emanuel, Special Collections Apprentice, An Acquired Taste, "Exceptional in Any Age":  The Library of Lady Jean Skipwith (exhibition, Swem Library's Special Collection, Coll.

Cornell, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Her collection also included a will, which allowed her daughters and daughter-in-law to choose 200 books each from her library, and left her son-in-law her Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;ref name="Leighton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mildred K. Abraham, "The Library of Lady Jean Skipwith," Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 91, 296-347 (Va. Hist. Soc. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joan Elizabeth Curran''' (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[scientist]] who played important roles in the development of [[radar]] and the [[atomic bomb]] during the [[Second World War]]. She invented [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]], a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied [[bomber]] crews. She also worked on the development of the [[proximity fuse]] and the electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] process for the atomic bomb.

==Early life==
Joan Elizabeth Strothers was born on 26 February 1916 in [[Swansea]], Wales, the daughter of an [[optician]], Charles William Strothers, and his wife, Margaret Beatrice, née Millington.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=71958|title=Joan Elizabeth Curran, Lady Curran (1916–1999) |first=Bill |last=Fletcher }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at Swansea Girls' High School, and in 1934 won an open scholarship to [[Newnham College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 February 1999 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |first=Tam |last=Dalyell |title=Obituary: Joan Curran |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-joan-curran-1071704.html |accessdate= 14 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, she rowed for the [[Cambridge University Women's Boat Club|ladies' university eight]],&lt;ref&gt;NCBC Captain's log book (1935).

Strothers, who "had the scientific equivalent of gardening green fingers",&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; was awarded a government grant to study for a higher degree, and elected to go to the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at Cambridge, where she joined [[Samuel Curran|Sam Curran]] in a team under the direction of [[Philip Dee]].&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; She soon established a reputation for "extreme dexterity and being outstandingly neat and skilful in the deployment of equipment."&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; In 1939, Dee proposed that the team spend a month at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough Airfield]]. They arrived on 1 September 1939. Two days later, Britain declared war on Germany, and Britain entered the Second World War.{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|p=98}}

==Second World War==
Instead of returning to the Cavendish, the team moved to [[Exeter]], where Dee and three others worked on developing rockets as anti-aircraft weapons, while Strothers and Curran joined a group under John Coles working on the development of the [[proximity fuse]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|p=98}} Strothers was based at [[Leeson House]] and [[Durnford School]].{{sfn|Latham|Stobbs|1999|p=196}} She and Curran developed a workable fuse, which was codenamed VT, an acronym of "Variable Time fuze". The system was a small, short-range, Doppler radar that used a clever circuit. However, Britain lacked the capacity to mass-produce the fuze,{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|p=98}} so the design was shown to the United States by the [[Tizard Mission]] in late 1940.{{sfn|Zimmerman|1996|pp=119–120}} The Americans perfected and mass-produced the fuse.{{sfn|Brown|1999|pp=174–180}} In due course, these proximity fuses arrived in the United Kingdom, where they played an important part in the defence of the kingdom against the [[V-1 flying bomb]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|p=98}}

[[Image:Window - Lancaster Dropping Window.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] dropping chaff (the crescent-shaped white cloud on the left of the picture) over [[Essen]] during a thousand-bomber raid]]
Strothers married Curran on 7 November 1940. Soon afterwards they were transferred to the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] near [[Swanage]], where Sam worked on [[History of Radar#Centimetric radar|centimetric radar]], while Joan joined the Counter Measures Group in an adjoining lab.{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|pp=99–100}} It was with this group, at Swanage, and later at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], that Joan devised the technique that was codenamed Window, which is also known as [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]]. She tried various types of radar reflectors, including wires and sheets, before settling on strips of [[tin foil]] {{convert|1|to|2|cm}} wide and {{convert|25|cm}} long that could be scattered from bombers, thus disrupting the enemy's radar.{{sfn|Jones|1978|pp=291–292}} Window was first employed in [[Operation Gomorrah]], a series of raids on [[Hamburg]], and resulted in a much lower loss rate than usual.{{sfn|Jones|1978|pp=300–302}} As part of [[Operation Taxable]] on 5–6 June 1944, Window was dropped by [[Avro Lancaster]]s of [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron]] to synthesise a phantom invasion force of ships in the [[Straits of Dover]] and keep the Germans unsure as to whether the brunt of the Allied assault would fall on [[Normandy]] or in the [[Pas de Calais]] area.{{sfn|Bateman|2009|pp=67–69}} [[R. V. Jones]] later declared: "In my opinion, Joan Curran made an even greater contribution to victory, in 1945, than Sam."&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt;

In early 1944 the Currans were part of a group of British scientists invited to go to the US to take part in the [[Manhattan Project]] – the Allied project to develop an [[atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/swansea-scientist-joan-made-huge-8409571 |title=Swansea scientist Joan made a huge difference to the world and should not be forgotten |newspaper=[[Wales Online]] |date=8 January 2015 |first=Robin |last=Turner |accessdate=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They joined the [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|British Mission]] at the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] in California, headed by [[Mark Oliphant]],{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=256–260}} a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory.{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|p=98}} Oliphant also acted as ''de facto'' deputy to [[Ernest Lawrence]], the director of the Radiation Laboratory.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=256–260}} The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic [[isotope separation]] process to create [[enriched uranium]] for use in atomic bombs.{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|pp=100–101}}

While at Berkeley, Joan gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Sheena, who was born severely mentally handicapped.&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt; They later had three sons, all of whom went on to complete a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Later life==
After the war ended, Sam took up an offer from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at [[Glasgow University]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|pp=100–101}} In [[Glasgow]], the Currans, together with a few friends, set up the [[Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children]] (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan was a member of the [[Greater Glasgow Health Board]] and the [[Scottish Special Housing Association]], the needs of the [[disabled]] were always at the forefront of her mind, and she did much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the [[Council for Access for the Disabled]] and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.&lt;ref name="The Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland"/&gt;

Sam worked at the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]] on the development of the British [[hydrogen bomb]] from 1955 to 1959. He returned to Glasgow in 1959 as principal the [[Royal College of Science and Technology]]. When it became the University of Strathclyde in 1964, the first new university in Scotland in 384 years, he became its first Principal and Vice Chancellor.{{sfn|Fletcher|1999|pp=102–103}} While her husband was Principal, Joan founded the Strathclyde Women's Group and became its president.&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland"/&gt;

During the war the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]] had been based in Scotland, establishing ties between the community and Poland. Joan promoted a special relationship with the [[Technical University of Lodz]], and also devoted care and attention to the children's hospital of that city.

'''John William Smith''' (November 4, 1792 – January 12, 1845) (born William John Smith in [[Virginia]]) was a Texas political figure, the first mayor of [[San Antonio]] under the [[Republic of Texas]] and the first mayor of San Antonio under the state of [[Texas]]. He supported and served Texas during the [[Texas Revolution|struggle for Texas Independence]].

==Early life==
Smith was born as the second son of John and Isabel Smith. He grew up in [[Ralls County, MO|Ralls County]], [[Missouri]] after moving from his birth state of Virginia, and received an expensive education. He married [[Harriet Stone]] in [[Hannibal, Missouri]] sometime between 1821 and 1822. They had three known children, Samuel, Mary Elizabeth and Lucinda.

His first elected position was in 1822 as [[Sheriff]] of Ralls County and State and County tax Collector. He resigned from the post in 1826 to move to Texas following the birth of his third child. His wife refused to accompany him and filed for divorce. She ultimately came to Texas with her second husband.

==Move to San Antonio==
Smith moved to [[Mexican Texas]] and settled in San Antonio. In Texas, he changed his first and middle names around because "William" was difficult for Mexicans to pronounce. He was known throughout the town as "El Colorado", Spanish for "Redhead". He served as in the city as military storekeeper until 1835 also working as a [[Surveying|surveyor]] (like his Texas contemporaries; [[James Kerr (Texas)|James Kerr]], [[Byrd Lockhart]], and [[Arthur Swift]] ) and a civil engineer. While in the city ([[San Fernando Cathedral]] to be exact), he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and married a 15-year-old Spanish (her &lt;ref&gt;1937 Chabot "With the Makers Genealogies ..." book&lt;/ref&gt; great grandfather [[Juan Curbelo (Tejano settler)|Juan Curbelo]] came from the [[Canary Islands]]) girl named [[Maria Jesusita Curbelo]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelime Vance Gillespie II, John William Smith:  Soldier, Messenger, Patriot
[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/smithjohnwilliam.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas Revolution==

Through time, Smith had become upset by the occupation of San Antonio by Mexican Colonel [[Domingo Ugartechea]]. He was arrested with A. C. Holmes and [[Samuel Maverick]] and was saved by his wife's pleas, which enabled him to escape and guide the final assault in the [[Siege of Bexar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/bexarmaverick.htm TAMU]&lt;/ref&gt;

He served twice as a messenger during the [[Siege of the Alamo]]. On February 23, Smith and Sutherland were sent by Travis as scouts to assess the Mexican Army's strength and position. Upon locating the Mexican Army in strength, he immediately returned to the Alamo. That evening he was dispatched to [[Gonzales, Texas]] with a message from Travis. He returned to the Alamo from Gonzales, Texas on March 1. Before the final [[battle of the Alamo]] and its fall, [[William B. Travis]] sent Smith with a message for [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], allowing him to escape the fate that all Texas soldiers defending San Antonio ultimately succumbed to. After delivering the message, he returned with men to fight in the battle but heard no gunfire as their horses drank at [[Cibolo Creek]]. He was informed that the [[battle of the Alamo]] was over and headed eastward to fight at [[Battle of San Jacinto|San Jacinto]], where independence was won.

==Mayor of San Antonio==
[[File:Emory-San Antonio.jpg|thumb|The city close to the time of Smith's mayorship]]
He was elected Mayor on September 19, 1837 and served until 1838. As mayor, he prohibited public bathing in the [[San Antonio River]] and [[San Pedro Creek]] between the hours of 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. He established that businesses must close at 9 p.m. on Sunday, and allowed for milk cows in Downtown as long as they were milked and in the corral before 10 p.m. Smith also regulated dog ownership, taxing citizens $2.00 for bitches and $0.50 for males. Although he did not run for re-election in 1838, he would run in 1840 and was elected. He served his second time as mayor until 1844. During this time, he constructed the city's first bridge across the San Antonio River on [[Downtown San Antonio|Commerce Street]].

He was for a time postmaster of San Antonio.

Other positions he held in [[Bexar County]] were alderman, tax assessor, clerk of the County Court, clerk of the Board of Land Commissioners, clerk of the County Probate Court, county treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Collins Scanlan, "SMITH, JOHN WILLIAM," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsm30], accessed May 17, 2011. Published by the TSHA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senator of the Republic==
During the Republic years, Smith served as a commissioner, to treat with the Indians of Texas.

From 1842 to January 12, 1845, he served the Republic as a Texas Senator.

==Death==
He died on January 12, 1845, most likely from [[pneumonia]].  He is regarded as a hero and was honored as such upon his death.

He was buried at the [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]] State Historical Park, but his remains were later transferred to Washington Cemetery which is located on 19724 Washington Cemetery Rd, [[Washington, Texas]] in [[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]], where his body remains today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=SMITH&amp;GSfn=JOHN&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=1964701&amp;GRid=38930037&amp; Find A Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Chatoyer,''' also known as '''Satuye''' (died 14 March 1795), was a [[Garifuna]] (''[[Black Carib|Carib]]'') chief who led a revolt against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonial government of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]] in 1795. Killed that year, he is now considered a national hero of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and also of Belize and Costa Rica. Vincentian politician [[Camillo Gonsalves]] described him in 2011 as his country's "sole [[Folk hero|national hero]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/webcast/unhrc/archive.asp?go=110510 Review of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines], [[Universal Periodic Review]], [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], 10 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1772, the population rebelled. Led by Chatoyer, the [[First Carib War]] forced the British to sign a treaty with them in 1773. This was the first time Britain had been forced to sign an accord with non-white people in the Caribbean.

By 1795, it became apparent to the local population that Britain had no intention of obeying the treaty. The people of the Caribbean then rose in rebellion and were joined by a group of French radicals, inspired by the ideals of the [[French Revolution]], who saw Britain as a traditional enemy of France. In the [[Second Carib War]], Chatoyer divided the island with his brother [[Duvalle]], who was another chieftain.&lt;ref name="Garifuna History"/&gt; Duvalle had a Guadeloupean lieutenant by the name of [[Massoteau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lara|first1=Oruno D.|title=De L'Oubli à l'Histoire|date=1998|publisher=Maisonneuve et Larose|location=Paris|isbn=2-86877-138-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working his way along the coast, Chatoyer was met by his French supporters at [[Chateaubelair]], and together the forces worked their way to Dorsetshire Hill, from where they would launch their attack on the capital city, [[Kingstown]].

On March 14, a battalion of British soldiers led by General [[Ralph Abercromby]], marched toward Dorsetshire Hill. That night, Chatoyer was killed by Major Alexander Leith. Though the rebellion continued until October 1796 under the leadership of Duvalle,&lt;ref name="Garifuna History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cayetano|first1=Sebastian|title=Garifuna History, Language &amp; Culture of Belize, Central America &amp; the Caribbean|date=1993|publisher=The Author|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YkFrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=CHief+duvalle&amp;dq=CHief+duvalle|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chatoyer's death led to the desertion of the French supporters and without their aid, the tide of the war turned in favour of the British.

As a national hero of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Chatoyer is recognized with a monument on Dorsetshire Hill, where he died.

==Legacy==
Although Chatoyer died before the remainder of the rebels were deported to [[Roatan]] in [[Honduras]], from where they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America and became known as the [[Garifuna]] people; he is considered to have been a Garifuna warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Colon Jr, Teofilo, [https://beinggarifuna.com/2015/03/14/memorial-mass-for-garifuna-freedom-fighter-paramount-chief-joseph-chatoyer-to-take-place-in-the-bronx-on-sunday-march-15th-2015-as-part-of-garifuna-american-heritage-month-in-new-york/ "Memorial Mass for GARIFUNA Warrior, Paramount Chief JOSEPH CHATOYER To Take Place In The Bronx on SUNDAY, March 15th 2015 as Part of 2015 GARIFUNA American Heritage Month in New York"], Beinggarifuna.com, 14 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A play based on his life, ''[[The Drama of King Shotaway]],'' written by [[William Henry Brown (playwright)|William Henry Brown]], an African American from the West Indies, and Director of the [[African Theatre]]. It was the first play written in the United States by a black man. The play was produced by the African Company at the [[African Grove Theatre]] in [[New York City]] in 1823, but no manuscript survived.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Bernard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y36KqUL1jSAC&amp;dq=%22King+Shotaway,&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Early Black American Playwrights and Dramatic Writers: A Biographical Directory and Catalog of Plays, Films, and Broadcasting Scripts''], Greenwood Publishing, 1990, pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan de Garay''' (1528&amp;ndash;1583) was a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquistador.]]
Garay's birthplace is disputed. Some say it was in the [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] city of [[Junta de Villalba de Losa]], while others argue he was born in the area of Orduña (Basque Country). There's no birth certification whatsoever, though Juan De Garay regarded himself as somebody from Biscay (a region from the Basque Country). He served under the [[Crown of Castille]], in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. He was governor of [[Asunción]] (present day [[Paraguay]]) and founded a number of cities in present-day [[Argentina]], many near the [[Paraná River]] area, including the second foundation of [[Buenos Aires]], in 1580.

== Biography ==

In 1543 he sailed to [[Peru]] with his uncle [[Pedro de Zárate]] in Viceroy [[Blasco Núñez Vela]]'s first expedition. In 1561 he took part in the foundation of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. In 1568 he moved to [[Asunción]] where he attained political stature. The governor of Asunción sent him in April 1573, with a company of eighty men, on an expedition to the [[Paraná River]], during which he founded the city of ''[[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz]]''. In 1576 he was appointed governor of Asunción. As governor, he attempted to avoid bloodshed by bringing justice and civilization to the natives. To achieve these goals, he founded Indian villages and established local governments.

In 1580, having attained the rank of Capitan General of the Viceroyalty, he re-founded the city on the banks of the [[Río de la Plata]], which was first established by [[Pedro de Mendoza]] in 1536 under the name of [[Buenos Aires|Nuestra Señora del Buen Ayre]], but was later destroyed by the natives. Garay founded [[Buenos Aires]] a second time on June 11 in the year 1580. He landed on the riverbank in the location of [[Plaza de Mayo]], calling the city ''Ciudad de la Trinidad'' and its port ''Santa Maria de Buenos Ayres''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Acta de fundación de Buenos_Aires (1580) | wslanguage=es | language=Spanish | last=Garay | first=Juan de | authorlink=Juan de Garay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buenos Aires would become the main city in the Paraná basin and its most important port.

Later, he went on an expedition in search for the legendary City of the Caesars (1581-1582).

Juan de Garay died near the [[Río de la Plata]], while travelling from Buenos Aires to [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] on March 20, 1583, his group of 40 men, a Franciscan priest and a few women entered an unknown lagoon and decided to spend the night on the banks of the [[Carcarañá River]], near the ancient [[Sancti Spíritus Fort]]. The group was ambushed by [[Querandí]]es natives who killed Garay, the priest, a woman, and twelve of the soldiers. He was then made King.

Garay had a daughter, Jerónima de Contreras, who married [[Hernando Arias de Saavedra]], the [[Governorate of the Rio de la Plata|governor of Rio de la Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the oldest part of the town of Garay in Biscay is located a palace-baserri named Garatikua and built by Juan de Garay. In the 19th century, it was called "Garay-Goitia".

==The Garay Family==
[[File:Monumento a Juan de Garay.jpg|thumb|150px|Monument to Juan de Garay]]
According to García Carraffa, the Garay's [[coat of arms]] (gules with rampant lion in gold with a silver banner) indicates an origin from the noble Garay Family of Tudela (Navarra), already mentioned in the thirteenth century. Juan de Garay as a Biscayan had the title of knight, a title the "Fueros" granted to all the Vizcayans. The family had a certain economic and cultural level, it should be kept in mind that his uncle was appointed Judge and "Alcalde Mayor" of Segovia and his cousin attended the University of Salamanca.

Juan joined the family of his uncle that was made by Pedro Ortiz de Zárate, his wife Catalina Uribe and Salazar and his cousins: Pedro Ortiz de Zárate, Ana Salazar and the youngest of the brothers Francisco Uribe. The three children bear different surnames, only the firstborn retains that of the father, while the others adopt the mother's surname (which was very common at the time). He also had a family relationship with Juan Ortiz de Zárate, third "Adelantado" (advanced) of the Rio de la Plata.

Cudi first gained major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''A Kid Named Cudi'' (2008). The mixtape caught the attention of American rapper-producer [[Kanye West]], who subsequently signed Cudi to his [[GOOD Music]] label imprint in late 2008. In 2008 his debut single "[[Day 'n' Nite]]" led him to prominence, reaching the top five of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. Cudi's debut album ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]'' (2009) was later [[Music recording sales certification|certified two-times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=kid+cudi+man+on+the+moon#search_section|title=Gold &amp; Platinum - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=August 2, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he released ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'', which was preceded by "[[Erase Me (song)|Erase Me]]" and "[[Mr. Rager]]". Later that year Cudi formed a [[rock band]], now known as [[WZRD (band)|WZRD]], with his long-time collaborator [[Dot da Genius]], releasing one [[WZRD (album)|eponymous debut album]] in early 2012. The album debuted at number one on the [[Rock Albums|Top Rock Albums]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/kid-cudi-ditches-rap-for-rock_1178078 |title=Kid Cudi Ditches Rap For Rock |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=October 31, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://keepittrill.com/online/2010/10/kid-cudi-forms-rock-band-called-wizard/ |title=Kid Cudi Forms New Rock Band Called 'Wizard' |publisher=Keepittrill.com |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Cudi released ''[[Indicud]]'', which became his highest-charting album on multiple charts. In February 2014, Cudi unexpectedly released his fourth album, ''[[Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon]]'', exclusively to digital retailers with no promotion. In 2015 Cudi released his rock album ''[[Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven]]'' to negative reception. In 2016 he returned to hip-hop with his sixth album ''[[Passion, Pain &amp; Demon Slayin']]'' to generally positive reviews. Cudi later released a joint album with West under the [[Kids See Ghosts|eponymous name]] ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]''. The album was met with critical acclaim.

== Musical career ==

=== 2003–08: Beginnings in New York ===
Cudi first began rapping towards the end of his high school career, inspired by [[alternative hip hop]] groups such as [[The Pharcyde]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].&lt;ref name=Soul/&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a music career.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Upon his arrival, he stayed with his uncle, Kalil Madi:&lt;ref name="2009interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2009/07/kid-cudi/page/2 |title=Kid Cudi |publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427174922/http://www.complex.com/music/2009/07/kid-cudi/page/2 |archivedate=April 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I was working at this restaurant in Cleveland. There was this white dude in his 40s who was cool as shit and would tell me, "You're funny and people like you. You need to move the fuck out of Ohio and just do this." My uncle told me I could come out there and stay with him in the [[South Bronx]] until I got on my feet. I'd never met him; this was my father's older brother, the last of my father's siblings, so I wanted to make that connection anyway. I moved in 2004 with my little [[Demo (music)|demo]] and maybe $500.&lt;ref name="q&amp;a"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://musicconnection.com/qa-kid-cudi/ |title=Q&amp;A With Kid Cudi |publisher=Musicconnection.com |date=November 4, 2013 |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly after he moved from Cleveland, a [[A Bathing Ape|BAPE]] store opened up in the city, where he later applied for a job:&lt;ref name="bape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypebeast.com/2010/3/bathing-ape-kid-cudi-interview-photoshoot?_locale=en |title=A Bathing Ape x Kid Cudi Interview &amp; Photoshoot |publisher=HypeBeast |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I discovered what BAPE was when I moved to NY, the store opened up shortly after I moved from Cleveland. I was always a fan of the brand but it just wasn't something I could afford back then. I remember working there my first couple of weeks in the same uniform cause I didn’t own anything prior to being hired. So it was a dream come true to be able to work at the store I dreamed of shopping in one day. Over a couple of years I might have applied at the store 3 or 4 times before the last attempt that got me hired. I fell in love with BAPE because of their color selection and artwork. I love the style of their cartoons.}}

While working there Cudi met future mentor [[Kanye West]], for the first time after forgetting to remove an anti-theft device from a jacket West had purchased.&lt;ref name="bape"/&gt; His uncle later kicked him out, leading to his writing "[[Day 'n' Nite]]":

{{cquote|My uncle that I lived with passed in 2006. We were actually beefing because he forced me out the house when I didn't have another situation set up, so I was bitter. I never apologized for it, and that kills me. That's why I wrote "Day 'n' Nite". If he wasn't there to let me stay with him those first few months, there would be no Kid Cudi. It fucked me up watching him go, but it was like, "I have to fulfill this destiny now for sure." Things were moving but they weren't solidified yet. I had "Day 'n' Nite", we were just getting started, and I was like, "This shit has got to pop off." I wasn't taking no for an answer.&lt;ref name="2009interview"/&gt;}}

Cudi's early work caught the attention of Kanye West, whose then-manager [[Plain Pat]], had introduced Cudi's music to him, subsequently leading West to sign Cudi to his [[GOOD Music]] imprint later that year. In July 2008, Kid Cudi released his first mixtape, ''[[A Kid Named Cudi]]'' (executive produced by Plain Pat and [[Emile Haynie]]), in collaboration with New York street-wear brand 10.Deep as a free download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://illroots.com/2008/07/17/kid-cuDi-a-kid-named-cuDi/ |title=10.Deep Presents: Kid Cudi – "A Kid Named Cudi Mixtape" |publisher=Illroots.com |date=July 17, 2008 |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424231047/http://illroots.com/2008/07/17/kid-cuDi-a-kid-named-cuDi/ |archivedate=April 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanye West first called upon Cudi to reference [[Refrain|hooks]] for American rapper and mogul [[Jay-Z]], and while in the studio Cudi and West went from working on ''[[The Blueprint 3]]'' (2009) to West's [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]]-esque ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008).&lt;ref name="2009interview"/&gt; Cudi’s assistance on the latter includes co-writing credits and or vocals on "[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]," "[[Welcome to Heartbreak]]," "[[Paranoid (Kanye West song)|Paranoid]]" and "RoboCop."&lt;ref name="2009interview"/&gt; Kid Cudi was a prominent [[songwriter]] and featured artist on ''808s &amp; Heartbreak'', with "Paranoid" and "Heartless" being released as singles, while "Welcome to Heartbreak" charted as an album cut and peaked at number 87 on the [[Pop 100]].&lt;ref name="Pop100"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kid cudi|chart=Pop 100}}|title=Billboard Pop 100 Chart Positions|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven}}

In a January 2015 interview, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Kid Cudi expressed the possibility of releasing another album before the release of ''Man on the Moon III'': "I'm always making music. The beauty in that is that I have a lot of material. And I'm actually thinking that it would be good to release something in the meantime, before ''Man on the Moon III'' comes out. Another Kid Cudi album, it's just kind of along the lines of what I did with ''Indicud'' or ''Satellite Flight'', which is just its own standalone thing but still a Kid Cudi album. The ''Man on the Moon III'' album is something that's gonna take some time but I know the fans are gonna be patient and I really appreciate that guys, thank you for your patience. But ''Man on the Moon III'' is coming, there may be an album before that just to tide you over."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themaskedgorilla.com/kid-cudi-planning-to-release-album-before-man-on-the-moon-3/ |title=Kid Cudi Planning To Release Album Before Man On The Moon: III |publisher=The Masked Gorilla |date=January 30, 2015 |accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitsonhits.com/kid-cudi-planning-to-release-new-album-before-man-on-the-moon-iii/ |title=Kid Cudi Planning To Release New Album Before Man On The Moon: III &amp;#124; Hits On Hits.

== Personal life ==
In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] two years earlier, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and [[Stoner culture#Cannabis subculture|stoner culture]]. In that same interview, Cudi said that while he believes in God, he considers himself [[spiritual but not religious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/kid-cudi-talks-quitting-weed-bossing-up-illuminati-rumors-and-motm-iii | title = Interview: Kid Cudi Talks Quitting Weed, Bossing Up, Illuminati Rumors, and "MOTM III" | author = Joe La Puma | date = January 17, 2013 | accessdate = August 2, 2013 | publisher = Complex }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013 interview, Kid Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and drugs: 
{{bquote |quote = "For me, I just got to this point, and especially up until recently, I gave up liquor, I don’t drink anymore, it’s been five and a half months I’ve been sober. The booze was a new thing for me, I didn’t realize I was an [[alcoholic]] all these years. I had a problem, I think with any addiction you have to be ready to make the choice, whether it’s [[cigarette]]s or anything. You have to just commit and you just have to stick with it. I stopped everything [[cold turkey]]. When I had my [[cocaine]] problem I stopped cold turkey, I didn’t go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. I don’t believe in these things. Some people need the extra help, not me. I wasn’t a [[drug addict]] before this crap, I wasn’t doing cocaine, I wasn’t getting [[Alcohol intoxication|wasted]] every night because I didn’t want to be alone. I wasn’t this dark person before the madness, I was a whole other dude. I don’t even think I smoked weed as much ‘cause we couldn’t afford it... You just have to make the choice and decide the person you wanna be and stick with it. You get to a certain age where the people around you are not gonna be on that rollercoaster all day long ready for you to go up, ready for you to go down, and stick with you through all the madness. People want you to be one person and stick with it and I chose to be clean and be sober and get my life together. For myself, for my health, for my daughter, for my family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefix.com/content/kid-cudi-reveals-how-he-beat-his-addictions|title=Kid Cudi Reveals How He Beat His Addictions|author=|date=|work=The Fix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.27973/title.kid-cudi-i-couldnt-deal-with-fame|title=- HipHopDX|author=|date=March 19, 2014|work=HipHopDX}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Family===
On March 26, 2010, Cudi's daughter, Vada Wamwene Mescudi, was born.&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;[https://twitter.com/wizardcud/status/162638922600554497 Photo: Ladies and gentleman, I think its time you all meet the #1 love in my life.

Twitter.com (January 12, 2012). Retrieved on January 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2012, Cudi was in a quiet [[Child custody|custody]] battle over his daughter. Reports surfaced that Cudi gave up custody after his child's mother accused him of being an absentee father, as well as having violent tendencies and a "long history of consistent drug and alcohol abuse." These claims were disputed by Cudi and his attorney in a statement, which noted: "Cudi did not give up custody but reached an amicable agreement with the mother; that 'both parents are fit and proper persons to have custody of their child,' as stated in the final custody judgment; results came back negative for drugs in a drug test voluntarily taken by Cudi; and that the court acknowledged Cudi attempted to establish a relationship and visit his child since her birth and "voluntarily provided financial support, including child support, rent and other monthly payments, for his daughter since her birth until the time that a child support order was entered as part of the normal course of the case." Details of the official custody agreement remain private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.complex.com/music/2012/11/kid-cudi-releases-statement-about-child-custody-battle | title = Kid Cudi's Attorney Responds to Child Custody Controversy | author = Andrew Martin | date = November 20, 2012 | accessdate = January 16, 2013 | publisher = Complex }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cudi has since purchased a property in Chicago to be close to his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Kid-Cudi-loses-custody-battle/tabid/418/articleID/277318/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Kid Cudi loses custody battle| date=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After immigrating to [[Canada]], he entered Royal Military College in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;Lief Newry Fitzroy Crozier {{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=story_line_child&amp;fl=0&amp;lg=English&amp;ex=00000134&amp;sl=2167&amp;pos=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071231010946/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=story_line_child&amp;fl=0&amp;lg=english&amp;ex=00000134&amp;sl=2167&amp;pos=1 |archivedate=2007-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He served as a major in the military. He joined the NWMP in 1872. He was appointed an inspector of the NWMP in 1873. He saw first hand the hardships faced by the Native people as the [[American Bison|buffalo]] disappeared. By 1884, he was the Superintendent of the North-West Mounted Police stationed in [[Fort Carlton]]. He warned Lieutenant-Governor [[Edgar Dewdney]] that government policies were creating unrest among the [[First Nations]] and Métis. Since he feared a repetition of the [[Red River Rebellion]], he asked for reinforcements to be sent to the North-West.

Wanting to avoid conflict, he attempted to negotiate with Louis Riel but was unsuccessful leaving the situation in a stalemate. 
&lt;ref&gt;Lief Newry Fitzroy Crozier {{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=story_line_child&amp;fl=0&amp;lg=English&amp;ex=00000134&amp;sl=2167&amp;pos=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071231010946/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=story_line_child&amp;fl=0&amp;lg=english&amp;ex=00000134&amp;sl=2167&amp;pos=1 |archivedate=2007-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On March 26, 1885, Crozier lead a group of approximately 100 mounted police and [[Prince Albert Volunteers]] from Fort Carlton and a seven-pounder gun to bring back provisions which were running low at Fort Carlton. These men were confronted by [[Gabriel Dumont (Métis leader)|Gabriel Dumont]] and a superior force of Métis near [[Duck Lake, Saskatchewan]]; no shots were fired and the police returned to Fort Carlton. In the ensuing [[Battle of Duck Lake]], the NWMP were routed by the Métis. The resistance that he had wanted to avoid earlier broke out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Police/eng_html/5.3_thenorthwest.html# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629144145/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Police/eng_html/5.3_thenorthwest.html |date=2011-06-29 }} Lief Newry Fitzroy Crozier&lt;/ref&gt;
The retreat of the government under heavy fire tarnished the reputation of the NWMP.
Crozier's role in the remainder of the rebellion was minimal, and his force largely remained at its post in [[Battleford, Saskatchewan]]. His march on Duck Lake and into an ambush stalled his career with the NWMP. Nevertheless, he was on April 1 promoted to assistant commissioner of the NWMP, a post which he held until his retirement in 1886. In 1886, after the Prime Minister, Sir [[John A. Macdonald]], appointed a civilian commissioner instead of himself, he resigned. He spent his later years in as a merchant and banker in [[Oklahoma Territory]], dying of a heart attack in [[Cushing, Oklahoma|Cushing, Oklahoma Territory]] on 25 February 1901. His body was brought back to [[Belleville, Ontario]], to be buried.

'''Liu Di''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 劉荻; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 刘荻; [[Pinyin]]: Liú Dí; born October 9, 1981), writing under the screen name "[[Stainless Steel Rat]]" (不锈钢老鼠), named after the assertive [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] science fiction character, became a symbol for [[democracy]] and [[free speech]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]] since her detention in November 2002. Her screen-name is often translated as Stainless Steel Mouse.

==Biography==
Liu Di graduated as a [[psychology]] major from [[Beijing Normal University]].

Liu's case comes during a crackdown on Internet content—from [[politics]] to [[pornography]]—and as the government struggles to gain control over a new and popular medium.

The reasons for Liu's detention were satirizing the [[China|CCP]] online and calling for the release of other "[[cyber-dissident]]s."

She was freed from [[Beijing]]'s [[Qincheng]] prison on Friday, November 28, 2003. Two other "[[cyber-dissident]]s", Wu Yiran, and Li Yibin, were also freed from a jail for political detainees.

==Playing career==
===College===
In the [[2015–16 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2015–16]] season, his freshman year with the [[Wisconsin Badgers]], he was the second-youngest player in college hockey.  Kunin scored 19 goals (third-most among [[NCAA]] freshmen) and 32 points in 34 games and was named to the [[Big Ten Conference]] All-Rookie Team.&lt;ref name ="sign"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild sign first-round pick, Badgers captain Luke Kunin|url=https://www.foxsports.com/north/story/minnesota-wild-wisconsin-badgers-first-round-pick-luke-kunin-signs-032317|website=foxsports.com|accessdate=February 26, 2018|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rookie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiba.iheart.com/articles/wisconsin-sports-125287/luke-kunin-named-to-big-ten-14494273/|title=Luke Kunin named to Big Ten All-Freshman team|website=wiba.com|date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016–17 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season|2016–17]] season, Kunin was elected as the Wisconsin team captain, becoming only the second sophomore captain in teams history.&lt;ref name = "badgers bio"/&gt; The last sophomore to have had achieved this honor was [[Mike Eaves]] 40 years ago.&lt;ref name = "badgers bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lund|first1=Ryan|title=Wild could have future captain in Kunin|url=https://www.foxsports.com/north/story/minnesota-wild-luke-kunin-future-captain-wisconsin-badgers-hockey-072017|website=foxsports.com|accessdate=February 26, 2018|date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He led the Badgers with 22 goals and 38 points in 35 games, good enough for Second Team All Big Ten.

On January 5, 2017, Kunin won a gold medal at the 2017 [[IIHF World U20 Championship|IIHF World Junior U20 Championship]] as Captain of [[United States men's national junior ice hockey team|Team USA]] in a 5-4 shootout win against [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Team Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mizutani|first1=Dane|title=Wild think Luke Kunin will be an NHL player, maybe very soon|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/4335406-wild-think-luke-kunin-will-be-nhl-player-maybe-very-soon|website=duluthnewstribune.com|accessdate=February 26, 2018|date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malabo Löpèlo Mëlaka''' or '''King Malabo I''' (1837–1937), born on the island of [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]] (today [[Bioko]], [[Equatorial Guinea]]), was the son of former [[Bubi people|Bubi]] king [[King Moka|Moka]] and served as king between 1904 until his death in 1937, during the [[Bahítáari Dynasty]]. One of his three sons, [[Francisco Malabo Beosá]] (1896–2001) was a successor to the royal throne as well as the final heir to the [[Bubi Kingdom]].

==Early life==
Prior to his reign, King Malabo I served as the secretary to Sas-Ebuera from 1899 until 1904. When [[King Esáasi Eweera]] (also known as [[King Sás-Ebuera]]) was arrested by Spanish authorities and detained in 1903 for one year. King Malabo I, along with his brother, [[Lopelo Malabo Bioko]], lost faith that an anti-colonial front against the reigning Spanish authority would come into fruition.

==Reign as King==
Despite not having full political influence, King Malabo I symbolically served as the King of Bioko Island during his reign. His administration conducted bureaucratic gestures such as thanking Francisco Alimama Kashu, a native of [[Hyderabad, India]], for his collaborating with local farms in improving farming techniques by giving him a {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot of land in the village of [[Moka (village)|Moka]]. Alimama Kashu eventually settled in Moka and married into the Malabo family.

During his reign the government of [[Spanish Guinea]] received complete cooperation of the Bubi people, often using violent colonial methods to gain favorable results.

The last anti-colonial uprising took place in 1910 at San Carlos, after the assassination of a European by the name of [[Leon Rabadan]] and two [[Indian people|Indian]] policemen. The confrontation resulted in the death of fifteen thousand ethnic Bubi.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Immediately after the insurrection, the colonial forces pressured King Malabo I to convince Bubi clan leaders to cease further retaliation. The colonial leaders only addressed the most resistant of the local leaders, such as [[Chief Riokalo]].

==Death and legacy==
With the death of King Malabo I in 1937, who died in prison while serving a life sentence for killing Spanish colonial authorities on April 19 of the same year, the political influence of the Bubi administration as well as the traditional role of the tribal king dissipated. The [[Bahítáari Dynasty]] ended with the death of King Malabo I's son, [[King Malabo II|Francisco]], in 2001.

At the end of the 1970s and under the [[toponymic]] [[Africanization]] policy of the new [[Equatorial Guinea]]n government, the capital city of [[Bioko Island]], formerly known as the British [[Port Clarence (Fernando Po)|Port Clarence]] and the Spanish [[Santa Isabel (Fernando Po)|Santa Isabel]], was renamed in honor of King Malabo I. In the early 1980s the [[Rey Malabo National Institute]], formerly called [[Cardinal Cisneros]], followed suit renaming their organization in honor of the king. Furthermore, many streets in several countries around the world have also been named in honor of King Malabo I.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Origin==
As the chronicles are silent on the subject of Malusha's pedigree, 19th-century Russian and Ukrainian historians devised various theories to explain her parentage and name.

Malusha Malkovna is said to be the daughter of Malk of [[Lyubech]], prince of the [[Drevlians]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Malusha/6000000010821867444&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;С. Н. Азбелев. Устная история в памятниках Новгорода и Новгородской земли. {{ISBN|9785860075351}}. Page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The same one that wanted to marry [[Olga of Kiev]] after she became a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon-Kennedy|first=Mike|title=Encyclopedia of Russian and Slavic Myth and Legend|year=1998|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=1-57607-063-8|pages=210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eD5AkdM83iIC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Olga+and+prince+Mal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MSz2U9iYFISyyAT74YCwCA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Olga%20and%20prince%20Mal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary Chronicle]] records that a certain Malusha died in 1000.  This record follows that of [[Rogneda]]'s death. Since Rogneda was Vladimir's wife, historians assume that Malusha was another close relative of the ruling prince, preferably his wife or mother.

The anti-Normanist historian [[Dmitry Ilovaisky]] managed to draw an opposite conclusion: that the Slavic name Malusha was turned into a Scandinavian Malfried. This claim received no wider support.

'''Matthew Caldwell''', (March 8, 1798 – December 28, 1842), also spelled '''Mathew Caldwell''' was a 19th-century Texas settler, military figure, Captain of the '''Gonzales – Seguin Rangers''' and a signer of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]]. Because of his recruitment ride ahead of the [[Battle of Gonzales]], some have called him the [[Paul Revere of Texas]].

==Early life and family==
Matthew Caldwell, nicknamed "Old Paint", was born in Kentucky on March 8, 1798. He moved to Missouri with his family in 1818, where he traded, fought and learned the ways of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. He, his wife, and family arrived in Texas in the [[Green DeWitt]] Colony on February 20, 1831. On June 22, 1831, he received the title to a parcel of land near the Zumwalt Settlement, southwest of current [[Hallettsville, Texas]]. Settling in [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]], Caldwell acquired the original James Hinds residence on Water Street and soon became a person of notoriety, involved in security and command of minutemen rangers in Gonzales and the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/captains.htm TAMU, DeWitt Captains]&lt;/ref&gt;

Actively recruiting before the [[battle of Gonzales]] in October 1835, he rode from Gonzales to [[Bastrop, Texas|Mina]] informing colonists of the dire need of their support in the volunteer army. Because of this, some have called him the [[Paul Revere of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Edward A|title=Wanted: Historic County Jails of Texas|year=2006|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-58544-308-6|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a participant at the battle, he would serve as a scout and mediator.&lt;ref name=hardin9&gt;Hardin (1994), pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; On Nov. 3, 1835, the delegates of the citizens of Texas established the provisional Texas government by the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation of 1835]]. The Consultation authorized the recruitment of 25 Rangers and later was increased to three companies of 56 men each. Caldwell was appointed a subcontractor to the [[Texian Army]] by the Provisional Government of Texas, to supply and administer a volunteer army at the [[siege of Bexar]] and [[the Alamo]].

On 1 February 1836, he and John Fisher were elected delegates from Gonzales to the Texas Independence [[Convention of 1836]] at [[Washington on the Brazos]] and both were signers of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]], on March 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/odeclar-10.html Matthew Caldwell Signature, Texas Independence Document]&lt;/ref&gt; The convention appointed a committee of three, of which Caldwell was a member, to assess the situation of the enemy on the frontier and the condition of the Texian army.&lt;ref name=lindley16&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; They then dispatched couriers with the message of independence and Caldwell went along with them, paying close attention to the state of the new republic as they passed through numerous settlements.

On February 4, 1836, Matthew Caldwell was named along with [[Byrd Lockhart]] and [[William A. Matthews]] as commissioners to raise a group of volunteers for a Gonzales Ranging Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/caldwellmathew.htm DeWitt Colony Captains]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was mustered by March 23, 1836. The muster list of 23 rangers is shown here.

Officers
Capt. Byrd Lockhart,
Lt. George C. Kimble,
First Sergeant William A. Irvin

Privates
John Ballard, John Davis, Andrew Duvalt, Jacob Darst, Frederick C. Elm, Galba Fuqua, William Fishbaugh, John Harris, Andrew J. Kent, David B. Kent, John G. King, Daniel McCoy, Jesse McCoy, Prospect McCoy, Isaac Millsaps, William Morrison, James Nash, Marcus L. Sewell, William Summers, Robert White

When the call for immediate reinforcements came from Lt. Col. [[William B. Travis]] by way of courier Captain Albert Martin on February 25, Lt. George C. Kimble responded on the 27th with 12 of the original rangers mustered and 20 more men joined as they worked their way to the Alamo.

==1836 Alamo relief force==
The Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers company primarily consisted of family men from [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]] and [[Green DeWitt|DeWitt's Colony]], who had gathered when the call for support was issued. After receiving Travis's "To the People of Texas and All Americans in the World" appeal on February 25, the Gonzales Rangers would leave the town of Gonzales on the evening of Saturday, February 27, led by commanding officer Lieutenant George C. Kimble and Captain [[Albert Martin (soldier)|Albert Martin]], who had been the Alamo courier to deliver Travis's appeal at Gonzales. Of the 23 original members who were mustered into the Gonzales Ranger Company on the 23rd, a total of 12 are thought to have entered the Alamo with the final Relief Force on March 1 and all but one died there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/gonreliefframe.htm TAMU, Gonzales Relief Force]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lockhart, Sowell, [[John William Smith (politician)|John William Smith]] and others would accompany the 32 Rangers into the Alamo and later depart, at night, as other couriers left.&lt;ref name=lindley98&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one account, a group of 25 men left Gonzales at two in the evening on the 27th. As they passed through Green Dewitt's Colony toward the [[Seguin, Texas|Umphries Branch]] community and on to the Cibolo Creek, the company would gain 8 more members, increasing the company to 32 men. The youngest member of the Alamo defenders, [[William Philip King]], only 16 years old, would become a part of this group. Due to family illness, he had substituted in his father's place. On the 29th, the group searched to find a way into the Alamo and through the Mexican lines. Then at three o'clock, in the early hours of March 1, they made a wild dash into the fort while being shot at by Alamo sentries. One man was slightly wounded and after a few rash words, the Alamo gates flew open for the Gonzales force to enter.&lt;ref name=edmondson340&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of the 32 immortals are:

Robert White,

Although knowing their chance of survival was slim, the Gonzales Rangers remained in the Alamo, serving as possibly the only reinforcements to make it into the Alamo during the siege.  The 1836 [[Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers]] would all perish in the [[battle of the Alamo]]. For their heroic effort to support the besieged and outnumbered Texians, they are remembered as the "Immortal 32".&lt;ref name=Todish46&gt;Todish (1998), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic years==
In the fall of 1837, after the revolution, settlers began returning to Gonzales. Nothing remained of the former town but one charred building. The Comanche had reestablished their claim to the area. Caldwell would serve as the first law officer or Sheriff of Gonzales (Guadalupe, Dewitt, Caldwell, Lavaca) County.&lt;ref name=Caldwell111&gt;Caldwell (2011), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''City Founders'''

In 1838, he and his fellow rangers founded the town of [[Seguin, Texas|Walnut Branch]], a sparsely populated area in northwest Gonzales County.&lt;ref&gt;John Gesick, "SEGUIN, TX," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hes03], accessed May 22, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The area was well favored and had been a frequented [[Green DeWitt|DeWitt]] ranger campground years before the revolution.

'''1838 frontier rangers'''

Caldwell formed a frontier ranger company of 29 men. Charles Lockhart became First Lieutenant and [[Robert Hall House|Robert Hall]] joined as his Second Lieutenant. They built a log fort to provide security for the residents and only mustered for a real crisis. In October that year, Indians raided the town and stole two young women and some children, The rangers pursued the group, but could not catch them. They were able to make allies of friendly Indians and valued their support.&lt;ref&gt;Life of Robert Hall (1992) pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frontier defender'''

Rumors of a Mexican retaliation soon flourished and Texas President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] would appoint Caldwell, on January 15, 1839, as a captain, to recruit a company of Gonzales Rangers, to defend the Texas frontier. Two months later he had raised his company of rangers and on March 23, 1839, Caldwell became captain of a company in the First Regiment of Infantry of Texas. On March 29, 1839, a company of 80 men commanded by General Edward Burleson had defeated [[Cordova Rebellion|Vicente Córdova]] and his rebels during a fight near [[Seguin, Texas]], at "Battleground Prairie". Córdova survived, but was pursued by Caldwell's Rangers, Seguin militia and then joined by members of the [[Henry Karnes]] company, insuring his departure from Texas.&lt;ref name=Moore198&gt;Moore (2006), p. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caldwells Gonzales &amp; Seguin Rangers 1839'''&lt;ref name=Moore193&gt;Moore (2006), p. 193-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, 1st Lt. James Campbell would be stationed at the Seguin outpost with half of the Caldwell Rangers, providing protection for the new town and others stationed close to Gonzales.
The officers of the Rangers were:
Captain Matthew Caldwell,
1st Lt. James Campbell,
2nd Lt. Canah C. Colley,

'''1840s defense and imprisonment'''

Indian attacks continued to plague the new Republic and in March Caldwell participated in a meeting to trade captives with the [[Comanche]]s. However, the meeting turned violent and the [[Council House Fight]] erupted, where he was wounded. He had recovered in time to lead a company at the [[battle of Plum Creek]] on August 12, 1840.

As captain of Company D of the scouting force in the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]] in 1841, he was captured with other members and imprisoned in Mexico. He was soon released and headed to San Antonio to confront the invading Mexican forces there.

On September 18, 1842, Caldwell commanded a force of 200 men from [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]], [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], [[San Antonio]] and other near settlements, confronting and defeating General [[Adrián Woll]], at the [[Battle of Salado Creek (1842)|battle of Salado Creek]].&lt;ref&gt;L.

== Personal life ==
Since 2009, Vasiljević has dated footballer [[Vujadin Savić]], the son of legendary Serbian footballer [[Dušan Savić]]. In 2011, it was revealed the couple was expecting a baby,&lt;ref name="Scandal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scandal.rs/mirka-vasiljevic-definitivno-trudna-dule-savic-zeni-sina/ |date=25 June 2011 |language=Serbian |accessdate=9 August 2011 |title=Mirka Vasiljević definitivno trudna: Dule Savić ženi sina |publisher=Scandal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729171259/http://www.scandal.rs/mirka-vasiljevic-definitivno-trudna-dule-savic-zeni-sina/ |archivedate=29 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; later confirmed to be a boy.&lt;ref name="Naslovi1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naslovi.net/rd/2676769 |title=Mirka i Vujadin čekaju sina |accessdate=9 August 2011 |language=Serbian |publisher=Vesti-Online.com |date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that they got one more son and daughter.

'''Randy Craig Wolfe''' (February 20, 1951 – January 2, 1997), known as '''Randy California''', was a guitarist, singer and songwriter and one of the original members of the rock group [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]], formed in 1967.

==Biography==
California was born into a musical Jewish&lt;ref name="bernarde-stars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bernarde | first = Scott | title = Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories | year = 2003 | publisher = UPNE | pages = 164–169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC | accessdate = 2015-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; family in [[Los Angeles]] and spent his early years studying varied styles at the family's Los Angeles folk club, the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]]. His uncle, Ed Pearl, was the founder of the Ash Grove.&lt;ref name="relix-bio"&gt;{{cite news | last = Skidmore | first = Mick | title = Randy California (1951–1997): A True Spirit and Guitarist Extraordinaire | year = 1997 | work = Relix Magazine | url = http://www.randycaliforniaandspirit.com/biography.html | accessdate = 2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 15 years old when his mother Bernice Pearl and new stepfather, [[Ed Cassidy]] (later to become a founding member of the band Spirit, with Randy), moved to New York City in the summer of 1966 because Cassidy had a number of jazz gigs lined up. It was there, at [[Manny's Music]], that Randy met [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="roby-interview"&gt;{{cite news | last = Roby | first = Steve | title = Randy California interview | work = Straight Ahead: The International Jimi Hendrix Fanzine | date = October–November 1994 | url = http://www.bostream.nu/johanb/spirit/blfl.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20030312193139/http://www.bostream.nu/johanb/spirit/blfl.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2003-03-12 | accessdate = 2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He played in Hendrix's band [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] that summer. California, Cassidy and Pearl lived in an apartment building in [[Forest Hills (Queens)]], New York called the Balfour, whose other residents included future [[Steely Dan]] co-founder [[Walter Becker]], who cited California's blues-based guitar style as an influence on his own playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/steely-dan-return-of-the-dark-brothers-20000330|title=Rolling Stone, BY ALEC WILKINSON March 30, 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage name "Randy California" was given to him by Hendrix to distinguish him from another Randy in the band, Randy Palmer, whom Hendrix dubbed "Randy Texas".&lt;ref name="bernarde-stars"/&gt; When Hendrix and California were invited to come to England by [[Chas Chandler]], former bassist of [[British Invasion]] band [[the Animals]]—who became Hendrix's manager and producer—Randy's parents refused to allow him to go, insisting the 15-year-old stay and finish high school.&lt;ref&gt;Benarde, Scott R. Stars of David: Rock 'n' Roll's Jewish Stories Publisher: Brandeis, 2003 {{ISBN|9781584653035}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, Chandler wanted Hendrix as the only guitarist for the band and nixed California's going to England.

Together with Cassidy, songwriter/front-man [[Jay Ferguson (American musician)|Jay Ferguson]], bassist [[Mark Andes]] (with whom California and Cassidy had initially formed a band called the Red Roosters) and keyboardist John Locke, California founded the band [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]].

Their first, self-titled, album was released in January 1968, a month before California's 17th birthday. He then wrote the band's biggest hit, 1968's "I Got a Line on You" for Spirit's second album, ''[[The Family That Plays Together]]''. He also wrote the single "1984", released in early 1970 and banned from most AM radio stations at that time. He also penned Spirit's other hit, "Nature's Way", for the band's best-selling album, ''[[Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]]''. Christopher Cross covered "Nature's Way" on his 1994 album "Windows."

==Trial==
In writing [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", [[Jimmy Page]] may have been reworking California's guitar riff from "[[Taurus (instrumental)|Taurus]]", an instrumental song from the first Spirit album. Led Zeppelin was on the same bill as Spirit on two American music festival dates in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|0-7119-5307-4}}, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  In the liner notes for the 1996 reissue of Spirit's first album, California stated: "people always ask me why 'Stairway to Heaven' sounds exactly like 'Taurus,' which was released two years earlier. I know Led Zeppelin also played 'Fresh Garbage' in their live set. They opened up for us on their first American tour". The fact that "Fresh Garbage" was a track from the same album that includes the song "Taurus" further fueled the belief that Led Zeppelin was at least aware of the song.{{Disputed inline|"Fresh Garbage"|date=March 2016}} In 2014, a copyright infringement and injunction lawsuit against the reissue of ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' started with the lawyer saying, "The idea behind this is to make sure that Randy California is given a writing credit on Stairway to Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/19/led-zeppelin-accused-stealing-stairway-to-heaven-opening |title=Led Zeppelin accused of stealing Stairway to Heaven opening &amp;#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Skidmore for Randy Craig Wolfe Trust v. Led Zeppelin'' Case 2:14-cv-03089-JS, Document 1, U.S. District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania, filed 05/31/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In Led Zeppelin's January 1969 appearance at the Fiillmore West, Jimmy Page breaks into an instrumental jam which clearly includes the Spirit song "Fresh Garbage."

In June 2016, after a trial that included audio recordings of several versions of both songs but not the Spirit and Led Zeppelin recordings, and also featured testimony from Page and bandmate Robert Plant explaining the songwriting process for "Stairway," a jury ruled that Page and Plant had not copied "Taurus." &lt;ref&gt;"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3656853/Jury-finds-Led-Zeppelin-did-not-steal-riff-Stairway.html"&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision came under appeal because the judge did not permit the two sound recordings to be played and instead allowed only sheet music.  Copyright law had been expanded to include sound recordings in 1974. In September 2018, this decision was overturned. A new trial was unanimously ordered by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on the basis that U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner gave jurors erroneous information about copyright law. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/09/29/led-zeppelin-face-retrial-in-stairway-to-heaven-copyright-lawsuit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Spirit was invited to open for Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Clear |others=[[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] |year=1969 |chapter= |pages= |publisher= |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, band manager/producer [[Lou Adler]]—who had been one of the founders of the rock festival movement two years earlier, as a partner (with Mamas &amp; Papas lynchpin [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]) in the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], where Hendrix premiered in the U.S.—opposed it because the band was busy promoting their latest album, ''[[Clear (Spirit album)|Clear]]''.

When Ferguson and Andes left Spirit to form [[Jo Jo Gunne]] due to the slow sales of ''Sardonicus'', and then his dear friend Hendrix died, a depressed California left Spirit. He recorded ''Kapt. Kopter &amp; The Fabulous Twirly Birds'', which included California and Cassidy's version of [[Paul Simon]]'s "Mother and Child Reunion" plus a slew of authentically Hendrix-like tracks (also featuring former Experience bassist [[Noel Redding]], AKA 'Clit McTorius'). In 1972 the album was released at virtually the same moment as Jo Jo Gunne's first, eponymous album that featured "Run, Run Run" and a Spirit album called ''Feedback'' that was recorded by Cassidy and Locke (who were Spirit's jazz influences) and guitarist/bassist brother duo Al and John Staehely, who wrote and sang most of the material on the LP.

California's second solo album, ''Euro-American'', was released in 1982 by Beggar's Banquet featuring a line up including British Drummer [[Preston Heyman]] and he headed the bill with Heyman at 1982 [[Glastonbury Festival]], much of the footage from which can be found on [[YouTube]], including a performance of the [[Bob Dylan]] classic song "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]". At this concert the power generator failed, it was said because the operator had fallen asleep stoned and neglected to refill the fuel - forcing Drummer [[Preston Heyman]] to perform a 20-minute un-amplified solo with the audience accompanying banging beer cans and chanting while the situation was rectified.&lt;ref&gt;Preston Heyman&lt;/ref&gt; He would release two more solo albums during the decade.

In December 1982, the original Spirit line-up re-formed and recorded several songs from their first four albums (as well as a few new tracks) live on a soundstage. Though the album Spirit of '84 was initially recorded for an audiophile label, Mercury Records re-signed the band (and gave California a solo deal) and released the album in 1984. The album was only a moderate success. Some of the original members went to do other projects, but California and Cassidy continued touring with new members Scott Monahan on keyboards and Dave Waterbury on bass.

California headed to England and recorded his third solo album, the contemporary hard rock ''Restless'' for which his friend British Drummer  [[Preston Heyman]] (who played on the track "Jack Rabbit") secured a deal with Phonogram for in late 1985. Following a few live dates in England, California returned to the United States and resumed touring extensively with Cassidy, Monahan, and Waterbury. There was one more solo album from California: a collection of material entitled ''Shattered Dreams'' that was released in 1986.

==Death==
California drowned in the Pacific Ocean in 1997 at the age of 45 while rescuing his 12-year-old son Quinn from a [[rip current]] near the home of his mother, Bernice Pearl, at [[Molokai]], Hawaii. He managed to push Quinn (who survived) toward the shore.&lt;ref name="obit-independent"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Independent]] | title = Obituary: Randy California | date = January 17, 1997 | last = Perrone | first = Pierre | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-randy-california-1283572.html | accessdate = 2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Randy Craig Wolfe Trust was established after his death and, using royalties from California's recording contracts, financially supports the Randy California Project, an after-school music education program for underprivileged elementary school children in Ventura County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean Cowden Moore |url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/education/elementary-school-band-is-rock-musicians-legacy |title=Elementary school band is rock musician's legacy |publisher=vcstar.com |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College football career==
Wells played football at [[Furman University]], playing fullback and wide receiver. He was a member of the 1988 [[NCAA]] [[Division I-AA]] national championship team.&lt;ref name="Wells bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robby Wells|url=http://ssuathletics.com/coaches.aspx?rc=1&amp;path=football|accessdate=May 29, 2017|publisher=Savannah State Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Wells coached football from 1990 to 2009. He began his career as an assistant coach at Greer (S.C.) High School (1990–1995). He served as head coach at C.E. Murray High School Greeleyville, SC (1995–1997).&lt;ref name="Wells bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newera"&gt;{{cite web|title=SSU football starts 'new era'|url=http://new.savannahnow.com/node/420252|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=2007-12-26}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to the [[University of South Carolina]]  as a graduate assistant for four seasons.  Wells worked with the defensive backs (1998-1999) and middle linebackers (2000).  Wells was fired by Head Football Coach [[Lou Holtz]] for meeting with Clemson Assistant Coach [[Brad Scott (American football)|Brad Scott]]. It was alleged that Wells shared the Gamecock playbook with Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thalji|first=Jamal|title=USC fires assistant after talk with rival|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/122800/news_pf/Sports/USC_fires_assistant_a.shtml|newspaper=St Petersburg Times|date=December 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells moved on to become the defensive coordinator at [[South Carolina State University]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="Wells bio" /&gt; As the Bulldog's defensive coordinator (2002–2005) Wells' defense attained numerous national rankings and a [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] championship (2004).&lt;ref name="Wells bio" /&gt;

In 2006, Wells was hired as the General Manager for the [[Augusta Spartans]] Arena Football Team where his duties included coaching, player personnel decisions, player development, team travel, fund raising and media relations.&lt;ref name="Wells bio" /&gt;

===Savannah State===
Wells was hired as head football coach on {{Start date|2007|12|22}}. In his first season as head coach, the team saw as many victories as the previous four seasons combined. Wells resigned his position on January 28, 2010 citing personal reasons. He subsequently filed a lawsuit against SSU for [[reverse discrimination]], alleging that his resignation as head coach was forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssuathletics.com/news/2010/1/28/GEN_0128101610.aspx|title=Wells resigns as SSU head football coach|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-28|publisher=Savannah State University|work=SSUAthletics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was settled in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://savannahnow.com/sports/2011-11-18/coachs-lawsuit-against-ssu-settled#.Ts3rgexLWnA | title=Coach's lawsuit against SSU settled | work=[[Savannah Morning News]] | date=November 18, 2011 | accessdate=November 24, 2011 | author=Jones, Walter | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115054726/http://savannahnow.com/sports/2011-11-18/coachs-lawsuit-against-ssu-settled#.Ts3rgexLWnA | archive-date=November 15, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="240k settlement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.savannahnow.com/sports/2011-11-30/robby-wells-receives-240000-settlement-ssu | title=Robby Wells receives $240,000 in settlement with SSU | work=[[Savannah Morning News]] | date=Nov 30, 2011 | accessdate=December 3, 2013 | author=Heath, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 presidential candidacy==
On November 21, 2011, Wells announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 general election]].&lt;ref name=running/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/29813383/detail.html | title=Charlotte man plans to run for President in 2012 | work=[[WSOC-TV]] | date=November 19, 2011 | accessdate=November 22, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220064734/http://www.wsoctv.com/news/29813383/detail.html | archive-date=December 20, 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially stated that he would run as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]], saying "Our party system is broken.

General '''Rodolfo Fierro''' (1880 – 14 October 1915)&lt;ref name="Leñero89"&gt;{{cite book|title=El infierno: Parafrasis de "El infierno," primera parte de la Divina comedia de Dante Alighieri |page=144 |year=1989 |publisher=UNAM |isbn=968-36-1058-7 |first=Vicente |last=Leñero|authorlink=Vicente Leñero}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[railway]] worker, railway superintendent, federal soldier and a [[major general]] in the army of [[Pancho Villa]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the {{lang|es|[[Division del Norte]]}}. Fierro and his counterpart and fellow lieutenant, [[Tomas Urbina]], have been cited as the two halves of Pancho Villa, Fierro representing his malicious side.&lt;ref name="Katz98"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Pancho Villa |first=Friedrich |last=Katz|authorlink=Friedrich Katz |pages=221, 269–272, 328–329 |year=1998 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=0-8047-3046-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed Fierro met Pancho Villa in 1913 following the [[Francisco_I._Madero#The_Revolution|Madero revolution]]. Originating from [[Sinaloa]], Fierro was a former federal officer having taken part in fighting against the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui Indians]]. Following his role as a federal officer, Fierro went on to work as a railway man, eventually being absorbed into Villa's ranks.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt;

==Roles==

===Soldier===
Fierro's prominence is often cited back to the [[Battle of Tierra Blanca]] on 23 November 1913. The battle included 5,500 of Villa's soldiers, against an estimated 7,000 federal soldiers. Before the battle began Fierro had been sent South to destroy the railroad tracks, forcing the federal soldiers to halt. As Villa flanked the well armed federal soldiers with [[cavalry]], a [[locomotive]] filled with [[dynamite]] and [[percussion caps]] was rammed into the federal soldiers train cars, the resulting explosion caused the federal soldiers to flee to nearby undamaged train cars in retreat. Fierro is then noted as riding on horseback after the escaping locomotive, climbing on to the locomotive, running across the roofs of the train cars, and shooting dead the [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] and [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]], pulling the train to a complete stop.&lt;ref name="Durschmied02"&gt;{{cite book|title=Blood of Revolution: From the Reign of Terror to the Rise of Khomeini |first=Erik |last=Durschmied |pages=100, 102, 111 |year=2002 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |isbn=1-55970-607-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; All federal soldiers captured were executed and in the battle Villa captured 4 locomotives, 7 [[machine guns]], horses, rifles and 400,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The death toll during the battle stood around 1,000 federal soldiers killed and 300 of Villa's.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight90"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution |first=Alan |last=Knight |pages=117, 336 |year=1990 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-7771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executioner===
[[File:Fierro Pancho Villa Ortega Medina.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|General Rodolfo Fierro third from the left, then Villa]]

Fierro is most known as Villa's executioner, known as {{lang|es|el carnicero}} ({{lang-en|the butcher}}).&lt;ref name="Rubenstein04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Greed, Rage, and Love Gone Wrong: Murder in Minnesota |first=Bruce |last=Rubenstein |pages=157 |year=2004 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-4338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauze97"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mexico: Biography of Power : a History of Modern Mexico, 1810-1996 |first=Enrique |last=Krauze |authorlink=Enrique Krauze|author2=Hank Heifetz  |year=1997 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=0-06-092917-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1930 novel ''El águila y la serpiente'' by [[Martín Luis Guzmán]] gives Fierro his [[pseudonym#Military and paramilitary organizations|nom de guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;Martín Luis Guzmán, ''El águila y la serpiente'' (1930), Mexico City: Editorial Porrúa 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Guzmán describes events following the capture of over 300 [[Orozquistas]] soldiers, followers of [[Pascual Orozco]]. The captured soldiers were led into a large field with Fierro on one end, and a wall on the other. They were informed, if they were to reach the opposite end and climb over the wall they would be allowed to continue on free. In groups of ten the captured men were set out to run, Fierro alone firing his pistol at them as they ran, his soldiers handing him fresh pistols to continue firing without delay. One captive is noted as making it over the wall and to freedom, only after Fierro stopped to massage an achy trigger finger.The shooting went on for two hours.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Durschmied02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauze97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rummel94"&gt;{{cite book|title=Death by Government |first=Rudolph J. |last=Rummel |pages=391 |year=1994 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=1-56000-927-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welsome07"&gt;{{cite book|title=The General and the Jaguar: Pershing's Hunt for Pancho Villa: A True Story of Revolution and Revenge |first=Eileen |last=Welsome |pages=10, 39 |year=2007 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-2224-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another account recounts that Fierro would ask each prisoner if they would rather return to their family, or join the army of Pancho Villa. Those deciding to return to their family were seen as men who would head back to their old regiment and were executed. Those choosing to join Pancho Villa were provided with a horse, a gun, and three bullets.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein04"/&gt;

Other stories exist of Fierro shooting a man dead in public in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. The person, sitting across from Fierro, argued that a man shot would fall backwards, Fierro disagreed. To settle the bet Fierro shot the man, and watched as he fell forward, confirming to Fierro that he was correct.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt; A similar story is told by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]]:&lt;ref&gt;Insurgent Mexico, part 4, chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; outside the theater of [[Durango]], a drunken man asked Fierro what time it was; Fierro said: "You! How dare you speak to me before I speak to you first-" and shot him dead.

While working as Villa's railway superintendent, Fierro was publicly reprimanded by Villa for a train of supply water running 35 minutes late. Fierro, when the train arrived is said to have shot the conductor dead as an act of vengeance for his humiliation. This incident sparked strife amongst the railway workers, who primarily supported Villa. In another incident, a drunken Fierro killed a railway worker for bumping into him, this final incident caused Villa to act. Villa permitted a judge to begin collecting evidence against Fierro into his actions, a judge who begged to be removed from the case for fear of repercussion. The case never went to trial but Fierro was removed from the position of railway superintendent. It is often stated the case was a sham, simply to continue to retain support from the much needed railway workers.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt;

Fierro is also known for the murder of William Benton on 17 February 1914, an Englishman and land owner in Mexico who had his land confiscated by Villa's forces. Numerous stories exist around what happened. Benton is cited as having stormed into Villa's headquarters in [[Ciudad Juárez]], demanding his land back from Villa, in which Villa refused. Following his refusal, Villa maintains Benton unsuccessfully attempted to draw a six-shooter [[pistol]], he was wrestled to the floor and given a formal [[court martial]] and found guilty of attempted [[assassination]], he was then executed and buried. A conflicting story exists in which Benton drew his pistol but was detained and removed from the town at night. He was taken to the desert, where a hole was dug and Fierro is believed to have struck Benton in the head with a shovel, dumping him into the grave without checking to see if Benton was still alive.&lt;ref name="Katz98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris99"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company |first=Roy |last=Morris |author2=Roy Morris Jr.  |pages=257 |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-512628-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker98"&gt;{{cite book|title=Legends and Lies: Great Mysteries of the American West |first=Dale L. |last=Walker |author2=John Jakes  |pages=198 |year=1998 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-312-86848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheina04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Villa: Soldier of the Mexican Revolution |first=Robert L. |last=Scheina |pages=63, 23 |year=2004 |publisher=Brassey's |isbn=1-57488-513-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commander===
On 15 January 1915, Villa turned over command of the western forces to Fierro and Calixto Contreras. The decision was made following the election of [[Roque González Garza]] by the Mexico City Convention. Fierro and Contreras were defeated following being put in command. In [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] on 17 January 1915, Fierro's forces were surprised by an attack and forced to flee to [[Irapuato, Guanajuato]]. Villa was forced to pull troops from [[Mexico City]] to North West Mexico to assist Fierro and Contreras. With the larger number of forces, (11,000 soldiers strong), Villa was able to take Guadalajara without a fight, Villa pursued but was repelled, after sustaining heavy casualties, he ordered a withdrawal moving himself and a large force of soldiers from the area. Fierro was again in charge of the west, and on March 22, attacked a well dug-in force at [[Tuxpan, Veracruz]]. Fierro was again defeated, losing two thousand men and eight hundred horses, the loss forced him to abandon Guadalajara as well.&lt;ref name="Scheina04" /&gt;

==Death==
On 14 October 1915, Fierro died after being thrown from his horse and landing in [[quicksand]]. At the time, Fierro was marching toward Sonora when he encountered the quicksand at the Casas Grandes Lagoon. The weight of his belt, loaded with gold coins and material is said to have prevented him from being able to escape.&lt;ref name="Durschmied02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welsome07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shorris04"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Times of Mexico |first=Earl |last=Shorris |year=2004 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0-393-05926-X |pages=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Villa Rides]]'' (1968), Fierro was portrayed by [[Charles Bronson]].

== In books ==
''The Friends of Pancho Villa'' ([[Berkley Books|Berkeley]]: New York, 1996), a novel by [[James Carlos Blake]]. Fierro is the narrator of the novel. Fierro also appears in Blake's novel ''Under the Skin'' as the father of the novel's protagonist, Jimmy Youngblood.

'''Saint Anne''', of [[David]]'s house and line, was the mother of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and grandmother of [[Jesus]] according to apocryphal [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic tradition. Mary's mother is not named in the [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|canonical gospels]], but is mentioned  as the daughter of Faqud in [[Mary in Islam|Quran.]] In writing, Anne's name and that of her husband [[Joachim]] come only from [[New Testament apocrypha]], of which the [[Gospel of James]] (written perhaps around 150) seems to be the earliest that mentions them.

==Church tradition==
The story bears a similarity to that of the birth of [[Samuel]], whose mother [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] ({{lang-he|{{hebrew|חַנָּה}}}} ''Ḥannāh'' "favour, grace"; etymologically the same name as Anne) had also been childless. Although Anne receives little attention in the [[Latin Church]] prior to the late [[12th century]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

dedications to Anne in [[Eastern Christianity]] occur as early as the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius' Buildings, Volume I, Chapters 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches, she is revered as Hannah. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Hannah is ascribed the title ''Forebear of God'', and both the [[Nativity of Mary]] and the [[Presentation of Mary]] are celebrated as two of the twelve [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church]]. The Dormition of Hannah is also a minor feast in Eastern Christianity. In [[Lutheran]] [[Protestantism]], it is held that [[Martin Luther]] chose to enter religious life as an [[Augustinians|Augustinian friar]] after crying out to St. Anne while endangered by lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Luther — Our Spiritual Guide|url=http://elcic.ca/What-We-Believe/Martin-Luther.cfm|work=Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada website|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brecht1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brecht|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Brecht|title=Martin Luther: His road to Reformation, 1483–1521|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hH6nI6Q6qBIC&amp;pg=PA48|year=1985|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-1414-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
Anne ([[Arabic]]: حنة ''Ḥannah'') is also revered in [[Islam]], recognised as a highly spiritual woman and as the mother of Mary. The Qur'an describes her as the daughter of Faqud who remained childless until her old age. One day, Hannah saw a bird feeding its young while sitting in the shade of a tree, which awakened her desire to have children of her own. She prayed for a child and eventually conceived; her husband, [[Joachim#In Islam|Imran]], died before the child was born. Expecting the child to be male, Hannah vowed to dedicate him to isolation and service in the [[Second Temple]].&lt;ref group="N"&gt;"O my Lord! I do dedicate into Thee what is in my womb for Thy special service: So accept this of me: For Thou hearest and knowest all things." (Qur'an 3:35).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite book

However, Hannah bore a daughter instead, and named her Mary. Her words upon delivering Mary reflect her status as a great [[mysticism|mystic]], realising that while she had wanted a son, this daughter was God's gift to her:&lt;ref name="Wheeler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DaCosta"/&gt;{{quote|Then, when she brought forth she said: My Lord! Truly, I brought her forth, a female. And God is greater in knowledge of what she brought forth. And the male is not like the female. [...] So her Lord received her with the very best acceptance. And her bringing forth caused the very best to develop in her.{{cite quran|3|36|end=37|t=[[Laleh Bakhtiar]]}}}}

==Beliefs==
[[File:Saint Anne et Marie enfant.JPG|thumb|Saint Anne with Mary as a child.]]

Although the [[Biblical canon#Christian biblical canons|canonical books of the New Testament]] never mention the mother of the Virgin Mary, traditions about her family, childhood, education, and eventual betrothal to Joseph developed very early in the history of the church. The oldest and most influential source for these is the apocryphal ''Gospel of James'', first written in Greek around the middle of the second century. In the West, the ''Gospel of James'' fell under a cloud in the fourth and fifth centuries when it was accused of "absurdities" by [[Jerome]] and condemned as untrustworthy by [[Pope Damasus I]], [[Pope Innocent I]], and [[Pope Gelasius I]].&lt;ref name=reames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/44sr.htm |title=Reames, Sherry L. ed.,"Legends of St. Anne, Mother of the Virgin Mary: Introduction", '&amp;#39;Middle English Legends of Women Saints'&amp;#39;, Medieval Institute Publications, Kalamazoo, Michigan, 2003 |publisher=Lib.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient belief, attested to by a sermon of [[John of Damascus]], was that Anne married once. In late medieval times, legend held that Anne was married three times first to Joachim, then to [[Clopas]] and finally to a man named Solomas and that each marriage produced one daughter: Mary, mother of Jesus, [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Salome (disciple)|Mary Salomæ]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden267.htm |title=Golden Legend II.131 |publisher=Catholic-forum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605122050/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/golden267.htm |archivedate=June 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister of Saint Anne was [[Sobe (sister of Saint Anne)|Sobe]], mother of [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]].

Similarly, in the [[4th century]] and then much later in the [[15th century]], a belief arose that Mary was born of Anne by virgin birth, preserving Anne's body and soul intact as distinct from the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] that preserved her daughter's body and soul intact and sinless from the first moment of existence.&lt;ref name=holweck/&gt; Adherents included the 16th-century Lutheran mystic [[Valentin Weigel]], who claimed Anne conceived Mary by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] rather than conventional conjugal relations. This belief was condemned as an error by the Catholic Church in 1677. In the fifteenth century, the Catholic cleric [[Johann Eck]] related in a sermon that St Anne's parents were named Stollanus and [[Emerentia]]. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1907) regards this genealogy as spurious.&lt;ref name=holweck&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01538a.htm |title=Holweck, Frederick. "St. Anne." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 3 May 2013 "The renowned Father John of Eck of Ingolstadt, in a sermon on St. Anne (published at Paris in 1579), pretends to know even the names of the parents St. Anne. He calls them Stollanus and Emerentia. He says that St. Anne was born after Stollanus and Emerentia had been childless for twenty years" |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
In the Eastern church, the cult of Anne herself may go back as far as c. 550, when Justinian built a church in Constantinople in her honor. 

The earliest pictorial sign of her veneration in the West is an 8th-century fresco in the church of Santa Maria Antiqua, Rome.&lt;ref name="reames" /&gt; 

Virginia Nixon sees an economic incentive in the local promotion of the cult of St. Anne in order to attract pilgrims. The identification of Sepphoris as the birthplace of Mary may reflect competition with a similar site in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Nixon, p. 13}}
A shrine at Douai, in northern France, was one of the early centers of devotion to St. Anne in the West.&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ANNE.HTM |title=Lives of Saints, John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two well-known shrines to St. Anne are that of [[Sainte-Anne-d'Auray|Ste. Anne d'Auray]] in Brittany, France; and that of [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré|Ste. Anne de Beaupré]] near the city of Québec. The number of visitors to the Basilica of Ste. Anne de Beaupré is greatest on St Anne's Feast Day, 26 July, and the Sunday before Nativity of the Virgin Mary, 8 September. In 1892, Pope Leo XIII sent a relic of St Anne to the church.&lt;ref name=ottawa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olomc-ottawa.com/Anne&amp;Joachim.html |title=Saint Anne and Saint Joachim, Our Lady of Mt.

In the [[Maltese language]], the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] is called ''It-Triq ta' Sant'Anna'', literally ''"The Way of St. Anne"''.&lt;ref name="malt_TheM"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Milky Way Project – It-Triq ta' Sant'Anna {{!}} What is the Milky Way?| work = maltastro.org| accessdate = 2015-11-02| url = http://www.maltastro.org/milkyway/?page_id=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Imperial Russia, the [[Order of St Anna|Order of St Anne]] was one of the leading state decorations.

===Relics===

The supposed relics of St. Anne were brought from the Holy Land to Constantinople in 710 and were kept there in the church of St. Sophia as late as 1333.&lt;ref name="holweck" /&gt; 

During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, returning crusaders and pilgrims from the East brought relics of Anne to a number of churches, including most famously those at Apt, in Provence, Ghent, and Chartres.&lt;ref name="reames" /&gt; St. Anne's relics have been traditionally preserved and venerated in the many cathedrals and monasteries dedicated to her name, for example in [[St. Anne's Church, Vienna|Austria]], Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shrinesaintanne.org/eng/2_5_relics.htm |title=Arm Reliquary Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré Shrine, Quebec |publisher=Shrinesaintanne.org |date=1960-07-03 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508054442/http://www.shrinesaintanne.org/eng/2_5_relics.htm |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/faszination-welterbe/5059266513/ |title=Flickr photograph of the so-called 'speaking reliquary' (tells the pilgrim what is venerated) |language=German |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greece in Holy Mount and the city of Katerini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bender |url=http://vita-nostra-in-ecclesia.blogspot.com/2010/07/feast-of-joachim-and-anne.html |title=Arm relic Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls&amp;#124;Papal Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls |publisher=Vita-nostra-in-ecclesia.blogspot.com |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval and baroque craftsmenship is evidenced in the striking metalwork of the life-size reliquaries containing the bones of her forearm for example. Examples employing folk art techniques are also known.

[[Düren]] has been the main place of pilgrimage for Anne since 1506, when [[Pope Julius II]] decreed that her relics should be kept there.

==Patronage==
The Church of Saint Anne in [[Beit Guvrin National Park]] was built by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] and the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the [[12th century]], known in Arabic as Khirbet (lit. "ruin") Sandahanna, the mound of Maresha being called Tell Sandahanna.

[[File:Basilique Saint-Anne.JPG|thumb|[[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], [[Quebec]], Canada.]]
Saint Anne is patroness of unmarried women, housewives, women in labor or who want to be pregnant, grandmothers, educators and teachers. She is also a patroness of horseback riders, cabinet-makers&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt; and miners. As the mother of Mary, this devotion to Saint Anne as the patron of miners arises from the medieval comparison between Mary and Christ and the precious metals silver and gold. Anne's womb was considered the source from which these precious metals were mined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/courses/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/text_links/st_anne.html |title=Butler, Alban. ed.

She is also the [[patron saint]] of: [[Brittany]] ([[France]]), [[Chinandega]] ([[Nicaragua]]), the [[Mi'kmaq]] people of [[Canada]], [[Castelbuono]] (Sicily), [[Quebec]] ([[Canada]]), [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] ([[California]]), [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] ([[Connecticut]]), [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] ([[Michigan]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aod.org/patronsaint/ |title=St. Anne – Archdiocese of Detroit |publisher=Aod.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adjuntas, Puerto Rico|Adjuntas]] ([[Puerto Rico]]), [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] and [[Jucuarán]] ([[El Salvador]]), [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]] ([[New Hampshire]]), [[Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Ana Pueblo]], [[Seama, New Mexico|Seama]], and [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] ([[New Mexico]]), [[Chiclana de la Frontera]], [[Marsaskala]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] and [[Fasnia]] ([[Spain]]),Town of Sta Ana Province of Pampanga,  [[Hagonoy, Bulacan|Hagonoy]], Santa Ana, [[Taguig City]], Saint Anne Shrine, Malicboy, [[Pagbilao]] and [[Quezon]] ([[Philippines]]), [[Santana (district of São Paulo)|Santana]] ([[Brazil]]), [[Saint Anne, Illinois|Saint Anne]] ([[Illinois]]), Sainte Anne Island, [[Baie Sainte Anne]] and [[Praslin Island]] ([[Seychelles]]), [[Bukit Mertajam]] and [[Port Klang]] ([[Malaysia]]), Kľúčové ([[Slovakia]]) and [[South Vietnam]]. The [[parish church]] of [[Vatican City]] is [[Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri]]. There is a shrine dedicated to Saint Anne in the Woods in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom.

==In art==

===''Christ in the House of His Parents''===
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1849–50]]
In [[John Everett Millais]]'s 1849–50 work, ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'',
Anne is shown in her son-in-law [[Saint Joseph|Joseph's]] carpentry shop caring for a young Jesus who had cut his hand on a nail. She joins her daughter [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and a young boy who will later become known as [[John the Baptist]] in caring for the injured hand of Jesus.

===Iconography===
The subject of Joachim and Anne ''[[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|The Meeting at the Golden Gate]]'' was a regular component of artistic cycles of the [[Life of the Virgin]]. The couple meet at the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] of [[Jerusalem]] and embrace. They are aware of Anne's pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an [[archangel]]. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the Immaculate Conception. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here. 

Her emblem is a door.&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt;

Anne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.

===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===
The role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]. Another typical subject has Anne teaching the Virgin Mary the Scriptures (see gallery below).

'''Sara Taylor Fagen''' (born September 15, 1974, in [[Dubuque, Iowa]]) is a technology and data entrepreneur, and former staff member in the administration of President [[George W. Bush]].

==White House Career==
In April 1999, Fagen began working for the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|presidential campaign of George Bush]]. Her initial position, through January 2000, was coalitions director for Bush's Iowa caucus campaign. She then did field work in the South Carolina, Virginia, Washington, and Illinois primaries, and finally served as executive director of the Michigan campaign. After Bush was elected, Fagen worked for the White House as an associate political director (Midwest) doing political and public affairs outreach.&lt;ref name="Long Road"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appleman"/&gt;

Fagen became the deputy to Matthew Dowd, Chief Strategist for the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election campaign. Sara earned her reputation as one of the nation's leading political and issue campaign strategists, serving as a senior aide and White House Political Director for President George W. Bush, and playing a pivotal part in the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. During the campaign, The Wall Street Journal called her a "data whiz," and said: "As a top strategist for the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election efforts Fagen helped perfect political micro-targeting." She also served as a senior strategist helping to direct the President's message development, paid media strategy, and opinion research.

After Bush's 2004 re-election, Fagen returned to work in the White House, where she served as the director of the White House Office of Political Affairs and deputy assistant to President George W. Bush.  She left for the private sector in May 2007.

===Dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy===
{{main|Dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy}}
On  June 13, 2007, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate]] and [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House judiciary committees]] issued a [[subpoena]] to Taylor, to produce documents and testify before the committee. A subpoena was also issued to [[Harriet E. Miers]], former White House counsel and supreme court nominee. In response to the subpoenas, the White House said that its longstanding policy was that no past or present White House officials would be permitted to testify under oath before the panels, and that only private, non-legally-binding, non-transcribed interviews would be permitted.

The Democratic chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees said that the White House terms were unacceptable.&lt;ref name='NYT-Stout-2007-06-13'&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Stout | coauthors= | title=Congress Subpoenas Miers and Another Former Bush Aide | date=June 13, 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/washington/13cnd-attorneys.html?hp | work =New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee, [[Arlen Specter]] (R-PA) said that the White House had not responded to an April 11, 2007, inquiry by the committee, and he supported the issuance of the subpoena in light of the lack of response by the White House and Taylor. On July 9, 2007, White House counsel [[Fred F. Fielding|Fred Fielding]], in letters to Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) and Representative [[John Conyers]] (D-MI) said President Bush is invoking [[executive privilege]] and not allowing Taylor to [[Congressional testimony|testify]], but reiterated that Taylor was available for a private, [[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]] interview.&lt;ref name='Hill-Marre-2007-06-13'&gt;{{cite news | first=Klaus | last=Marre | title=Specter endorses subpoena of White House official | date=June 13, 2007 | url =http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/specter-agrees-with-issuing-subpoena-2007-06-13.html | work =The Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
In 2008, Fagen founded a media firm, BlueFront Strategies, as a strategic consulting and public affairs company to focus on issue advocacy and solutions for business. In mid-2009, Fagen co-founded, with public affairs veteran John Brady, the company Resonate Networks, an advertising firm that uses data on political leanings and attitudes to help companies and interest groups sell online ads.

Fagen became a partner at DDC Advocacy in 2011 after the company acquired Bluefront Strategies.  In 2013, Fagen, along with the partners of TargetPoint Consulting, formed Deep Root Analytics, a media analytics company that helps clients use big data to improve ad buying decisions. Fagen also sits on the board of CentraForce. Fagen's commentary appears on [[CNBC]], where she is regular contributor.

===Deep Root Analytics===
In 2013, Fagen and Target Point Consulting partners founded Deep Root Analytics, a media analytics company that helps clients use big data to make ad buying decisions. They aim to improve [[microtargeting]] by providing better web-enabled media targeting. In June 2017 cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery discovered Deep Root's data on an unsecure Amazon server, which exposed political data on more than 198 million American citizens.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"&gt;{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619212634/http://gizmodo.com/gop-data-firm-accidentally-leaks-personal-details-of-ne-1796211612 |archive-date=June 19, 2017 |publisher=''[[Gizmodo]]'' |title=GOP Data Firm Accidentally Leaks Personal Details of Nearly 200 Million American Voters |url=https://gizmodo.com/gop-data-firm-accidentally-leaks-personal-details-of-ne-1796211612 |first=Dell |last=Cameron |first2=Kate |last2=Conger |date=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of the data included [[American Crossroads]], the [[Kantar Group]] and [[Controversial Reddit communities#FatPeopleHate|r/FatPeopleHate]], among other subreddits.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo"/&gt;

==Education and early career==
Fagen graduated from [[Wahlert High School]], a private, co-educational, Roman Catholic school in [[Dubuque, Iowa]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=178463 |date=October 29, 2007 |title=Dubuque native found herself in the spotlight of a political controversy |author=Mary Rae Bragg |work=Telegraph Herald }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; She then attended [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].

'''Scott Lee Peterson'''&lt;ref name=SLP/&gt; (born October 24, 1972) is an [[United States|American]] former fertilizer salesman who is currently on [[death row]] in [[San Quentin State Prison]]. In 2004, he was convicted of the first-degree [[murder]] of his pregnant wife, [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]], and the second-degree murder of their unborn son, Conner, in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], [[California]].

In 2005, he was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[lethal injection]]. His case is currently on appeal to the [[Supreme Court of California]].

==Early life and marriage==
Scott Lee Peterson was born October 24, 1972, at [[Sharp Coronado Hospital]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]], to Lee Arthur Peterson, a businessman who owned a crate-packaging company, and Jacqueline "Jackie" Helen Latham,&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04&gt;St. John, Kelly.

Retrieved September 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; who owned a boutique in [[La Jolla]] called The Put On.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; Though Lee and Jackie had six children from previous relationships, Scott was their only child together.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biography.com/&gt; As a child, he shared a bedroom with his half-brother John in the family's two-bedroom apartment in La Jolla.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;

Peterson began playing [[golf]] at an early age, a result of time he spent with his father. By age 14, he could beat his father at the game. For a time, he had dreams of becoming a professional golfer like [[Phil Mickelson]], his teammate at the [[University of San Diego High School]].&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; By the end of high school, he was one of the top junior golfers in San Diego.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; In 1990, Peterson enrolled at [[Arizona State University]] (where Mickelson had also enrolled) on a partial golf scholarship.&lt;ref name=PhoenixNewTimes&gt;Harris, Ashley (May 10, 2016).

''[[Phoenix New Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mickelson would go on to become a highly successful [[PGA Tour|PGA]] golfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.pga.com/pga/images/events/2005/pgachamp/pdf/totalpurse.pdf |title=The 87th PGA Championship |publisher=[[PGA of America]] |date=August 15, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Lee Peterson later testifying that his son was discouraged by the considerable competition that Mickelson presented at Arizona State. Randall Mell of the [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], [[Florida]] ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' reported that Chip Couch, the father of [[University of Florida]] golfer [[Chris Couch]], had gotten Peterson kicked off the golf team after giving Chris a [[hangover]] following a night of partying. Peterson transferred to [[Cuesta College]] in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], and later, [[California Polytechnic State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Stapley, Garth (March 6, 2007). [http://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/peterson-after-the-trial/article3097028.html "Man claims he got Scott Peterson thrown off the golf team"]. ''[[The Modesto Bee]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He initially planned to major in international business, but changed his major to [[agribusiness|agricultural business]]. Professors who taught Peterson described him as a model student. His agribusiness professor, Jim Ahern, commented, "I wouldn't mind having a class full of Scott Petersons."&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;

While at Cal Poly, Peterson worked at a restaurant in [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] called the Pacific Café. One of his co-workers would receive visits from a neighbor named Laci Denise Rocha, who also attended Cal Poly&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;&lt;ref name=ModestoBee/&gt; as an ornamental horticulture major.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; When Peterson and his future wife first met at the restaurant in mid-1994, Laci made the first move, sending him her phone number. Immediately after meeting him, Laci told her mother that she had met the man that she would marry. Peterson later called Laci and they began dating, their first date being a deep-sea fishing trip on which Laci got seasick.&lt;ref name=ModestoBee&gt;[http://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/peterson-disappearance-and-arrest/article3096758.html "The woman behind the smile"]. ''The Modesto Bee''. April 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As Peterson's relationship with Laci grew more serious, he put aside his dreams of professional golf in order to focus on a business path.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; The couple dated for two years&lt;ref name=ModestoBee/&gt; and eventually moved in together.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; In 1997, after Laci graduated, they married at [[Sycamore Mineral Springs Resort]] in [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]'s Avila Valley.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;&lt;ref name=PhoenixNewTimes/&gt; While Peterson finished his senior year, Laci took a job in nearby [[Prunedale, California|Prunedale]]. Prosecutors have stated that around this time, Peterson engaged in the first of at least two [[extramarital affair]]s, though they have not revealed a name or details of each relationship.

Peterson graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in agricultural business in June 1998.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; After their graduations, the Petersons opened a [[sports bar]] in San Luis Obispo called The Shack.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ModestoBee/&gt; Contrary to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' story that reported that Peterson's parents loaned him money to open the establishment,&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; his parents emphatically told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that they did not, believing it was a bad investment. When the couple had difficulty finding a technician to install a needed vent in the restaurant, Peterson took the necessary certification course in [[Los Angeles]] in order to install it himself. Business was initially slow, but eventually improved, especially on weekends.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt; The Petersons sold The Shack in 2000 when they moved to Laci's hometown of [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] to start a family.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ModestoBee/&gt; In October 2000, they purchased a three-bedroom, two-bath bungalow house for $177,000 on Covena Avenue in an upscale neighborhood near [[La Loma Park]].&lt;ref name=SFChronicle3.7.04/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

Laci soon took a part-time job as a substitute teacher,&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; and Peterson got a job with Tradecorp U.S.A., a newly founded subsidiary of a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[fertilizer]] company.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle8.3.04&gt;Walsh, Diana (August 3, 2004). [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/THE-PETERSON-TRIAL-Credit-card-debt-takes-2736606.php "THE PETERSON TRIAL / Credit-card debt takes center stage / Couple appeared to be living beyond means, says auditor"]. ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lee Peterson, the Spanish company was trying to establish a customer base in the U.S., and hired Scott as their [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] representative. Working on salary plus commission, Peterson sold fertilizer, [[irrigation]] systems, chemical nutrients, and related products to big farms and flower growers, primarily in California, [[Arizona]], and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; He was earning a salary of $5,000 a month before taxes.&lt;ref name=SFChronicle8.3.04/&gt; Laci's loved ones, including her mother and younger sister, related that she worked enthusiastically at being the perfect housewife, enjoying cooking and entertaining, and that she and her family welcomed the news in 2002 that she was pregnant.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; In November 2002, when Laci was seven months pregnant, Peterson was introduced by a friend to a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] massage therapist named Amber Frey. In later public statements, Frey said Peterson told her he was single, and the two began a romantic relationship. The last time Peterson's parents saw Laci was during a three-day weekend they spent together in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the week before [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=SFChronicle8.3.04/&gt;

==Disappearance of Laci Peterson==
{{Main|Murder of Laci Peterson}}
On December 24, 2002, Laci's parents, Dennis Robert Rocha and Sharon Ruth Anderson, reported Laci [[missing person|missing]] from their Modesto home. She was seven-and-a-half months pregnant at the time, with a due date of February 10, 2003. The couple had planned to name the baby boy Conner. The exact date and cause of Laci's death were never determined. Peterson initially reported her missing on [[Christmas Eve]], and the story quickly attracted nationwide media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/468/000026390|title=Scott Peterson|publisher=Notable Names Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4008491.stm|title=US beach bodies killer convicted|publisher=BBC News|date=November 12, 2004|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modesto detectives Jon Buehler and Allen Brocchini, the lead investigators on the case, questioned Peterson the day he reported Laci missing. Peterson stated that he had been out on his boat at the [[Berkeley Marina]] in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] to go fishing, about 90 miles from their Modesto home. Detectives immediately launched a search, but were surprised by Peterson's behavior. Buehler later told [[ABC News]] that, "I suspected Scott when I first met him. Didn't mean he did it, but I was a little bit thrown off by his calm, cool demeanor and his lack of questioning ... he wasn't, 'Will you call me back? Can I have one of your cards? What are you guys doing now?'"&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;Effron, Lauren (September 12, 2017). [http://abcnews.go.com/US/police-found-scott-petersons-car-laci-petersons-body/story?id=49773987 "What police found in Scott Peterson's car after Laci Peterson's body was discovered"]. [[ABC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Modesto police did not immediately reveal to the public that Peterson was a suspect, largely because Laci's family and friends maintained their faith in his innocence during the month following her disappearance. The police did treat the case as suspicious within the first few hours after the missing persons report was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kristal Hawkins

On January 17, 2003, it became known that Peterson had engaged in numerous affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/092704-pm_ctv.html|title=Before Amber Frey, two other affairs for him, detective says|last=Ryan|first=Harriet|date=September 28, 2004|publisher=[[Court TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328134354/http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/092704-pm_ctv.html|archive-date=March 28, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently with Amber Frey. She approached the police about Peterson, whom she had just begun to date, after learning that he was actually married to a missing woman. At this point, Laci's family announced that they had withdrawn their support of Peterson, later expressing anger that he had told Frey that he'd "lost his wife" on December 9, 2002—fourteen days before she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/110603_ctv.html|title=Detective: Peterson told lover he was a widower weeks before wife disappeared|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frey agreed to let the police tape her subsequent phone conversations with Peterson in the hopes of getting him to [[confession (law)|confess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/111203-pm_ctv.html|title=Detective: Peterson's mistress agreed to tape phone calls|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, the audio recordings of the couple's conversations were played, and the transcripts were publicized. The recordings revealed that in the days after Laci went missing, Peterson claimed to Frey that he had traveled to [[Paris]] to celebrate the holidays, in part with his new companions Pasqual and François. In reality, he had made one of these phone calls while attending the [[New Year's Eve]] [[candlelight vigil]] for Laci in Modesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laci Peterson Case: Scott Peterson's Ex-Mistress Testifies|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/11/court.archive.peterson5/index.html|accessdate=June 11, 2008|date=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery of remains of Laci and Conner==
On April 13, 2003, the remains of a late-term male fetus were found on Richmond's [[Point Isabel Regional Shoreline]], north of the marina where Peterson had been boating the day of Laci's disappearance. The next day, a partial female [[torso]] missing its hands, feet, and head was found in the same area. The bodies were identified as Laci and her fetus. [[Autopsy|Autopsies]] were performed, but due to [[decomposition]] the exact cause of death could not be determined. The medical examiner did note that she had suffered some broken ribs prior to her death; these injuries were not caused by her body being dragged along the rocks in the bay. Prosecutors suggested that she could have been suffocated or strangled in their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/110104_closings_ctv.html|title=In closing, prosecutor says parenthood pushed him to kill|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the bodies created a greater sense of urgency for Brocchini and Buehler, who had put a tracker on Peterson's car. Knowing that he was in San Diego at the time, they feared he would escape across the border to [[Mexico]]. Brocchini commented in 2017, "I just thought, 'We've got to find Scott right now. He told me he was there and that’s where the bodies come up? I mean, I believe it was premeditated, he planned it... San Diego was pretty darn close to the Mexican border. Scott knew the area pretty well. That's where his parents lived. That's where he lived. So it wasn't like he was going to have to get on [[MapQuest]] to try and figure out a way to get to [[Tijuana]]."&lt;ref name=ABCNews/&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Modesto Police Department (California)|Modesto Police Department]] performed [[Forensic science|forensic]] searches of Peterson's home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/13/local/me-peterson13 "Evidence at Peterson Home Is Revealed"]. [[Associated Press]]/''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. July 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI also conducted [[mitochondrial DNA]] testing on a hair from pliers found in Peterson's fishing boat that linked them with hairs recovered from Laci's hairbrush.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2005/july/shoe_bomb071805 "The Case of the Explosive Shoes: And Other Amazing Stories from the FBI Lab"].

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Peterson was arrested, police conducted further searches in the bay in an attempt to locate hand-made concrete [[anchor]]s they believe weighed down Laci's body while it was under water; nothing was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/05/23/peterson|title=Witness tells Scott Peterson's attorneys he saw suspicious man|publisher=CNN|date=May 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2003, Peterson was arraigned in [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus County]] Superior Court before Judge Nancy Ashley. He was charged with two [[felony]] counts of murder with premeditation and special circumstances: the first-degree [[murder]] of Laci, and the [[second-degree murder]] of Conner.

==Trial==
Before his arraignment, Peterson had been represented by Kirk McAllister, a veteran criminal defense attorney from Modesto. Chief Deputy [[Public Defender]] Kent Faulkner was also assigned to the case.&lt;ref name=Finz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/03/MN122043.DTL|title=L.A. attorney says client wants to vindicate himself by finding killer|last=Finz|first=Stacy|date=May 3, 2003|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson later indicated that he could afford a private attorney, namely [[Mark Geragos]], who had done other high-profile criminal defense work.&lt;ref name=Finz/&gt; On January 20, 2004, a judge changed the venue of the trial from Modesto to [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], because Peterson was the victim of increasing hostility in the Modesto area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,108939,00.html|title=Judge Moves Peterson Trial to San Mateo County|agency=Associated Press|date=January 20, 2004|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson's trial began on June 1, 2004,&lt;ref name=CNNFastFacts/&gt; and was followed closely by the media. The lead prosecutor was [[Rick Distaso]]. Geragos led Peterson's defense. Prosecution witness Frey engaged her own attorney, [[Gloria Allred]], to represent her. Allred was not bound by the [[gag order]] imposed on those involved in the trial. Although she maintained that her client had no opinion about whether Peterson was guilty, Allred was openly sympathetic to the prosecution. She appeared frequently on television news programs during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/talk/chat_transcripts/2004/0924peterson-allred.html|title=The Scott Peterson Murder Trial|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0311/13/lkl.00.html|title=Transcripts|publisher=CNN|date=November 13, 2003|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson's defense lawyers based their case on the lack of [[direct evidence]] and played down the significance of [[circumstantial evidence]].&lt;ref name=CourtTV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/060204_ctv.html|title=Two-timer, yes, but no double murderer: Peterson's defense lays out its case|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=2010-11-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228204313/http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/060204_ctv.html|archivedate=2009-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested that the fetal remains were of a full-term infant and theorized that someone kidnapped Laci, held her until she gave birth, and then dumped both bodies in the bay. The prosecution's medical experts contended that the baby was not full term and died at the same time as his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/092204_ctv.html|title=Peterson's unborn son died at time of his wife's disappearance, expert says|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geragos suggested that a [[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic cult]] kidnapped the pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=C.

Juror Frances Gorman was removed and replaced early in the trial due to [[misconduct]]. Jury foreman and attorney Gregory Jackson later requested his own removal during jury deliberations, most likely because his fellow jurors wanted to replace him as foreman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/11/10/peterson.trial |title=Source: Jury foreman dismissed in Peterson case |publisher=CNN|date=November 11, 2004 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Carolyn (November 11, 2004).

Fox News. November 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence===
A single hair was the only piece of forensic evidence that was identified. The strand, thought to have been Laci's, was found in a pair of pliers on Peterson's boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hilden/20040720.html|title=The Scott Peterson Trial|publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com|date=July 20, 2004|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented as prosecution evidence during the trial was the fact that Peterson changed his appearance and purchased a vehicle using his mother's name in order to avoid recognition by the press. He added two [[pornography|pornographic]] television channels to his cable service only days after his wife's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/080304_ctv.html|title=Prosecutors: Peterson signed up for porn channels after wife vanished|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution stated that this meant he knew she would not be returning home. Peterson expressed interest in selling the house he had shared with Laci,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/082504_ctv.html|title=Taped phone calls catch Scott Peterson in numerous lies to family, friends|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold her [[Land Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,84562,00.html|title=Body Identified as Laci Peterson; Scott Peterson Arrested in San Diego|last=Cosby|first=Rita|agency=Associated Press|date=April 19, 2003|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Cheng, a [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey]] and an [[expert witness]] on tides of the [[San Francisco Bay]], testified as a witness for the prosecution. During [[cross-examination]], Cheng admitted that his findings were "probable, not precise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/05/national/main647611.shtml|title=Laci Dumped at Scott Fishing Spot?: But Prosecution Expert Can't Be Certain About The Location|last=de Vries|first=Lloyd|date=October 4, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal systems are sufficiently chaotic, and he was unable to develop an exact [[scientific modelling|model]] of the bodies' disposal and travel. As the trial progressed, the prosecution opened discussion of Peterson's affair with Frey and the contents of their taped telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/23/1093113128828.html?from=storylhs|title='Love triangle' murder trial captivates US|date=August 23, 2004|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense argued that a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who was accused of stealing checks from Peterson's mailbox might have murdered Laci, but Modesto police detective Mike Hermosa did not indicate that the woman was ever a suspect in her disappearance. Prosecutor Dave Harris noted that the checks were stolen after she vanished, meaning the woman was not involved in her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/22/national/main631386.shtml|title=Concrete Found in Peterson Home|accessdate=August 20, 2011|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles March was expected to be a crucial witness for the defense, one who, according to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', could single-handedly [[exoneration|exonerate]] Peterson by showing that Laci's fetus died a week after prosecutors claimed. Under cross-examination, March admitted basing his findings on an [[anecdote]] from one of Laci's friends that she had taken a home pregnancy test on June 9, 2002. When prosecutors pointed out that no medical records relied on the June 9 date, March became flustered and confused on the stand and asked a prosecutor to cut him "some slack", undermining his credibility. Summing up this key defense witness, Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at [[Loyola Law School]] in [[Los Angeles]] said, "There were moments today that reminded me of [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]."&lt;ref&gt;Finz, Stacy; Walsh, Dian (October 22, 2004).

''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one newspaper account about March's testimony, "by the end of his testimony Thursday, legal analysts and jurors closed their notebooks, rolled their eyes, and snickered when they thought no one was looking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense witness asks D.A. to cut him slack: Expert says fetus died days after mother disappeared|first1=Stacy|last1=Finz|first2=Diana|last2=Walsh|date=October 22, 2004|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/22/BAGNB9E4PG37.DTL|accessdate=July 6, 2012|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motives===
The prosecution presented Peterson's affair with Frey and financial problems as motives for the murder. Prosecutors surmised that he killed Laci due to increasing debt and a desire to be single again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxreno.com/news/3430205/detail.html |title=June 17: Was Money The Motive For Murder? |date=June 24, 2010 |location=Reno, NV |publisher=[[KRXI-TV]] |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308210045/http://www.foxreno.com/news/3430205/detail.html |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict and sentencing===
[[File:SanQuentinSP.jpg|thumb|[[San Quentin State Prison]], where Peterson is incarcerated]]
On November 12, 2004, a jury convicted Peterson of two counts of murder: first-degree murder with special circumstances for killing Laci, and second-degree murder for killing the fetus she carried. The [[Bifurcation (law)|penalty phase]] of the trial began on November 30, and concluded December 13, when the jury rendered a sentence of death. On March 16, Judge [[Alfred Delucchi|Alfred A. Delucchi]] followed the jury verdict,&lt;ref name=CNNFastFacts/&gt; sentencing Peterson to death by [[lethal injection]] and ordering him to pay $10,000 toward the cost of Laci's funeral,&lt;ref name=CNN3.17.14&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/16/peterson.case|title=Peterson sentenced to death for wife's slaying|publisher=CNN|date=March 17, 2005|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/07/06/timeline-scott-peterson-case/|title=Timeline: The Scott Peterson case |publisher=Fox News|date=July 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Egelko|first=Bob|date=January 12, 2013|url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Peterson-appeal-may-be-helped-by-ruling-3718197.php|title=Peterson appeal may be helped by ruling|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the murder of Laci "cruel, uncaring, heartless, and callous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, Harriet|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/031605_ctv.html |title=Judge sentences Scott Peterson to death for killing his wife and unborn son|publisher=Court TV|date=March 16, 2005|accessdate=September 13, 2017|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228204050/http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/031605_ctv.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later press appearances, members of the jury stated that they felt that Peterson's demeanor—specifically his lack of emotion and the phone calls to Frey in the days following Laci's disappearance—indicated that he was guilty. They based their verdict on "hundreds of small 'puzzle pieces' of circumstantial evidence that were revealed during the trial, from the location of Laci's body to the myriad lies her husband told after her disappearance". The jury decided on the death penalty because they felt that Peterson betrayed his responsibility to protect his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/peterson/121304_jurors_ctv.html|title=Peterson jurors speak about guilty verdict, death sentence|publisher=Court TV|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2005 a judge ruled that proceeds from a $250,000 life insurance policy Peterson took out on Laci will go to Laci's mother, which was reaffirmed by the Fifth District Court of Appeal on October 21, 2005. Peterson's automatic appeal was filed in the California Supreme Court on July 5, 2012.&lt;ref name=CNNFastFacts/&gt;

Peterson arrived at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in the early morning hours of Wednesday, March 17, 2005. He was reported not to have slept the night before, being too "jazzed" to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/17/peterson.prison/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Prison: Two women want to marry Peterson|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7217582|title=Scott Peterson sent to San Quentin|publisher=MSNBC|date=March 18, 2005|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the more than 700 other inmates in California's sole [[death row]] facility while his case is on automatic appeal to the [[Supreme Court of California]].&lt;ref name=CNN3.17.14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abad-Santos, Alexander (July 6, 2012).

==Appeal==
Cliff Gardner, Peterson's attorney, stated that the publicity surrounding the trial, incorrect evidentiary rulings, and other mistakes deprived Peterson of a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/07/06/scott-peterson-appeals-death-sentence-to-california-supreme-court|title=Scott Peterson appeals death sentence to California Supreme Court|publisher=Fox News|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 2012, Gardner filed a 423-page appeal of Peterson's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/07/06/scott-peterson-appeals-death-sentence-to-california-supreme-court|title=Scott Peterson appeals death sentence to California Supreme Court|publisher=Fox News|date=July 6, 2012|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Scott-Peterson-files-to-overturn-convictions-3689584.php|title=Scott Peterson files to overturn convictions|date=July 18, 2012|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Bob|last=Egelko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General of California|State Attorney General]]'s office filed their response brief on January 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stapley, Garth|title=Details emerge to counter Scott Peterson appeal|url=http://www.modbee.com/news/local/article8604551.html|newspaper=Modesto Bee|date=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense filed a response to the State's brief in July 2015, claiming that a certified dog that detected Laci's scent at Berkeley Marina had failed two-thirds of tests with similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stapley, Garth|title=New court brief says judge botched Scott Peterson's 2004 trial|url=http://www.modbee.com/news/local/article29080468.html|newspaper=Modesto Bee|date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the defense filed a ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' petition, claiming that a juror lied on her jury application, and that there was evidence that neighbors saw Laci alive after Scott left home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Scott Peterson conviction be thrown out?|url=http://www.10news.com/news/will-scott-peterson-conviction-be-thrown-out-112415|website= [[KGTV]] [[ABC 10 News]]|date=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2017, the State Attorney General responded to the appeal by filing a 150-page document contesting the notion disputing the claims put forward in the appeal, stating that the appeal ignored "overwhelming evidence" that Peterson murdered Laci. Supervising Deputy Attorney General Donna Provenzano stated that the timeline of the crime was established by the neighbor who found the Petersons' [[Golden Retriever]] wandering in the street with its leash still attached, before the sightings of Laci and her dog. Provenzano also indicated, "Purported sightings of Laci were legion," noting 74 reported sightings in 26 states and overseas, most of which she stated, were neither viable nor corroborated.&lt;ref&gt;Stapley, Garth (August 11, 2017).

'''Ted Owens''' (1920-1987) was an alleged [[Contactee|UFO contactee]] who claimed [[paranormal]] powers.

==Life==
Owens, who had a genius-level IQ and was a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], believed he had been subject to "psychic surgery" by "space intelligences" who had operated on his brain to allow him to receive their telepathic messages. He considered himself a "UFO prophet" and compared himself with [[Moses]], claiming [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers that enabled him to not only predict but control [[lightning]], [[hurricanes]], [[tornado]]es, [[earthquakes]] and [[volcano]]es. Dubbing himself the "PK Man", Owens professed that his alleged powers were given to him by space intelligences who wished to call attention to the dangers that nuclear weapons and environmental pollution posed for mankind.&lt;ref name="Kripal2011" /&gt;

[[Science fiction]] and [[comic book]] writer [[Otto Binder]] wrote that Owens suffered a series of accidents resulting in brain trauma, which he felt were responsible for Owens supposed supernormal powers. [[Parapsychologist]] Jeffrey Mishlove wrote a book about Owens, ''The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter'', with a foreword by [[John E. Mack]].&lt;ref name="Kripal2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey J.

The theology of [[John Calvin]] has been influential in both the development of the system of belief now known as [[Calvinism]] and in [[Protestant]] thought more generally. There has been disagreement among scholars regarding the degree to which later Calvinism corresponds to Calvin's own theology.

''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' suggests that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His theological importance is tied to the attempted systematization of Christian doctrine. In the doctrine of predestination; in his simple, eschatologically grounded distinction between an immanent and a transcendent eternal work of salvation, resting on Christology and the sacraments; and in his emphasis upon the work of the Holy Spirit in producing the obedience of faith in the regenerate (the ''tertius usus legis'', or so-called third use of the law), he elaborated the orthodoxy that would have a lasting impact on Reformed theology.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch et al., ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity', vol. 1 (Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1999), 324&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Publications==
{{see also|John Calvin bibliography}}
Calvin developed his theology in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, but the most concise expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]''. He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hesselink|2004|pp=74–75}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various editions of that work span nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouwsma|1988|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Helm|2004|p=6}}; {{Harvnb|Hesselink|2004|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's ''[[Loci Communes]]''. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The final edition of the ''Institutes'' appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=4–10}}; {{Harvnb|De Greef|2004|pp=42–44}}; {{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=136–144, 151–174}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=110–114, 309–325}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|2006|pp=53–62, 97–99, 132–134, 161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
{{Calvinism}}

===Scripture===
[[File:CalvinInstitutio.jpg|thumb|left|Title page from the final edition of Calvin's ''magnum opus'', ''[[Institutio Christiane Religionis]]'', which summarises his theology.]]
{{main|John Calvin's view of Scripture}}
The first statement in the ''Institutes'' acknowledges its central theme. It states that the sum of human wisdom consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=23–24}}; {{Harvnb|Hesselink|2004|pp=77–78}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin argues that the knowledge of God is not inherent in humanity nor can it be discovered by observing this world. The only way to obtain it is to study scripture. Calvin writes, "For anyone to arrive at God the Creator he needs Scripture as his Guide and Teacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not try to prove the authority of scripture but rather describes it as ''autopiston'' or self-authenticating. He defends the [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] view of God and, in a strong polemical stand against the Catholic Church, argues that [[Religious image|images]] of God lead to idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|1995|pp=59–62}}; {{Harvnb|Hesselink|2004|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=29–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin viewed Scripture as being both ''majestic'' and ''simple''. According to Ford Lewis Battles, Calvin had discovered that "sublimity of style and sublimity of thought were not coterminous."&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Ford Lewis. "God Was Accommodating Himself to Human Capacity," in [[Donald McKim]] (ed.) ''Readings in Calvin's Theology'' (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1984), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Providence===
At the end of the first book of the ''Institutes'', he offers his views on [[Divine Providence|providence]], writing, "By his Power God cherishes and guards the World which he made and by his Providence rules its individual Parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hesselink|2004|p=85}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are unable to fully comprehend why God performs any particular action, but whatever good or evil people may practise, their efforts always result in the execution of God's will and judgments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=70–79}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sin===
The second book of the ''Institutes'' includes several essays on the [[original sin]] and the [[fall of man]], which directly refer to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who developed these doctrines. He often cited the [[Church Fathers]] in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerrish|2004|pp=290–291, 302}}. According to Gerrish, Calvin put his defence against the charge of novelty in the preface of every edition of the ''Institutes''. The original preface of the first edition was addressed to the King of France, Francis I. The defence expressed his opinion that patristic authority favoured the reformers and that allegation of the reformers deviating from the patristic consensus was a fiction. See also {{Harvnb|Steinmetz|1995|pp=122–137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Calvin's view, sin began with the fall of [[Adam]] and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=80–88}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived during the time of the [[Old Testament]]. God made a covenant with [[Abraham]], promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the [[Old Covenant]] was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the [[New Covenant]] using the passage from the [[Apostles' Creed]] that describes Christ's suffering under [[Pontius Pilate]] and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=57–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atonement===
[[R. T. Kendall]] has argued that Calvin's view of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] differs from that of later [[Calvinist]]s, especially the [[Puritans]]. Kendall interpreted Calvin as believing that Christ died [[Unlimited atonement|for all people]], but intercedes only for the [[Election (Christianity)|elect]].

Kendall's thesis has been disputed by [[Paul Helm]], who argues that "both Calvin and the Puritans taught that Christ died for the elect and intercedes for the elect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Helm|first=Paul|author-link=Paul Helm|title=Calvin and the Calvinists|year=1982|publisher=[[Banner of Truth Trust]]|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union with Christ===
In the third book of the ''Institutes'', Calvin describes how the spiritual union of Christ and humanity is achieved. He first defines faith as the firm and certain knowledge of God in Christ. The immediate effects of faith are [[repentance]] and the remission of sin. This is followed by spiritual [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]], which returns the believer to the state of holiness before Adam's transgression. However, complete perfection is unattainable in this life, and the believer should expect a continual struggle against sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=126–130}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several chapters are then devoted to the subject of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]. He defined justification as "the acceptance by which God regards us as righteous whom he has received into grace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, it is clear that it is God who initiates and carries through the action and that people play no role; God is completely sovereign in salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=130–137}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=95–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alister McGrath]], Calvin provided a solution to the [[Reformation]] problem of how [[Justification (theology)|justification]] relates to [[sanctification]]. Calvin suggested that both came out of union with Christ. McGrath notes that while [[Martin Bucer]] suggested that justification causes (moral) regeneration, Calvin argued that "both justification and regeneration are the results of the believer's union with Christ through faith."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister E. McGrath]], ''Reformation Thought: An Introduction'' (3rd ed; Oxford: Blackwell, 1999): 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predestination===
Near the end of the ''Institutes'', Calvin describes and defends the doctrine of [[predestination]], a doctrine advanced by Augustine in opposition to the teachings of [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]. Fellow theologians who followed the Augustinian tradition on this point included [[Thomas Aquinas]] and Martin Luther,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Calvin's formulation of the doctrine went further than the tradition that went before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heron|2005|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle, in Calvin's words, is that "All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestinated to life or to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvin|1989|loc=[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.v.xxii.html Book III, Chapter 21, Par 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of predestination "does not stand at the beginning of the dogmatic system as it does in Zwingli or Beza", but, according to Fahlbusch, it "does tend to burst through the soteriological-Christological framework."&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch ''et al'', 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to some other Protestant Reformers, Calvin taught [[double predestination]]. Chapter 21 of Book III of the ''Institutes'' is called "Of the eternal election, by which God has predestinated some to salvation, and others to destruction".

===Ecclesiology and sacraments===
The final book of the ''Institutes'' describes what he considers to be the true Church and its ministry, authority, and [[sacraments]]. He denied the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal claim to primacy]] and the accusation that the reformers were [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]. For Calvin, the Church was defined as the body of believers who placed Christ at its head. By definition, there was only one "catholic" or "universal" Church. Hence, he argued that the reformers "had to leave them in order that we might come to Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|p=134}}; {{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=187–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministers of the Church are described from a passage from [[Ephesians]], and they consisted of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and doctors. Calvin regarded the first three offices as temporary, limited in their existence to the time of the New Testament. The latter two offices were established in the church in Geneva. Although Calvin respected the work of the [[ecumenical council]]s, he considered them to be subject to God's Word found in scripture. He also believed that the civil and church authorities were separate and should not interfere with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=135–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin defined a sacrament as an earthly sign associated with a promise from God. He accepted only two sacraments as valid under the new covenant: [[baptism]] and the Lord's Supper (in opposition to the Catholic acceptance of [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]]). He completely rejected the Catholic doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] and the treatment of the Supper as a sacrifice. He also could not accept the Lutheran doctrine of [[sacramental union]] in which Christ was "in, with and under" the elements. His own view was close to [[Theology of Huldrych Zwingli#Eucharist|Zwingli's symbolic view]], but it was not identical. Rather than holding a purely symbolic view, Calvin noted that with the participation of the Holy Spirit, faith was nourished and strengthened by the sacrament. In his words, the eucharistic rite was "a secret too sublime for my mind to understand or words to express. I experience it rather than understand it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Potter|Greengrass|1983|pp=34–42}}; {{Harvnb|McDonnell|1967|p=206}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1995|pp=147–157}}; {{Harvnb|Niesel|1980|pp=211–228}}; {{Harvnb|Steinmetz|1995|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other Protestant Reformers, Calvin believed that there were only two [[sacrament]]s, [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]. Calvin also conceded that [[ordination]] could also be called a sacrament, but suggested that it was a "special rite for a certain function."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xx.html ''Institutes'' IV.xix.28].&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin believed in [[infant baptism]], and devoted a chapter in his ''Institutes'' to the subject.

Calvin believed in a real spiritual presence of Christ at the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=Cunnington&gt;Ralph Cunnington, "[https://www.academia.edu/1091130/Calvins_Doctrine_of_the_Lords_Supper_A_blot_upon_his_labors_as_a_public_instructor Calvin's Doctrine of the Lord's Supper: A blot upon his labors as a public instructor?]" ''[[WTJ]]'' 73 (2011):217.&lt;/ref&gt; For Calvin, [[union with Christ]] was at the heart of the Lord's Supper.&lt;ref name=Cunnington /&gt;

According to Brian Gerrish, there are three different interpretations of the Lord's Supper within non-Lutheran Protestant theology: 
#''Symbolic memorialism'', found in [[Zwingli]], which sees the elements merely as a sign pointing to a past event; 
#''Symbolic parallelism'', typified by [[Bullinger]], which sees the sign as pointing to “a happening that occurs simultaneously in the present” ''alongside'' the sign itself; and 
#''Symbolic instrumentalism'', Calvin's view, which holds that the Eucharist is “a present happening that is actually brought about through the signs.”&lt;ref&gt;B. A. Gerrish, "Sign and reality: The Lord's Supper in the reformed confessions" in ''The Old Protestantism and the New'' (Edinburgh: T &amp;T Clark 1982) pp. 118-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin's sacramental theology was criticized by later Reformed writers. [[Robert L. Dabney]], for example, called it “not only incomprehensible but impossible.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Dabney]], ''Lectures in Systematic Theology'', p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
[[File:Joachim-Westphal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joachim Westphal (of Hamburg)|Joachim Westphal]] disagreed with Calvin's theology on the [[eucharist]].]]
Calvin's theology was not without controversy. [[Pierre Caroli]], a Protestant minister in Lausanne accused Calvin, as well as [[Pierre Viret|Viret]] and [[William Farel|Farel]], of [[Arianism]] in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in ''Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gamble|2004|p=199}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551 [[Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec]], a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's doctrine of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gamble|2004|pp=198–199}}; {{Harvnb|McGrath|1990|pp=16–17}}; {{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=208–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, [[Joachim Westphal (of Hamburg)|Joachim Westphal]], a [[Gnesio-Lutheran]] pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic doctrine of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's ''Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis'' (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox Doctrine of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gamble|2004|pp=193–196}}; {{Harvnb|Parker|1975|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1556 [[Justus Velsius#Frankfurt: Disputation with Calvin|Justus Velsius]], a Dutch dissident, held a public [[disputation]] with Calvin during his visit to [[Frankfurt]], in which Velsius defended [[Free will in theology|free will]] against Calvin's doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]]. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, [[Sebastian Castellio]], broke with him on the issue of the treatment of heretics. In Castellio's ''Treatise on Heretics'' (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cottret|2000|pp=227–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganoczy|2004|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calvin and the Jews===
Scholars have debated Calvin's view of the Jews and Judaism. Some have argued that Calvin was the least anti-semitic among all the major reformers of his time, especially in comparison to Martin Luther.&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel J. Elazar, ''Covenant and Commonwealth: Europe from Christian Separation through the Protestant Reformation, Volume II of the Covenant Tradition in Politics'' (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that Calvin was firmly within the anti-semitic camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pater|1987|pp=256–296}}; {{Harvnb|Baron|1972|pp=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree, however, that it is important to distinguish between Calvin's views toward the biblical Jews and his attitude toward contemporary Jews. In his theology, Calvin does not differentiate between God's covenant with Israel and the New Covenant. He stated, "all the children of the promise, reborn of God, who have obeyed the commands by faith working through love, have belonged to the New Covenant since the world began."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lange van Ravenswaay|2009|p=144}} quoting from Calvin, Institutes II.11.10&lt;/ref&gt; Still he was a [[supersessionist]] and argued that the Jews are a rejected people who must embrace Jesus to re-enter the covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Pak, G. Sojin.'' John Calvin and the Jews: His Exegetical Legacy''. Reformed Institute of Metropolitan Washington, 2009, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Calvin's statements on the Jewry of his era were polemical. For example, Calvin once wrote, "I have had much conversation with many Jews: I have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or ingenuousness – nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's commentary of Daniel 2:44–45 translated by Myers, Thomas.''Calvin's Commentaries''. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1948, quoted in {{Harvnb|Lange van Ravenswaay|2009|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, he differed little from other Protestant and Catholic theologians of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Detmers|2006|p=199}}; {{Harvnb|Lange van Ravenswaay|2009|pp=143–146}}; {{Harvnb|Pak|2009|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his extant writings, Calvin only dealt explicitly with issues of contemporary Jews and Judaism in one treatise,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pak|2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Response to Questions and Objections of a Certain Jew''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ad Questiones et Obiecta Iudaei cuisdam Responsio Ioannis Calvini'' in [[Corpus Reformatorum|CR]] 37:653–74 and translated by R. Susan Frank in M. Sweetland Laver, ''Calvin, Jews, and Intra-Christian Polemics'' (PhD diss, Temple University, Philadelphia, 1987), pp. 220–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he argued that Jews misread their own scriptures because they miss the unity of the Old and New Testaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pak|2009|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Yōkai'''''|妖怪||''[[ghost]]'', ''phantom'', ''strange apparition''}} are a class of [[supernatural]] monsters, spirits, and demons in [[Japanese folklore]]. The word ''yōkai'' is made up of the [[kanji]] for "bewitching; attractive; calamity"; and "spectre; apparition; mystery; suspicious".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E5%A6%96%E6%80%AA Youkai Kanji] and [http://jisho.org/words?jap=youkai&amp;eng=&amp;dict=edict Yōkai: definition] via Denshi Jisho at jisho.org Retrieved 22 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be called {{Nihongo|[[Ayakashi (yōkai)|'''''ayakashi''''']]|あやかし|}}, {{Nihongo|'''''[[mononoke]]'''''|物の怪|}}, or {{Nihongo|'''''mamono'''''|魔物|}}. ''Yōkai'' range diversely from the malevolent to the mischievous, or occasionally bring good fortune to those who encounter them.

''Yōkai'' often possess animal features (such as the ''[[Kappa (folklore)|kappa]]'', which looks similar to a turtle, or the ''[[tengu]]'' which has wings), yet others appear mostly human. Some ''yōkai''  look like inanimate objects (such as ''[[Tsukumogami|tsukumogami]]''), while others have no discernible shape.

''Yōkai'' usually have spiritual or supernatural abilities, with [[shapeshifting]] being the most common. ''Yōkai'' that shapeshift are called ''[[Obake|bakemono (化物) / obake (お化け)]]''.

Japanese [[folkloristics|folklorists]] and historians explain yōkai as personifications of "supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants".

In the [[Edo period]], many artists, such as [[Toriyama Sekien]], invented new ''yōkai'' taking inspiration from folk tales or purely from their own imagination. Today, several such fabricated ''yōkai'' (e.g. Kameosa and [[Amikiri]], see below) are commonly mistaken to originate in more traditional folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obakemono.com/obake/toriyama-sekien/ |title=Toriyama Sekien ~ 鳥山石燕 （とりやませきえん） ~ part of The Obakemono Project: An Online Encyclopedia of Yōkai and Bakemono |publisher=Obakemono.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726080810/http://www.obakemono.com/obake/toriyama-sekien/|archivedate=26 July 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Gamayoukai.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gama Yōkai from the ''Saigama to Ukiyo Soushi Kenkyu'' Volume 2, special issue ''Kaii''』&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|近藤瑞木・佐伯 孝弘|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamababaki]]]]
[[File:SekienNarigama.jpg|right|170px|thumb|[[Narikama]] from the ''[[Gazu Hyakki Tsurezure Bukuro]]'' by [[Sekien Toriyama]]]]
What is thought of as "supernatural" depends on the time period; but generally, the older the time period, the greater the amount of phenomena that were deemed supernatural in character or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Japanese ideas of [[animism]], spirit-like entities called (among other things) ''[[mononoke]]'' were believed to reside in all things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such spirits possessed emotions and personalities. If the spirit were peaceful, it was a ''[[Mitama|nigi-mitama]]'', bringing good fortune—such as bountiful harvests. Violent spirits, ''[[Mitama|ara-mitama]]'', brought ill fortune—including illness and natural disasters. One's ancestors and particularly-respected departed elders could be deemed ''nigi-mitama'', accruing status as protective gods and receiving worship. Animals, objects and natural features or phenomena were also venerated as ''nigi-mitama'' or propitiated as ''ara-mitama''—depending on the area.

The ritual for converting ''ara-mitama'' into ''nigi-mitama'' was called the ''[[chinkon]]'' ("the calming of the spirits").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|pp=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chinkon'' rituals were performed to quell maleficent spirits, prevent misfortune and alleviate fear from events and circumstances that could not otherwise be explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|宮田登|2002|p=14}}、{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|pp=201–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ara-mitama'' that failed to achieve deification due to lack of sufficient veneration, or who lost their divinity following attrition of worshipers, became ''yōkai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|宮田登|2002|pp=12–14}}、{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|pp=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, those things thought to be supernatural became fewer and fewer. Meanwhile, depictions of ''yōkai'' in ''[[Emakimono|emaki]]'' and paintings began to standardize, turning into caricatures and softening their fearsome natures. Elements from tales of ''yōkai'' were increasingly mined for public entertainment. Use of ''yōkai'' in popular media began as early as the middle ages.&lt;ref name="小松 中世"&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mythology and lore of ''yōkai'' became more defined and formalized during the Edo period and after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
The folkloricist [[Tsutomu Ema]] studied the literature and paintings depicting ''yōkai'' and ''henge'' (変化, or "mutants") and divided them into categories, as presented in the ''Nihon Yōkai Henge Shi'' and the ''Obake no Rekishi''.
*Five categories based on the ''yōkai's'' "true form": human, animal, plant, object, or natural phenomenon.
*Four categories depending on source of mutation: this-world related, spiritual/mental related, reincarnation/next-world related, or material related.
*Seven categories based on external appearance: human, animal, plant, artifact, structure/building, natural object or phenomenon, and miscellaneous—as well as compound classifications for ''yōkai'' falling into more than one category.

In traditional Japanese [[folkloristics]], ''yōkai'' are classified (not unlike the [[nymph]]s of Greek mythology) by location or phenomenon associated with their manifestation. ''Yōkai'' are indexed in the book ''Sogo Nihon Minzoku Goi'' (綜合日本民俗語彙, "A Complete Dictionary of Japanese Folklore")&lt;ref&gt;民俗学研究所『綜合日本民俗語彙』第5巻 [[平凡社]] 1956年 403–407頁　索引では「霊怪」という部門の中に「霊怪」「妖怪」「憑物」が小部門として存在している。&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

*''Yama no ke'' (mountains), ''michi no ke'' (paths), ''ki no ke'' (trees), ''mizu no ke'' (water), ''umi no ke'' (the sea), ''yuki no ke'' (snow), ''oto no ke'' (sound), ''doubutsu no ke'' (animals, either real or imaginary)

==History==

===Ancient history===
* First century: there is a book from what is now China titled 循史伝 with the statement "the spectre (yōkai) was in the imperial court for a long time. The king asked Tui for the reason. He answered that there was great anxiety and he gave a recommendation to empty the imperial room" (久之 宮中数有妖恠（妖怪） 王以問遂 遂以為有大憂 宮室将空), thus using "妖恠" to mean "phenomenon that surpasses human knowledge."
* Houki 8 (772): in the [[Shoku Nihongi]], there is the statement "shinto purification is performed because yōkai appear very often in the imperial court, (大祓、宮中にしきりに、妖怪あるためなり)," using the word "yōkai" to mean not anything in particular, but strange phenomena in general.
* Middle of the [[Heian period|Heian]] era (794-1185/1192): In [[The Pillow Book]] by [[Sei Shōnagon]], there is the statement "there are tenacious mononoke (いと執念き御もののけに侍るめり)" as well as a statement by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] that "the mononoke have become quite dreadful (御もののけのいみじうこはきなりけり)," which are the first appearances of the word "mononoke."
* Koubu 3 (1370): In the [[Taiheiki]], in the fifth volume, there is the statement, "Sagami no Nyudo was not at all frightened by yōkai."

[[File:Yoshitoshi Nihon-ryakushi Susanoo-no-mikoto.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Yamata no Orochi]] from the ''Nihon-ryakushi: Susanoo'' by [[Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]]]]
The ancient times were a period abundant in literature and folktales mentioning and explaining ''yōkai''. Literature such as the [[Kojiki]], the [[Nihon Shoki]], and various [[Fudoki]] expositioned on legends from the ancient past, and mentions of ''[[oni]]'', ''[[orochi]]'', among other kinds of mysterious phenomena can already be seen in them.&lt;ref name="小松"&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Heian period]], collections of stories about ''yōkai'' and other supernatural phenomena were published in multiple volumes, starting with publications such as the [[Nihon Ryōiki]] and the [[Konjaku Monogatarishū]], and in these publications, mentions of phenomena such as [[Hyakki Yagyō]] can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;『今昔物語集』巻14の42「尊勝陀羅尼の験力によりて鬼の難を遁るる事」&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yōkai'' that appear in these literature were passed on to later generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the literature mentioning and explaining these ''yōkai'', they were never given any visual depictions. In Buddhist paintings such as the [[Hell Scroll (Nara National Museum)]], which came from the later Heian period, there are visual expressions of the idea of ''oni'', but actual visual depictions would only come later in the middle ages, from the Kamakura period and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2011|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yamata no Orochi]] was originally a local god but turned into a ''yōkai'' that was slain by [[Susanoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasaburo was originally a bandit whose vengeful spirit (''onryo'') turned into a poisonous snake upon death and plagued the water in a paddy, but eventually became deified as the "wisdom god of the well (井の明神)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]]'' and ''[[inugami]]'' are sometimes treated as gods in one area and ''yōkai'' in other areas. From these examples, it can be seen that among Japanese gods, there are some beings that can go from god to ''yōkai'' and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|宮田登|2002|p=12}}、{{Harvnb|小松和彦|2015|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-classical history===
[[File:Hyakki-Yagyo-Emaki Tsukumogami 1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The ''Hyakki Yagyo Emaki'', author unknown. It comes from the Muromachi period.]]
Medieval Japan was a time period where publications such as ''[[Emakimono]]'', ''[[Otogizōshi]]'', and other visual depictions of ''yōkai'' started to appear. While there were religious publications such as the ''Jisha Engi'' (寺社縁起), others, such as the ''Otogizōshi'', were intended more for entertainment, starting the trend where ''yōkai'' became more and more seen as subjects of entertainment. For examples, tales of ''yōkai'' extermination could be said to be a result of emphasizing the superior status of human society over ''yōkai''.&lt;ref name="小松 中世"/&gt; Publications included:
* The [[Shuten-doji|Ooe-yama Shuten-doji Emaki]] (about an ''oni''), the ''Zegaibou Emaki'' (about a ''tengu''), the ''[[Fujiwara no Hidesato|Tawara no Touta Emaki]]'' (俵藤太絵巻) (about a giant snake and a centipede), the ''[[Tsuchigumo Zoshi]]'' (土蜘蛛草紙) (about ''tsuchigumo''), and the ''[[Kiyohime|Dojo-ji Engi Emaki]]'' (about a giant snake). These ''emaki'' were about ''yōkai'' that come from even older times.
* The ''Kitano Tenjin Engi Emaki'', in which [[Sugawara no Michizane]] was a lightning god who took on the form of an ''oni'', and despite attacking people after doing this, he was still deified as a god in the end.&lt;ref name="小松 中世" /&gt;
* The ''Junirui Emaki'', the ''Tamamono Soshi'', (both about [[Tamamo-no-Mae]]), and the ''Fujibukuro Soushi Emaki'' (about a monkey). These ''emaki'' told of ''yōkai'' mutations of animals.
* The ''[[Tsukumogami Emaki]]'', which told tales of thrown away none-too-precious objects that come to have a spirit residing in them planning evil deeds against humans, and ultimately get exorcised and sent to peace.
* The ''[[Hyakki Yagyō Emaki]]'', depicting many different kinds of ''yōkai'' all marching together
In this way, ''yōkai'' that were mentioned only in writing were given a visual appearance in the middle ages. In the Otogizōshi, familiar tales such as Urashima Tarō and Issun-bōshi also appeared.

The next major change in ''yōkai'' came after the period of warring states, in the Edo period.

===Modern history===
==== Edo period ====
[[File:Yoshitoshi The Heavy Basket.jpg|right|thumb|210px|"The Heavy Basket" from the ''Shinkei Sanjurokkei Sen'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (Meiji 25)]]
* [[Enpō]] 6 (1677): Publication of the [[Shokoku Hyakumonogatari]], a collection of tales of various monsters.
* [[Hōei]] 6 (1706): Publication of the Otogi Hyakumonogatari. In volumes such as "Miyazu no Ayakashi" (volume 1) and "Unpin no Yōkai" (volume 4), collections of tales that seem to come from China were adapted into a Japanese setting.&lt;ref  name="otogihyoku"&gt;{{Cite book|author=太刀川清|title=百物語怪談集成|year=1987|publisher=[[国書刊行会]]|pages=365–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shōtoku (era)|Shōtoku]] 2 (1712): Publication of the [[Wakan Sansai Zue]] by Terajima Ryōan, a collection of tales based on the Chinese [[Sancai Tuhui]].
* Shōtoku 6 (1716): In the specialized dictionary ''[[Sesetsu Kojien]]'' (世説故事苑), there is an entry on ''yōkai'', which stated, "among the commoners in my society, there are many kinds of kaiji (mysterious phenomena), often mispronounced by commoners as 'kechi.' Types include the cry of weasels, the howling of foxes, the bustling of mice, the rising of the chicken, the cry of the birds, the pooping of the birds on clothing, and sounds similar to voices that come from cauldrons and bottles. These types of things appear in the ''[[Shōseiroku]]'', methods of exorcising them can be seen, so it should serve as a basis"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 世説故事苑 3巻 | url = https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=AWVw3Grzl5AC&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=2015-12-16| year = 1716 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tenmei]] 8 (1788): Publication of the Bakemono chakutocho by Masayoshi Kitao. This was a ''[[kibyoshi]]'' diagram book of ''yōkai'', but it was prefaced with the statement "it can be said that the so-called yōkai in our society is a representation of our feelings that arise from fear" (世にいふようくわいはおくびょうよりおこるわが心をむかふへあらわしてみるといえども … ),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|others=[[アダム・カバット]]校注・編 |title=江戸化物草紙 |publisher=[[Shogakukan|小学館]] |date=February 1999 |pages=29|isbn=978-4-09-362111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and already in this era, while ''yōkai'' were being researched, it indicated that there were people who questioned whether yōkai really existed or not.

It was in this era that the technology of the printing press and publication was first started to be widely used, that a publishing culture developed, and was frequently a subject of ''[[kibyoshi]]''&lt;ref&gt;草双紙 といわれる 絵本 で、ジャンルごとにより表紙が色分けされていた。黄表紙は大人向けのもので、その他に赤や青がある。&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications.

As a result, ''[[kashi-hon]]'' shops that handled such books spread and became widely used, making the general public's impression of each ''yōkai'' fixed, spreading throughout all of Japan. For example, before the Edo period, there were plenty of interpretations about what the ''yōkai'' were that were classified as ''kappa'',"but because of books and publishing, the notion of ''kappa'' became anchored to what is now the modern notion of ''kappa''. Also, including other kinds of publications, other than ''yōkai'' born from folk legend, there were also many invented ''yōkai'' that were created through puns or word plays, and the [[Gazu Hyakki Hagyo]] by [[Sekien Toriyama]] is one example of that. Also, when the [[Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai]] became popular in the Edo period, it is thought that one reason for the appearance of new ''yōkai'' was a demand for entertaining ghost stories about ''yōkai'' no one has ever heard of before, resulting in some ō that were simply made up for the purpose of telling an entertaining story, and the ''[[kasa-obake]]'' and the ''[[tōfu-kozō]]'' are known examples of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|editor=京極夏彦 ・多田克己編|title=妖怪画本 狂歌百物語|year=2008|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-3360-5055-7|pages=272–273頁|chapter=『妖怪画本・狂歌百物語』妖怪総覧}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also frequently depicted in ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', and there are artists that have drawn famous ''yōkai'' like [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], [[Yoshitoshi]], [[Kawanabe Kyōsai]], and [[Hokusai]], and there are also [[Hyakki Yagyō]] books made by artists of the [[Kanō school]].

In this period, toys and games like ''[[karuta]]'', ''[[sugoroku]]'', [[pogs]] frequently used ''yōkai'' as characters. Thus, with the development of a publishing culture, ''yōkai'' depictions that were treasured in temples and shrines were able to become something more familiar to people, and it is thought that this is the reason that even though ''yōkai'' were originally things to be feared, they have then became characters that people feel close to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=湯本豪一|editor=講談社コミッククリエイト編|title=DISCOVER妖怪 日本妖怪大百科|year=2008|publisher=講談社|series=KODANSHA Official File Magazine|volume=VOL.10|isbn=978-4-06-370040-4|pages=30–31頁|chapter=遊びのなかの妖怪}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear|left}}

==== Meiji period ====
* Meiji 24 (1891): Publication of the ''Seiyou Youkai Kidan'' by [[Shibue Tamotsu]]. It introduced folktales from Europe, such as the Grimm Tales.
* Meiji 29 (1896): Publication of the ''Yōkaigaku Kogi'' by [[Inoue Enryō]]
* Meiji 33 (1900): Performance of the kabuki ''Yami no Ume Hyakumonogatari'' at the [[Kabuki-za]] in January. It was a performance in which appeared numerous ''yōkai'' such as the ''kasa ippon ashi'', skeletons, ''yuki-onna'', ''okasabe-hime'', among others. [[Onoe Kikugorō V]] played the role of many of these, such as the ''okasabe-hime''.
* Taishō 3 (1914): Publication of the ''Shokubutsu Kaiko'' by [[Mitsutaro Shirai]]. Shirai expositioned on plant ''yōkai'' from the point of view of a plant pathologist and herbalist.
[[File:Cholera.jpg|thumb|170px|A poster relating the spread of Cholera to a ''shinigami''. From [[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]. The image and idea of ''shinigami'' were imported from European depictions like these in the Meiji period.]]

With the [[Meiji Restoration]], Western ideas and translated western publications began to make an impact, and western tales were particularly sought after. Things like ''[[binbogami]]'', ''[[yakubyogami]]'', and ''[[shinigami]]'' were talked about, and ''shinigami'' were even depicted in classical ''[[rakugo]]'', and although the ''shinigami'' were misunderstood as a kind of Japanese ''yōkai'' or ''kami'', they actually became well-known among the populace through a ''rakugo'' called "Shinigami" in [[San'yūtei Enchō]], which were adoptions of European tales such as the Grimm fairy tale "Godfather Death" and the Italian opera "Crispino" (1850). Also, in Meiji 41 (1908), [[Kyōka Izumi]] and [[Tobari Chikufuu]] jointedly translated [[Gerhart Hauptmann]]'s play ''The Sunken Bell''. Later works of Kyōka such as [[Yasha ga Ike]] were influenced by ''The Sunken Bell'', and so it can be seen that folktales that come from the West became adapted into Japanese tales of yōkai.

==== Shōwa period ====
Since yōkai are introduced in various kinds of media, they have become well-known among the old, the young, men and women. The ''[[kamishibai]]'' from before the war, and the ''[[manga]]'' industry, as well as the ''[[kashi-hon]]'' shops that continued to exist until around Showa 40 (the 1970s), as well as television contributed to the public knowledge and familiarity with ''yōkai''. ''Yōkai'' play a role in attracting tourism revitalizing local regions, like the places depicted in the Tono Monogatari like [[Tono, Iwate]], [[Iwate Prefecture]] and the [[Tottori Prefecture]], which is [[Shigeru Mizuki]]'s place of birth. In Kyoto, there is a store called Yōkaido, which is a renovated ''machiya'' (traditional Kyoto-style house), and the owner gives a guided ''yōkai'' tour of Kyoto.

In this way, ''yōkai'' are spoken about in legends in various forms, but traditional oral storytelling by the elders and the older people is rare, and regionally unique situations and background in oral storytelling are not easily conveyed. For example, the classical ''yōkai'' represented by ''tsukumogami'' can only be felt as something realistic by living close to nature, such as with ''tanuki'' ([[Japanese racoon dog]]s), [[fox]]es and [[weasel]]s. Furthermore, in the suburbs, and other regions, even when living in a primary-sector environment, there are tools that are no longer seen, such as the [[inkstone]], the ''kama'' (a large cooking pot), or the ''tsurube'' (a bucket used for getting water from a well), and there exist ''yōkai'' that are reminiscent of old lifestyles such as the ''[[azukiarai]]'' and the ''[[dorotabo]]''. As a result, even for those born in the first decade of the Showa period (1925–1935), except for some who were evacuated to the countryside, they would feel that those things that become ''yōkai'' are "not familiar" are "not very understandable." For example, in classical ''rakugo'', even though people understand the words and what they refer to, they are not able to imagine it as something that could be realistic. Thus, the modernization of society has had a negative effect on the place of yōkai in classical Japanese culture.

On the other hand, the ''yōkai'' introduced through mass media are not limited to only those that come from classical sources like folklore, and just as in the Edo period, new fictional ''yōkai'' continue to be invented, such as scary school stories and other [[urban legend]]s like ''[[kuchisake-onna]]'' and ''[[Hanako-san]]'', giving birth to new ''yōkai''. From 1975 onwards, starting with the popularity of ''kuchisake-onna'', these urban legends began to be referred to in mass media as "modern ''yōkai''."&lt;ref name="gendai"&gt;{{Cite book|author=山口敏太郎|title=本当にいる日本の「現代妖怪」図鑑|year=2007|publisher=笠倉出版社|isbn=978-4-7730-0365-9|pages=9頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology was also used in recent publications dealing with urban legends,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DISCOVER妖怪 日本妖怪大百科|volume=VOL.10|pages=2頁|chapter=都市伝説と妖怪}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the researcher on yōkai, [[Bintarō Yamaguchi]], used this especially frequently.&lt;ref name="gendai" /&gt;

During the 1970s, many books were published that introduced ''yōkai'' through encyclopaedias, illustrated reference books, and dictionaries as a part of children's horror books, but along with the ''yōkai'' that come from classics like folklore, ''kaidan'', and essays, it has been pointed out by modern research that there are some mixed in that do not come from classics, but were newly created. Some well-known examples of these are the ''[[gashadokuro]]'' and the ''[[jubokko]]''. For example, [[Arifumi Sato]] is known to be a creator of modern ''yōkai'', and [[Shigeru Mizuki]], a manga artist for ''yōkai'', in writings concerning research about ''yōkai'', pointed out that newly created ''yōkai'' do exist,&lt;ref name="と学会2007"&gt;{{Cite book|author=と学会|title=トンデモ本の世界U|year=2007|publisher=楽工社|isbn=978-4-903063-14-0|pages=226–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="妖怪王2003"&gt;{{Cite book|author=妖怪王（山口敏太郎）グループ|title=昭和の子供 懐しの妖怪図鑑|edition=|year=2003|publisher=アートブック本の森|series=コスモブックス|isbn=978-4-7747-0635-1|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mizuki himself, through ''[[GeGeGe no Kitaro]]'', created about 30 new yōkai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=水木しげる|title=妖怪なんでも入門|year=1974|publisher=小学館|series=小学館入門百科シリーズ|isbn=978-4-092-20032-6|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much criticism that this mixing of classical ''yōkai'' with newly created ''yōkai'' is making light of tradition and legends.&lt;ref name="と学会2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="妖怪王2003" /&gt; However, since there have already been those from the Edo period like Sekien Toriyama who created many new ''yōkai'', there is also the opinion that it is unreasonable to criticize modern creations without doing the same for classical creations too.&lt;ref name="と学会2007" /&gt; Furthermore, there is a favorable view that says that introducing various ''yōkai'' characters through these books nurtured creativity and emotional development of young readers of the time.&lt;ref name="妖怪王2003" /&gt;
