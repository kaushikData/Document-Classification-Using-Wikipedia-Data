      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">'''Anioł Dowgird''' (1776–1835) was a [[philosopher]] of [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]].

Dowgird studied in [[Jesuit]] and [[Piarist]] schools, then joined the [[Piarist Order]] and took [[holy orders]]. Subsequently, he taught at Piarist schools and for a time was a professor of [[logic]] and [[ethics]] at [[Wilno University]].&lt;ref name=wiep&gt;"Dowgird, Anioł," ''Wielka Ilustrowana Encyklopedia Powszechna'' (Great Illustrated Universal Encyclopedia), volume IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowgird derived his views from [[John Locke]]'s [[empiricism]], the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]],&lt;ref&gt;"Dowgird, Anioł," ''Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN'' (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), vol. 1, p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.

'''Anti-racism''' includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies adopted or developed to oppose [[racism]].

According to the Anti-racism Digital Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|URL=http://endracism.info|title=Anti-racism Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Anti-racism can be defined as some form of focused and sustained action, which includes inter-cultural, inter-faith, multi-lingual and inter-abled (i.e. differently abled) communities with the intent to change a system or an institutional policy, practice, or procedure which has racist effects."

==European origins==
The [[Europe]]an colonization of the [[Americas]] by [[Christopher Columbus]] did not occur until 1492. However, two [[Papal bull]]s announced several decades before that event were designed to help ward off increasing [[Muslim]] invasions into Europe, which they believed would have an effect on the [[New World]].

When [[Islam]] presented a serious military threat to [[Italy]] and [[Central Europe]] during the mid-15th century around the time of the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Pope Nicholas V]] tried to unite [[Christendom]] against them but failed. He then granted [[Portugal]] the right to subdue and even enslave Muslims whether white or any other race, pagans and other non-Christians in the papal bull ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452). While this bull preceded the [[Atlantic slave trade]] by several decades, slavery and the slave trade were part of African societies and tribes which supplied the [[Arab]] world with slaves long before the arrival of the Europeans.

Increasingly, the Italian merchants from the wealthiest states in Italy, especially [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] joined in the lucrative trade and some members sported exotic lackeys and few domestic or workshop slaves whereas before slavery was forbidden in [[Christendom]] and only formerly in [[Muslim Spain]] and [[Sicily]] and their buffer border marches were seen and legally allowed. Racial views of Superiority started developing and became more acute about these slaves, social views imported from the Court of [[Granada]] where they were highly stratified and classified.

The following year saw the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to Muslim conquerors of the ever-growing  Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] which left the pope as the undoubted contested leader of Christendom when the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] leadership became under submission. Several decades later, European explorers and missionaries spread Christianity to the Americas, [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]]. [[Pope Alexander VI]] had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands by the Iberian Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Portugal. Under their ''patronato'' system, however, Royal authorities, not the [[Holy See|Vatican]], controlled as in Europe all clerical appointments in the new colonies. Thus, the 1455 Papal bull ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' granted the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] all lands behind [[Cape Bojador]] "allowing to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual servitude." {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Later, the 1481 Papal bull ''[[Aeterni regis]]'' granted all lands south of the [[Canary Islands]] to the Portuguese Empire, while in May 1493, the Aragonese-born Pope [[Alexander VI]]decreed in the Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] Islands should belong to the [[Spanish Empire]] while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to [[Portugal]]. These arrangements were later confirmed in the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

==American origins==
The European origins of racism spread to the Americas alongside the Europeans, but establishment views were questioned when applied to indigenous peoples. After the discovery of the New World many of the clergy sent to the New World, educated in the new Humane values of the [[Renaissance]] blooming but still new in Europe and not ratified by the Vatican, began to criticize Spain and their own Church's treatment and views of indigenous peoples and slaves.

In December 1511, [[Antonio de Montesinos]], a Dominican friar, was the first man to openly rebuke the Spanish authorities and administrators of [[Hispaniola]] for their "cruelty and tyranny" in dealing with the American natives and those forced to labor as slaves. [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] enacted the ''[[Laws of Burgos]]'' and ''Valladolid'' in response. However enforcement was lax, and the [[New Laws]] of 1542 have to be made to take a stronger line. Because some people like Fray [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] questioned not only the Crown but the Papacy at the [[Valladolid Controversy]] whether the Indians were truly men who deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull ''Veritas Ipsa'' or ''[[Sublimis Deus]]'' (1537) confirmed that the Indians and other races were deserving men, ''so long as they became baptized''.&lt;ref name=Johansen110&gt;Johansen, Bruce, ''The Native Peoples of North America'', Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2006, p. 110, quote: "In the Papal bull ''Sublimis deus'' (1537), Pope Paul III declared that Indians were to be regarded as fully human, and that their souls were as immortal as those of Europeans. This edict also outlawed slavery of Indians in any form&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koschorke290"&gt;Koschorke, ''A History of Christianity in Asia, Africa, and Latin America'' (2007), p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, their Christian conversion effort gained momentum along social rights, while leaving the same status recognition unanswered for Africans of Black Race, and legal social racism prevailed towards the Indians or Asians. However, by then the last schism of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had taken place in Europe in those few decades along political lines, and the different views on the Value of human lives of different races were not corrected in the lands of Northern Europe, which would join the [[History of colonialism|Colonial race]] at the end of the century and over the next, as the Portuguese and Spanish Empires waned. It would take another century, with the influence of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] at its height, and its consequent [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] developed at the highest circles of its Court, to return these previously inconclusive issues to the forefront of the political discourse championed by many intellectual men since [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. These issues gradually permeated to the lower social levels, where they were a reality lived by men and women of different races from the European racial majority.

==Quaker initiatives==

[[File:1867 JohnBrowns Blessing byTNoble NYHistoricalSociety.png|thumb|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s blessing]]
Prior to the [[American Revolution]], a small group of [[Quakers]] including [[John Woolman]] and [[Anthony Benezet]] successfully persuaded their fellow members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] to free their slaves, divest from the [[slave trade]], and create unified Quaker policies against slavery. This afforded their tiny religious denomination some moral authority to help begin the [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]] movement on both sides of the Atlantic. [[John Woolman|Woolman]] died of smallpox in [[England]] in 1775, shortly after crossing the Atlantic to bring his anti-slavery message to the Quakers of the [[British Isles]].

During and after the [[American Revolution]], Quaker ministrations and preachings against slavery began to spread beyond their movement.  In 1783, 300 Quakers, chiefly from the London area, presented the British Parliament with their signatures on the first petition against the slave trade. In 1785, Englishman Thomas Clarkson, enrolled at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], and in the course of writing an essay in Latin (''Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare'' (Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?), read the works of [[Anthony Benezet|Benezet]], and began a lifelong effort to outlaw the [[slave trade]] in England. In 1787, sympathizers formed the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]], a small non-denominational group that could lobby more successfully by incorporating Anglicans, who, unlike the Quakers, could lawfully sit in Parliament. The twelve founding members included nine Quakers, and three pioneering Anglicans: [[Granville Sharp]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], and [[William Wilberforce]] – all evangelical Christians.

==Later successes==
Later successes in opposing racism were won by the abolitionist movement, both in [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|England]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|United States]]. &lt;!-- The preceding statement is inaccurate with regards to the United States. The first major successes were as a result of the "free soil" movement. When the Abolition movement finally came to realize that incremental advancement is better than no advancement and united forces with Lincoln's Free Soil movement - the result was the rebellion of 1861. --&gt; Though many Abolitionists did not regard blacks or [[mulatto]]s as equal to whites, they did in general believe in [[freedom (political)|freedom]] and often even [[equal protection|equality of treatment for all people]]. A few, like [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], went further. Brown was willing to die on behalf of, as he said, "millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments&amp;nbsp;..." Many black Abolitionists, such as [[Frederick Douglass]], explicitly argued for the humanity of blacks and mulattoes, and for the equality of all people.

Prior to and during the [[American Civil War]], racial egalitarianism in the North became much stronger and more generally disseminated. The success of [[Buffalo Soldier|black troops]] in the [[Union Army]] had a dramatic impact on Northern sentiment. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was a notable example of this shift in political attitudes, although it notably did not completely extinguish legal slavery in several states. After the war, the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] government passed the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendments]] to the Constitution to guarantee the rights of blacks and mulattoes. Many ex-slaves had access to education for the first time. Blacks and mulattoes were also allowed to vote, which meant that African-Americans were elected to [[Congress of the United States of America|Congress]] in numbers not equaled until the Voting Rights Act and the Warren Court helped re-enfranchise black Americans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Due to resistance in the [[Southern United States|South]], however, and a general collapse of idealism in the North, Reconstruction ended, and gave way to the [[nadir of American race relations]]. The period from about 1890 to 1920 saw the re-establishment of [[Jim Crow laws]]. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who regarded Reconstruction as a disaster, segregated the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_segregation.html|title=The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow . Jim Crow Stories . Segregation in the U. S. Government |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ku Klux Klan]] grew to its greatest peak of popularity and strength. [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' was a movie sensation.

In 1911 the [[First Universal Races Congress]] met in London, at which distinguished speakers from many countries for four days discussed race problems and ways to improve interracial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rhr.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/2005/92/99|title=Introduction: New Historical Perspectives on the First Universal Races Congress of 1911|journal=Radical History Review|first=I. C.|last=Fletcher|date=1 April 2005|publisher=|volume=2005|issue=92|pages=99–102|doi=10.1215/01636545-2005-92-99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific anti-racism==

[[Friedrich Tiedemann]] was one of the first people scientifically to contest racism. In 1836, using craniometric and brain measurements (taken by him from Europeans and black people from different parts of the world), he refuted the belief of many contemporary naturalists and anatomists that black people have smaller brains and are thus intellectually inferior to white people, saying it was scientifically unfounded and based merely on the prejudiced opinions of travelers and explorers.&lt;ref&gt;Tiedemann, Friedrich. ''On the Brain of the Negro, compared with that of the european and the orang-outang. IN: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. VOL:126 (1836). http://laboratoriogene.info/Ciencia_Hoje/Tiedemann_1836.pdf''.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Charles Darwin]] wrote in 1871 that ‘[i]t may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant’ and that ‘[a]lthough the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, &amp;c., yet if their whole structure be taken into consideration they are found to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points.’&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. ''The Descent of Man https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man_(Darwin)/Chapter_VII''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 20th century, the work of anthropologists trying to end the [[paradigm]]s of [[cultural evolutionism]] and [[social Darwinism]] within social sciences—anthropologists like [[Franz Boas]], [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Pierre Clastres]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—began the initiative to the end of racism in human sciences and establish [[cultural relativism]] as the new dominant paradigm.

==Racial equality: Paris 1919==
{{main article|Racial Equality Proposal}}

Japan first proposed articles dedicated to the elimination of racial discrimination to be added to the rules of the [[League of Nations]]. This was the first proposal concerning the international elimination of racial discrimination in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Although the proposal received a majority (11 out of 16) of votes, the chairman, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], overturned it saying that important issues should be unanimously approved. [[Billy Hughes]]&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web|first=L.F.|last=Fitzhardinge|title=Hughes, William Morris (Billy) (1862–1952)|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090395b.htm|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Cook]] vigorously opposed it as it undermined the [[White Australia policy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Revival in the United States==
{{main article|Harlem Renaissance|Civil Rights Movement}}
Opposition to racism revived in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Franz Boas]], [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Margaret Mead]], and [[Ashley Montagu]] argued for the equality of humans across races and cultures. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was a very visible advocate for minority rights during this period. [[Anti-capitalist]] organizations like the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], which gained popularity during 1905–1926, were explicitly egalitarian.

Beginning with the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and continuing into the 1960s, many [[African-American]] writers argued forcefully against racism.

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Jim Crow laws]] were repealed in the South and blacks finally re-won the right to vote in Southern states. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was an influential force, and his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech is an exemplary condensation of his egalitarian ideology.

==Influence==
[[File:Crowd at Demonstration.jpg|thumb|right|Crowd rallying at a demonstration in [[Israel]] against manifestations of racism and discrimination.]]
Egalitarianism has been a catalyst for [[feminism]], [[anti-war]], and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements. [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s opposition to the [[Mexican–American War]], for example, was based in part on his fear that the U.S. was using the war as an excuse to expand [[History of slavery in the United States|American slavery]] into new territories. Thoreau's response was chronicled in his famous essay "[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]", which in turn helped ignite [[Gandhi]]'s successful campaign against the British in India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Gandhi's example in turn inspired the American civil rights movement.

As [[James Loewen]] notes in ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me]]'': "Throughout the world, from Africa to [[Northern Ireland]], movements of oppressed people continue to use tactics and words borrowed from our abolitionist and civil rights movements." In [[East Germany]], revolutionary [[Iran]], [[Tiananmen Square]], and [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|South Africa]], images, words, and tactics developed by human rights supporters have been used regularly and repeatedly.

Many of these uses have been controversial. In [[Zimbabwe]], [[Robert Mugabe]] has used anti-racist rhetoric to promote a [[land distribution]] scheme whereby privately held land is confiscated from white Rhodesians and distributed to blacks, which has resulted in widespread starvation (see [[Land reform in Zimbabwe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/698175.stm|title=UK anger over Zimbabwe violence|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,,2048032,00.html|title=Corrupt, greedy and violent: Mugabe attacked by Catholic bishops after years of silence|first=Chris|last=McGreal|date=1 April 2007|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sentamu&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2970781.ece Sentamu urges Mugabe action] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015095634/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2970781.ece |date=October 15, 2007|publisher= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of bacterial phylodynamics has increased substantially due to the advancement of [[next-generation sequencing]] and the amount of data available.

== Methods ==

=== Novel hypothesis (study design) ===
Studies can be designed to observe intra-host or inter-host interactions.  Bacterial phylodynamic studies usually focus on inter-host interactions with samples from many different hosts in a specific geographical location or several different geographical locations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The most important part of a study design is how to organize the sampling strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, the number of sampled time points, the sampling interval, and the number of sequences per time point are crucial to phylodynamic analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Sampling bias]] causes problems when looking at a diverse taxological samples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For example, sampling from a limited geographical location may impact effective population size.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biek|first=Roman|last2=Pybus|first2=Oliver G.|last3=Lloyd-Smith|first3=James O.|last4=Didelot|first4=Xavier|title=Measurably evolving pathogens in the genomic era|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534715000683|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=30|issue=6|pages=306–313|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.009|pmc=4457702|pmid=25887947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generating data ===

==== Experimental settings ====
Sequencing of the genome or genomic regions and what sequencing technique to use is an important experimental setting to phylodynamic analysis.  Whole genome sequencing is often performed on bacterial genomes, although depending on the design of the study, many different methods can be utilized for phylodynamic analysis.  Bacterial genomes are much larger and have a slower evolutionary rate then RNA viruses, limiting studies on the bacterial phylodynamics.  The advancement of sequencing technology has made bacterial phylodynamics possible but proper preparation of the whole bacterial genomes is mandatory.

===== Alignment =====
When a new dataset with samples for phylodynamic analysis are obtained, the sequences in the new data set are aligned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A [[BLAST|BLAST search]] is frequently executed to find similar strains of the pathogen of interest. Sequences collected from BLAST for an alignment will need the proper information to be added to a data set, such as sample collection date and geographical location of the sample.  [[Multiple sequence alignment|Multiple sequence alignment algorithms]] (e.g., MUSCLE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Robert C.|date=2004-01-01|title=MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1792–1797|doi=10.1093/nar/gkh340|issn=1362-4962|pmc=390337|pmid=15034147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MAFFT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katoh|first=Kazutaka|last2=Misawa|first2=Kazuharu|last3=Kuma|first3=Kei-ichi|last4=Miyata|first4=Takashi|date=2002-07-15|title=MAFFT: a novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=14|pages=3059–3066|issn=0305-1048|pmc=135756|pmid=12136088}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clustal|CLUSAL W]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larkin|first=M. A.|last2=Blackshields|first2=G.|last3=Brown|first3=N. P.|last4=Chenna|first4=R.|last5=McGettigan|first5=P. A.|last6=McWilliam|first6=H.|last7=Valentin|first7=F.|last8=Wallace|first8=I.

After the running a multiple sequence alignment algorithm, manual editing the alignment is highly recommended.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Multiple sequence alignment algorithms can leave a large amount of indels in the sequence alignment when the indels do not exist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Manually editing the indels in the data set will allow a more accurate phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Quality control =====
In order to have an accurate phylodynamic analysis, quality control methods must be performed.  This includes checking the samples in the data set for possible contamination, measuring phylogenetic signal of the sequences, and checking the sequences for possible signs of recombinant strains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Contamination of samples in the data set can be excluded with by various laboratory methods and by proper DNA/RNA extraction methods.  There are several way to check for phylogenetic signal in an alignment, such as likelihood mapping, transition/transversions versus divergence plots, and the Xia test for saturation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  If phylogenetic signal of an alignment is too low then a longer alignment or an alignment of another gene in the organism may be necessary to perform phylogenetic analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Typically substitution saturation is only in issue in data sets with viral sequences.  Most algorithms used for phylogenetic analysis do not take into recombination into account, which can alter the molecular clock and coalescent estimates of a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Strains that show signs of recombination should either be excluded from the data set or analyzed on their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Data analysis ===

==== Evolutionary model ====

The best fitting [[Models of DNA evolution|nucleotide or amino acid substitution model]] for a [[multiple sequence alignment]] is the first step in phylodynamic analysis.  This can be accomplished with several different algorithms (e.g., IQTREE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Lam-Tung|last2=Schmidt|first2=Heiko A.|last3=von Haeseler|first3=Arndt|last4=Minh|first4=Bui Quang|date=2015-01-01|title=IQ-TREE: A Fast and Effective Stochastic Algorithm for Estimating Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenies|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/1/268/2925592/IQ-TREE-A-Fast-and-Effective-Stochastic-Algorithm|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=32|issue=1|pages=268–274|doi=10.1093/molbev/msu300|issn=0737-4038|pmc=4271533|pmid=25371430}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEGA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sudhir|last2=Stecher|first2=Glen|last3=Tamura|first3=Koichiro|date=2016-07-01|title=MEGA7: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Version 7.0 for Bigger Datasets|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=33|issue=7|pages=1870–1874|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw054|issn=1537-1719|pmid=27004904}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Phylogeny inference ====

There are several different methods to infer phylogenies.  These include methods include tree building algorithms such as [[UPGMA]], [[neighbor joining]], [[maximum parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hypothesis testing ===

====  Assessing phylogenetic support ====

Testing the reliability of the tree after inferring its phylogeny, is a crucial step in the phylodynamic pipeline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Methods to test the reliability of a tree include [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], [[maximum likelihood estimation]], and [[Posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] in [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Phylodynamics inference ====

Several methods are used to assess phylodynamic reliability of a data set.  These methods include estimating the data set's [[molecular clock]], demographic history, population structure, [[gene flow]], and selection analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Phylodynamic results of a data set can also influence better study designs in future experiments.

== Examples ==

=== Phylodynamics of cholera ===
[[Cholera]] is a diarrheal disease that is caused by the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]].''   ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' has been a popular bacterium for phylodynamic analysis after the [[2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti]].  The cholera outbreak happened right after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake in Haiti]], which caused critical infrastructure damage, leading to the conclusion that the outbreak was most likely due to the ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' bacterium being introduced naturally to the waters in Haiti from the earthquake.  Soon after the earthquake, the [[United Nations|UN]] sent [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] troops from Nepal to Haiti.  Rumors started circulating about terrible conditions of the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] camp, as well as people claiming that the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] troops were deposing of their waste in the [[Artibonite River]], which is the major water source in the surrounding area.  Soon after the MINUSTAH troops arrival, the first cholera case was reported near the location of the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] camp.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piarroux|first=Renaud|title=Understanding the Cholera Epidemic, Haiti|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/7/11-0059_article|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1161–1168|doi=10.3201/eid1707.110059|pmc=3381400|pmid=21762567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phylodynamic analysis was used to look into the source of the Haiti cholera outbreak.  Whole genome sequencing of ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' revealed that there was one single point source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti and it was similar to O1 strains circulating in South Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orata|first=Fabini D.|last2=Keim|first2=Paul S.|last3=Boucher|first3=Yan|date=2014-04-03|title=The 2010 Cholera Outbreak in Haiti: How Science Solved a Controversy|url=http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003967|journal=PLOS Pathogens|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1003967|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003967|issn=1553-7374|pmc=3974815|pmid=24699938}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Before the MINUSTAH troops from Nepal were sent to Haiti, a cholera outbreak had just occurred in Nepal.  In the original research to trace the origin of the outbreak, the Nepal strains were not available.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;   Phylodynamic analyses were performed on the Haitian strain and the Nepalese strain when it became available and affirmed that the Haitian cholera strain was the most similar to the Nepalese cholera strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Lee S.|last2=Petkau|first2=Aaron|last3=Beaulaurier|first3=John|last4=Tyler|first4=Shaun|last5=Antonova|first5=Elena S.|last6=Turnsek|first6=Maryann A.|last7=Guo|first7=Yan|last8=Wang|first8=Susana|last9=Paxinos|first9=Ellen E.|date=2013-08-30|title=Evolutionary Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae O1 following a Single-Source Introduction to Haiti|url=http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/4/e00398-13|journal=mBio|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e00398–13|doi=10.1128/mBio.00398-13|issn=2150-7511|pmc=3705451|pmid=23820394}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This outbreak strain of cholera in Haiti showed signs of an altered or hybrid strain of ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' associated with high virulence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Typically high quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (hqSNP) from whole genome ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' sequences are used for phylodynamic analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Using phylodynamic analysis to study cholera helps prediction and understanding of ''V. cholerae'' evolution during bacterial epidemics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:De mulieribus claris - Camiola paga il riscatto di Orlando.jpg|thumb|Miniature from ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', representing Camiola]]
'''Camiola Turinga''' was from [[Messina]] and was known as a virtuous woman. She was the daughter of Lawrence of [[Thuringia]]. She lived in the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the time of the reign of [[Frederick III of Sicily]]. When her husband and parents died she inherited much wealth and was known for handling this large fortune in a moral fashion.

[[Boccaccio]], as a medieval historian and early Renaissance [[archaeology|archaeologist]], describes the events that happened that lead up to her becoming a widow when she was still a young lady. He says in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' in the next to the last biography that when king [[Frederick III of Sicily]] died, his eldest son Peter took over. Right after that time Godfrey of [[Squillace]], commander for king [[Robert of Sicily]], attacked the town of [[Lipari]]. The townspeople were overwhelmed and practically wiped out. Peter then gathered together an army of [[mercenaries]] and volunteer auxiliary troops. He put them into the command of a Count John of Chiaamonte. John's mission was to bring much needed supplies for the starving people of Lipari.

When Godfrey learned that John's army outnumbered his own, he abandoned his camp and left all his supplies there. John then came upon these supplies and took back to the people of Lipari. Then with overconfidence John challenged Godfrey to battle. Godfrey accepted the challenge. He prepared and reinforced his troops overnight and was fully prepared in the morning. John, being overconfident, did not expect Godfrey to attack, assuming instead that he Godfrey would retreat.

Godfrey's men attacked the Sicilians with much vigor. The Sicilians under John's command were stunned with the onslaught. Hand-to-hand combat took place on the Sicilian ships. The Sicilians ultimately lost confidence, since they were not fully prepared for such an attack. They then took whatever ships were still seaworthy and hightailed it. Many of the Sicilian ships were sunk and victory was within grasp for Godfrey. Even though some of John's ships were able to get away, John himself along with some princes and missionaries, were captured. The town of Lipari surrendered and sued for peace.

The prisoners were then taken to [[Naples]] and jailed. Among the prisoners was [[Roland of Sicily]], an illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily]].  Ransom was paid for all the prisoners, and they were all released, except for one - Roland. King Peter hated his brother and all the others under John's command because of their incompetence and how they handled the attack of Godfrey.

Now enters Camiola. She remembers him when they both were children. Rolan was in prison with no hope of getting out. She saw that Peter and his other brothers were willing to let him rot in jail and wished to do something about this. It turned out that there was no legal way of getting him out - except marrying him! She sent secretly to Roland a proposition on this matter. Roland jumped at the opportunity: anything to be able to get out of jail. In fact, that is all he really wanted and would say and promise anything just to get out. Camiola then legally drew up all the necessary documents and arranged for his release. She had to pay two thousand ounces of silver for his release, which was half her wealth. She handed over the agreed amount to gain his release.

Roland was returned to Messina a free man. Immediately he acted like there was no arrangement of a marriage and had no appreciation for his release. Camiola was totally taken off guard because of his attitude and confronted him. She first diplomatically tried an arrangement for the marriage to take place, however Roland would have nothing to do with it.  Ultimately he was brought up in front of an ecclesiastical judge. She proved to the judge that she had a 
legal and binding signed contract for marriage in return for Roland's release out of prison. She showed to the judge that Roland agreed to this and in return was to marry her for his release out of an otherwise hopeless situation of being imprisoned for the rest of his life.

Upon the judge making the decision that Rolan was wrong in not fulfilling his obligation, he admitted to his mistake however still did not want to marry her. His brothers and friends then got involved and convinced Roland that it was the right thing to do. Roland then decided he would marry her and
came to her with this proposal with his friends. She however at this point gave a lengthy speech. From that time forward, she could not be swayed by either the plebs or reprimands from her high moral standards which she had already shown. Roland, however, was scorned by everyone from then on, including his immediate family.

He served as the Lebanese representative to the [[United Nations]], the President of the [[Commission on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations General Assembly]], a member of the [[Lebanese Cabinet]], a national minister of Education and the Arts, and of Foreign Affairs and Emigration, and [[theologian]]. He was responsible for the drafting and adoption of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

==Birth and education==
Born in [[Btourram]], [[Lebanon]], Malik was the son of Dr. Habib Malik and Zarifa Karam. Malik was the great-nephew of the renowned author [[Farah Antun]]. Malik was educated at the American Mission School for Boys, now [[Tripoli Evangelical School]] for Girls and Boys in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and the [[American University of Beirut]], where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics. He moved on to [[Cairo]] in 1929, where he developed an interest in philosophy, which he proceeded to study at [[Harvard]] (under [[Alfred North Whitehead]]) and in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], Germany under [[Martin Heidegger]] in 1932. His stay in Germany, however, was short-lived. He found the policies of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] unfavorable, and left soon after they came to power in 1933. In 1937, he received his [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy (based on [[metaphysics]] in the philosophies of Whitehead and Heidegger) from [[Harvard University]]. He taught there as well as at other universities in the United States. After returning to Lebanon, Malik founded the Philosophy Department at the American University of Beirut, as well as a cultural studies program (the 'civilization sequence program',&lt;ref&gt;Now: Civilization Studies Program, AUB http://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Pages/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; now 'Civilization Studies Program'). He remained in this capacity until 1945 when he was appointed to be the [[Lebanese Ambassador to the United States]] and the [[Ambassador to the United Nations|United Nations]].

== In the United Nations==
Malik represented Lebanon at the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco conference]] at which the [[United Nations]] was founded. He served as a rapporteur for the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]] in 1947 and 1948, when he became President of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]]. The same year, he helped to draft the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] with Chair and President of the Human Rights Commission, U.S. [[Delegate]] to the [[U.N. General Assembly]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. He succeeded Mrs. Roosevelt as the Human Rights Commission's Chair. He remained as ambassador to the US and UN until 1955. He was an outspoken participant in debates in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and often criticized the [[Soviet Union]]. After a three-year absence, he returned in 1958 to preside over the thirteenth session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/ga/55/president/bio13.htm | title = DR. CHARLES HABIB MALIK - 13th Session | publisher = United Nations| accessdate = November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles in Lebanon==
Meanwhile, Malik had been appointed to the [[Cabinet of Lebanon|Lebanese Cabinet]]. He was [[Ministry of Education and Higher Education (Lebanon)|Minister of National Education and Fine Arts]] in 1956 and 1957, and [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (Lebanon)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1956 to 1958. While a Minister, he was elected to the [[National Assembly of Lebanon|National Assembly]] in 1957, and served there for three years.

Following the outbreak of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], which raged from 1975 to 1990, Malik helped to found the [[Front for Freedom and Man in Lebanon]], which he named as such, to defend the Christian cause. It was later renamed the [[Lebanese Front]]. A [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox Christian]], he was the only non-[[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] among the Front's top leaders, who included [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist Party]] founder [[Pierre Gemayel]] and former [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] and [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] leader [[Camille Chamoun]]. Malik was widely regarded as the brains of the Front, in which the other politicians were the brawn.

Malik was also noted as a theologian who successfully reached across confessional lines, appealing to his fellow [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], and [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]] alike. The author of numerous commentaries on the [[Bible]] and on the writings of the early [[Church Fathers]], Malik was one of the few Orthodox theologians of his time to be widely known in Evangelical circles, and the evangelical leader [[Bill Bright]] spoke well of him and quoted him. Partly owing to Malik's ecumenical appeal, as well as to his academic credentials, he served as President of the [[World Council on Christian Education]] from 1967 to 1971, and as Vice-President of the [[United Bible Societies]] from 1966 to 1972.

Malik also famously worked alongside fellow Lebanese diplomat and philosopher [[Karim Azkoul]].&lt;ref name="Malik/Azkoul"&gt;{{cite web|last=Elias|first=Amin|title=La liberté de conversion : le débat dans l'Islam est désormais quotidien|url=http://www.oasiscenter.eu/fr/node/6579|publisher=Fondazione Internazionale Oasis|accessdate=24 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314135508/http://www.oasiscenter.eu/fr/node/6579|archivedate=14 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = General Assembly Continues Middle East Debate|url = http://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/139/0139759.html|website = www.unmultimedia.org|date = 1958-08-19|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = UN|last = Photo/YES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lebanese Delegation to the 12th Session of the UN General Assembly|url = http://www.unmultimedia.org/s/photo/detail/139/0139890.html|website = www.unmultimedia.org|date = 1957-09-25|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = UN|last = Photo/TW}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is related to founder of post colonial studies, [[Edward Said]] through marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward W.|year=1999|title=Out of Place|publisher=Vintage Books, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Malik returned to his academic career in 1960. He traveled extensively, lectured on human rights and other subjects, and held professorships at a number of American universities including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the [[American University]] in Washington, DC, [[Dartmouth College]] ([[New Hampshire]]), [[University of Notre Dame]] ([[Indiana]]). In 1981, he was also a [[Pascal Lecturer]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] in [[Canada]]. His last official post was with [[The Catholic University of America]] (Washington, DC), where he served as a [[Jacques Maritain]] Distinguished Professor of Moral and Political Philosophy from 1981 to 1983. He also returned to his old chair in Philosophy at the American University of Beirut (1962 to 1976) and was appointed Dean of Graduate Studies. Malik has been awarded a world record of 50 [[honorary degree]]s; the originals are in his archives in Notre Dame University, Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Death==
Malik died of complications due to kidney failure, secondary to atheroembolic disease sustained after a cardiac catheterization, performed at the [[Mayo Clinic]] two years earlier, in Beirut on 28 December 1987. His son, [[Habib Malik]], is a prominent academic (with expertise in the history of ideas, and associate professor in the humanities division at the [[Lebanese American University]]) and also a human rights activist. He was also survived by his brother, the late Father Ramzi Habib Malik, a prominent Catholic priest who worked tirelessly for the cause of Christian reconciliation with the [[Jewish]] people as well as for the belief that the Jewish People are the elder brothers of the Christians.
Malik's personal papers are housed in [[Notre Dame University]], Lebanon, where 200 of his personal papers and books are stored, and in the [[Library of Congress]], [[Washington D.C.]], where his heritage occupies 44 meters of shelves in the special collection area.

'''Chinua Achebe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|n|w|ɑː|_|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|b|eɪ}}; born '''Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe''', 16 November 1930&amp;nbsp;– 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and critic.&lt;ref name="EO 6"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  His first novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' (1958), often considered his best,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Ruth.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories as a university student. After graduation, he worked for the [[Nigerian Broadcasting Service]] (NBS) and soon moved to the metropolis of [[Lagos]]. He gained worldwide attention for his novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' in the late 1950s; his later novels include ''[[No Longer at Ease]]'' (1960), ''[[Arrow of God]]'' (1964), ''[[A Man of the People]]'' (1966), and ''[[Anthills of the Savannah]]'' (1987). Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a "language of colonisers", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture ''[[An Image of Africa|An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"]]'' featured a famous criticism of [[Joseph Conrad]] as "a thoroughgoing racist"; it was later published in ''[[The Massachusetts Review]]'' amid some controversy.

When the region of [[Biafra]] broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a supporter of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the new nation. The civil war that took place over the territory, commonly known as the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafran War]], ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.

A titled Igbo [[chieftain]] himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nnamdi Ken Amobi |date=13 April 2013 |title=Chinua Achebe: Ogidi man first, Ogidi man last |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/04/chinua-achebe-ogidi-man-first-ogidi-man-last/ |newspaper=Vanguard |location=Lagos |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe's novels focus on the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and after the colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.

Upon his return to the United States in 1990, he began an eighteen-year tenure at [[Bard College]] as the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature. From 2009 until his death, he served as David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at [[Brown University]].

==Biography==
Chinua Achebe was born on 16 November 1930. Achebe's parents, Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, were converts to the [[Protestant]] [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Achebe stopped practicing the religion of his ancestors, but he respected its traditions. Achebe's unabbreviated name, Chinualumogu ("May God fight on my behalf"&lt;ref name="EO 7"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;), was a prayer for divine protection and stability.&lt;ref name="EO 7"/&gt; His first novel is ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' (1958), ''[[Anthills of Savannah]]''(1987), and his last ''[[There Was a Country]]'' originally published in (2012). The Achebe family had five other surviving children, named in a similar fusion of traditional words relating to their new religion: Frank Okwuofu, John Chukwuemeka Ifeanyichukwu, Zinobia Uzoma, Augustine Ndubisi, and Grace Nwanneka.&lt;ref name="EO 7"/&gt;

===Early life===
Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930.&lt;ref name="EO 7"/&gt; Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of [[Ogidi, Anambra|Ogidi]], in what is now the state of [[Anambra State|Anambra]].&lt;ref name="EO 6"/&gt;

[[Image:Nigeria linguistical map 1979.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of Nigeria's [[Languages of Nigeria|linguistic groups]]. Achebe's homeland, the [[Igboland|Igbo region]] (archaically spelt ''Ibo''), lies in the central south.]]

Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books&amp;nbsp;– including a prose adaptation of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678).&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade ceremonies]], which he recreated later in his novels and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended [[Sunday school]] every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when [[apostate]]s from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in ''[[Things Fall Apart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achebe 1994, pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 12, Achebe moved away from his family to the village of [[Nekede]], four kilometres from [[Owerri]]. He enrolled as a student at the Central School, where his older brother John taught.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nekede, Achebe gained an appreciation for [[Mbari (art)|Mbari]], a traditional art form that seeks to invoke the gods' protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; (He would later suggest the name for the [[Mbari Writers and Artists Club]] that was founded in Ibadan by [[Ulli Beier]] and others in 1961.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mbari-Mbayo-Club "Mbari Mbayo Club"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookshybooks.com/2014/10/54-years-of-nigerian-literature-mbari.html "54 Years of Nigerian Literature: The Mbari Club"], Bookshy, 30 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When the time came to change to secondary school, in 1944, Achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious Dennis Memorial Grammar School in [[Onitsha]] and the even more prestigious [[Government College Umuahia|Government College]] in [[Umuahia]].&lt;ref name="EO 22"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeled on the British public school, and funded by the colonial administration, Government College was established in 1929 to educate Nigeria's future elite.&lt;ref name="EO 22"/&gt; It had rigorous academic standards and was vigorously elitist, accepting boys purely on the basis of ability.&lt;ref name="EO 22"/&gt; The language of the school was English, not only to develop proficiency but also to provide a common tongue for pupils from different Nigerian language groups.&lt;ref name = "EO 30"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe described this later as being ordered to "put away their different mother tongues and communicate in the language of their colonisers".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule was strictly enforced and Achebe recalls that his first punishment was for asking another boy to pass the soap in Igbo.&lt;ref name = "EO 30"/&gt;

Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in his first year, completing the first two years' studies in one, and spending only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen and belonged instead to a group of six exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from five to six o'clock in the afternoon (though other activities and other books were allowed).&lt;ref name="EO 26"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe started to explore the school's "wonderful library".&lt;ref name="QEO 26"&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; There he discovered [[Booker T. Washington]]'s ''[[Up from Slavery]]'' (1901), the autobiography of an American former slave; Achebe "found it sad, but it showed him another dimension of reality".&lt;ref name="EO 26"/&gt; He also read classic novels, such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (1850), and ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883), together with tales of colonial derring-do such as [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s ''[[Allan Quatermain]]'' (1887) and [[John Buchan]]'s ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'' (1910). Achebe later recalled that, as a reader, he "took sides with the white characters against the savages"&lt;ref name="QEO 26"/&gt; and even developed a dislike for Africans. "The white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous. The savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or, at the most, cunning. I hated their guts."&lt;ref name="QEO 26"/&gt;

====University====
[[Image:Ibadan street scene.jpg|thumb|right|Street in [[Ibadan]], 2007]]
In 1948, in preparation for independence, Nigeria's first university opened.&lt;ref name="EO 34"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as University College (now the [[University of Ibadan]]), it was an associate college of the [[University of London]]. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a [[bursary]] to study medicine.&lt;ref name="EO 34"/&gt; It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading [[Joyce Cary]]'s 1939 work ''[[Mister Johnson (novel)|Mister Johnson]]'' about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons that he decided to become a writer.&lt;ref name="Bard College-2001" /&gt; Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist as a sign of the author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

He abandoned the study of medicine and changed to English, history, and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Because he switched his field, however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government [[bursary]], and his family also donated money&amp;nbsp;– his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home from his job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These include [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Wole Soyinka]], poet and playwright [[John Pepper Clark]], and poet [[Christopher Okigbo]].&lt;ref&gt;July, p. 64; Laurence, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elechi Amadi]] is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although he was in the faculty of sciences.

In 1950 Achebe wrote a piece for the ''University Herald'' entitled "Polar Undergraduate", his debut as an author. It used irony and humour to celebrate the intellectual vigour of his classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with other essays and letters about philosophy and freedom in academia, some of which were published in another campus magazine, ''The Bug''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the ''Herald'''s editor during the 1951–52 school year.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the university, Achebe wrote his first short story, "In a Village Church", which combines details of life in rural Nigeria with Christian institutions and icons, a style which appears in many of his later works.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Other short stories he wrote during his time at Ibadan (including "The Old Order in Conflict with the New" and "Dead Men's Path") examine conflicts between tradition and [[modernity]], with an eye toward dialogue and understanding on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; When a professor named Geoffrey Parrinder arrived at the university to teach [[comparative religion]], Achebe began to explore the fields of Christian history and African traditional religions.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the final examinations at Ibadan in 1953, Achebe was awarded a second-class degree. Rattled by not receiving the highest level, he was uncertain how to proceed after graduation. He returned to his hometown of Ogidi to sort through his options.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching and producing===
While he meditated on his possible career paths, Achebe was visited by a friend from the university, who convinced him to apply for an English teaching position at the Merchants of Light school at [[Oba, Nigeria|Oba]]. It was a ramshackle institution with a crumbling infrastructure and a meagre library; the school was built on what the residents called "bad bush"&amp;nbsp;– a section of land thought to be tainted by unfriendly spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in ''Things Fall Apart'', Achebe describes a similar area called the "evil forest", where the Christian missionaries are given a place to build their church.&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1994). The "evil forest" is a place where twins (considered an abomination by the community) are thrown away to die. When the Christian missionaries persevere despite their location, they are able to convince some in the community that the superstition is unwarranted.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The students did not have access to the newspapers he had read as a student, so Achebe made his own available in the classroom. He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria|Nigerian Broadcasting Service]] (NBS), he left the school and moved to [[Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lagos Island.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lagos]] in 2007]]

The NBS, a radio network started in 1933 by the [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial government]],&lt;ref&gt;Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria. [http://www.radionigeriaonline.com/aboutus.html "About Us"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025013028/http://www.radionigeriaonline.com/aboutus.html |date=25 October 2007 }}. Online at [http://www.radionigeriaonline.com/index.php Radio Nigeria Online]. Retrieved 15 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; assigned Achebe to the Talks Department, preparing scripts for oral delivery. This helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language, a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Lagos also made a significant impression on him. A huge [[conurbation]], the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages. Achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and later drew upon his experiences when describing the city in his 1960 novel ''[[No Longer at Ease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Lagos, Achebe started work on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, although [[Amos Tutuola]]'s ''Palm-Wine Drinkard'' (1952) and [[Cyprian Ekwensi]]'s ''People of the City'' (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered the creation of the Nigerian novel itself.&lt;ref name="Ezenwa1"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; A visit to Nigeria by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1956 brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1956 he was selected at the Staff School run by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named [[Gilbert Phelps]], to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.&lt;ref name="Ezenwa1"/&gt;

===''Things Fall Apart''===
{{Main|Things Fall Apart}}
Back in Nigeria, Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel (now titled ''Things Fall Apart'', after a line in the poem "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]" by [[W. B. Yeats]]). He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose. By 1957, he had sculpted it to his liking, and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service. He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the ₤22 fee) to the London company. After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service, Achebe began to worry. His boss at the [[Nigerian Broadcasting Service|NBS]], Angela Beattie, was going to London for her annual leave; he asked her to visit the company. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored in the corner of the office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, "I would have been so discouraged that I would probably have given up altogether."&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Things Fall Apart books 02.jpg|thumb|left|A spiral stack of the 1994 Anchor Books edition of ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'']]

In 1958, Achebe sent his novel to the agent recommended by Gilbert Phelps in London. It was sent to several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it reached the office of [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]], where executives hesitated until an educational adviser, Donald MacRae, just back in England after a trip through West Africa, read the book and forced the company's hand with his succinct report: "This is the best novel I have read since the war".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Alan (1991). Quoted in Petersen, reprinted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinemann published 2,000 hardcover copies of ''Things Fall Apart'' on 17 June 1958. According to Alan Hill, employed by the publisher at the time, the company did not "touch a word of it" in preparation for release.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was received well by the British press, and received positive reviews from critic [[Walter Allen]] and novelist [[Angus Wilson]]. Three days after publication, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that the book "genuinely succeeds in presenting tribal life from the inside". ''[[The Observer]]'' called it "an excellent novel", and the literary magazine ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' said that "Mr. Achebe's style is a model for aspirants".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reception in Nigeria was mixed. When Hill tried to promote the book in West Africa, he was met with scepticism and ridicule. The faculty at the University of Ibadan was amused at the thought of a worthwhile novel being written by an alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more supportive; one review in the magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]'' said: "The book as a whole creates for the reader such a vivid picture of Igbo life that the plot and characters are little more than symbols representing a way of life lost irrevocably within living memory."&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book Okonkwo struggles with the legacy of his father&amp;nbsp;– a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute&amp;nbsp;– as well as the complications and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia.&lt;ref&gt;Achebe 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes of his earlier stories, which grew from his own background.

''Things Fall Apart'' went on to become one of the most important books in [[African literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Booker, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Selling over 20 million copies around the world, it was translated into 57 languages, making Achebe the most translated African writer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/565351/things-fall-apart-by-chinua-achebe/9780385474542/|title=THINGS FALL APART by Chinua Achebe {{!}} PenguinRandomHouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, in recognition of its universality, appears in the [[Bokklubben World Library]] collection "proposed by one hundred writers from fifty-four different countries, compiled and organized in 2002 by the Norwegian Book Club. This list endeavors to reflect world literature, with books from all countries, cultures, and time periods." The book is also included in the Encyclopedia Britannica's list of "12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/list/12-novels-considered-the-greatest-book-ever-written|title=12 Novels Considered the 'Greatest Book Ever Written'|date=16 April 2018|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigerian Nobel laureate [[Wole Soyinka]] has described the work as "the first novel in English which spoke from the interior of the African character, rather than portraying the African as an exotic, as the white man would see him."&lt;ref name="Bard College-2001" /&gt;

===Marriage and family===
In the same year ''Things Fall Apart'' was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to [[Enugu]] and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years, and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding; some tension arose early in their union, due to conflicts about attention and communication. However, as their relationship matured, husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first child, a daughter named Chinelo, was born on 11 July 1962. They had a son, Ikechukwu, on 3 December 1964, and another boy named [[Chidi Chike Achebe|Chidi]], on 24 May 1967. When the children began attending school in Lagos, their parents became worried about the world view&amp;nbsp;– especially with regard to race&amp;nbsp;– expressed at the school, especially through the mostly white teachers and books that presented a prejudiced view of African life.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Achebe published his first children's book, ''[[Chike and the River]]'', to address some of these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Biafran War]], the Achebes had another daughter on 7 March 1970, named [[Nwando Achebe|Nwando]]. When asked about his family Achebe stated: "There are few things more important than my family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/nwando-achebe-2/ |title=Nwando Achebe |publisher=history.msu.edu |accessdate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503063619/http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/nwando-achebe-2/ |archivedate=3 May 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nwando|last=Achebe|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=1037_3025_3707&amp;products_id=406796 |title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria |publisher=Indiana University Press|date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nwando|last=Achebe|url=http://www.heinemann.com/products/E07078.aspx |title=Farmers, Traders, Warriors, and King |publisher=Heinemann |date= |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''No Longer at Ease'' and fellowship travels===
In 1960, while they were still dating, Achebe dedicated to Christie Okoli his second novel, ''[[No Longer at Ease]]'', about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of ''Things Fall Apart'''s main character, Okonkwo.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of [[History of Nigeria (1960-1979)|Nigerian independence]]. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional [[Igbo people|Igbo culture]], Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Swahili.svg|thumb|275px|right|A map of the distribution of people using the [[Swahili language]]]]

Later that year, Achebe was awarded a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] for six months of travel, which he called "the first important perk of my writing career";&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe set out for a tour of East Africa. One month after Nigeria achieved its independence, he travelled to [[Kenya]], where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity: [[European ethnic groups|European]], [[Asian people|Asiatic]], [[Arab]], or Other. Shocked and dismayed at being forced into an "Other" identity, he found the situation "almost funny" and took an extra form as a souvenir.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to [[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]] (now united in [[Tanzania]]), he was frustrated by the [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] attitude he observed among non-African hotel clerks and social elites.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe also found in his travels that [[Swahili language|Swahili]] was gaining prominence as a major African language. Radio programs were broadcast in Swahili, and its use was widespread in the countries he visited. Nevertheless, he also found an "apathy" among the people toward literature written in Swahili.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; He met the poet [[Robert Bin Shaaban|Sheikh Shaaban Robert]], who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his Swahili-language work.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now called [[Zambia]]), Achebe found himself sitting in a whites-only section of a bus to [[Victoria Falls]]. Interrogated by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front, he replied, "if you must know I come from [[Nigeria]], and there we sit where we like in the bus."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching the waterfall, he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus, but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Achebe again left Nigeria, this time as part of a Fellowship for Creative Artists awarded by [[UNESCO]]. He travelled to the United States and Brazil. He met with a number of writers from the US, including novelists [[Ralph Ellison]] and [[Arthur Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, he met with several other authors, with whom he discussed the complications of writing in Portuguese. Achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series===
Once he returned to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the [[Voice of Nigeria]] network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 he attended an executive [[African Writers Conference|conference of African writers in English]] at the [[Makerere University College]] in [[Kampala]], Uganda. He met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world, including Ghanaian poet [[Kofi Awoonor]], Nigerian playwright and poet [[Wole Soyinka]], and US poet-author [[Langston Hughes]]. Among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term [[African literature]] ought to include work from the [[diaspora]], or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself. Achebe indicated that it was not "a very significant question",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge. Writing about the conference in several journals, Achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of Africa, and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (signing autographs in London).jpg|thumb|left|Achebe selected the novel ''Weep Not, Child'' by [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] as one of the first titles of Heinemann's [[African Writers Series]].]]

While at Makerere, Achebe was asked to read a novel written by a student (James Ngugi, later known as [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]]) called ''Weep Not, Child''. Impressed, he sent it to Alan Hill at Heinemann, which published it two years later to coincide with its paperback line of books from African writers. Hill indicated this was to remedy a situation where British publishers "regarded West Africa only as a place where you sold books." Achebe was chosen to be General Editor of the [[African Writers Series]], which became a significant force in bringing [[postcolonial literature]] from Africa to the rest of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and he continued in that role until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim Bello-Kano, [http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/86856/print "Chinua Achebe: A non-romantic view"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710023947/http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/86856/print |date=10 July 2013 }}, ''Pambazuka News'', Issue 624, 3 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As these works became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature&amp;nbsp;– especially from Europe&amp;nbsp;– began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled "Where Angels Fear to Tread" in the December 1962 issue of ''Nigeria Magazine''. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He lashed out at those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: "no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' here does not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view)."&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the [[University of Leeds]], presenting his essay "The Novelist as Teacher".&lt;ref&gt;Brendon Nicholls, [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/chinua-achebe-at-leeds/ "Chinua Achebe at Leeds: When the Great Share the Good"], Leeds ''African Studies Bulletin'' 73 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arrow of God''===
Achebe's third book, ''Arrow of God'', was published in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard the story of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew further inspiration a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by [[archaeologist]] [[Charles Thurstan Shaw|Thurstan Shaw]]; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional ''Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger'' referenced at the end of ''Things Fall Apart''), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on ''Arrow of God'' in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Achebe's previous works, ''Arrow'' was roundly praised by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called "certain structural weaknesses".&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written to Achebe, the US writer [[John Updike]] expressed his surprised admiration for the sudden downfall of ''Arrow of God''{{'}}s protagonist. He praised the author's courage to write "an ending few Western novelists would have contrived".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe responded by suggesting that the individualistic hero was rare in African literature, given its roots in communal living and the degree to which characters are "subject to non-human forces in the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Man of the People''===
''A Man of the People'' was published in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu from the village of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend [[John Pepper Clark]] declared: "Chinua, I ''know'' you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!"&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, Nigerian Major [[Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu]] seized control of the northern region of the country as part of a larger coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of his novel had brought Achebe to the attention of military personnel, who suspected him of having foreknowledge of the coup. When he received word of the pursuit, he sent his wife (who was pregnant) and children on a squalid boat through a series of unseen creeks to the Igbo stronghold of [[Port Harcourt]]. They arrived safely, but Christie suffered a [[miscarriage]] at the journey's end. Chinua rejoined them soon afterwards in Ogidi. These cities were safe from military incursion because they were in the southeast, part of the region which would later secede.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the family had resettled in [[Enugu]], Achebe and his friend [[Christopher Okigbo]] started a publishing house called Citadel Press, to improve the quality and increase the quantity of literature available to younger readers. One of its first submissions was a story called ''How the Dog was Domesticated'', which Achebe revised and rewrote, turning it into a complex allegory for the country's political tumult. Its final title was ''How the Leopard Got His Claws''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later a Nigerian intelligence officer told Achebe, "of all the things that came out of Biafra, that book was the most important."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Biafra independent state map-en.svg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Biafra]] secession]]

===Nigeria-Biafra War===
In May 1967, the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of [[Biafra]]; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion. Achebe's colleague, [[Christopher Okigbo]], who had become a close friend of the family (especially of Achebe's son, young Ikechukwu), volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press. Achebe's house was bombed one afternoon; Christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother, so the only victims were his books and papers. The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war. Five days later, Christopher Okigbo was killed on the war's front line.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss; in 1971 he wrote "Dirge for Okigbo", originally in the [[Igbo language]] but later translated to English.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the war intensified, the Achebe family was forced to leave Enugu for the Biafran capital of [[Aba, Nigeria|Aba]]. As the turmoil closed in, he continued to write, but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry. The shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone. "I can write poetry," he said, "something short, intense more in keeping with my mood&amp;nbsp; ... All this is creating in the context of our struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these poems were collected in his 1971 book ''Beware, Soul Brother''. One of his most famous, "Refugee Mother and Child", spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him. Dedicated to the promise of Biafra, he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador, refusing an invitation from the Program of African Studies at [[Northwestern University]] in the US. Achebe traveled to many cities in Europe, including London, where he continued his work with the African Writers Series project at Heinemann.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 129–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, relations between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and [[John Pepper Clark]] had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing sides of the conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of ''[[A Man of the People]]'' he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, their contemporary [[Wole Soyinka]] was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and spent two years in jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: "I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I would have been in the same situation as Wole Soyinka is&amp;nbsp;– in prison."&lt;ref name="Quoted1"&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nigerian government, under the leadership of General [[Yakubu Gowon]], was backed by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]]; the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the causes of the war in 1968, Achebe lashed out at the Nigerian political and military forces that had forced Biafra to secede. He framed the conflict in terms of the country's colonial past. The writer in Nigeria, he said, "found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content&amp;nbsp; ... The old white master was still in power. He had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission."&lt;ref name="Quoted1"/&gt;

[[Image:Flag of Biafra.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Republic of Biafra]]]]

Conditions in Biafra worsened as the war continued. In September 1968, the city of Aba fell to the Nigerian military and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to [[Umuahia]], where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged with the task of drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the group completed a document entitled ''The Principles of the Biafran Revolution'', later released as ''[[Ahiara Declaration|The Ahiara Declaration]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October of the same year, Achebe joined writers Cyprian Ekwensi and [[Gabriel Okara]] for a tour of the United States to raise awareness about the dire situation in Biafra. They visited thirty college campuses and conducted countless interviews. While in the southern US, Achebe learned for the first time of the [[Igbo Landing]], a true story of a group of Igbo captives who drowned themselves in 1803&amp;nbsp;– rather than endure the brutality of slavery&amp;nbsp;– after surviving through the [[Middle Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Timothy B. (2004). [http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2895 "Ebos Landing"]. The ''[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the group was well received by students and faculty, Achebe was "shocked" by the harsh racist attitude toward Africa he saw in the US. At the end of the tour, he said that "world policy is absolutely ruthless and unfeeling".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of 1970 saw the end of the state of Biafra. On 12 January, the military surrendered to Nigeria, and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi, where their home had been destroyed. He took a job at the [[University of Nigeria]] in [[Nsukka]] and immersed himself once again in academia. He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar academia===
After the war, Achebe helped start two magazines: the literary journal ''Okike'', a forum for African art, fiction, and poetry; and ''Nsukkascope'', an internal publication of the University (motto: "Devastating, Fearless, Brutal and True").&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe and the ''Okike'' committee later established another cultural magazine, ''Uwa Ndi Igbo'', to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1972 he released ''Girls at War'', a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed. It was the 100th book in Heinemann's African Writers Series.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Umass Amherst Chapel &amp; Library in the evening.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] at night]]

The [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] offered Achebe a professorship later that year, and the family moved to the United States. Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school, and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language. Achebe helped her face the "alien experience" (as he called it) by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students (he taught only one class, to a large audience), he began to study the perceptions of Africa in Western scholarship: "Africa is not like anywhere else they know&amp;nbsp; ... there are no real people in the Dark Continent, only ''forces'' operating; and people don't speak any language you can understand, they just grunt, too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of Conrad====
Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, ''[[An Image of Africa|An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"]]''. Decrying [[Joseph Conrad]] as "a bloody racist",&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1989), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe asserted that Conrad's [[Heart of Darkness|famous novel]] dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as "a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril."&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1989), pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe also discussed a quotation from [[Albert Schweitzer]], a 1952 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate: "That extraordinary missionary, Albert Schweitzer, who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about, epitomizes the ambivalence. In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being."&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1989), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were surprised that Achebe would challenge a man honoured in the West for his "reverence for life".&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert (1936). [http://www.schweitzer.org/english/aseind.htm "Reverence for Life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205030001/http://schweitzer.org/english/aseind.htm |date=5 December 2006 }}. Online at [http://www.schweitzer.org/index.htm Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016085801/http://schweitzer.org/index.htm |date=16 October 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lecture caused a storm of controversy, even at the reception immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: "How dare you!",&lt;ref name="QEO 191"&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had "no sense of humour",&lt;ref name="QEO 191"/&gt; but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: "I now realize that I had never really read ''Heart of Darkness'' although I have taught it for years."&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1989), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Stirling]] and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comprehensive rebuttal of Achebe's critique was published in 1983 by British critic Cedric Watts. His essay "A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad" defends ''Heart of Darkness'' as an anti-imperialist novel, suggesting that "part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Cedric (1983). "A Bloody Racist: About Achebe's View of Conrad". ''The Yearbook of English Studies'' Vol. 13, pp. 196–209.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian–American theorist [[Edward Said]] agreed in his book ''[[Culture and Imperialism]]'' that Conrad criticised imperialism, but added: "As a creature of his time, Conrad could not grant the natives their freedom, despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Atkinson, William (1 January 2004), "Bound in Blackwood's: The Imperialism of 'The Heart of Darkness' in Its Immediate Context". ''Twentieth Century Literature'' Vol. 50, No. 4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Watts and Said, Nidesh Lawtoo argued that "underneath the first layer of straightforward opposition ... we find an underlying mimetic continuity between Conrad's colonial image of Africa [in ''Heart of Darkness''] and Achebe's postcolonial representation" in ''Things Fall Apart''.&lt;ref&gt;Lawtoo, Nidesh (2013). "A Picture of Africa: Frenzy, Counternarrative, Mimesis." ''Modern Fictions Studies'' 59.1, pp. 26–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe's criticism has become a mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay was included in the 1988 [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]] critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of "the three most important events in ''Heart of Darkness'' criticism since the second edition of his book&amp;nbsp; ..."&lt;ref name="QEO 259"&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe."&lt;ref&gt;Tredell, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it&amp;nbsp;– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works."&lt;ref name="QEO 259"/&gt; Interviewed on [[National Public Radio]] with [[Robert Siegel]], in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And if it were not for what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Robert (15 October 2009), [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113835207 "Chinua Achebe: 'Heart Of Darkness' Is Inappropriate"], [[NPR]]. Retrieved 19 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and politics===
When he returned to the University of Nigeria in 1976, he hoped to accomplish three goals: finish the novel he had been writing, renew the native publication of ''Okike'', and further his study of Igbo culture. He also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to European targets. In an August 1976 interview, he lashed out at the archetypal Nigerian intellectual, who is divorced from the intellect "but for two things: status and stomach. And if there's any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job, he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1979, Achebe was awarded the first-ever Nigerian National Merit Award.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he met [[James Baldwin]] at a conference held by the [[African Literature Association]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], USA. The writers&amp;nbsp;– with similar political perspectives, beliefs about language, and faith in the liberating potential of literature&amp;nbsp;– were eager to meet one another. Baldwin said: "It's very important that we should meet each other, finally, if I must say so, after something like 400 years."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Achebe retired from the University of Nigeria. He devoted more time to editing ''Okike'' and became active with the left-leaning [[People's Redemption Party]] (PRP). In 1983, he became the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called ''The Trouble with Nigeria'' to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says bluntly: "the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership."&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since ''[[A Man of the People]]'', Achebe replied: "I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated."&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument&amp;nbsp;– which almost became a fistfight&amp;nbsp;– with [[Bakin Zuwo]], the newly elected governor of [[Kano State]]. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of the 1980s delivering speeches, attending conferences, and working on his sixth novel. He also continued winning awards and collecting honorary degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 235–249.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he was elected president-general of the [[Ogidi, Anambra State|Ogidi]] Town Union; he reluctantly accepted and began a three-year term. In the same year, he stepped down as editor of ''Okike''.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anthills'' and paralysis===
In 1987 Achebe released his fifth novel, ''[[Anthills of the Savannah]]'', about a military coup in the fictional West African nation of Kangan. A finalist for the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]], the novel was hailed in the ''[[Financial Times]]'': "in a powerful fusion of myth, legend and modern styles, Achebe has written a book which is wise, exciting and essential, a powerful antidote to the cynical commentators from 'overseas' who see nothing ever new out of Africa."&lt;ref name="QEO 253"&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; An opinion piece in the magazine ''West Africa'' said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize, and that Achebe was "a writer who has long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures."&lt;ref name="QEO 253"/&gt; The prize went instead to [[Penelope Lively]]'s novel ''[[Moon Tiger]]''.

[[Image:Bard stonerow 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Stone Row at the centre of the [[Bard College]] campus]]

On 22 March 1990, Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but the weight of the vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at [[Bard College]] in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], New York; he held the position for more than fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Achebe was awarded the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the St. Louis Literary Award |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |accessdate=25 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archivedate=31 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 2009 he joined the Brown University faculty as the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2009/09/achebe |title=Famed African Writer Chinua Achebe Joins the Brown Faculty |publisher=News.brown.edu |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later in his life as a publisher===
In October 2005, the London ''Financial Times'' reported that Achebe was planning to write a novella for the ''[[Canongate Myth Series]]'', a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors.&lt;ref&gt;Gurria-Quintana, Angel. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7ba47e26-46aa-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8.html?nclick_check=1 "Myth understood"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 28 October 2005. Retrieved 7 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Achebe was awarded the [[Man Booker International Prize]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6745609.stm "Nigeria author wins Booker honour"] (13 June 2007).

Retrieved 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and South African writer [[Nadine Gordimer]], who said Achebe has achieved "what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writer's purpose: 'a new-found utterance' for the capture of life's complexity".&lt;ref name="manbooker"/&gt; In 2010, Achebe was awarded [[The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize]] for $300,000, one of the richest prizes for the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gishprize.com/recipients/ |title=Recipients |publisher=Gish Prize |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, [[Penguin Books]], released ''There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra''. Publication immediately caused a stir and re-opened the discussion about the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. It would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Idris|last=Akinbajo|url=http://premiumtimesng.com/news/126311-breaking-prof-chinua-achebe-is-dead.html|title=Prof Chinua Achebe is dead|date=22 March 2013|accessdate=22 March 2013|quote=His latest book, ''There Was a Country'', was an autobiography on his experiences and views of the civil war.

==Style==

===Oral tradition===
The style of Achebe's fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people.&lt;ref&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories, illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling. The tale about the Earth and Sky in ''Things Fall Apart'', for example, emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale, Okonkwo's dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Gera, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such "women's stories".&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1994), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hallmark of Achebe's style is the use of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in ''Arrow of God'' "serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation."&lt;ref name="Gera 32"&gt;Gera, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, ''No Longer at Ease'' and ''A Man of the People'', is less pronounced.&lt;ref name="Gera 32"/&gt;

For Achebe, however, proverbs and folk stories are not the sum total of the oral Igbo tradition. In combining philosophical thought and public performance into the use of oratory ("Okwu Oka"&amp;nbsp;– "speech artistry"&amp;nbsp;– in the Igbo phrase), his characters exhibit what he called "a matter of individual excellence&amp;nbsp; ... part of Igbo culture."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Egejuru, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Things Fall Apart'', Okonkwo's friend Obierika voices the most impassioned oratory, crystallising the events and their significance for the village. Nwaka in ''Arrow of God'' also exhibits a mastery of oratory, albeit for malicious ends.&lt;ref&gt;Egejuru, pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe frequently includes folk songs and descriptions of dancing in his work. Obi, the protagonist of ''No Longer at Ease'', is at one point met by women singing a "Song of the Heart", which Achebe gives in both Igbo and English: "Is everyone here? / (Hele ee he ee he)"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gera, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Things Fall Apart'', ceremonial dancing and the singing of folk songs reflect the realities of Igbo tradition. The elderly Uchendu, attempting to shake Okonkwo out of his self-pity, refers to a song sung after the death of a woman: "For whom is it well, for whom is it well? There is no one for whom it is well."&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1994), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; This song contrasts with the "gay and rollicking tunes of evangelism" sung later by the white missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1994), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe's short stories are not as widely studied as his novels, and Achebe himself did not consider them a major part of his work. In the preface for ''Girls at War and Other Stories'', he writes: "A dozen pieces in twenty years must be accounted a pretty lean harvest by any reckoning."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Feuser, Willfried F. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hblk0WKPTG4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22pretty+lean+harvest+by+any+reckoning%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6Yd43VrHIw&amp;sig=XbXAeZXB-3TZiWHpy_a7OVvQ3jQ "Nothing Puzzles God!": Chinua Achebe's Civil War Stories"], ''No Condition Is Permanent: Nigerian Writing and the Struggle for Democracy'' (Holger G. Ehling and Claus-Peter Holste-von Mutius, eds). Amsterdam and New York: Editions Rodopi, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his novels, the short stories are heavily influenced by the oral tradition. And like the folktales they follow, the stories often have morals emphasising the importance of cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="Short stories"&gt;Ogede, Ode (1 January 2001). "Oral Tradition and Modern Storytelling: Revisiting Chinua Achebe's Short Stories". ''International Fiction Review'' Vol. 28, Issue 1/2, pp. 67–77. ISSN 0315-4149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of English===
As the [[decolonisation]] process unfolded in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world; Achebe was no exception. Indeed, because of his subject matter and insistence on a non-colonial narrative, he found his novels and decisions interrogated with extreme scrutiny&amp;nbsp;– particularly with regard to his use of English. One school of thought, championed by Kenyan writer [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], urged the use of indigenous African languages. English and other European languages, he said in 1986, were "part of the neo-colonial structures that repress progressive ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe chose to write in English. In his essay "The African Writer and the English Language", he discusses how the process of colonialism&amp;nbsp;– for all its ills&amp;nbsp;– provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds "a language with which to talk to one another". As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria, he uses "the one central language enjoying nationwide currency".&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1975), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ogbaa, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Achebe recognises the shortcomings of what [[Audre Lorde]] called "the master's tools". In another essay he notes:

{{quote|For an African writing in English is not without its serious setbacks. He often finds himself describing situations or modes of thought which have no direct equivalent in the English way of life. Caught in that situation he can do one of two things. He can try and contain what he wants to say within the limits of conventional English or he can try to push back those limits to accommodate his ideas&amp;nbsp; ... I submit that those who can do the work of extending the frontiers of English so as to accommodate African thought-patterns must do it through their mastery of English and not out of innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ogbaa, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another essay, he refers to James Baldwin's struggle to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation that he needed to take control of the language and expand it.&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian poet and novelist [[Gabriel Okara]] likens the process of language-expansion to the evolution of [[jazz]] music in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Okara (1991), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe's novels laid a formidable groundwork for this process. By altering syntax, usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style.&lt;ref&gt;Azohu, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; In some spots this takes the form of repetition of an Igbo idea in standard English parlance; elsewhere it appears as narrative asides integrated into descriptive sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Azohu, pp. 415–419.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Achebe's novels approach a variety of themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions: "Around the tragic stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity".&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background, he adds: "Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality'&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in ''Things Fall Apart'' match those in [[Olaudah Equiano]]'s autobiographical ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|Narrative]]''. Responding to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: "Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria".&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, pp. 164–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and colonialism===
A prevalent theme in Achebe's novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and [[modernity]], especially as embodied by European [[colonialism]]. The village of Umuofia in ''Things Fall Apart'', for example, is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive. Nigerian English professor Ernest N. Emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as "the systematic emasculation of the entire culture".&lt;ref&gt;Emenyonu, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli, the president of Kangan in ''Anthills of the Savannah''. Distanced from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education, he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice.&lt;ref&gt;Gera, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often effected by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in ''No Longer at Ease'' succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude.&lt;ref&gt;Nnolim, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts and the position of District Commissioner in ''Things Fall Apart'' likewise clash with the traditions of the Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Emenyonu, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard Achebean ending results in the destruction of an individual and, by [[synecdoche]], the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and [[hedonism]] in ''A Man of the People'', for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, pp. 104–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's [[tragedy|tragic]] endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by [[Sophocles]] and [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Niven, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a [[fatalism|fatalistic]] inevitability. In 1972, he said: "I never will take the stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth satisfied me—and this is well founded in the Igbo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lindfors, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; His perspective is reflected in the words of Ikem, a character in ''Anthills of the Savannah'': "whatever you are is never enough; you must find a way to accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mezu, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things&amp;nbsp; ... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness."&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masculinity and femininity===
The [[gender roles]] of men and women, as well as societies' conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success.&lt;ref name="Udumukwu, p. 202"&gt;Udumukwu, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; As seen in ''Things Fall Apart'', Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control 'his' women is inextricably connected to his dignity.&lt;ref name="Udumukwu, p. 202"/&gt; Thus, women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society.&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers.&lt;ref&gt;Corely, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity.&lt;ref name="Bestman, p. 156"&gt;Bestman, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Womanism is "an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women" that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women.&lt;ref name="Bestman, p. 156"/&gt; As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as ''Things Fall Apart'' differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe's women some agency and prominence.

In ''Things Fall Apart'', Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers everything "feminine" in his life, including his own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: "When did you become a shivering old woman?"&lt;ref&gt;Achebe (1994), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that one's chi, or personal god, is the 'mother within'.&lt;ref name="Bestman, p. 167"&gt;Bestman, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo's hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, in part because they remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice.&lt;ref name="Yousaf1"&gt;Yousaf, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was considered an ''agbala''—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with 'woman'. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father's lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo's feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority&amp;nbsp;– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Bicknell, p. 266. The author cites a study by Kemene Okonjo, "The Dual-Sex Political System in Operation: Igbo Women and Community Politics in Midwestern Nigeria", in Nancy J. Hafkin and Edna G. Bay (eds), ''Women in Africa''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of "Nneka" ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;Bicknell, pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt; Ekwefi's perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Bestman, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos.&lt;ref name="Yousaf1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mezu, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo's failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother.&lt;ref name="Bestman, p. 167"/&gt; Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that "I want to sort of scream that ''Things Fall Apart'' is on the side of women&amp;nbsp; ... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bob (9 March 2008). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030700987.html "Things Fall Into Place"]. ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo's violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society.&lt;ref&gt;Bestman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the "embodiment of the male writer's vision for the new Africa".&lt;ref&gt;Jeyifo, p. 885.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the "sign" of changes to come.

Achebe's first central female character in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in ''Anthills of the Savannah''. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power.&lt;ref&gt;Bicknell, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Bicknell, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Achebe has been called "the father of modern African writing"&lt;ref name="manbooker"/&gt; and Africa's greatest storyteller,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21574453-chinua-achebe-africas-greatest-storyteller-died-march-21st-aged-82-chinua-achebe " Chinua Achebe], The Economist&lt;/ref&gt; and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years. In 1992 he became the first living writer to be represented in the [[Everyman's Library]] collection published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]].&lt;ref name="Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 285"&gt;Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; His 60th birthday was celebrated at the [[University of Nigeria]] by "an international Who's Who in African Literature". One observer noted: "Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent."&lt;ref&gt;Emenyonu (1996), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achebe provided a "blueprint" for African writers of succeeding generations.&lt;ref name="Ogbaa1"/&gt; In 1982, he was awarded an honorary degree from the [[University of Kent]]. At the ceremony, professor Robert Gibson said that the Nigerian writer "is now revered as Master by the younger generation of African writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Even outside of Africa, his impact resonates strongly in literary circles. Novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] called him "a magical writer&amp;nbsp;– one of the greatest of the twentieth century". Poet [[Maya Angelou]] lauded ''Things Fall Apart'' as a book wherein "all readers meet their brothers, sisters, parents and friends and themselves along Nigerian roads".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Mandela]], recalling his time as a political prisoner, once referred to Achebe as a writer "in whose company the prison walls fell down",&lt;ref&gt;[[Maya Jaggi|Jaggi, Maya]] (14 June 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3466">'''Classical Pantheism''', as defined by [[Charles Hartshorne]] in 1953, is the theological [[deterministic]] philosophies of [[pantheists]] such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].  Hartshorne sought to distinguish [[panentheism]], which rejects determinism, from deterministic pantheism.

The term has also been used to mean Pantheism in the classical Greek and Roman era,&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Natural Theology, George Hayward Joyce, 2003, p482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-theistic theories: being the Baird lecture for 1877, by Robert Flint p536&lt;/ref&gt; or archetypal pantheism as variously defined by different authors.&lt;ref&gt;Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Michael Philip Levine, 1994, p163&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hartshorne's Classical Pantheism ==

This usage of the term Classical Pantheism was first presented by [[Charles Hartshorne]] in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt; and by others discussing his presentation.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray John B. Cobb, Clark H. Pinnock, "Searching for an Adequate God: A Dialogue Between Process and Free Will Theists", Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In making his case for [[panentheism]], Hartshorne sought to distinguish panentheism, which rejects determinism, from deterministic pantheism.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Chan Ho, "Transcendence And Spatiality of the Triune Creator", European Academic Publishers, 2005, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "pantheism" is derived from Greek words pan (πᾶν, "all") and theos (θεός, "God"), together meaning "All-God" or "All is God."  It is often associated with [[monism]], the view that reality is a single thing.

The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' refers to this form of Pantheism as an "extreme [[monism]]," stating that in Classical Pantheism, "God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion: Volume 10|year=2005|publisher=MacMillan|location=USA|isbn=0028657330|edition=2nd|editor=Lindsay Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples of deterministic-inclined pantheisms include the views of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

== Quotations ==
The following quotations illustrate Hartshorne's concept of Classical Pantheism:

*"For no particular thing, not even the smallest, can have happened otherwise than in accordance with the common nature and its reason." - [[Chrysippus]] &lt;ref&gt;Bobzien, Susanne, "Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy", Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
*"In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another cause, and so on to infinity." - [[Baruch Spinoza]] &lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, Baruch, "The Ethics", Proposition 48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses of "Classical Pantheism" ==
*Typical or archetypal pantheism. This usage varies according to the judgement of the writer as to what constitutes typical or archetypal pantheism, but usually includes Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Michael Philip Levine, 1994, p163&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pantheism of the Classical period, specifically Ancient Greece and Rome (for example, [[Stoicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harrison, "Elements of Pantheism," Element Books 1999 p13&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conimbricenses''' were the [[Jesuits]] of the [[University of Coimbra]] in [[Coimbra]], [[Portugal]].

==Origins==
The Conimbricenses were Jesuits who took over the intellectual leadership of the [[Roman Catholic]] world from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the end of the 16th century. Notable Conimbricenses include [[Luis de Molina]] (1535–1600) and [[Francisco Suárez]] (1548–1617).

==Commentaries==
The Coimbra Commentaries, also known as the Conimbricenses, are a group of 11 books on [[Aristotle]] (only 8 can be called commentaries). The names of 200 Jesuits, including those of professors and students, appeared repeatedly on the college registries. From the late 16th to the early 17th centuries, the university produced voluminous commentaries on Aristotle's philosophical writings. The commentaries were, in fact, dictated to the students by the professors and so were not intended for publication. After they were published anyway, to interpret and disown incorrect and unauthorized editions, [[Claudio Acquaviva]], the General of the Society of Jesus, assigned [[Pedro da Fonseca (philosopher)|Pedro da Fonseca]], the provincial of the Portuguese province,  the task of supervising the revision of the commentaries for authorized publication. Fonseca was called "the Aristotle of Portugal" by [[Charles George Herbermann]] in his ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]].''

===Contents===
The treatises appeared in the following order:

# ''Commentarii, Collegii, Conimbricenses, Societatis, Jesu in octo, [[Physics (Aristotle)|libros Physicorum]], Aristotelis, Stagyritæ,'' (Coimbra, 1591, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1984);
# ''Commentarii, Collegii, Conimbricenses, Societatis, Jesu in quattuor, libros, Physicorum, Aristotelis [[On the Heavens|de Cœlo]]'' (Coimbra, 1592);
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|libros Meteororum]] Aristotelis Stagyritæ'' (Coimbra, 1592);
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in libros Aristotelis qui [[Parva naturalia]] appelantur'' (Coimbra, 1592);
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in [[Nicomachean Ethics|libros Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nichomachum]] aliquot Cursus Conimbricensis disputationes in quibus præcipua quaedam Ethicæ disciplinæ capita continentur'' (Coimbra, 1595);
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in duos libros Aristotelis [[De generatione et corruptione]]'' (Coimbra, 1595, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 2003);
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu in tres libros Aristotelis [[De Anima]]'' (Coimbra, 1592 reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 2006). This treatise was published after the death of Father Emmanuel Golz (whom Father Fonseca had commissioned to publish the earlier volumes) by Father Comas Maggalliano (Magalhaens). He added a treatise of Father Balthazaar Alvarez ''De Anima Separata'' and his own work ''Tractatio aliquot problematum ad quinque Sensus Spectantium'';
# ''Commentarii Collegii Conimbricensis Societatis Jesu In universam dialecticam nunc primum'' (ed. Venice, 1606, reprint Hildesheim, Georg Olms, 1976) The works commented are In Isagogem Porphyry, In libros Categoriarium Aristotelis, In libros Aristotelis de Interpretatione, In libros Aristotelis Stagiritae de Priori Resolutione, In primum librum Posteriorum Aristotelis, In librum primum Topicorum Aristotelis and In duos libros Elenchorum Aristotelis.

A foreword prefixed the last treatise and disowned any connection with the work published at Frankfurt in 1604 and claiming to be the "Commentarii Conimbricenses". It reads in part, "Before we could finish the task entrusted to us of editing our Logic, to which we were bound by many promises, certain German publishers fraudulently brought out a work professing to be from us, abounding in errors and inaccuracies which were really their own. They also substituted for our commentaries certain glosses gotten furtively. It is true these writings thirty years previously were the work of one of our professors not indeed intended for publication. They were the fruit of his zeal and he never dreamed they would appear in print".

The last treatise was prepared for printing by Father Sebastian Couto. The eight parts formed five quarto volumes in wide circulation and appeared in many editions. The best known were those of [[Lyon]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Cologne]]. The Commentaries are in [[Latin]] and are supplemented by reliable explanations of the text and an exhaustive discussion of the Aristotelian system.

'''''Consciousness Explained''''' is a 1991 book by the American [[philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]], in which the author offers an account of how [[consciousness]] arises from interaction of physical and [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes in the [[brain]].

==Summary==
Dennett puts forward a [[Multiple drafts model|"multiple drafts" model]] of consciousness, suggesting that there is no single central place (a "[[Cartesian theater]]") where conscious experience occurs; instead there are "various events of content-fixation occurring in various places at various times in the brain".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; The brain consists of a "bundle of semi-independent agencies";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; when "content-fixation" takes place in one of these, its effects may propagate so that it leads to the utterance of one of the sentences that make up the story in which the central character is one's "self". Dennett's view of consciousness is that it is the apparently serial account for the brain's underlying ''[[parallel computing|parallelism]]''.

One of Dennett's more controversial claims is that [[qualia]] do not (and cannot) exist as qualia are described to be. Dennett's main argument is that the various properties attributed to qualia by philosophers—qualia are supposed to be incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on&amp;mdash;are incompatible, so the notion of qualia is incoherent. The non-existence of qualia would mean that there is no [[hard problem of consciousness]], and "[[philosophical zombie]]s", which are supposed to act like a human in every way while somehow lacking qualia, cannot exist. So, as Dennett wryly notes, he is committed to the belief that we are all p-zombies (if you define the term p-zombie as functionally identical to a human being without any additional non-material aspects)—adding that his remark is very much open to misinterpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}, p. 406. "Are zombies possible? They're not just possible, they're actual. We're all zombies. Nobody is conscious — not in the systematically mysterious way that supports such doctrines as epiphenomenalism." In a footnote Dennett states: "It would be an act of desperate intellectual dishonesty to quote this assertion out of context!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennett claims that our brains hold only a few salient details about the world, and that this is the only reason we are able to function at all. Thus, we do not store elaborate pictures in short-term memory, as this is not necessary and would consume valuable computing power. Rather, we log what has changed and assume the rest has stayed the same, with the result that we miss some details, as demonstrated in various experiments and illusions, some of which Dennett outlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spinney|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennett|1991}}. See e.g. chapter 5 on "Orwellian and Stalinesque Revisions". Memory is central to much of Dennett's book, with reference found throughout.&lt;/ref&gt; Research subsequent to Dennett's book indicates that some of his postulations were more conservative than expected. A year after ''Consciousness Explained'' was published, Dennett noted "I wish in retrospect that I'd been more daring, since the effects are stronger than I claimed". Since then, examples continue to accumulate of the illusory nature of our visual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spinney|2000}}, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

A key philosophical method is [[heterophenomenology]], in which the verbal or written reports of subjects are treated as akin to a theorist's fiction—the subject's report is not questioned, but it is not assumed to be an incorrigible report about that subject's inner state. This approach allows the reports of the subject to be a datum in psychological research, thus circumventing the limits of classical [[behaviorism]].

Dennett says that only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of unconscious events could explain consciousness at all: "To explain is to explain ''away''".

==Reception==
Critics of Dennett's approach, such as [[David Chalmers]] and [[Thomas Nagel]], argue that Dennett's argument misses the point of the inquiry by merely redefining consciousness as an external property and ignoring the subjective aspect completely. This has led detractors to nickname the book ''Consciousness Ignored'' and ''Consciousness Explained Away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barash|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carruthers|2005}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett and his [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialist]] supporters, however, respond that the aforementioned "subjective aspect" of conscious minds is nonexistent, an unscientific remnant of commonsense "folk psychology", and that his alleged redefinition is the only coherent description of consciousness.

However, [[John Searle]] argues&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J R: ''The Mystery of Consciousness'' (1997) p. 95–131&lt;/ref&gt; that Dennett, who insists that discussing subjectivity is nonsense because it is unscientific and science presupposes objectivity, is making a [[category error]]. Searle argues that the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are epistemically objective (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party), but are not necessarily ontologically objective. Searle calls any value judgment epistemically subjective. Thus, "McKinley is prettier than Everest" is epistemically subjective, whereas "McKinley is higher than Everest" is epistemically objective. In other words, the latter statement is evaluable (in fact, falsifiable) by an understood ("background") criterion for mountain height, like "the summit is so many meters above sea level". No such criteria exist for prettiness. Searle says that, in Dennett's view, there is no consciousness in addition to the computational features, because that is all that consciousness amounts to for him: mere effects of a von Neumann(esque) virtual machine implemented in a parallel architecture and therefore implies that conscious states are illusory. In contrast, Searle asserts that, "where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance is the reality."

Searle said further: &lt;blockquote&gt;To put it as clearly as I can: in his book, ''Consciousness Explained'', Dennett denies the existence of consciousness. He continues to use the word, but he means something different by it. For him, it refers only to third-person phenomena, not to the first-person conscious feelings and experiences we all have. For Dennett there is no difference between us humans and complex zombies who lack any inner feelings, because we are all just complex zombies. ...I regard his view as self-refuting because it denies the existence of the data which a theory of consciousness is supposed to explain...Here is the paradox of this exchange: I am a conscious reviewer consciously answering the objections of an author who gives every indication of being consciously and puzzlingly angry. I do this for a readership that I assume is conscious. How then can I take seriously his claim that consciousness does not really exist?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1995/dec/21/the-mystery-of-consciousness-an-exchange/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Darío Salas Sommer''' ({{lang-es|Darío Salas Sommer}}; born 4 March 1935 in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]) is a Chilean philosopher, scientist and humanist. He is known especially for his exploration of moral aspects of human life and personal development, described in his notable books ‘Morals of the XXI Century’ and ‘Cosmic Currency, the Greatest Wealth’

==Biography==

Dr. Dario Salas Sommer was born in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], on March 4, 1935. He is the grandson of the distinguished Chilean educator Darío Salas Díaz. In 1970, he founded the Institute for Hermetic Philosophy headquartered in Santiago, Chile, and represented in Argentina, Spain, the United States and Russia. Dr. Salas Sommer has given more than 2,000 lectures, delivered speeches at notable conferences, and been interviewed on TV and in magazines around the world.

==Philosophy==
Dario Salas Sommer has been committed to the progress of humanity and to the internal development of the human being for more than four decades. He has discovered a scientifically-based &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihpusa.org/capitalmagazine]&lt;/ref&gt; morality called "moral physics," which is based on a series of maxims, in which the underlying assumption is that morals are laws of nature.

The existence of objective morality has been debated since the times of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. Dr. Dario Salas Sommer puts forth the concept that ‘moral laws’ exist for both individuals and nations. Who follows the moral rules will prosper and who violates them will be punished. In his book ‘Moral of the 21st Century’ he proves that acting in accordance with the principles of morality is not only fair, but also beneficial. This book, originally written in Spanish, has already been translated into English, Arabic, German, Russian and Chinese.

‘''Personally, I have had the privilege to scientifically prove how certain moral aberrations immediately create a decline in vital energy, which I explain and support in my book''’,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihpusa.org/ideas Ideas on Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; stated Dario Salas Sommer. This ideas reflecting ‘moral universalism’ can be found among other contemporary philosophers, among them [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jurgen Habermas]]. Dario Salas Sommer, however, gives a deeper view on human morality in connection with person, nature and consciousness. In his books the practical methods of personal development are given, which is why Sommer’s approach has been called by the author &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihpusa.org/tvinterview]&lt;/ref&gt; ‘operative philosophy’, or ‘practical philosophy’. Through daily actions, one can harmoniously unify spirituality, love, money, happiness and wisdom as a result.

==The public sphere==

Dario Salas Sommer is the founder of Fundacion Bolivariana Latinoamericana, a non-profit foundation created to support and develop educational and cultural projects for youth. The foundation supports scientific and academic cooperation between universities of Latin America and Eurasia, in [[ecology]], social science and human development.

Dr. Dario Salas Sommer continuously participates, online and in person, in global cultural and scientific events. In 2007, he gave a speech at the Global Warming and Climate Change Summit (Calentamiento Global y Cambio Climático: La Hora de Actuar ha Llegado) in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], dedicated to the environmental crisis affecting our planet and attended by the President of Chile Michelle Bachelet. During this notable event, he met with US Vice President [[Al Gore]]. “''All of our problems, including Global Warming, have their origin in this fragmented vision of reality that makes us feel as if we owned Nature, instead of being a part of it”, the researcher points, “The truth is, an event as important as global warming cannot take place without making any connection to the emotions, actions and thoughts of the human species.''”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caras.cl/tag/calentamiento-global-y-cambio-climatico-la-hora-de-actuar-ha-llegado/ La hora de actuar llegó hace rato]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Summer 2015, Dr. Dario Salas Sommer drew public attention to the importance of moral values in world politics. During the summit of the BRICS countries in Ufa, Russia, he addressed the leaders of the world fastest-growing nations, strongly urging them to remember the fundamental importance of moral principles in global politics and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brics-info.org/morality-is-objective-and-can-be-described-by-laws-of-physics/ Morality is Objective and Can be Described by Laws of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; Dario Salas Sommer has a strong.recognition in Russia&lt;ref&gt;[http://rg.ru/2016/03/04/avtoru-morali-xxi-veka-vruchat-rossijskij-orden-druzhby.html]&lt;/ref&gt; where he is a well-known figure (he is awarded with the [[Order of Friendship|Member of the Order of Friendship]]) The book 'Morals for 21st Century', focused on ethics and morality, is studied by the students in the universities of BRICS countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infobrics.org/post/8083/]&lt;/ref&gt; Dario Salas Sommer has a strong recognition across the world, and his works received positive comments from state leaders of China&lt;ref&gt;[http://mundo.sputniknews.com/mundo/201609191063551386-brics-educacion/]&lt;/ref&gt; and India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mundo.sputniknews.com/sociedad/201609041063243371-foro-dario-salas-sommer/]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the international conference on climate change in Paris (COP21, December 2015)  the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon noted the importance of the philosopher's ideas regarding the world leaders' moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nexchannel.cl/Nex/noticias/ver_imagen.php?img=2015/12/13/LaTercera-Negocios-18]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the book 'Morals for the 21st Century' has been introduced at the United Nations General Assembly &lt;ref&gt; [http://diario.elmercurio.com/2016/10/02/economia_y_negocios/vida_empresarial/noticias/2ef4a6f3-9508-4f78-8ac1-df3ba266723b.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and received by world leaders as a symbol of reviving moral values in global affairs.

The '''day-year principle''', '''year-day principle''' or '''year-for-a-day principle''' is a method of interpretation of [[Bible prophecy]] in which the word ''day'' in prophecy is considered to be symbolic of a ''year'' of actual time. It is used principally by the [[historicism (Christian eschatology)|historicist]] school of prophetic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jerry |last=Moon|title=The Year-Day Principle|url=http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/end/yearday.htm|journal= AtIssue|publisher=SDAnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], some [[Pentecostal]]s and the [[Christadelphians]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Robert, Thirteen Lectures On The Apocalypse, [http://www.antipas.org/books/13_lectures/lecture10.html Lecture 10], 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; The day-year principle is also used by the [[Bahá'í Faith]], as well as in astrological prediction techniques, otherwise known as "primary directions".

== Biblical basis ==
Proponents of the principle, such as the Seventh-day Adventists, claim that it has three primary precedents in Scripture:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe: An Exposition of the Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church|edition=2nd|year=2005|publisher=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|page=48|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{bibleverse||Numbers|14:34|NIV}}. The [[Israelites]] will wander for 40 years in the wilderness, one year for every day spent by the spies in [[Canaan]].
# {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|4:5-6|NIV}}. The prophet Ezekiel is commanded to lie on his left side for 390 days, followed by his right side for 40 days, to symbolize the equivalent number of years of punishment on Israel and Judah respectively.
# {{bibleverse||Daniel|9:24-27|NIV}}. This is known as the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]]. The majority of scholars do understand the passage to refer to 70 "sevens" or "septets" of years—that is, a total of 490 years.
While not listed as primary precedent by the proponents, a direct reference to the day for a year concept is established in Genesis.
# {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:27|NIV}}. Laban requires an additional seven years of work in contract for Rachels hand in marriage, calling it a week.

[[Jon Paulien]] has defended the principle from a [[systematic theology]] perspective, not strictly just from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Paulien, "[http://atsjats.org/site/1/podcast/spirit_prophecy_jon_paulien.mp3 A New Look at the Year-Day Principle]", talk at the 2008 [[Evangelical Theological Society]] meetings.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This view was recognized by the Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L. E. |last=Froom|title =Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers|volume= 1 &amp; 2 |pages= 889 and 124|ref=harv|year=1950|publisher= Review and Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%209:24-27 Daniel 9:24–27], and as seen in Jesus' use of the day-year principle in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013:31-35 Luke 13:31–33],{{clarify|date=December 2017}} and in the early church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L. E. |last=Froom |title= Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers |volume=1|pages= 170, 174–76|publisher=Review and Herald|year= 1950|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The day-year principle was first used in Christian exposition in 380 AD by [[Ticonius]], who interpreted the three and a half days of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:9 as three and a half years, writing 'three days and a half; that is, three years and six months' ('dies tres et dimidium; id est annos tres et menses sex').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=EB |last=Elliott |title=Horae Apocalypticae| volume =III| page =279|edition=fifth |year= 1862|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century [[Faustus of Riez]] gave the same interpretation of Revelation 11:9, writing 'three and a half days which correspond to three years and six months' ('Tres et dimidius dies tribus annis et sex mensibus respondent),&lt;ref name="ElliottHorae"&gt;{{cite book|first=EB |last=Elliott|title=Horae Apocalypticae| volume =III |page =280|edition= fifth |year= 1862|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in c. 550 [[Primasius of Hadrumetum|Primasius]] also gave the same interpretation, writing 'it is possible to understand the three days and a half as three years and six months' ('Tres dies et dimidium possumus intelligere tres annos et sex menses').&lt;ref name="ElliottHorae" /&gt; The same interpretation of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:9 was given by the later Christian expositors [[Bede]] (730 AD), as well as [[Anspert]], [[Arethas of Caesarea|Arethas]], [[Haymo of Halberstadt|Haymo]], and [[Berengaudus]] (all of the ninth century).&lt;ref name="ElliottHorae" /&gt; Primasius appears to have been the first to appeal directly to previous Biblical passages in order to substantiate the principle, referring to [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 14:34 in support of his interpretation of the three and a half days of Revelation 11:9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=More Scripturae loquentis utentes, quod dictium legius de quadraginta diebus quibus exploratores terram Channan circuierunt, anus pro die reputabitur; ut hic, versa vice, dies pro anno positus agnoscatur| last=Prismasius |first2=EB |last2=Elliott|title=Horae Apocalypticae| volume =III | page=280|edition= fifth |year= 1862|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haymo and [[Bruno Astensis]] "justify it by the parallel case of Ezekiel lying on his side 390 days, to signify 390 years ; — i. e. a day for a year. — ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=EB |last=Elliott|title=Horae Apocalypticae| volume =III |page =281|edition= fifth |year= 1862|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Protestant Reformers were well established on the day/year principle and it was also accepted by many Christian groups, ministers, and theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Francois |last=du Ion|title= The Apocalyps|year= 1596 |page= 124|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigrinus|title=Antichrists Grundtliche Offenbarung|page=fils 28v,29r|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aaron| last=Burr|title=The Watchman's Answer to the Question, What of the Night |page=21|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who expounded the Historicist interpretation are [[John Wycliffe]], [[John Knox]], [[William Tyndale]], [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[Philip Melanchthon]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jan Hus]], [[John Foxe]], [[John Wesley]], [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformed.org/books/edwards/redemption/index.html?mainframe=/books/edwards/redemption/index_hisred.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Whitefield]], [[Charles Finney]], [[C. H. Spurgeon]], [[Matthew Henry]], [[Adam Clarke]], [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]], and Bishop [[Thomas Newton]] as exponents of this school.&lt;ref&gt;S. Gregg, "Revelation: Four Views," Nashville: Thomas Nelson Pub, 1997, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christian historicist application ==
=== 490 year prophecy ===
[[Daniel 9]] contains the [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]].

=== 1260 year prophecy ===
[[Image:Adventist eschatology timeline.gif|right|thumb|350px|Timeline of "time, times and half a time", 1260 days or 42 month prophecy in historicist Seventh-day Adventism.]]

Historicist interpreters have usually understood the "time, times and half a time" (i.e. 1+2+0.5=3.5), "1,260 days" and "42 months" mentioned in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] to be references to represent a period of 1260 years (based on the 360 day [[Jewish calendar|Jewish year]] multiplied by 3.5).&lt;ref name="SDA1260"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe (2nd ed)
|publisher=Ministerial Association, [[General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists]]
|year=2005
|isbn=1-57847-041-2
|pages=184–185
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These time periods occur eight times in scripture:

*{{bibleverse||Daniel|7:25|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Daniel|9:27|NIV}}, "half one set of seven".
*{{bibleverse||Daniel|12:7|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|11:2|NIV}}, "42 months".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|11:3|NIV}}, "1260 days".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:6|NIV}}, "1260 days".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|12:14|NIV}}, "time, times and a half".
*{{bibleverse||Revelation|13:5|NIV}}, "42 months".

Historicists usually believe the "1,260 days" spanned the [[Middle Ages]] and concluded within the [[Early Modern Times|early modern]] or [[modern era]]. Although many dates have been proposed for the start and finish of the "1,260 days", certain time spans have proven to be more popular than others.

His view of the symbolic nature of the day-year principle was similar to the 'man as microcosm' argument; that a day in the life of a man could be likened to a year in the life of the wider world. Among his illustrations for this were Ezekiel 16 where the youth of a woman is likened to the growing in maturity of the Jewish people. ''(see Edward Bishop Elliott ''Horae Apocalypticae'' London: Seeley, Jackson &amp; Halliday 5th ed (1862) Vol 3 p. 263)'' Similarly, the sabbath as a day for the individual is mirrored in the seventh fallow year of an agrarian society. Likewise, Ezekiel 4:1-7 where the prophet lies prostrate for a number of days to mirror the number of years of iniquity of Judah and Israel. "I have appointed thee each day for a year." He says another interesting, if problematic, illustration is Isaiah 20:2-3 where Isaiah appears to walk naked for three years. Elliott suggests that his prophetic act would have lasted three days as a sign of what the Assyrians would accomplish three years thence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other views ====
Robert Fleming writing in 1701 (''The Rise and Fall of Rome Papal'') stated that the 1260-year period should commence with Pope Paul I becoming a temporal pope in AD 758 which would expire in 2018 by counting Julian years, or the year 2000 if counting prophetic (360 day) years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleming|first1=Robert|title=The rise and fall of Rome papal|date=1848|publisher=Houlston &amp; Stoneman|page=49|edition=New|url=https://archive.org/details/a581793200flemuoft|accessdate=2016-12-16|archiveurl=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13990737M/The_rise_and_fall_of_Rome_papal|archivedate=2008-09-02|quote=Now, as near as I can trace the time of this donation of Pepin, it was in or about the year 758, about the tune that Pope Paul the First began to build the church of St. Peter and St. Paul.

And if what I suggest above be true, that Antichrist shall not be finally destroyed until the coming of Christ, then may this calculation be looked upon to be very considerable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 756 to 2016 ====

British Theologian [[Adam Clarke]] writing in 1825 stated that the 1260-year period should commence with 755 AD, the actual year [[Pepin the Short]] invaded Lombard territory, resulting in the Pope's elevation from a subject of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to an independent [[head of state]]. The [[Donation of Pepin]], which first occurred in 754 and again in 756 gave to the Pope [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the [[Papal States]]. However, his introductory comments on [[Daniel 7]] added 756 as an alternative commencement date.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Clarke ''”The Holy Bible”'' New York: Lane and Scott (1850) vol. IV, Introduction to Chapter VII, page 592, “It will be proper to remark that the period of a time, times, and a half, mentioned in the twenty-fifth verse are the duration of the dominion of the little horn that made war with the saints, (generally supposed to be a symbolic representation of the papal power,) had most probably its commencement in A.D. 755 or 756, when Pepin, king of France, invested the pope with temporal power. This hypothesis will bring the conclusion of the period to about the year of Christ 2000, a time fixed by Jews and Christians for some remarkable revolution; when the world, as they suppose, will be renewed, and the wicked cease from troubling the Church, and the saints of the Most High have dominion over the whole habitable globe."&lt;/ref&gt; In April of that year, Pepin, accompanied by [[Pope Stephen II]] entered northern Italy from France, forcing the Lombard King [[Aistulf]] to lift his siege of Rome, and return to [[Pavia]]. Following Aistulf's capitulation, Pepin remained in Italy until finalizing his Donations. Based on this, 19th century commentators anticipate the end of the Papacy in 2016:

{{quote|text= ''“As the date of the prevalence and reign of antichrist must, according to the principles here laid down, be fixed at A.D. 756, therefore the end of this period of his reign must be A.D. 756 added to 1260; equal to 2016, the year of the Christian era set by infinite wisdom for this long-prayed-for event. Amen and amen!"''&lt;ref&gt;Freeborn Garretson Hibbard “Eschatology: Or, The Doctrine of the Last Things” New York: Hunt &amp; Eaton (1890), page 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.D. Whedon “The Methodist Quarterly Review” New York: Carlton &amp; Porter (1866), article V, page 256.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Of the five areas of the Bible which mention this timeline,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 7:25, Daniel 12:7, Revelation 11:2-3, Revelation 12:6,14 and Revelation 13:5.&lt;/ref&gt; only Revelation 11:9-12 adds a brief 3½ more years to the end of this 1260-year period.&lt;ref&gt;The 3½ days follow the 42 months or 1260 days (representing years) mentioned in verses 2 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; If added to 2016, this would bring us to autumn of 2019 or spring of 2020 for the commencement of the Eternal Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;John Brown "A Dictionary of the Holy Bible" in two volumes. Philadelphia: William IV. Woodward, N°. 17 Chestnut Street (1798), vol. I, page 34: "But if we date the rise of Antichrist from the Pope's commencing a civil lord, about A. D. 756, we cannot hope for the beginning of the Millennium till after A. D. 2016."&lt;/ref&gt; However, far more attention is paid by historicists to 2016 as the final end of the Papacy and the commencement of the Millennial rule than there is to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams “The Cottage Bible and family expositor” Hartford: D.F. Robinson and H.F. Sumner (1834), vol. 2, page 1417: “Mr. Lowman, though an earlier commentator, is (we believe) far more generally followed; and he commences the 1260 days from about 756, when, by aid of Pepin, King of France, the Pope obtained considerable temporalities. This carries on the reign of Popery to 2016 or sixteen years into the commencement of the Millennium, as it is generally reckoned.”&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due in part, to uncertainty as to who or what the [[two witnesses]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] represent. But for those 17th to 19th century historicists adhering to the day year principle who also predicted a literal restoration of the unconverted Jews in their original homeland,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Chamberlain “The National Restoration and Conversion of the Twelve Tribes of Israel” London: Wertheim and MacIntosh (1854), page 402: “Mr. Faber erred in asserting the contrary; and this error was the cause of his not seeing that Israel's restoration precedes his conversion.”&lt;/ref&gt; the fall of the Papacy immediately precedes the rapid conversion of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;James Lunn "A Dissertation on the Conversion and Restoration of the Jews" Edinburgh: J. Morren (1804), page 99: "the fall of the Papacy is to be the means of bringing in the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt; The two events are closely linked, with the former enabling the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fleming (the Younger). "Apocalyptical Key" London: Paternoster Row (1793), page 72: "Therefore after various thoughts upon this head, being satisfied that the Jews were to be converted, and that this great event could not be wholly left out in the Revelation, I did at last conclude that this must not be (whatever particular conversions of some part of them might happen) until the final destruction of the Popish party; whose idolatry, villanies, lies and legends, and bloody temper, is the chief thing that prejudices them against Christianity."&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 756 AD is also thought to occur 666 years from John's writing of the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;William M'Gavin “The Protestant: essays on the principal points of controversy” (1835) Edwin Hunt - Middletown, vol. 1, page 726: “Thus was the bishop of Rome raised to the rank and sovereignty of a great prince. This is usually considered the last step of his elevation. It took place in the year 756; and this, I believe, is the latest period to which the commencement of the prophetic number of 1260 years is referred. Supposing the book of Revelation to have been written in the year 90, which is the period usually assigned to it, the time which elapsed between that and the last stage of papal usurpation, is precisely six hundred and sixty-six years, which reminds us of the number of the name of the beast, Rev. xiii. 18.”&lt;/ref&gt; The verse in Daniel 8:25 which reads ''"...but he shall be broken without hand"'' is usually understood to mean that the destruction of the "little horn" or Papacy with not be caused by any human action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Newton "DISSERTATIONS ON THE PROPHECIES" London: J.F. and C. Rivington (1789), 8th edition, page 327: "As the stone in Nebuchadnezzar's dream was cut out of the mountain without hands, that is not by human, but by supernatural means; so the little horn shall be broken without hand, not die the common death, not fall by the hand of men, but perish by a stroke from heaven."&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic activity is described as the means by which Rome will be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;East Apthorp, D.D. "Discourses on Prophecy" (1786) Discourse XI, page 273: "Rome the seat of Antichrist will be consumed with fire, at the coming of Christ, or when the period of her apostasy is expired, in 1260 years from the rise of Antichrist," page 275: "...present Rome, when by an eruption of fire the mountainous soil, being undermined, will fall into an abyss, and be covered with the sea."&lt;/ref&gt; The following excerpt is from the 5th edition (1808) of the Rev. David Simpson's book "A Plea for Religion and the Sacred Writings":

{{quote|text= ''"Antichrist will retain some part of his dominion over the nations till about the year 2016." "And when the 1260 years are expired, Rome itself, with all its magnificence, will be absorbed in a lake of fire, sink into the sea, and rise no more at all for ever*."&lt;ref&gt;Rev. David Simpson "A Plea for Religion and the Sacred Writings" London: W. Baynes, and Paternoster-Row. (1808) 5th edition, pages 131 and 133.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though the end of the 1260 years will be marked by dramatic events, it will not instantly remove all the governments of the world. The Messianic Kingdom will be established in place of the former Roman Empire, and continue to expand until it has enveloped the remaining countries. The following is an excerpt from "the Covenanter", a Reformed Presbyterian publication (1857):

{{quote|text= ''“The end of the 1260 years will not at once usher in the brightness of the Millennial day. It will be marked by some occurrence, by some grand movement of Providence—such as the violent, it may be, and sudden crushing of the Papal power, and that of the corrupt and oppressive monarchies of the Old World, and of the governments similar to them in spirit, if not in form, in the New-— by some event in the pagan world, in which a new era will take its rise: new and signally successful efforts for the conversion of the Jews—for the evangelization of the nations-—for the subjecting of the “kingdoms of this world” to the law and government of “the Lord and of his Christ.” A generation may pass, or more than one, before this work will be fully completed; but it will advance with large strides.”''&lt;ref&gt;James L. Willson (editor) “The Covenanter” Philadelphia: William S. Young (1857) vol. 13, page 238.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Daniel 2:35 makes reference to the various world powers (represented as various metals) being “broken to pieces together”, the previous verse (v.34) portrays the Eternal Kingdom coming as “a stone cut from a mountain without hands” and striking a statue (symbolizing the successive world empires) on its feet first. Most adherents of the day-year principle, interpret these feet “that were of iron and clay,” as denoting the nations descended from and occupying areas of the former Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;George D'Oyly “The Holy Bible According to the Authorized Version” London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Gilbert &amp; Rivington. (1830) Volume II. Daniel, chapter II: The Roman empire therefore is represented in a double state; first, with the strength of iron, conquering all before it, "his legs of iron;" and then weakened and divided by the mixture of barbarous nations, "his feet part of iron and part of clay." The Roman empire was afterwards divided into ten lesser kingdoms, the remains of which are subsisting at present.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Greenfield “Pillar of Divine Truth” London: Samuel Bagster (1831), page 232: “The Roman empire became weakened by a mixture of barbarous nations, by the incursions of whom it was torn asunder about the fourth century after Christ, and at length divided into ten kingdoms, answering to the ten toes of the image, and the ten horns of the beast. The ten kingdoms into which the western Roman empire was divided were, primarily, according to Machiavel and Bp. Lloyd, 1. The Huns in Hungary, A. D. 356. 2. The Ostrogoths in Moesia, 377. 3. The Visigoths in Pannonia, 378. 4. The Sueves and Alans in Gascoigne and Spain, 407. 5. The Vandals in Africa, 407. 6. The Franks in France, 407. 7. The Burgundians in Burgundy, 407. 8. The Heruli and Turingi in Italy, 476. 9. The Saxons and Angles in Britain, 476. 10. The Lombards first, upon the Danube, 526, and afterwards in Italy. Though the ten kingdoms differed from these in later periods, and were sometimes more or less, yet they were still known by that name.”&lt;/ref&gt; The dominions of all the empires and nations are expected to be crushed simultaneously, but the end of “life” or existence of the Roman derived countries will precede that of the other nations of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel 7:11, 12: “I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Bicheno “The Restoration of the Jews” London: Bye and Law (1800), page 48: “The destruction is to begin at the toes of the image, the kingdoms into which the Roman empire has been divided.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time for this worldwide expansion to complete is indicated in Daniel 7:12, which adds ''“As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.”'' Henry Folbigg (1869) elaborated on this verse:

{{quote|text= ''It is here predicted that after the destruction of the papal beast, “the rest of the beasts,” by which I understand the Pagan, Mahometan, Hindoo, Chinese, and other empires, “ will have their dominion taken away,” that is, they will gradually lose their dominion, perhaps be conquered and lose their heathen rulers— “ but their lives ”—the existence of various corrupt "and unchristian principles, “ will be prolonged for a season and a time,” which, if intended to be taken in the usual prophetic and symbolic sense would indicate a period of 450 years. This would extend far into the Millennium, and therefore although we may and should look for, and hasten the coming of great and beneficial changes, we are not to expect universal civilization in a day, nor the conversion of the world in a year—but rather the gradual yet more rapid spread of the gospel and the spiritual reign of Christ and his saints—of Christ and his Church for 1,000 years.''&lt;ref&gt;Henry Folbigg “The Great Epoch” London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer (1869), pages 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prior to [[Adam Clarke]] (Methodist), [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], an Evangelical Reformed (Congregational) theologian commented on the views of his more well-known predecessors and contemporaries, and wrote that [[Sir Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Fleming the younger|Robert Fleming]] (Presbyterian), [[Moses Lowman]] (Presbyterian), [[Phillip Doddridge]] (Congregational), and Bishop Thomas Newton (Anglican), were in agreement that the 1,260 timeline should be calculated from the year 756 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Edwards ”History of Redemption” New York: T. and J. Swords (1793), page 431: "The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist. The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A. D. 756, when the Pope began to be a temporal power, (that is, in prophetic language, a beast) by assuming temporal dominion; 1260 years from this period will bring us to about A. D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.) which says, that " in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished."&lt;/ref&gt;

F.A. Cox (Congregationalist) confirmed that this was the view of Sir Isaac Newton and others, including himself:

{{bquote | ''“The author adopts the hypothesis of Fleming, Sir Isaac Newton, and Lowman, that the 1260 years commenced in A.d. 756; and consequently that the millennium will not begin till the year 2016.”''&lt;ref&gt;Rev. F.A. Cox “Outlines of Lectures on the Book of Daniel” London: Westley and Davis (1833) 2nd edition, page 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Williams (1755–1839)|Thomas Williams]] also acknowledged that this was the predominant view among the leading Protestant theologians of his time:

{{bquote | ''“Mr. Lowman, though an earlier commentator, is (we believe) far more generally followed ; and he commences the 1260 days from about 756, when, bv aid of Pepin, King of France, the Pope obtained considerable temporalities. This carries on the reign of Popery to 2016, or sixteen years into the commencement of the Millennium, as it is generally reckoned.”''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Williams “The Cottage Bible and family expositor” Hartford: D.F. Robinson and H. F. Sumner (1837), vol. 2, page 1417.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The timeline was also printed in other denominational publications including Lutheran,&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Friedrich Gleditsch]] "Nova [[Acta Eruditorum]]" in Latin. Leipzig (1739), no. VII, pars. I, page 302: "Accadamus ad Periodum III de phialis, qua: révélant rtatum Ecclefia:, temporibus Romani Imperii ultimis, quod per bertiam repradentatur; per ipfos 1260 annos, ab A. 756 ad 2016."&lt;/ref&gt; Reformed,&lt;ref&gt;P.

(Mosheim says, 755.) Did we know exactly at what time to date the beginning of the 1260 years, we might show, with certainty, when they would terminate; but this would not consist with that wise obscurity, which always, in some respects, rests on prophecies, before they are fulfilled. The beginning of these years, however, cannot well be fixed sooner than A. D. 606, nor later than A. D. 756," page 126: “In his introductory remarks at the head of the same chapter, he says, "It will be proper to remark, that the period of a time, times and a half, mentioned in the 25th verse as the duration of the dominion of the little horn that made war with the saints, (generally supposed to be a symbolical representation of the papal power,) had most probably its commencement in A. D. 755 or 756, when Pepin, king of France, invested the Pope with temporal power."&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian (Socinian),&lt;ref&gt;Antoine-Augustin Bruzen de La Martinière “Cérémonies Et Coutumes Religieuses” Paris: PRUDHOMME Son.

L. Chamberlain “Judah and Israel, or, The kingdom of the God of Heaven” San Francisco: The Bancroft Company (1888), page 216: “Many are still expecting his coming in the dim future, for those historical dates will not end until 2016 A.D.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholicon, a monthly Catholic publication, implied (1816) that this timeline was more accurate than the other predictions of the time:
{{bquote | ''“Lowman, who allowing the greatest latitude, comes in our opinion nearest to the truth, to the distant year 2016.”''&lt;ref&gt;“Catholicon” London: Keating, Brown and Keating (1816) vol. 111, no. XIV, Aug. 1816, page 50: "Lowman, who allowing the greatest latitude, comes in our opinion nearest to the truth, to the distant year 2016."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1870 the newly formed [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the remaining [[Papal States]], depriving the Pope of his [[temporal power (papal)|temporal]] rule. Unaware that Papal rule would be restored, (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state, the historicist view that the Papacy is the Antichrist rapidly declined in popularity as one of the defining characteristics of the Antichrist (i.e. that he would also be a political temporal power at the time of the return of Jesus) was no longer met.

In spite of its one time predominance, the 2016 prediction was largely forgotten and no major Protestant denomination currently subscribes to this timeline.

[[Image:2300days.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Seventh-day Adventist interpretation of the ''2300-day'' prophecy time line and its relation to the ''70-week'' prophecy]]
The distinctly Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the divine [[investigative judgment]] beginning in 1844, based on the 2300 day prophecy of {{bible verse||Daniel|8:14|KJV}}, relies on the day-year principle. The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the [[70 weeks prophecy#Seventh-day Adventist interpretations|70 weeks prophecy]] based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, to 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''[[Journal of the Adventist Theological Society]]'' 12:1 (Spring 2001), pp. 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prophecy of 2300 days in Verse 14 plays an important role in [[Seventh-day Adventist eschatology]]. The Seventh-day Adventist Church traces its origins to the [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], who predicted that the [[second coming]] of Jesus would occur in 1844 by assuming that the ''cleansing of the Sanctuary'' of Daniel 8:14 meant the destruction of the earth, and applying the day-year principle.

The prophetic time always uses the day-year principle, thus "2300 days" was understood to be 2300 years. Starting at the same time as the Prophecy of Seventy Weeks found in Chapter 9, on the grounds that the ''70 weeks'' were "decreed" (actually "cut off") for the Jewish people from the 2300-day prophecy. This beginning year is calculated to be 457 BC (see [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks#Seventh-day Adventist interpretations|details here]]), then the end of the 2300 years would have been in 1844.

Although the Millerites originally thought that 1844 represented the end of the world, those who later became Seventh-day Adventist reached the conclusion that 1844 marked the beginning of a divine [[Investigative Judgment|pre-advent judgment]] called [[Heavenly Sanctuary|"the cleansing of the sanctuary"]]. It is intimately related to the [[history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and was described by the church's prophet and pioneer [[Ellen G. White]] as one of the [[The Pillars of Adventism|pillars of Adventist belief]].&lt;ref&gt;White, E.G., "Counsels to Writers and Editors," pp. 30, 31 (Old Landmarks).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Venden, Morris, 1982, "The Pillars", Pacific Press, p. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baha'i application==
=== Baha'i recognition of the 2300 Day-Year Prophecy ===

Baha'is also recognize the Day-Year Principle and use it in understanding prophecy from the Bible. In the book, ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] outlines a similar calculation for the 2300-year prophecy as given in the Christian section above. By applying the day-year principle, he demonstrates that the fulfillment of the vision of Daniel occurred in the year 1844, the year of the [[Báb]]'s declaration in Persia i.e. the starting date of the Baha'i Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Some Answered Questions
|publisher=US Baha'i Publishing Trust
|year=1990
|page=42
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same year that the Millerites predicted for the return of Christ, and Baha'is believe that William Miller's methodologies were indeed sound.

The prophecy states "For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)
Baha'is understand the "cleansing of the sanctuary" to be the restoration of religion to a state in which it is guided by authorities appointed by its Founder rather than by people who have appointed themselves as the authority.&lt;ref name="Bahai1262"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Prophecies of Jesus
|publisher=OneWorld Publications, Ltd, Oxford, UK
|year=1991
|page=82
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The leaders of Sunni Islam were self-appointed; the first 12 leaders of Shia Islam had been appointed through a chain of succession going back to Muhammad, but that chain ended after 260 years—see next section below.)
Thus Baha'is believe that divinely-guided religion was re-established in 1844 with the revelation of the Báb, continued through the revelation of the Baha'i founder ([[Baha'u'llah]]) and continues today through their [[Universal House of Justice]], elected according to the method described by Baha'u'llah.&lt;ref name="Bahai1263"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Covenant of Baha'u'llah
|publisher=George Ronald Publisher, Ltd, Oxford, UK
|year=1992
|pages=1–441
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christians have generally expected their Messiah to appear somewhere in Judeo-Christian lands, Baha'is have noted&lt;ref&gt;''Thief in the Night'', [[William Sears (Bahá'í)|William Sears]], George Ronald Publishers, Oxford, England (1992), ch. 18, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; that Daniel himself was in Persia at the time the prophecy was made. He was in Shushan (modern day Susa or Shūsh, Iran), when he received his prophetic vision (Daniel 8:2). The Bab appeared 2300 years later in Shiraz, about 300 miles away from where Daniel's vision occurred.

=== Convergence of 1260-Day Prophecy and the 2300-Day Prophecy ===

The year 1260 was significant in Shia Islam, independently of any Biblical reference. The Shia branch of Islam followed a series of 12 Imams, whose authority they traced back to Muhammad. The last of these disappeared in the Islamic year 260 AH. According to a reference in the Qur'an,&lt;ref&gt;Quran 32:5&lt;/ref&gt; authority was to be re-established after 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="Bahai1261"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Dawn of Mount Hira
|publisher=George Ronald, Oxford, UK
|year=1976
|page=58
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there was widespread anticipation among Shi'ites that the 12th Imam would return in Islamic year 1260 AH. This is also the year 1844 AD in the Christian calendar. Thus both the [[Millerism|Millerites]] and the Shi'ites were expecting their Promised One to appear in the same year, although for entirely independent reasons.

Therefore, Baha'is understand the 1260-day prophecies in both Daniel and in the Book of Revelation as referring to the year 1260 of the Islamic calendar&lt;ref name="Bahai1260"&gt;{{cite book
|title=''Some Answered Questions''
|publisher=US Baha'i Publishing Trust
|year=1990
|page=46
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the year 1844 AD, the year the [[Báb]] pronounced himself to be a Messenger of God and the year that the Baha'i Faith began.

=== Day-Year Principle in Revelation 9:15 (391 Days) ===

Baha'is have also applied the Day-Year principle to Rev. 9:15&lt;ref&gt;William Sears, ''Thief in the Night'', part 1, chap. 6, page 24, George Ronald Publisher, Oxford, UK 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; which states, "And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men."

The slaying of "the third part of men" was interpreted by some Christian scholars&lt;ref&gt;H. Grattan Guinness, ''The Approaching End of the Age'' (1880, Hodder and Stoughton, London) at https://archive.org/stream/approachingendof00guin#page/662/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paget Baxter, ''The Coming Battle'' (W. Harbert, Philadelphia, 1860).&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the fall of the Eastern Orthodox part of Christianity, centered on Constantinople in the year 1453 AD. (The other two-thirds being the Western Christian world, centered on Rome, and the southern part of the Christian world in North Africa, which was already under the dominion of Islam long before 1453.) Using the day-year principle, the formula gives 1+30+360 days = 391 days = 391 years after 1453. Adding 391 years to 1453 brings the prediction again to 1844, the same year as the 2300 day prophecy of Daniel 8.

Theoretically, this prophecy could be taken one step further, since there are accurate records of the dates of the start and end of battle for Constantinople. If "the hour" is taken to be 1/24th of a day, then, by the day-year principle, it would equate to 1/24 of a year i.e. 15 days. Since the battle of Constantinople lasted for several weeks, it is not possible to pin down the exact starting day of this 391-1/24-year prophecy, but if the formula is followed to this degree, it suggests the prophecy's fulfillment should have occurred sometime in May or June 1844.

=== Day-Year Principle in Daniel 12: 1290- and 1335-Day Prophecies ===

In addition, Baha'is have applied the Day-Year principle to the two prophecies at the end of the last chapter of Daniel concerning the 1290 days (Dan 12:11) and the 1335 days (Dan 12:12).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sours, ''The Prophecies of Jesus'', Appendix 7, pp. 201-204 (One World Publications, Oxford, UK, 1991.)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1290 days is understood as a reference to the 1290 years from the open declaration of Muhammad to the open declaration of Baha'u'llah. The 1335 days is understood to be a reference to the firm establishment of Islam in 628 AD to the firm establishment of the Baha'i Faith (the election of its Universal House of Justice) in 1963 AD.

{{More citations needed|date=November 2012}}
{{US fed civ pro}}
The '''''Erie'' doctrine''' is a fundamental [[law|legal]] [[doctrine]] of [[civil procedure in the United States]] which mandates that a [[United States federal court|federal court]] sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] (or in general, when hearing state law claims in contexts like [[supplemental jurisdiction]] or adversarial proceedings in bankruptcy) must apply [[State law|state]] [[Substantive law|substantive]] law to resolve claims under state law.

The doctrine follows from the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[landmark decision]] in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'' (1938). The case overturned ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'', which allowed [[United States federal judge|federal judges]] sitting in a state to ignore the [[common law]] local decisions of [[State court (United States)|state courts]] in the same state, in cases based on [[diversity jurisdiction]].

==Scope==
There are two main objectives of the ''Erie'' decision: (1) to discourage [[forum shopping]] among litigants, and (2) to avoid inequitable administration of the laws.  Broadly speaking, the second objective is sometimes referred to as "vertical uniformity" and is rooted in the idea that in a given state, the outcome of the litigation should not be grossly different just because a litigant filed a claim in a state court rather than a federal court or vice versa.

The ''Erie'' doctrine today applies regardless of how the federal court may hear a state claim.  Whether the federal court encounters a state law issue in diversity jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction, or bankruptcy jurisdiction, the federal court must honor state [[common law]] when deciding state law issues.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, ''[[United Mine Workers v. Gibbs]]'', 383 U.S. 715 (1966) and ''[[Butner v. United States]]'', 440 U.S. 48 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, when the U.S. Constitution does not control and Congress has not legislated (or cannot legislate) on a topic, then the laws of the states necessarily govern and state judge-made rules are equally binding on the federal courts as state statutes.

The federal court must determine if either 1) state law is clear as to the case in controversy, or 2) if not, then has the state's highest court ruled specifically on a similar case.  If so, the state law or court ruling must be followed.  But if not, then the federal court must determine '''''how''''' the state's highest court would potentially rule on a matter: for example, it may look to state appellate courts to see how they ruled, and if the state chose not to hear further appeals, the federal court could determine that the high court agreed with the appellate courts.  The determination is called an '''Erie guess''', though the term "guess" is a misnomer as the federal court must make a reasoned determination in its ruling.

Alternatively though, the court may elect to certify the question to the state's highest court for a ruling on state law in the matter.  Some states, however, do not allow Federal District Courts to certify questions, only the Supreme Court or Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals.

==Origin==
The ''Erie'' case involved a fundamental question of [[federalism]] and the jurisdiction of federal courts in the United States.  In 1789, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law still in effect today called the [[Rules of Decision Act]] ({{usc|28|1652}}), which states that the laws of a state furnish the rules of decision for a federal court sitting in that state.  Thus, a federal court in [[Texas]], hearing a case based on diversity (as opposed to a federal question), has to follow the laws of the applicable state in resolving a case before it.

===''Swift v. Tyson''===
The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]'' had defined the laws of the state as meaning only laws passed by legislatures of that state (though Justice [[Joseph Story]] writing for the court suggested that federal courts should pay special attention to how the "local tribunals" of a state would resolve a dispute). Thus, on issues of "general common law," a federal court was free to ignore decisions by a state's highest court.

===Aftermath of ''Swift''===
The decision in ''[[Swift v. Tyson|Swift]]'' resulted in inconsistent judicial rulings in the same state on the same legal issue depending on whether a plaintiff brought a case in state or federal court.  In one case, for example, ''[[Black and White Taxicab Co. v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab Co.]]'' 276 U.S. 518 (1928), the Brown and Yellow Cab Company, a [[Kentucky]] [[corporation]], sought to create a business association with the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], where Brown and Yellow would have a monopoly on soliciting passengers of the railroad, effectively eliminating the competition, the Black and White Cab Co.  Such an agreement was illegal under Kentucky [[common law]], as interpreted by Kentucky's highest court.  Brown and Yellow dissolved itself, reincorporated in [[Tennessee]], and executed the agreement there, where such an agreement was legal, bringing suit against Black and White in a Kentucky federal court to prevent them from soliciting passengers.  The federal court upheld the agreement, citing ''Swift'', and arguing that under general federal common law, the agreement was valid.  If Brown and Yellow had brought suit in a Kentucky state court, the agreement would not have been upheld.

==''Erie''==
The decision in ''Erie'' involved a [[railroad]] accident.  The [[plaintiff]], Tompkins, was walking alongside Erie's railroad tracks in [[Pennsylvania]] when a train passed. An open door struck him and knocked him under the train, severing his arm.  In most states, Tompkins could sue for [[negligence]] of the railroad and recover monetary damages for his loss. In Pennsylvania, however, Tompkins would have been considered a [[trespass]]er. He was not to recover for an ordinary negligence claim in the state court of Pennsylvania, because under the law of that state, a claimant had to show "wanton" negligence on part of the Defendant to recover.

Thus, Tompkins brought his case in federal court to avoid the unfavorable state law. He subsequently won. However, on appeal the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] held, in an opinion drafted by Justice Brandeis, that such decisions and inconsistent rulings based on a general federal common law were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]], and that decisions by a state supreme court were "laws" that federal courts were bound to follow under the ''Rule of Decision Act''.  Brandeis noted that the Court felt that ''Swift'' allowed federal courts to make unconstitutional modifications of the substantive law of a state. He noted that it violated the right to equal protection under the law, although he did not mean it in the sense of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Court overturned ''Swift'' on its own initiative, since the parties in ''Erie'' did not ask the Court to do so.

==Development==
Several later [[Legal case|cases]] have added to the vague ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins|Erie]]'' decision (Brandeis cited no provision of the Constitution that ''[[Swift v. Tyson|Swift]]'' violated, although theoretically it might have violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment's]] reservation of powers to the state).  Speaking generally, there are two approaches in determining whether a federal court will apply a state law: (1) the ''[[Hanna v. Plumer|Hanna]]'' &amp; [[Rules Enabling Act]] approach, per {{usc|28|2072}} when there is a [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] and [[statute]] that conflicts with a [[state law]]; and (2) the ''Byrd''-''Erie'' approach when there is not a conflict between a state and federal practice.

===''Byrd''-''Erie''===
This approach suggests that unless there is a major countervailing federal policy that trumps the state practice, if ignoring the state law would lead to forum shopping by plaintiffs and unequal administration of the laws (like in ''Yellow Cab'' above), the court should apply the state law. In ''[[Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc.|Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electrical Cooperative, Inc.]]'', the Court decided that the federal policy allocating responsibilities between judge and jury, as embodied in the 7th Amendment of the US Constitution, outweighed the state rule requiring a judge to decide whether an employer was immune from suit. The main goal of the ''Erie'' decision was to prevent "[[forum-shopping]]," a practice where [[plaintiffs]] choose a [[venue (law)|legal forum]] simply because of the probability of a more favorable ruling.  The main problem with the decision is that  sometimes there is simply no state law or practice on which a federal court may defer. Federal judges are left to guess how a state court would rule on a given legal question, and a state court is in no way bound by a federal decision interpreting their own state law.

Justice Frankfurter in ''[[Guaranty Trust Co. v. York]]'', {{ussc|326|99|1945}} summarizes the main point of Erie differently... 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In essence, the intent of that decision was to ensure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court....&lt;/blockquote&gt;   

This suggests that Erie's main goal was to achieve equal protection under the law.  One way that equal protection is intentionally disregarded would be through  "[[forum shopping]],"  but the reduction of inequality was the main target of the doctrine.

===''Hanna''===
Under the approach in ''[[Hanna v. Plumer]]'', the [[United States district court|federal court]] of a [[U.S. state|state]] hearing a case based on [[diversity jurisdiction]] should apply [[state law]] in the event of conflict between state and federal law if the state law deals with substantive rights of state citizens.  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has defined substantive rights as, "rights conferred by the law to be protected and enforced by the adjective law of judicial procedure."   An example of a substantive right would be a state law on [[fraud]], which may vary widely in composition depending on the jurisdiction.    If the state law is merely procedural,  or relating merely to the form and mode of judicial operations, then the federal court does not have to apply the conflicting state law.   However, the substance-procedure distinction is a generality as the Court rejected any test based upon "litmus paper criterion."   Thus, a choice between state and federal law must be made with reference to the underlying policy of the ''Erie'' decision.   The Court announced a modification of the "outcome-determinative" test in ''York'',  whereby the test must be applied in light of the twin aims of ''Erie,''  which are the discouragement of forum-shopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.   Under this rule, state procedural law would not supplant federal procedural law if the differences in the outcome are nonsubstantial or trivial,  fail to raise Equal Protection concerns,  and are unlikely to influence the choice of forum.

=== ''Gasperini'' ===
A recent Supreme Court case that addressed the ''Erie'' problem is ''[[Gasperini v. Center for Humanities]]'', {{ussc|518|415|1996}}.  ''Gasperini'' is a post-''Hanna'' decision addressing a conflict between state and federal law for review of jury verdicts. The plaintiff, a well-known artist and photographer from New York, sued a New York museum in federal court in New York, for damages arising from the loss of some photographs and slides he had loaned the museum. A jury found in his favor and awarded damages. The defendant appealed, and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reduced the damages award on appeal. Gasperini appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The New York state provision, a [[Tort reform in the United States|"tort reform"]] measure, allowed reviewing appellate courts to overturn a jury verdict if it "deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation."  Pursuant to this law, the Second Circuit applied the state's appellate standard of review. However, the Supreme Court stated that federal courts, bound by the reexamination clause of the [[Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], could overturn a jury's finding of fact only if it "shocked the conscience."

The Supreme Court could have resolved the case by reading the [[Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] broadly, and treating it as controlling in federal court. However, instead, the Court opted for what can be described as a compromise, holding that the federal court should apply the state's lower standard of review, but in a way that would not run afoul of the Seventh Amendment: instead of the federal appeals court reviewing the jury finding, the trial judge would assume the role.

''Gasperini'', and another recent ''Erie''-area case, ''[[Semtek International Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.]]'', have shown ''Erie'' has gone in a newer and even more complicated direction than the previous controlling cases, and that instead of selecting either federal or state law for a case, the federal court may be required to somehow blend federal and state law, depending on the issue. This is quite frustrating for those who wish to have a black-letter rule that will point them to the answer. However, the possibility of blending in ''Erie'' does not open up an infinitude of possibilities. In both ''Gasperini'' and ''Semtek'', the common thread is that the blending is done in a way that is calculated to advance the aims of ''Erie'' (and ''York''): non-discrimination between litigants, and discouragement of [[forum shopping]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan Ides &amp; Christopher May, Civil Procedure, 3d Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eschatological verification''' describes a process whereby a proposition can be verified after death. A proposition such as "there is an afterlife" is verifiable if true but not falsifiable if false (if it's false, the individual will not know it's false, because they have no state of being). The term is most commonly used in relation to [[God]] and the [[afterlife]], although there may be other propositions - such as moral propositions - which may also be verified after death. 

[[John Hick]] has expressed the premise as an allegory of a quest to a Celestial City. In this parable, a [[theist]] and an [[atheist]] are both walking down the same road. The theist believes there is a destination, the atheist believes there is not. If they reach the destination, the theist will have been proven right; however, if there is no destination on an endless road, this can never be verified. This is an attempt to explain how a theist expects some form of life or existence after death and an atheist does not. They both have separate belief systems and live life accordingly, but logically one is right and the other is not. If the theist is right, he will be proven so when he arrives in the afterlife. However, if the atheist is right, they will simply both be dead and nothing will be verified.

This acts as a response to [[Verificationism]]. Under Hick's analogy claims about the [[afterlife]] are verifiable ''in principle'' because the truth becomes clear after death. To some extent it is therefore wrong to claim that religious language cannot be verified because it can (when you're dead).

'''Guided meditation''' is a process by which one or more participants [[Meditation|meditate]] in response to the guidance provided by a trained practitioner or teacher,&lt;ref&gt;Complementary, Alternative, or Integrative Health: What’s In a Name?

The term "guided meditation" is most commonly used in [[Medicine#Clinical practice|clinical practice]], [[Research|scholarly research]], and [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] to signify an aggregate of integrated techniques. The most common and frequently used combination or synthesis comprises [[meditation music]] and [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], [[guided imagery]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], some form of [[Meditation|meditative practice]] and [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]], and [[Writing therapy|journaling]]. [[Hypnosis]] or [[Hypnotherapy|hypnotherapeutic procedures]] may be included as part of an intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

Investigators, clinicians, and research authors frequently analyze and discuss the effects and efficacy of this intervention as a whole, with the result that it is often difficult to attribute positive or negative outcomes to any of the specific techniques that contribute to guided meditation. Furthermore, the term "guided meditation" is frequently used interchangeably with the terms "guided imagery" and sometimes with "creative visualization" in [[popular psychology]] and [[Self help|self-help]] literature, and to a lesser extent in [[Scholarly method|scholarly]] and [[Scientific method|scientific]] publications. Consequently, understanding the nature, scope, application, and limitations of guided meditation requires it to be considered in context and relationship to the multiple techniques that are integral to its practice, allowing for variations in terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

Guided meditation as an aggregate or synthesis of techniques including [[meditation music]] and [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], [[guided imagery]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[Meditation|meditative praxis]], and [[Writing therapy|self-reflective diary-keeping or journaling]] has been shown to be effective in precipitating [[Therapy|therapeutic]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitative]], and [[Learning|educational]] benefits when employed as an adjunct to primary clinical and instructional strategies, including as a means to lower levels of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]],&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

'''Integral theory''' is [[Ken Wilber]]'s attempt to place a wide diversity of theories and thinkers into one single framework.&lt;ref name="sean1"&gt;Esbjörn-Hargens, S. (2010). Introduction. In Esbjörn-Hargens (ed.) Integral Theory in Action: Applied, Theoretical, and Constructive Perspectives on the AQAL Model.  Albany, NY: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is portrayed as a "theory of everything" ("the living Totality of matter, body, mind, soul, and spirit"),&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;Macdonald, Copthorne.

Ken Wilber's "Integral Theory" started as early as the 1970s, with the publication of ''The Spectrum of Consciousness'',&lt;ref name="grof1"&gt;Grof, Stanislav.

Retrieved via StanislavGrof.com on Jan. 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; that attempted to synthesize eastern religious traditions with western structural stage theory, models of psychology development that describe human development as following a set course of stages of development.&lt;ref name="zimmerman1"&gt;Zimmerman, Michael E. (2005). [http://www.colorado.edu/ArtsSciences/CHA/profiles/zimmpdf/Ken_Wilber_Rel_and_Nat.pdf "Ken Wilber (1949 -)"], The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, p. 1743. London: Continuum&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="sst"}}

Wilber's ideas have grown more and more inclusive over the years, incorporating [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and [[methodology]].&lt;ref name="eborn-hargens1"&gt;Esbjörn-Hargens, Sean (2006). [http://aqaljournal.integralinstitute.org/ "Editor’s Inaugural Welcome,"] AQAL: Journal of Integral Theory and Practice, p. v. Retrieved Jan. 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber, drawing on both Aurobindo's and Gebser's theories, as well as on the writings of many other authors, created a theory which he calls AQAL, "All Quadrants All Levels".

===Background===

====Sri Aurobindo====

The adjective ''integral'' was first used in a spiritual context by [[Sri Aurobindo]] (1872–1950) from 1914 onward to describe his own [[Integral Yoga|spiritual teachings]], which he referred to as ''Purna'' (Skt: "Full") Yoga. It appeared in ''[[The Synthesis of Yoga]]'', a book that was first published in serial form in the journal ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]'' and was revised several times since.&lt;ref&gt;''The Synthesis of Yoga'', see Biographical Notes to the 3rd Pondicherry edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo's work has been described as Integral Vedanta,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and [[Integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Ram Shankar Misra, ''The integral Advaitism of Sri Aurobindo'', Banaras: Banaras Hindu University, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haridas Chaudhuri, Frederic Spiegelberg, ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen &amp; Unwin, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Integral Psychology (the term coined by [[Indra Sen]]) and the psychotherapy that emerges from it.&lt;ref&gt;Brant Cortright, Integral Psychology: Yoga, Growth, and Opening the Heart, SUNY, 2007 {{ISBN|0-7914-7071-7}}, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; His writings influenced others who used the term "integral" in more philosophical or psychological contexts.

In the teachings of Sri Aurobindo, integral yoga refers to the process of the union of all the parts of one's being with the Divine, and the transmutation of all of their jarring elements into a harmonious state of higher divine consciousness and existence.

As described by Sri Aurobindo and his co-worker [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] (1878–1973), this spiritual teaching involves an integral [[Apotheosis|divine transformation]] of the entire being, rather than the [[moksha|liberation]] of only a single faculty such as the [[intellect]] or the [[emotion]]s or the body. According to Sri Aurobindo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;(T)he Divine is in his essence infinite and his manifestation too is multitudinously infinite. If that is so, it is not likely that our true integral perfection in being and in nature can come by one kind of realisation alone; it must combine many different strands of divine experience. It cannot be reached by the exclusive pursuit of a single line of identity till that is raised to its absolute; it must harmonise many aspects of the Infinite. An integral consciousness with a multiform dynamic experience is essential for the complete transformation of our nature. &amp;mdash; Sri Aurobindo, ''[[The Synthesis of Yoga]]'', p. 114&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aurobindo's ideas were further explored by [[Indra Sen]] (1903–1994) in the 1940s and 1950s, a psychologist, and devotee of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. He was the first to coin the term "Integral psychology" to describe the psychological observations he found in Sri Aurobindo's writings (which he contrasted with those of Western Psychology), and developed themes of "Integral Culture" and "Integral Man".&lt;ref&gt;Aster Patel, "The Presence of Dr Indra Senji", [http://sabda.sriaurobindoashram.org/pdf/news/nov2003.pdf SABDA - Recent Publications, November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas were further developed by  [[Haridas Chaudhuri]] (1913–1975), a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] philosopher and academic who founded in 1968 the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Haridas Chaudhuri, "Psychology: Humanistic and Transpersonal". ''[[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]]'', and ''The Evolution of Integral Consciousness''; Bahman Shirazi "Integral psychology, metaphors and processes of personal integration"  in Cornelissen (ed.) ''Consciousness and Its Transformation'' [http://www.saccs.org.in/TEXTS/IP2/IP2-1.2-.htm online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jean Gebser====
The word ''integral'' was independently suggested by [[Jean Gebser]] (1905–1973), a [[Swiss]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] and interdisciplinary scholar, in 1939 to describe his own intuition regarding the next stage of human [[higher consciousness|consciousness]]. Gebser was the author of ''The Ever-Present Origin'', which describes human history as a series of mutations in [[consciousness]]. He only afterwards discovered the similarity between his own ideas and those of Sri Aurobindo and [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ever-Present Origin'' p.102 note 4&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Ever-Present Origin'', Gebser distinguished between five structures of consciousness: archaic, magic, mythical, mental, and integral. Gebser wrote that he was unaware of Sri Aurobindo's prior usage of the term "integral", which coincides to some extent with his own.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====Georg Feuerstein====
The German indologist [[Georg Feuerstein]] first wrote about Integralism in "Wholeness or Transcendence? Ancient Lessons for the Emerging Global Civilization" (1992). Feuerstein used this term to refer to a particular outlook on spirituality which he saw present in the Indian [[tantra|tantric]] traditions. Feuerstein outlined three major approaches to life in Indian spirituality: ''nivritti-marga'' (path of cessation), ''pravritti-marga'' (path of activity) and ''purna-marga'' (path of wholeness).&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, G. Tantra, path of ecstasy, pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The path of cessation is the traditional path of renunciation and [[asceticism]] practiced by [[sannyasa|sanyasins]] with the goal of liberation from this world, while the path of activity is the pursuit of worldly goods and happiness. Feuerstein ties this integral approach to [[nondual]] Indian philosophy and the tantric tradition. According to Feuerstein the integral or wholeness approach: "implies a total cognitive shift by which the phenomenal world is rendered transparent through superior wisdom. No longer are things seen as being strictly separated from one another, as if they were insular realities in themselves, but everything is seen together, understood together, and lived together. Whatever distinctions there may be, these are variations or manifestations of and within the selfsame Being."&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, G. Tantra, path of ecstasy, pages 44&lt;/ref&gt; An integral worldview also leads to body and sex positivism and anti-asceticism. Even negative experiences such as pain and disgust are seen as integral to our life and world and thus are not rejected by the integral approach, but used skillfully.

====Collaboration with Don Beck====
After completing SES, Ken Wilber started to collaborate with Don Beck, whose "[[Spiral Dynamics]]" shows strong correlates with Wilber's model.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Cooke and Ben Levi [http://www.dialogue.org/Documents/SD_Integral.pdf Spiral Dynamics Integral]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spiral Dynamics, Don Beck and Chris Cowan use the term ''integral'' for a developmental stage which sequentially follows the pluralistic stage. The essential characteristic of this stage is that it continues the inclusive nature of the pluralistic mentality, yet extends this inclusiveness to those outside of the pluralistic mentality. In doing so, it accepts the ideas of development and hierarchy, which the pluralistic mentality finds difficult. Other ideas of Beck and Cowan include the "first tier" and "second tier", which refer to major periods of human development.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Ken Wilber's AQAL, pronounced "ah-qwul", is the basic framework of Integral Theory. It suggests that all human knowledge and experience can be placed in a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is one of the most comprehensive approaches to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.&lt;ref name="wilber-intro"&gt;Wilber, Ken. [http://aqaljournal.integralinstitute.org/public/Pdf/AQAL_Glossary_01-27-07.pdf "AQAL Glossary,"] "Introduction to Integral Theory and Practice: IOS Basic and the AQAL Map," Vol. 1, No. 3. Retrieved on Jan. 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which don't fit into these four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiandt | first1 = K. | last2 = Forman | first2 = J. | last3 = Erickson Megel | first3 = M. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = Integral nursing: an emerging framework for engaging the evolution of the profession | url = http://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(03)00080-0/abstract | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 130–137 | doi=10.1016/s0029-6554(03)00080-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. "Lines" are lines of development, the several domains of development, which may process uneven, with several stages of development in place at the various domains.{{refn|group=note|This interpretation is at odds with structural stage theory, which posits an overall follow-up of stages, instead of variations over several domains.}} "States" are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a terminal experience of a higher developmental stage.{{refn|group=note|This too is wildly at odds with structural stage theory, but in line with Wilber's philosophical idealism, which sees the phenomenal world as a concretisation, or immanation, of a "higher," transcendental reality, which can be "realized" in "religious experience."}} "Types" is a rest-category, for phenomena which don't fit in the other four concepts.&lt;ref&gt;"Integral Psychology." In: Weiner, Irving B. &amp; Craighead, W. Edward (ed.), ''The Corsini encyclopedia of psychology,'' Vol. 2, 4. ed., Wiley 2010, pp. 830 ff. {{ISBN|978-0-470-17026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Excerpt C: The Ways We Are In This Together | work=Ken Wilber Online | url=http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm | accessdate=December 26, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223205255/http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptC/intro-1.cfm/ | archivedate=December 23, 2005 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is topped with formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being," which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories—quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types—describe the relative truth of the [[two truths doctrine]] of [[Buddhism]].{{refn|group=note|The [[Madhyamaka]] Two Truths Doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every"thing" is empty, [[sunyata]] of an unchanging "essence." It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and ''do'' posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.}}

===Holons===
{{main article|Holon (philosophy)}}

Holons are the individual building blocks of Wilber's model. Wilber borrowed the concept of ''[[Holon (philosophy)|holons]]'' from [[Arthur Koestler]]'s description of the [[great chain of being]], a mediaeval description of levels of being. "Holon" means that every [[entity]] and [[concept]] is both an entity on its own, and a hierarchical part of a larger whole. For example, a cell in an organism is both a whole as a cell, and at the same time a part of another whole, the organism. Likewise a letter is a self-existing entity and simultaneously an integral part of a word, which then is part of a sentence, which is part of a paragraph, which is part of a page; and so on. Everything from [[quarks]] to [[matter]] to [[energy]] to [[idea]]s can be looked at in this way. The relation between individuals and society is not the same as between cells and organisms though, because individual holons can be members but not parts of social holons.&lt;ref&gt;See ''A Miracle Called "We"'' in '' Integral Spirituality'' and http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptA/notes-1.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality]]: The Spirit of Evolution'', Wilber outlines twenty fundamental properties, called "tenets", that characterize all holons.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken; ''Sex, Ecology, Spirituality'', 1995, p. 35–78&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they must be able to maintain their "wholeness" and also their "part-ness;" a holon that cannot maintain its wholeness will cease to exist and will break up into its constituent parts.

Holons form natural "[[holarchy|holarchies]]", like [[Russian doll]]s, where a whole is a part of another whole, in turn part of another whole, and so on.

===Quadrants===
Each [[holon (philosophy)|holon]] can be seen from within (subjective, interior perspective) and from the outside (objective, exterior perspective), and from an individual or a collective perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Wilber's Integral Philosophy: A Summary and Critique | url = http://jhp.sagepub.com/content/48/3/364.abstract | journal = Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 364–388 | doi = 10.1177/0022167807309748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the four approaches has a valid perspective to offer. The subjective emotional pain of a person who suffers a tragedy is one perspective; the social statistics about such tragedies are different perspectives on the same matter. According to Wilber all are needed for real appreciation of a matter.

Wilber uses this grid to categorize the perspectives of various theories and scholars, for example:
* '''Interior individual perspective (upper-left quadrant)''' include [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]], which interprets people's interior experiences and focuses on "I"
* '''Interior plural perspective (lower-left)''' include [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]'s philosophical [[hermeneutics]] which seeks to interpret the [[collective consciousness]] of a society, or plurality of people and focuses on "We"
* '''Exterior individual perspective (upper-right)''' include [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behaviorism]], which limits itself to the observation of the behavior of organisms and treats the internal experience, decision making or volition of the subject as a [[black box]], and which with the fourth perspective emphasizes the subject as a specimen to examine, or "It".
* '''Exterior plural perspective (lower-right)''' include [[Marxian economics|Marxist economic theory]] which focuses upon the behavior of a society (i.e. a plurality of people) as functional entities seen from outside, e.g. "They".

According to Wilber, all four perspectives offer complementary, rather than contradictory, perspectives. It is possible for all to be correct, and all are necessary for a complete account of human existence. According to Wilber, each by itself offers only a partial view of reality.

According to Wilber modern western society has a pathological focus on the exterior or objective perspective. Such perspectives value that which can be externally measured and tested in a laboratory, but tend to deny or marginalize the left sides (subjectivity, individual experience, feelings, values) as ''unproven'' or having ''no meaning''. Wilber identifies this as a fundamental cause of society's malaise, and names the situation resulting from such perspectives, "flatland".

===Levels or stages===
{{See also|Developmental stage theories}}

Wilber discerns various structural stages of development, following several structural stage theories of [[developmental psychology]].{{refn|group=note|name="sst"|[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]],&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza (ed.), ''International Handbook of Education for Spirituality, Care and Wellbeing,'' Springer 2009, p. 427. {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]]'s [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]], [[Erik Erikson|Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], and [[Jane Loevinger]]'s [[Loevinger's stages of ego development|stages of ego development]].}} According to Wilber, these stages can be grouped in [[pre-personal]] (subconscious motivations), personal (conscious mental processes), and [[transpersonal]] (integrative and mystical structures) stages.{{refn|group=note|For example:
* [[Freudian]] drives, [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[archetypes]], and myth are pre-personal structures. 
* Empirical and rational processes are at the personal level. 
* Transpersonal entities include, for example, [[Aurobindo]]'s Overmind, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]'s Oversoul, [[Plato]]'s Forms, [[Plotinus]]' ''nous'', and the [[Hindu]] [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], or world-soul.}}

All of these mental structures are considered to be complementary and legitimate, rather than mutual exclusive. Wilber's equates the levels in psychological and cultural development, with the hierarchical nature of matter itself.

===Lines, streams, or intelligences===
According to Wilber, various domains or lines of development, or [[Theory of multiple intelligences|intelligences]] can be discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilber|first=Ken|title=integral Psychology|year=2000|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1-57062-554-9|pages=197–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[Cognition|cognitive]], [[Ethics|ethical]], [[aesthetic]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], [[kinesthetic]], [[Affection|affective]], [[music]]al, spatial, [[logic]]al-[[Mathematics|mathematical]], [[karma|karmic]], etc. For example, one can be highly developed cognitively (cerebrally smart) without being highly developed morally (as in the case of [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctors).

===States===
States are temporary states of consciousness, such as waking, dreaming and sleeping, bodily sensations, and drug-induced and meditation-induced states. Some states are interpreted as temporary intimations of higher stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, Ken. (2006). ''Integral spirituality: A startling new role for religion in the modern and post-modern world''.  Boston, MA: Shambhala&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Mark (2008). "An Alternative View on States: Part One and Two. Retrieved in full 3/08 from http://www.integralworld.net/edwards14.html&lt;/ref&gt; Wilber's formulation is: "States are free but structures are earned." A person has to ''build'' or earn structure; it cannot be peak-experienced for free. What can be peak-experienced, however, are higher states of freedom from the stage a person is habituated to, so these deeper or higher states can be experienced at any level.{{refn|group=note|In his book ''Integral Spirituality'', Wilber identifies a few varieties of states: 
* The three [[Day|daily]] cycling ''natural'' states: waking, dreaming, and sleeping. 
* ''Penomenal'' states such as bodily sensations, emotions, mental ideas, memories, or inspirations, or from exterior sources such as our [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|sensorimotor]] inputs, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, tasting. 
* ''Altered'' states, is divided into two groups:
:* ''[[Exogenous]]'' or [[wikt:induce|induce]]d states: psychedelic and other drug-induced states; hypnosis and [[hypnotherapy]]; psycho-therapeutic techniques; [[gestalt therapy]]; [[psychodrama]]; [[voice dialogue]] techniques; [[biofeedback]] states; forms of guided imagery;
:* ''[[Endogenous]]'' or trained states: performance enhancement techniques in [[sports therapy]]; meditative training which work on calming, relaxation, equanimity states; and mental imaging and visualization such as [[tonglen]] meditation. 
:* Some techniques, such as [[Neuro-linguistic Programming]], work with both endogenous and exogenous types. 
* ''[[wikt:spontaneous|Spontaneous]]'' or peak states: unintentional or unexpected shifts of awareness from gross to subtle or causal states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1970). ''Religions, values, and peak experiences''. New York: Penguin; McFetridge, Grant (2004). ''Peak states of consciousness: Theory and applications, vol. 1, Break-through techniques for exceptional quality of life''.  Hornsby Island, BC: Institute for the Study of Peak States Press; Bruce, R. (1999). ''Astral dynamics: A new approach to out-of-body experiences''. Charlottesville, VA: Hampton Roads&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Types===
These are models and theories that don't fit into Wilber’s other categorizations. Masculine/feminine, the nine [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]] categories, and [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and typologies, among innumerable others, are all valid types in Wilber's schema. Wilber makes types part of his model in order to point out that these distinctions are different from the already mentioned distinctions: quadrants, lines, levels and states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Other approaches===
Bonnitta Roy has introduced a "Process Model" of integral theory, combining Western process philosophy, Dzogchen ideas, and Wilberian theory. She distinguishes between Wilber's concept of ''perspective'' and the Dzogchen concept of ''view'', arguing that Wilber's view is situated within a framework or ''structural enfoldment'' which constrains it, in contrast to the Dzogchen intention of being mindful of view.&lt;ref name="roy1"&gt;Roy, Bonnitta (2006).

Wendelin Küpers, a German scholar specializing in phenomenological research, has proposed that an "integral pheno-practice" based on aspects of the work of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] can provide the basis of an "adequate phenomenology" useful in integral research. His proposed approach claims to offer a more inclusive and coherent approach than classical phenomenology, including procedures and techniques called ''epoché'', ''bracketing'', ''reduction'', and ''free variation.''&lt;ref name="kupers1"&gt;Küpers, Wendelin [http://integral-review.org/documents/Kupers,%20Phenomenology%20Vol.%205%20No.%201.pdf "The Status and Relevance of Phenomenology for Integral Research: Or Why Phenomenology is More and Different than an 'Upper Left' or 'Zone #1' Affair,"] Integral Review, June 2009, Vol. 5, No. 1.

[[Sean Esbjörn-Hargens]] has proposed a new approach to [[climate change]] called Integral Pluralism, which builds on Wilber's recent work but emphasizes elements such as Ontological Pluralism that are understated or absent in Wilber's own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Esbjörn-Hargens, S.

Graves]], [[Jane Loevinger]] and Ken Wilber.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Floyd, Alex Burns, and Jose Ramos, [http://foresightinternational.com.au/catalogue/resources/Integral_Futures.pdf A Challenging Conversation on Integral Futures: Embodied Foresight &amp; Trialogues], ''Journal of Futures Studies'', November 2008, 13(2): 69 - 86; p.71&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Steve McIntosh]] pointed to [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Teilhard de Chardin]] as pre-figuring Wilber as integral thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', ch.7&lt;/ref&gt; While in the same year, the editors of ''What Is Enlightenment?'' listed as contemporary Integralists [[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]], Allan Combs, [[Robert Godwin]], Sally Goerner, [[George Burr Leonard|George Leonard]], [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], [[William Irwin Thompson]], and Wilber.&lt;ref&gt;The Real Evolution Debate, ''What Is Enlightenment?'', no.35, January–March 2007, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Hampson suggested that there are six intertwined genealogical branches of Integral, based on those who first used the term: those aligned with Aurobindo, Gebser, Wilber, Gangadean, László and Steiner (noting that the Steiner branch is via the conduit of Gidley).&lt;ref&gt;Gary Hampson, "Integral Re-views Postmodernism: The Way Out Is Through" ''Integral Review'' 4, 2007 pp.13-4, http://www.integral-review.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[Michael E. Zimmerman (philosopher)|Michael E. Zimmerman]] and Sean Esbjörn-Hargens have applied Wilber's integral theory in their environmental studies and ecological research, calling it "integral ecology".&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M. (2005). “Integral Ecology: A Perspectival, Developmental, and Coordinating Approach to Environmental Problems.” ''World Futures: The Journal of General Evolution'' 61, nos. 1-2: 50-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esbjörn-Hargens, S.

"Integral leadership" is presented as a style of leadership that attempts to integrate major styles of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Kupers, W. &amp; Volckmann, R. (2009).

Retrieved on October 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]], Lawrence Chickering, Jack Crittenden, David Sprecher, and [[Ken Wilber]] have applied the AQAL-model to issues in [[political philosophy]] and applications in [[government]], calling it "integral politics".&lt;ref name="wilber-atoe1"&gt;Ken Wilber (2000). A Theory of Everything: An Integral Vision for Business, Politics, Science and Spirituality, p. 153. Boston: Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-855-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen has called the [[Integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|Yoga psychology of Sri Aurobindo]] "Integral psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Indra Sen, ''Integral Psychology: The Psychological System of Sri Aurobindo'', Pondicherry, India: Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; For Wilber, "integral psychology" is psychology that is inclusive or holistic rather than exclusivist or reductive, and values and integrates multiple explanations and methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, K., 1997, [http://www.imprint.co.uk/Wilber.htm An integral theory of consciousness]; ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'', 4 (1), pp.71-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esbjörn-Hargens, S., &amp; Wilber, K. (2008). “Integral Psychology” in The Corsini’s Encyclopedia of Psychology. 4th Edition. New York: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Marilyn Hamilton used the term "integral city", describing the city as a living human system, using an integral lens.&lt;ref name="hamilton-icity"&gt;Hamilton, M. (2008). Integral City: Evolutionary Intelligences for the Human Hive. Gabriola Island BC: New Society Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Integral Life Practice (ILP) applies Ken Wilber's Integral model through nine modules of personal practice.  Examples of "integral practice" not associated with Ken Wilber, and derived from alternate approaches, are Integral Transformative Practice (ITP), Holistic Integration, and Integral Lifework.

== Reception in mainstream academia ==
Integral Theory is widely ignored, at mainstream academic institutions, and has been sharply contested by critics.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"&gt;Michael E. Zimmerman. [http://www.colorado.edu/ArtsSciences/CHA/profiles/zimmpdf/Ken_Wilber_Rel_and_Nat.pdf Ken Wilber], The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, London: Continuum. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The independent scholar Frank Visser says that there is a problematic relation between Wilber and academia for several reasons, including a "self-referential discourse" wherein Wilber tends to describe his work as being at the forefront of science.&lt;ref name="visser2"&gt;Frank Visser. [http://www.integralworld.net/visser26.html "Assessing Integral Theory: Opportunities and Impediments,"] IntegralWorld.net, accessed 2010-1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Visser has compiled a bibliography of online criticism of Wilber's Integral Theory&lt;ref name="visser-criticism"&gt;Visser, Frank. [http://www.integralworld.net/criticism.html "Critics on Ken Wilber,"] IntegralWorld.net. Retrieved on Jan. 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and produced an overview of their objections.&lt;ref name="visser-objections"&gt;Frank Visser [http://www.integralworld.net/visser11.html "A Spectrum of Wilber Critics,"] IntegralWorld.net, accessed 2010-1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Wilber critic, the independent scholar Andrew P. Smith, observes that most of Wilber's work has not been published by university presses, a fact that discourages some academics from taking his ideas seriously. Wilber's failure to respond to critics of Integral Theory is also said to contribute to the field's chilly reception in some quarters.&lt;ref name="smith1"&gt;Smith, Andrew P. [http://www.integralworld.net/smith20.html "Contextualizing Ken"], IntegralWorld.net. Retrieved on Jan. 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forman and Esbjörn-Hargens have countered criticisms regarding the academic standing of integral studies in part by claiming that the divide between Integral Theory and academia is exaggerated by critics who themselves lack academic credentials or standing. They also said that participants at the first Integral Theory Conference in 2008 had largely mainstream academic credentials and pointed to existing programs in alternative universities like [[John F. Kennedy University]] or [[Fielding Graduate University]] as an indication of the field's emergence.&lt;ref name="forman-hargens1"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The AQAL system has been critiqued for not taking into account the lack of change in the biological structure of the brain at the human level (complex neocortex), this role being taken instead by human-made artifacts.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;Steve McIntosh, ''Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution'', Paragon House, St Paul Minnesota, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55778-867-2}} pp.227f.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5046">'''John Siddique''' (born 1964) is best known as a British [[spiritual teacher]], [[poet]], and [[author]]. &lt;br /&gt; 
He is the founder of Authentic Living, through which he aims to encourage people from all walks of life awaken to what he calls their 'true naturalness'.

In the field of literature, Siddique is the Honorary Fellow in Creative Writing at Leicester University. He is the former Canterbury Laureate, and British Council Poet in Residence at California State University, Los Angeles. He has served as a Royal Literary Fund Fellow at York St. John University.

==Personal life==
The young Siddique immersed himself in the world of books through his local library. Before becoming a writer he drifted through various jobs such as being a [[Road crew|roadie]], a pipe-welder, and [[Landscape gardening|landscape gardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=7336 |title=''Poetry International'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111937/http://uk.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=7336 |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He first began writing in 1991 after reading James Joyce's Ulysses and discovering the poetry of [[e.e. cummings]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[D.H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therialto.co.uk/pages/|title= ''The Rialto''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated in interviews that he regards his true countries of birth to be "literature and language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelondonmagazine.net |title=''The London Magazine'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209001156/http://www.thelondonmagazine.net/ |archivedate=2010-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014 Siddique became very ill and underwent a near-death experience, he says that as he died, he felt an infinite love that was beyond intimacy, and that he distinctly heard a voice telling him to 'leave his old work and go and talk with people.' It was this that led him to become a spiritual teacher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''Joseph Frédéric Bérard''' (4 November 1789 – 16 April 1828), [[France|French]] [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], was born at [[Montpellier]].

==Life==
Educated at the medical school in  Montpellier, he afterwards went to [[Paris]], where he was employed in connection with the ''Dictionnaire des sciences medicales''. He returned in 1816, and published a work, ''Doctrine medicale de l'école de Montpellier'' (1819), which is indispensable to a proper understanding of the principles of the [[vitalism|Vitalistic school]], more specifically ''Doctrine medicale de l'école de Montpellier''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1823 he was called to a chair of medicine at Paris, which he held for three years; he was then nominated professor of [[hygiene]] at Montpellier. His health gave way under his labours, and he died in 1828. His most important book is his ''Doctrines des rapports du physique et du moral'' (Paris, 1823).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He held that consciousness or internal perception reveals to us the existence of an immaterial, thinking, feeling and willing subject, the self or soul. Alongside of this there is the vital force, the nutritive Tower, which uses the physical frame as its organ. The [[soul]] and the principle of life are in constant reciprocal action, and the first owes to the second, not the formation of its faculties, but the conditions under which they are evolved. He showed himself unable to understand the points of view of those whom he criticized, and yet his own theories, midway between vitalism and [[animism]], are entirely destitute of originality.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

To the ''Esprit des doctrines medicales de Montpellier'', published posthumously (Paris, 1830), the editor, H. Petiot, prefixed an account of his life and works; see also [[Jean Philibert Damiron|Damiron]], ''Phil. en France an XIX' siècle'' (Paris, 1834); C. J. Tissot, ''Anthropologie générale'' (1843).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics''''' ({{lang-de|Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik}}) is a 1929 book about [[Immanuel Kant]] by the German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]]. It is often referred by Heidegger to simply as the ''Kantbuch'' (''Kantbook''). This book published as volume 3 of the ''[[Heidegger Gesamtausgabe|Gesamtausgabe]]''.

The book is dedicated to the memory of [[Max Scheler]].

==Background==
During the 1920s Heidegger read [[Immanuel Kant]] extensively. The Kantian influence is pervasive throughout Heidegger's most celebrated and influential book, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). The Kantbook can be seen as a supplement for the [[Being_and_Time#Heidegger.27s_original_project|unfinished second part]] of ''Being and Time''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'', trans. by Richard Taft, fifth edition enlarged (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1997), p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, during the winter semester of 1927/28 Heidegger delivered a lecture course dealing explicitly with Kant's philosophy entitled ''Phenomenological Interpretation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason'' (volume 25 of the [[Heidegger Gesamtausgabe|Gesamtausgabe]]). However, the main source for the Kantbook was Heidegger's [[Cassirer–Heidegger debate|encounter]] with [[Ernst Cassirer]] in [[Davos]], in 1929. It is here Heidegger begins to develop his unique interpretation of Kant which places unprecedented emphasis on [[Critique of Pure Reason#The Schematism|the schematism of the categories]]. Heidegger began writing ''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'' immediately after Davos.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1997), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Cassirer, like most Kant scholars, rejected Heidegger's interpretation of Kant. According to Michael J. Inwood, Heidegger implicitly abandoned some of the views he expounded in ''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'' in his subsequent work on Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, Michael J. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=374 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==

===English translations===
*Martin Heidegger, ''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'', trans. by James S. Churchill (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1962).
*Martin Heidegger, ''Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics'', trans. by Richard Taft, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990).

Taft notes Churchill's translation "occasionally falls into awkward and misleading renderings of the original that make it hard to use today." The primary reason for this is that Churchill's translation is one of earliest translations of any of Heidegger's works into English, thus predating most of the now established conventions in Heidegger scholarship in the English speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger (1997), p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kocc Barma Fall''', born '''Birima Maxuréja Demba Xolé Faal ''' (1586-1655) was a Senegalese philosopher. He is considered to be the greatest Senegalese thinker and philosopher and one of the prominent figures of African philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au-senegal.com/kocc-barma-fall-disait,6832.html?lang=fr|title=Kocc Barma Fall disait…|publisher=Au-senegal.com|accessdate=2 May 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Murphy states that "Kocc Barma's words and acts have passed into Senegalese folklore to such an extent that proverbs are often introduced by the phrase 'Kocc Barma said', whether this is true or not".&lt;ref name="Murphy2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=David|title=Sembene: Imagining Alternatives in Film &amp; Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_oIFzaSWyEC&amp;pg=PA63|date=1 January 2000|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=978-0-85255-555-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fertile imagination, his quick wit and his metaphorical sayings are part of the universe of [[Wolof culture]]. During his lifetime he was particularly concerned about the injustice of [[Damels]], whom he viewed as tyrannical.

A '''logical extreme''' is a useful, though often [[Fallacy|fallacious]], [[rhetorical device]] for the disputation of propositions. Quite simply, a [[logic]]al extreme is the relevant statement of an extreme or even preposterous position that is nonetheless consistent with the proposition in question. Thus, in so far as the logically extreme position is both relevant and untenable, it has succeeded in calling the proposition into question, at least in its stated form.

{{quote|The worst effect of Clausewitz's views came through his [[metaphysical]] exposition of the [[idea]] of 'absolute' warfare. By taking the logical extreme as the theoretical [[Ideology|ideal]], he conveyed the impression, to superficial readers, that the road to success was through the unlimited application of force. [...] Moreover, Clausewitz contributed to the subsequent decay of generalship when in an oft-quoted passage he wrote--'Philanthropists may easily imagine that there is a skilful method of disarming and overcoming the enemy without great bloodshed, and that this is the proper tendency of the Art of War....It is an error which must be extirpated.' [...] Unfortunately Clausewitz's corrective arguments would henceforth be cited by countless blunderers to excuse, and even to justify, their futile squandering of life in bull-headed assaults.&lt;ref name="Bury1960"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.P.T. |last=Bury |year=1960 |title=The New Cambridge Modern History |volume=10 |publisher=University Press |isbn=9780521045483 |lccn=89009938 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA319 |page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;|J.P.T.

'''Louis Gabriel Ambroise, [[Vicomte]] de Bonald''' (2 October 1754&amp;nbsp;– 23 November 1840), was a French [[counter-revolutionary]]&lt;ref&gt;Beum, Robert (1997). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/ModernAge-1997q3-00290 "Ultra-Royalism Revisited: An Annotated Bibliography With A Preface,"] ''Modern Age'', Vol. 39, No. 3, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]] and [[politician]]. Mainly, he is remembered for developing a set of [[Social theory|social theories]] that exercised a powerful influence in shaping the [[Ontology|ontological]] framework from which French [[sociology]] would emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert A. (1943). "The French Revolution and the Rise of Sociology in France," ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 49, No. 2, pp. 156–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert A. (1944). "De Bonald and the Concept of the Social Group," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 315–331.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reedy, W. Jay (1979). [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89051906741;view=1up;seq=282 "Conservatism and the Origins of the French Sociological Tradition: A Reconsideration of Louis de Bonald's Science of Society,"] ''Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Meeting for the Western Society for French History,'' Vol. 6, pp. 264–273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reedy, W. Jay (1994). "The Historical Imaginary of Social Science in Post-Revolutionary France: Bonald, Saint-Simon, Comte," ''History of the Human Sciences'', Vol. 7 no. 1, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bonald came from an ancient noble family of Provence.  He was educated at the Oratorian college at Juilly,&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Marin (2005). "Bonald, Louis de (1754–1840)." In: ''Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Thought.'' London &amp; New York: Routledge, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and after serving with the Artillery, he held a post in the local administration of his native province. Elected to the States General of 1789 as a deputy for Aveyron, he strongly opposed the new legislation on the civil status of the clergy and emigrated in 1791. There he joined the army of the [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Prince of Condé]], soon settling in [[Heidelberg]]. There he wrote his first important work, the highly conservative ''Theorie du Pouvoir Politique et Religieux dans la Societe Civile Demontree par le Raisonnement et l'Histoire'' (3 vols., 1796; new ed., Paris, 1854, 2 vols.), which the [[French Directory|Directory]] condemned.{{sfn|''EB''|1911}}

Upon returning to France, he found himself an object of suspicion and at first lived in retirement. In 1806, he, along with [[Chateaubriand]] and [[Joseph Fiévée]], edited the ''[[Mercure de France]]''. Two years later, he was appointed counsellor of the Imperial University, which he had often attacked previously.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson (2005), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Bourbon Restoration]] he was a member of the council of public instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Dorschel, Andreas (2008). "Aufgeklärte Gegenaufklärung", ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', No. 25, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1815 to 1822, de Bonald served as a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies. His speeches were extremely conservative and he advocated literary [[censorship]]. In 1825, he argued strongly in favor of the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]], including its prescription of the death penalty under certain conditions.{{sfn|''EB''|1911}}

In 1822, de Bonald was made Minister of State, and presided over the censorship commission. In the following year, he was made a peer, a dignity which he had lost by refusing to take the required oath in 1803. In 1816, he was appointed to the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. In 1830, he retired from public life and spent the remainder of his days on his estate at Le Monna.{{sfn|''EB''|1911}}

De Bonald had four sons, two of whom, [[Victor de Bonald|Victor]] and [[Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald|Louis]], led lives of some note.

==Ideas==
Bonald was one of the leading writers of the [[theocratic]] or [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|traditionalist school]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Godechot|Godechot, Jacques]] (1982). ''The Counter-Revolution: Doctrine and Action, 1789–1804.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Christopher Olaf (2006). [http://www.mmisi.org/IR/41_01/blum.pdf "On Being Conservative: Lessons from Louis de Bonald,"] ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 23–31.&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Hughes Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Lamennais]], [[Pierre Simon Ballanche|Ballanche]] and baron [[Ferdinand Eckstein|Ferdinand d'Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Masseau, Didier (2000). ''Les Ennemis des Philosophes''. Editions Albin Michel.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings are mainly on social and political philosophy, and are based ultimately on one great principle, the divine origin of [[language]]. In his own words, "L'homme pense sa parole avant de parler sa pensée" (man thinks his speech before saying his thought); the first language contained the essence of all truth. From this he deduces the existence of [[God]], the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of the [[scripture|Holy Scriptures]], and the [[infallibility]] of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|''EB''|1911}}

While this thought lies at the root of all his speculations, there is a formula of constant application. All relations may be stated as the triad of cause, means and effect, which he sees repeated throughout nature. Thus, in the [[universe]], he finds the first cause as mover, movement as the means, and bodies as the result; in the state, power as the cause, ministers as the means, and subjects as the effects; in the family, the same relation is exemplified by father, mother and children. These three terms bear specific relations to one another; the first is to the second as the second to the third. Thus, in the great triad of the religious world—God, the Mediator, and Man—God is to the God-Man as the God-Man is to Man. On this basis, he constructed a system of political absolutism.{{sfn|''EB''|1911}}

==Anti-Semitism==

Bonald published one of the most violent anti-Semitic texts of the post-French Revolutionary period, ''Sur les juifs''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, the [[Philosophes]] are condemned for fashioning the intellectual tools used to justify Jewish emancipation during the Revolution. Bonald accuses the Jews of not becoming "authentic" French citizens and disrupting traditional society. Michele Battini writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Bonald [...] the Constituent Assembly had committed "the enormous mistake of knowingly putting laws in conflict with religion and customs," but, sooner or later, the government would have to change its mind, as would "the friends of the blacks" who regretted "the haste with which they called for freedom for a people who had always been alien." [...] The Jews, by their "nature," are a nation destined to remain alien to other peoples. This "foreignness" appears—this seems the sense of the reference to the ''noirs'' —to be an objective fact, permanent and "physical," and for this reason analogous to the racial difference with the blacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bonald calls for the reversal of Jewish emancipation and endorses new discriminatory measures:&lt;blockquote&gt;such as the imposition of identifying marks on the clothes of the enemy who had become "invisible" because of emancipation. The identification mark (''la marque distinctive'') would be fully justified by the need to identify those responsible for behavior hostile to the ''bien public''. The return to the past almost sounds like a premonition of Hitler’s decrees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotes==
* "Monarchy considers man in his ties with society; a republic considers man independently of his relations to society."
* "There was geometry in the world before Newton, and philosophy before Descartes, but before language there was absolutely nothing but bodies and their images, because language is the necessary instrument of every intellectual operation — nay, the means of every moral existence."
* "Man thinks his word before he speaks his thought, or, in other words, man cannot speak his thought without thinking his word."

'''Marc Crépon ''' (born 30 March 1962) is a French philosopher and academic who writes on the subject of languages and communities in the French and German philosophies and contemporary political and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/recherche/portraits/article/marc-crepon?lang=fr|title=Marc Crépon - École normale supérieure - Paris|work=ens.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also translated works by philosophers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]] and Leibniz.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

He is chair of Philosophy at the [[Ecole Normale Superieure]] and director of research at the Archives Husserl, National Center for Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/whats_onpritzker-military-presentsmarc-crepon-and-michael-naas-trial-hate/|title=Commemorating World War One: The Trial of Hate, A conversation with French Author Marc Crépon and Translator Michael Naas. - Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library - Chicago|work=pritzkermilitary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was born in Decize, Nievre in 1962. After high school, Crépon completed a preparatory course at [[Lycee Condorcet]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="frenchculture.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchculture.org/books/events/trial-hatred-marc-crepon|title=THE TRIAL OF HATRED - MARC CREPON|work=frenchculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[Ecole Normale Superieure]] and passed the [[agrégation]] in 1986, a French civil service exam for positions in public education.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The topic of his dissertation (written in French) was ''The problem of human diversity: survey on the characterization of the people and the constitution of geographies of spirit from Leibniz to Hegel'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/probleme-de-la-diversite-humaine-enquete-sur-la-caracterisation-des-peuples-et-la-constitution-des-geographies-de-lesprit-de-leibniz-a-hegel/oclc/490132426/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br|title=Formats and Editions of Le problème de la diversité humaine : enquête sur la caractérisation des peuples et la constitution des géographies de l'esprit de Leibniz a Hegel [WorldCat.org]|work=worldcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Career ==
Crépon's first academic position was teaching philosophy at [[Nanterre University]]. Shortly after this, he moved to [[Moldova]] for a period and credits living and working in the USSR with developing many of his attitudes and pedagogical methods.&lt;ref name="frenchculture.org"/&gt; At this time, he also developed an interest in the relationship between political and linguistic communities, which he would go on to research in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens.fr/recherche/portraits/article/marc-crepon|title=Marc Crépon - École normale supérieure - Paris|work=ens.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has traveled and lectured at American universities, including [[University of California, Irvine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/calendar/events.php?recid=4298&amp;dept_code_val=all&amp;event_cat=archive&amp;file_name=events_arch|title=The Trial of Hatred" - Marc Crépon|work=uci.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rice University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchculture.org/books/events/marc-crepon-houston|title=Marc Crépon in Houston|work=frenchculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crépon also taught classes while in residence at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago in 2006 and in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffett.northwestern.edu/documents/newsletters/Newsletter2006Fall.pdf |format=PDF |title=CICS Newsletter |date=2006 |publisher=Buffett.northwestern.edu|accessdate=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch''' (16 August 1802 – 30 September 1896) was a German [[mathematician]], [[logician]], [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]]. His brother was the composer [[Karl Ludwig Drobisch]] (1803–1854).

==Life==
Drobisch studied mathematics and philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he subsequently became a professor. He wrote his ''habilitation'' in 1824. From 1826 to 1868 he served as ''ordinarius'' (full professor) in mathematics, and from 1842 on as ''ordinarius'' in philosophy. He was rector of the university of Leipzig in 1840–41 and served as dean of the philosophical faculty several times. Drobisch made contributions to philosophical and [[mathematical logic]], [[set theory]], [[quantitative linguistics]] and [[empirical psychology]]. Drobisch was strongly influenced by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]].

In 1834, Drobisch joined the Count Jablonowski Society of the Sciences in Leipzig. In 1846 he was a co-founder of the Saxony's Royal Society of the Sciences, whose successor organisation has named a medal in his honour. In 1868, Drobisch resigned from the mathematics department to devote himself to philosophy. He was made an honorary citizen of Leipzig in 1876. In his later years, Drobisch suffered from advancing blindness, making scholarly work impossible from the mid-1880s on. [[Wilhelm Wundt]], a pioneer of German empirical psychology, held Drobisch's funeral oration and acknowledged his influence. Drobisch was one of the forerunners of the [[Neo-Kantianism|Neo-Kantian]] revival of the 1860s. [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] criticized him and Herbart in his ''Foundations of Mathematical Psychology'' (1865).

'''Nikolai Vasilievich Bugaev''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Васи́льевич Буга́ев}}; September 14, 1837 – June 11, 1903) was a prominent [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]], the father of [[Andrei Bely]].

==Biography==
Bugaev was born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russian Empire]] into a somewhat unstable family (his father was an army doctor), and at the age of ten young Nikolai was sent to [[Moscow]] to find his own means of obtaining an education.  He succeeded, graduating in 1859 from [[Moscow University]], where he majored in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].  He went on to study [[engineering]], but in 1863 wrote a Master's thesis on the [[Convergent series|convergence]] of [[infinite series]].  This document was sufficiently impressive to win him a place studying under [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Ernst Kummer]] in [[Berlin]].  He also spent some time in [[Paris]] studying under [[Joseph Liouville]].  He earned his doctoral degree in 1866 and returned to [[Moscow]], where he taught for the remainder of his career.  Some of his most influential papers offered proofs of previously unproven assertions of Liouville, but his most original work centered around the development of formal analogies between [[arithmetic]] and [[Analytic number theory|analytic]] operations.

Bugaev was the active member of the [[Moscow Mathematical Society]] and the president of it (1891-1903). He also wrote influential philosophical essays in which he trumpeted the virtues of [[mathematical analysis]] and decried the influence of [[geometry]] and [[probability]].  Many feel he is largely responsible for the pronounced predilection towards "hard analysis" which is characteristic of so much of the best Russian mathematics.  Through Bugaev's star student, [[Dmitri Egorov]], many famous Russian mathematicians, such as [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Nikolai Luzin]], directly "descend" from Bugaev—and thus from the Prince of Mathematicians, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].

Nikolai Bugaev was also a talented [[chess]] player; some of his games are available at [http://www.algonet.se/~marek/orangutan-people.htm orangutan-people site].

Bugaev was a memorable "character" whose life was touched by scandal.  He was not, it is said, much admired for his looks, but his wife was brilliant, beautiful, and rich, and the Bugaevs were socially prominent.  Their mathematically, musically, and artistically talented son, ''Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev'' (14 October 1880 O.S.-8 January 1934), went on to adopt the pseudonym [[Andrei Bely]], under which name he helped found the [[Russian Symbolist movement|Symbolist movement]]. Professor Korobkin, the main character of Bely's innovative novel ''Moscow'', was inspired by Nikolay Bugayev. In view of his father's prejudices, Boris Bugaev was fascinated by probability and particularly by the notion of [[entropy]], which is mentioned in several of his novels and poems.

[[File:PeterAFrench.png|thumb|Peter A French]]
'''Peter A. French''' (born March 19, 1942) is an American philosopher and writer.  He is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at [[Arizona State University]] where he taught from 2000 until 2016.  He previously was a professor at [[Northern Arizona University]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]], and the [[University of South Florida]].

==Early life==
French was born in 1942 in [[Newburgh, New York]]. His father was a Lutheran minister, his mother died of cancer when he was five years old.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} He was raised in New York and New England and earned a BA (with majors in philosophy and religious studies) from [[Gettysburg College]] (1963), an MA in philosophy from the [[University of Southern California]] (1964) and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of Miami]] (1971).&lt;ref name="pafcv"&gt;"Peter A. French Curriculum Vitae" https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/286173/cv&lt;/ref&gt; He did post-doctoral work at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="pafcv" /&gt;

==Career==
French has been a professor of philosophy at Northern Arizona University, the University of Minnesota, and a visiting professor at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia. He has held the Exxon Distinguished Research Professorship in the Center for the Study of Values at the University of Delaware, the Lennox Distinguished Professorship and Chair of Philosophy at Trinity University, and the Cole Chair in Ethics, Director of the Ethics Center, and Chair of the Department of Philosophy at the University of South Florida. He is now Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Arizona State University where he served as the Lincoln Professor of Ethics and Professor of Philosophy, and was the founding Director of the Lincoln Center for Applied Ethics from 2000 to 2013.&lt;ref name="pafcv" /&gt;

French is the author of twenty-one books on a wide range of topics in ethics, metaethics and applied ethics. A number of his papers are translated into Chinese, Japanese, German, Italian, French, Serbian, and Spanish. He was the editor of the ''Journal of Social Philosophy'' for 16 years (1988-2005) and general editor of the seven volume ''Issues in Contemporary Ethics'' series in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="pafcv" /&gt; According to Zachary Goldberg, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, French’s contributions to a wide spectrum of philosophical discussions made him an influential figure in the areas of moral responsibility and the agency of individuals and collectives.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Goldberg editor, ''Reflections on Ethics and Responsibility: Essays in Honor of Peter A. French'', Springer, 2017, xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

French is best known for his work on collective and [[corporate responsibility]], especially his theory that corporations should be treated as members of the moral community and held morally responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;“The Corporation as a Moral Person” in ''American Philosophical Quarterly'', July 1979. Reprinted in ''Ethical Issues in Business'', ed. by Donaldson and Werhane, Prentice-Hall, 1983 and subsequent editions; ''Collective Responsibility'', ed. by May and Hoffman, Rowman and Littlefield, 1992; and in numerous anthologies and in many languages.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Professor Jeffrey Moriarty in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' French is “a seminal thinker on corporate moral agency.”  He is responsible for developing the argument that firms have internal decision-making structures through which they act intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Moriarty, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', “Business Ethics,” First published Thu Nov 17, 2016, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-business/#CorpMoraAgen&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Corporation as a Moral Person" French coined the term Corporate Internal Decision Structures (CID Structures) and defined a CID Structure as an organization of personnel for the exercise of a corporation’s power with respect to its ventures and interests.  According to French a CID Structure produces decision-making, ratification, and action processes thereby forming a corporation into a functioning intentional morally responsible entity. He identified two sorts of rules crucial to CID Structures: organizational rules and policy/procedure rules. Organizational rules define levels of authority.  Policies and procedures are recognition rules for identifying a decision or an act as having been made or performed for corporate reasons.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of French’s position on corporate moral responsibility over various iterations and that of his critics see, “Reflections on Corporate Moral Responsibility and the Problem Solving Technique of Alexander the Great” by John Hasnas, ''Journal of Business Ethics'', May 2012, Volume 107, Issue 2, 183–195.&lt;/ref&gt; French expanded, defended, and modified this theory in publications in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;''Collective and Corporate Responsibility'', Columbia University Press, 1984; ''Corporate Ethics'', Harcourt, Brace, 1995; ''Responsibility Matters'', University Press of Kansas, 1992; and a number of articles in philosophy and law journals.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Michael Kerlin in the ''Journal of Business Ethics'' French’s work on [[corporate ethics]] is “of intellectual sophistication with real world applications.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Kerlin, “Peter French, Corporate Ethics and The Wizard of Oz,” ''Journal of Business Ethics'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'',  some philosophers and legal theorists wrote to French claiming his work had laid the groundwork for the treatment of corporations as persons and asked if he was willing to change his position on corporations and write an opinion piece for the ''New York Times''.  French declined and responded in a paper published in the festschrift honoring him that the Court’s majority opinion does not represent his position on corporate moral personhood.  French noted that Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote in his concurring opinion that corporate speech is “the speech of many individual Americans who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the corporation the right to speak on their behalf.”&lt;ref&gt;''Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission'', 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 1, Scalia, J., concurring, No. 08–205.&lt;/ref&gt;  French argued that corporations do not speak for their employees, stockholders, or others affiliated with them.  There is no necessary connection between what corporate speech expresses and the beliefs, desires, interests, plans, and goals of such individuals.  Corporations speak qua corporate entities and the political speech of individuals is already protected.&lt;ref&gt;"Coda" of "Moral Belief/Behavior Discordance and Prizing" in Zachary Goldberg editor, ''Reflections on Ethics and Responsibility: Essays in Honor of Peter A. French'', Springer, 2017, 240-242&lt;/ref&gt;

French distinguished two distinct types of collectivities in his discussions of collective responsibility: aggregates and conglomerates.  According to Marian Smiley, French defines an aggregate collectivity as merely a group of people to whom collective responsibility cannot be ascribed.  A conglomerate collectivity for French is an organization of individuals whose identity is not exhausted by the conjunction of the identities of the persons in the organization.  Conglomerate collectivities can be held collectively responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', “Collective Responsibility,” First published August 8, 2005; substantive revision June 14, 2010 by Marion Smiley, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/&lt;/ref&gt; On French's account, responsibility may be distributable or non-distributable over the membership of a collectivity depending on the type.

French also coined the term “the responsibility barter game” to describe the common way people negotiate with each other to try to lessen or avoid personal responsibility for bad outcomes.  According to Jane E. Jadlos writing in ''The Journal of Religion'' for French “responsibility is not a truth of some sort about the world, but a set of practices used to describe and understand individual and social behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Jane E. Jadlos,"Responsibility Matters," ''The Journal of Religion'' July 1994, Volume 74, Issue 3.  See also Michael McKenna, “Theories of Moral Responsibility and the Responsibility Barter Game” in Zachary Goldberg editor, ''Reflections on Ethics and Responsibility: Essays in Honor of Peter A. French'', Springer, 2017, 71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; French has also written on moral assessment, evil, loss of innocence, blame, shame, vengeance, moral originality, and moral belief/behavior discordance.&lt;ref&gt;See “Works by and about Peter A. French” at https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=Peter+A.+French&amp;acc=off&amp;wc=on&amp;fc=off&amp;group=none”.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a founding and senior editor of ''Midwest Studies in Philosophy'', an annual book series since 1976 in analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Published by University of Minnesota Press (Volumes I - IX), University of Notre Dame Press (Volumes X - XXII), Blackwell Publishers (now Wiley/Blackwell) (Volumes XXIII - present).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first chapter of French’s ''War and Moral Dissonance'' is a memoir of his experiences teaching ethics to Navy and Marine chaplains during [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;''War and Moral Dissonance'', Cambridge University Press, 2011,  Chapter 1, “The Two-Collar Conflict."&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonel James L. Cook of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in a review of that book says that French discusses ad bellum and in bello ethical lapses in the war, but delves into the metaphysical issues others ignore and examines the war's aftermath. French's treatment is philosophically rigorous, but also poetically touching…[it] combines philosophical acumen with profound empathy even for a single victim of war.”&lt;ref&gt;James L. Cook, “Review of War and Moral Dissonance,” ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Gettysburg College awarded French a Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree for his work in philosophy and ethics. The citation read at the college’s 171st Commencement by then Gettysburg College President Katherine Will included the following: “Your book exploring the [[My Lai Massacre]] attracted national attention for its exploration of the question of whether army units or individual members of those units are responsible for military atrocities and is widely credited as a founding work of the field of applied ethics.”&lt;ref&gt;“Citation read on conferring the Doctor of Humane Letters degree on Peter A. French,” Gettysburg College Commencement, Beachem Portico, Pennsylvania Hall, May 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008 the American Philosophical Association dedicated an issue of its ''Newsletter on Philosophy and Law'' to French because of his “influence in applied ethics and having helped establish the field of applied ethics as a substantive area of research in the philosophy discipline.”&lt;ref&gt;''American Philosophical Association Newsletter on Philosophy and Law'', Volume 7, Number 2, “Tribute to Peter French,” edited by Steven Scalet and Christopher Griffin, Spring 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the American Philosophical Association dedicated a Symposium Session on the Work of Peter French at its Central Division Meetings in Chicago.

'''Piotr Lenartowicz''' (25 August 1934 &amp;ndash; 10 October 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatianum.edu.pl/ogloszenie_180.html|title=Zmarł ś.p. ks. prof. dr hab.

== Life ==
Lenartowicz was born in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Wiesław Lenartowicz and Krystyna Schneider. He completed his medical studies at School of Medicine in Warsaw in 1958. In 1961 he obtained a doctorate in neurophysiology at the School of Medicine in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophia Rationis Magistra Vitae. Tom 1. Chapter. Ks. Piotr Lenartowicz, SJ'', pp 53-76. Józef Bremer and Robert Janusz eds, Ignatianum, WAM 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Studied philosophy (Lic. in philosophy (Jesuit Faculty of Philosophy, Cracow, 1965) and theology Lic. in theology (Jesuit Faculty of Theology, Warsaw, 1970).  He studied philosophy in Rome, at the Philosophical Faculty of [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and received a doctorate in  developmental biology in 1975. He received another degree (doctor habilitowany) at the Philosophical Faculty of Pontifical Academy of Theology, Cracow, working on theory of biological phenomena, in 1986. In 1999 he became a full professor. Lenartowicz participated in seminars in [[Castel Gandolfo]] invited by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He was a member of the [[Jesuit University of Philosophy and Education Ignatianum]] and at one time was vice president of that institution.

== Work==
His main interests revolve around philosophy of biology including integration of biological phenomena, theory of the genetic program, aristotelian theory of biological substance, cognitive aspects of biological dynamisms, problems of biological observation, experimentation and concept formation, and reconstruction of fossil hominids.

Lenartowicz  wrote about the principles of [[irreducible complexity]] before the hypothesis gained ground after the publication of [[Michael Behe|Michael Behe's]] [[Darwin's Black Box]]. In his dissertation Phenotype-Genotype Dichotomy published in 1975, he described irreducibility of certain biological phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Lenartowicz, P., Fundamental patterns of biochemical integration.

{{Rights |By claimant}}

'''Plant rights''' are [[rights]] to which [[plant]]s may be entitled. Such issues are often raised in connection with discussions about [[human rights]], [[animal rights]], [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], or [[sentiocentrism]].

==Philosophy==
[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' contains a chapter, "The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-ButErew-ButErew-c27.html|chapter=The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables|title=Erewhon|author=Butler, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether animal rights can be extended to plants, animal rights philosopher [[Tom Regan]] argues that animals acquire rights due to being aware, what he calls "subjects-of-a-life". He argues that this does not apply to plants, and that even if plants did have rights, abstaining from eating meat would still be moral due to the use of plants to rear animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Regan|first=Tom|title=Animal rights, human wrongs: an introduction to moral philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmBksH1k2RMC&amp;pg=PA101|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-3354-9|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to philosopher [[Michael Marder]], the idea that plants should have rights derives from "plant subjectivity", which is distinct from human personhood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/2013120141156284755.html&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]] holds that all life has [[inherent worth]] and argues for respect for plants, but does not assign them rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vesilind|first1=P. Aarne|last2=Gunn|first2=Alastair S.|title=Engineering, ethics, and the environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFaNf3XdJjIC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58918-5|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher D. Stone, the son of [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[I.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Stone]], proposed in a 1972 paper titled "Should Trees Have Standing?" that if corporations are assigned rights, so should natural objects such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|title=Should Trees Have Standing? Law, Morality, and the Environment|edition=Third|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-973607-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Christopher D.|year=1972|title=Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects|journal=Southern California Law Review|volume=45|pages=450–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- If you feel that this paragraph should be deleted, please explain why on the article talk page. --&gt;Whilst not appealing directly to "rights", Matthew Hall has argued that plants should be included within the realm of human moral consideration. His "Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany" discusses the moral background of plants in western philosophy and contrasts this with other traditions, including indigenous cultures, which recognise plants as persons—active, intelligent beings that are appropriate recipients of respect and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Matthew|title=Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany|year=2011|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=1-4384-3428-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall backs up his call for the ethical consideration of plants with arguments based on [[plant neurobiology]], which says that plants are autonomous, perceptive organisms capable of complex, adaptive behaviours, including the recognition of self/non-self.

==Scientific arguments==
In the study of [[plant physiology]], plants are understood to have mechanisms by which they recognize environmental changes. This definition of [[Plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]] differs from the notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions, an idea also called [[plant perception (paranormal)|plant perception]]. The latter concept, along with [[plant intelligence]], can be traced to 1848, when [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], a German [[experimental psychologist]], suggested that plants are capable of [[emotion]]s, and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heidelberger ''Nature from within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysical worldview'' 2004, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology analyzed scientific data on plants, and concluded in 2009 that plants are entitled to a certain amount of "dignity", but "dignity of plants is not an absolute value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The dignity of plants|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|first=Florianne|last=Koechlin|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315|pmid=19568336|pmc=2634081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-issue Party for Plants entered candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINTRE62S2HA20100329|title=Plant rights party to contest next Dutch election|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=August 7, 2010|publisher=Reuters|first=Ben|last=Berkowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on topics such as climate, biodiversity and sustainability in general. Such concerns have been criticized as evidence that modern culture is "causing us to lose the ability to think critically and distinguish serious from frivolous ethical concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Silent Scream of the Asparagus|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/065njdoe.asp|author=Smith, Wesley J.|date=May 12, 2008|volume=13|issue=33|publisher=Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal arguments==
[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Justice [[William O. Douglas]], author of a noted dissent about the legal standing of plants]]
In his dissent to the 1972 ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote about whether plants might have [[standing (law)|legal standing]]:
{{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a fiction found useful for maritime purposes... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life...The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled.}}

The [[Swiss Constitution]] contains a provision requiring "account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals, plants and other organisms", and the [[Swiss government]] has conducted ethical studies pertaining to how the dignity of plants is to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The dignity of plants|pmc=2634081|author=Florianne Koechlin|publisher=Plant Signal Behav.|date=January 2009|volume=4|issue=1|pages=78–79|pmid=19568336|doi=10.4161/psb.4.1.7315}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, a river in New Zealand, including the plants and other organisms contained within its boundaries, was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Vines T, Bruce A Faunce TA.

Journal of Law and Medicine 2013; 20: 528 available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2235935 (accessed 28 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular arguments==
When challenged by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] to become [[vegetarian]], [[Timothy McVeigh]] argued that "plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|title=McVeigh to PeTA: "Where Do You Draw the Line?"|publisher=Fur Commission|date=May 7, 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922060922/http://furcommission.com/news/newsF02x.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/71380695.html?dids=71380695:71380695&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+17%2C+2001&amp;author=Lloyd+Grove+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=The+Reliable+Source&amp;pqatl=google|title=The Reliable Source|publisher=Washington Post|first=Lloyd|last=Grove|authorlink=Lloyd Grove|page=C3|date=April 17, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Animal Liberation Front]] argues that there is no evidence that plants can experience pain, and that to the extent they respond to stimuli, it is like a device such as a [[thermostat]] responding to sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Morality/Biology/InsectAR.htm#faq42|chapter=Isn't it hypocritical to kill and eat plants?|title=FAQs Insects, Plants|publisher=Animal Liberation Front}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''preference''' is a technical term in psychology, economics and philosophy usually used in relation to choosing between alternatives; someone has a preference for A over B if they would choose A rather than B.

Preference can also be used in insolvency terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual’s attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit decision-making process (Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, &amp; Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &amp; Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

{{main article|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.

==Marketing==
Brand preference is strongly linked to brand choice that can influence the consumer decision making and activate brand purchase. "Brand preferences can be defined as the subjective, conscious and behavioral tendencies which influence consumer's predisposition toward a brand." Understanding the brand preferences of consumers will dictate the most suitable and successful Marketing Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Prasanna Mohan Raj and Ananth, "Brand Preferences Of Newspapers- Factor Analysis Approach", Research Journal of Economics and Business Studies", Vol.5, No: 11, September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

"Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Biology|biological]] explanations for one's preference. [[Sexual orientation]], for example, is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.

==Insolvency==
In Insolvency, the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. 
If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk. &lt;ref name=Steven&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''progenitor cell''' is a [[cell (biology)|biological cell]] that, like a [[stem cell]], has a tendency to differentiate into a specific type of cell, but is already more specific than a stem cell and is pushed to differentiate into its "target" cell. The most important difference between stem cells and progenitor cells is that stem cells can replicate indefinitely, whereas progenitor cells can divide only a limited number of times.  Controversy about the exact definition remains and the concept is still evolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Seaberg | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Van Der Kooy | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00031-6 | title = Stem and progenitor cells: The premature desertion of rigorous definitions | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–131 | year = 2003 | pmid =  12591214| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "progenitor cell" and "stem cell" are sometimes equated.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100009804|progenitor cell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Most progenitors are described as [[Oligopotency|oligopotent]]. In this point of view, they may be compared to adult stem cells. But progenitors are said to be in a further stage of [[cell differentiation]]. They are in the “center” between stem cells and fully differentiated cells.  The kind of potency they have depends on the type of their "parent" stem cell and also on their niche. Some progenitor cells were found during research, and were isolated. After their marker was found, it was proven that these progenitor cells could move through the body and migrate towards the tissue where they are needed.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Many properties are shared by adult stem cells and progenitor cells.

Progenitor cells are found in adult organisms and they act as a repair system for the body. They replenish special cells, but also maintain the blood, skin and intestinal tissues. They can also be found in developing embryonic [[pancreatic]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].

==Function==
The majority of progenitor cells lie dormant or possess little activity in the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in which they reside. They exhibit slow [[cell growth|growth]] and their main role is to replace cells lost by normal attrition. In case of tissue injury, damaged or dead cells, progenitor cells can be activated. [[Growth factor]]s or [[cytokine]]s are two substances that trigger the progenitors to mobilize toward the damaged tissue. At the same time, they start to differentiate into the target cells. Not all progenitors are mobile and are situated near the tissue of their target differentiation. When the cytokines, growth factors and other cell division enhancing stimulators take on the progenitors, a higher rate of cell division is introduced. It leads to the recovery of the tissue.

==Examples==
The characterization or the defining principle of progenitor cells, in order to separate them from others, is  based on the different cell markers rather than their morphological appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=JE|last2=Partridge|first2=TA|title=Muscle satellite cells.|journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology|date=August 2003|volume=35|issue=8|pages=1151–6|pmid=12757751|doi=10.1016/s1357-2725(03)00042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the human cerebral cortices==
Before embryonic day 40 (E40), progenitor cells generate other progenitor cells; after that period, progenitor cells produce only dissimilar mesenchymal stem cell daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">In the [[Neo-Gricean]] approach to [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] championed by [[Yale]] linguist [[Laurence Horn]], the Q-Principle ("Q" for "Quantity") is a reformulation of [[Paul Grice]]'s maxim of Quantity (''see'' [[Gricean maxims]]) combined with the first two sub-maxims of Manner.&lt;ref name=Horn1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn |first1=Laurence |title=A Natural History of Negation |date=1989|publisher=The University of Chicago press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=193-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Q-principle states: "Say as much as you can (given R)."  As such it interacts with the [[R-Principle]], which states: "Say no more than you must (given Q)." &lt;ref name = SEP&gt; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/ "Implicature"] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] .&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = ECS&gt; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470018860.s00233/full "The Gricean Model"] in the Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Q-Principle leads to the implication that if the speaker did not make a stronger statement (or say more), then its denial is (implied to be) true. For instance, the inference from "He entered a house" to "He did not enter his own house" is Q-based inference, i.e. deriving from the Q-Principle. &lt;ref name = SEP /&gt;

{{Sufism}}

==Birth==
{{one source|section|date=November 2016}}
Said to have been born between 714 and 718 CE (95 and 98 [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]]) in [[Basra]],&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; [[Iraq]] of the [[Qays]] tribe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Windows on the House of Islam|last=a-Ra'uf al-Munawi|first='Abu|publisher=University of California|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=132–33|editor-last=Renard|editor-first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of Rābiʻas early life has been recounted by [[Farid ud-Din Attar]], a later Sufi saint and poet. 

She herself left no written works about her life. She was the fourth daughter of her family and therefore named Rābiʻa, meaning "fourth". 
According to [[Fariduddin Attar]], when Rābiʻa was born, her parents were so poor that there was no oil in house to light a lamp, nor even a cloth  to wrap her with. Her mother asked her husband to borrow some oil from a neighbor, but he had resolved in his life never to ask for anything from anyone except God. He pretended to go to the neighbor's door and returned home empty-handed. At night [[Muhammad]] appeared to him in a dream and told him,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Your newly born daughter is a favorite of the Lord, and shall lead many Muslims to the right path. You should approach the Amir of Basra and present him with a letter in which should be written this message: 'You offer Durood to the Holy Prophet one hundred times every night and four hundred times every Thursday night. However, since you failed to observe the rule last Thursday, as a penalty you must pay the bearer four hundred dinars'".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==
However, after the death of her father, [[famine]] overtook Basra. She parted from her sisters. Rabia went into the desert to pray and became an [[ascetic]], living a life of semi-seclusion. She is often cited as being the queen of saintly women,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Spirituality Foundations|last=Khawar Khan Chrishti|first=Saadia|publisher=Crossroads|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=208–10|editor-first=Seyyed|editor-last=Hossein Nasr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known for her complete devotion in the form of "Pure [[unconditional love]] of God." As an exemplar among others devoted to God, she provided a model of mutual love between God and His creation; her example is one in which the loving devotee on earth becomes one with the Beloved.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

She prayed:&lt;blockquote&gt;"O Lord, if I worship You because of Fear of Hell,&lt;br/&gt;then burn me in Hell;

If I worship You because I desire Paradise,&lt;br/&gt;then exclude me from Paradise;

But if I worship You for Yourself alone,&lt;br/&gt;then deny me not your Eternal Beauty.&lt;ref name="Singh2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willis Barnstone; Aliki Barnstone|title=A book of women poets from antiquity to now By|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/book-of-women-poets-from-antiquity-to-now/oclc/1004930317|date=1992|publisher=Schocken Books, Inc|isbn=978-93-82277-87-3|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Rābiʻa died in her 80s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.poetseers.org/spiritual-and-devotional-poets/sufi-poets/rabia|title=Rabia al Basri|publisher=Poetseers.org|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Basra in 185 AH/801 CE, where her tomb was shown{{clarify|date=November 2016}} outside the city.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Often noted as having been the single most famous and influential renunciant women of Islamic history, Rābiʻa was renowned for her extreme virtue and piety. A devoted ascetic, when asked why she performed a thousand ritual prostrations both during the day and at night, she answered:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I desire no reward for it; I do it so that the Messenger of God, may God bless him and give him peace, will delight in it on the day of Resurrection and say to the prophets, 'Take note of what a woman of my community has accomplished'".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She was intense in her self-denial and devotion to God. She never claimed to have obtained unity with Him; instead, she dedicated her life to getting closer to God.&lt;ref name="helms"/&gt; As an explanation of her refusal to lift her head toward the heavens [to God] as an act of modesty, she used to say: "Were the world the possession of a single man, it would not make him rich ... [B]ecause it is passing away."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

She was the one who first set forth the doctrine of [[Divine Love]] known as [[Ishq|''Ishq-e-Haqeeqi'']]&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]], ''Rabi'a The Mystic and Her Fellow-Saints in Islam'', Cambridge Library Collection, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered to be the most important of the early renunciant, one mode of piety that would eventually become labeled as Sufism.&lt;ref name="Hanif"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanif|first=N.|title=Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2002|pages=108–10|ISBN=9788176252669|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7JInpQL0x8C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry and myths==
Much of the [[poetry]] that is attributed to her is of unknown origin.  After a life of hardship, she spontaneously achieved a state of [[self-realization]]. She was able to perform divine miracles because of her intimacy with God through this introspection. When asked by [[Shaikh]] [[Hasan al-Basri]] how she discovered the secret, she responded by stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"You know of the how, but I know of the how-less."&lt;ref&gt;Farid al-Din Attar, ''Rabe'a [sic] al-Adawiya'', from ''Muslim Saints and Mystics'', trans. A.J. Arberry, London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the many [[myths]] that surround her life is that she was freed from slavery because her master saw her praying while surrounded by light, realized that she was a saint and feared for his life if he continued to keep her as a slave.&lt;ref name="helms"&gt;Barbara Lois Helms, ''Rabi'a as Mystic, Muslim and Woman''&lt;!-- publishing info, location, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist theory based on the life of Rabi'a al-Adawiyya==
{{Main|Islamic feminism}}
Several aspects of the Sufi religion suggest that Sufi ideologies and practices have stood as counters to dominant society and its perception of women and the relationships between men and women. The stories detailing the life and practices of Rabi'a al-Adawiyya show a countercultural understanding of the role of gender in society. Her role as a spiritual and intellectual superiority is depicted in several narratives. In a Sufi narrative, Sufi leader Hasan al-Basri explained, "I passed one whole night and day with Rabi'a ... it never passed through my mind that I was a man nor did it occur to her that she was a woman...when I looked at her I saw myself as bankrupt [i.e. as spiritually worth nothing] and Rabi'a as truly sincere [rich in spiritual virtue]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Gender in Islam|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|publisher=Yale University|year=1992|location=|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she made a decision to stay celibate in order to leave her womanhood behind and devote herself completely to God.&lt;ref name="helms"/&gt;

==Anecdotes==
One day, she was seen running through the streets of [[Basra]] carrying a pot of fire in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. When asked what she was doing, she said,"I want to put out the fires of Hell, and burn down the rewards of Paradise.  They block the way to Allah. I do not want to worship from fear of punishment or for the promise of reward, but simply for the love of Allah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attar|first1=Farid al-Din|title=Memorial of the Friends of God|date=c. 1230|edition=2009 Translation by Losensky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The life of Rabia has been the subject of several motion pictures by [[Turkish cinema]]. One of these films, ''Rabia'', released in 1973, was directed by [[Osman F. Seden]], and [[Fatma Girik]] played the leading role of Rabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007447|title=Rabia (1973)|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rabia, İlk Kadın Evliya'' (Rabia, The First Woman Saint), another Turkish film on Rabia, also of 1973 was directed by [[Süreyya Duru]] and starred by [[Hülya Koçyiğit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinematurk.com/film/5512-rabia-ilk-kadin-evliya|title=Rabia/İlk Kadın Evliya|website=Sinematurk.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Jewish concept of a [[mitzvah]] is used colloquially to mean a good deed or an act of kindness. Judaism teaches that "the world is built on kindness". Kabbalistic teaching sees kindness as emerging from the first of seven Divine emotional attributes; to be effective kindness must be balanced and considered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inner.org/education/educ33.htm|title=A Kabbalistic Approach to Spiritual Growth: Part 33 – Lovingkindness and Judgment – GalEinai – Revealing the Torah's Inner Dimension|website=www.inner.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; while mercy is also for the undeserving. The [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]], [[Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] told reporters that to bring the [[Moshiach]] sooner, people should "add in acts of goodness and kindness".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/player_cdo/aid/490071/jewish/Acts-of-Goodness-and-Kindness.htm and more generally, http://www.chabad.org/search/keyword_cdo/kid/10740/jewish/Chessed-Acts-of-Kindness.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolph Lingens''' is a fictional character often used by contemporary analytic philosophers as a [[placeholder name]] in a  hypothetical scenario which illustrates some feature of the [[indexicality]] of natural language. He was created by the logician [[Gottlob Frege]] in the course of one of the earliest systematic discussions of [[indexicals]]. A number of philosophers picking up on Frege's discussion of indexicals, notably [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], and [[Robert Stalnaker]], have adopted Lingens to make their own points about indexicals.

== ''De se'' attitudes ==
Lingens first appeared in Frege's influential essay 'Thought' ('Der Gedanke', published in ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus I'' (1918–19), pp. 58–77).  Mr. Lingens appears in the company of Leo Peter.  Both are concerned with Dr. Gustav Lauben's having been wounded, and are later joined by Herbert Garner who is possessed of the knowledge that Gustav Lauben was born on 13 September 1875.  Frege's discussion is concerned with how proper names and indexicals like 'I' function and how they are connected with the sense (or mode of presentation) that, on his account, each speaker who uses them associates with them.

Rudolph Lingens makes a number of appearances in the subsequent literature on Frege and on indexicals. Notably he occurs in an influential 1977 paper by John Perry ('Frege on Demonstratives'), in which Perry asks us to imagine Lingens as an [[amnesiac]] in Main Library at [[Stanford]] who comes to read a complete biography of himself. By reading the biography, Lingens comes to have a rich body of factual information about Rudolph Lingens, but he still fails to realize that (as we would put it) ''he himself'' is Lingens. Here we resort to natural language indexicals—''he himself''—to try to express what knowledge it is Lingens lacks; and our resort to such indexicals for expressing this knowledge seems to be ineliminable. Much of the philosophical literature on indexicality is concerned with trying to explicate the apparently "essentially indexical" character of the information Lingens lacks in Perry's imagined scenario.

[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] that essentially require indexical reference to oneself to express—such as the belief Lingens would express by saying '''I'' am Rudolph Lingens'—are often called ''de se'' attitudes.

Lingens reappears in [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]]'s 1979 paper on the topic ('Attitudes ''de dicto'' and ''de se''') and also in a 1981 paper by [[Robert Stalnaker]] ('Indexical Belief'). Both philosophers are picking up on Perry's discussion. {{cn|date=November 2013}}

In this paper, Stalnaker suggests that Lingens is the cousin of [[Bernard J. Ortcutt]], a character originally created by [[W. V. O. Quine]] to illustrate the distinction between ''[[de dicto]]'' and ''[[de re]]'' [[attitude ascriptions]].

'''Sacred Space''' is a [[prayer]] website which has achieved considerable fame since its foundation in 1999. It was created by two members of the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] order, Alan McGuckian and Peter Scally, and was managed by the Jesuit Communication Centre, [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], until June 2008.  The site is updated daily, guiding users through a ten-minute session of [[prayer]] centered on a passage of [[scripture]].

==History==
The notion of a website about prayer came to the two Jesuits when they were working in communications. McGuckian and Scally noticed that increasing numbers of office workers sit at a computer for hours every day, often doing repetitive work. They reasoned that people work better if they break that routine every now and again; and prayer is one way of breaking the routine.&lt;ref name=messenger&gt;[http://www.catholicireland.net/sacred-space/ "Sacred Space", ''The Messenger'', Irish Jesuits, December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; People as far away as the Arctic Circle and Australia log onto the site.

Speaking in ''The Tablet'', Jan 18, 2003, Scally stated, "A person at the computer has a sense of privacy and intimacy; comfortable, upright, and attentive, subconsciously screening out all distractions, he concentrates on the screen -gazes in fact on that screen. What better description of the attitude of attentive listening to God?"&lt;ref name=Botelho&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oBCBgO0chcMC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=%22Sacred+Space+(website)%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xZcRUredB5O88wTV3IHIBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sacred%20Space%20(website)%22&amp;f=false Botelho, Jude. "Church on the Internet", ''Communication as Mission'', National Consultation at Ishvani Kendra, Pune, ed. by L. Stanislaus, Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Delhi, 2007] {{ISBN|978-81-8458-006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of the Internet for prayer is perhaps understandable, not only because it provides the user with the privacy needed for personal prayer, but also because the multi media approach to prayer, now offered by many websites makes prayer more stimulating than a mental exercise.&lt;ref name=Botelho/&gt;

== Developments ==
''Sacred Space'' attracts over five million visits annually. Most of this traffic has been engendered by word of mouth. The website has been produced in almost thirty [[language]]s over the site's lifetime. This level of interest led an Australian publishing house, Michelle Anderson Publishing, to approach the Jesuit Communication Centre about bringing out a hard-copy version of the daily prayers. Ave Maria Press, Veritas  and Jesuit Communications in Manila, also bring out annual volumes of ''Sacred Space - The Prayer Book'' of which a Kindle edition is also available from Amazon. Advent and Lent editions have proven popular and have helped thousands of people to bring the simple yet helpful structure to their prayer.

According to Piaras Jackson, an Irish Jesuit priest who has been involved with the site for a number of years, only five percent of users are from Ireland. Of the English language section, most visitors are from the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Piaras attributes the popularity of ''Sacred Space'' to the facts that it is immediately available 24/7, current with daily scripture readings; and allows anonymity, requiring no log-in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjweb.info/jesuitvoices/episodeShow.cfm?PodcastID=12 "Jesuit Voices", Jesuit Curia in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt; Last year alone its pages were viewed almost 30 million times from over 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.com/2013/08/big-sales-expected-for-latest-edition.html "Big sales expected for latest edition of Sacred Space", ''Clerical Whispers'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergio Cotta''' (6 October 1920 – 3 May 2007) was an Italian [[philosopher]] and university professor. He was considered a specialist on the political thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="FeaverRosen1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Feaver|author2=Frederick Rosen|title=Lives, Liberties and the Public Good: Essays on Political Philosophers and Their Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfevCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8|accessdate=18 August 2017|date=18 June 1987|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-08006-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Cotta, along with André Masson and [[Robert Shackleton]], was considered the most important interpreter of [[Montesquieu]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Felice|first1=Domenico|last2=Casadei|first2=Thomas|title=LA ILUSTRACIÓN Y SUS HERENCIAS - Por una filosofía del límite: Sergio Cotta, intérprete de Montesquieu|publisher=University of Seville|pages=24|url=https://www.alojoptico.us.es/Araucaria/nro21/ideas21_1.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2017|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotta was educated in Florence, attending the La Querce Barnabiti Institute and the [[University of Florence]]. During the Second World War he was a resistance fighter against German occupation. He was the commander of a partisans Brigade of the VII Divisione Autonoma Monferrato and was decorated with the Italian bronze medal.&lt;ref name="AntiseriTagliagambe2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antiseri|first1=Dario |last2= Tagliagambe|first2=Silvano|title=History of Philosophy -: Italian Philosophers of the Twentieth Century Italian: Storia della filosofia -: Filosofi italiani del Novecento|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWagDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT468|accessdate=2 September 2017|date=15 December 2014|publisher=Giunti|isbn=978-88-587-6240-0|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic career took him to a variety of institutions, but he was primarily based at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] from 1966 to 1990.

==Biography==
Sergio Cotta was born to Alberto Cotta, who was a scholar of [[Forestry|forestry sciences]], and Mary Nicolis di Robilant, of the aristocratic Robilant family. A direct descendant of the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]], he studied in [[Florence]] at the La Querce Barnabiti Institute and then enrolled at the Faculty of Political Science at the [[University of Florence]] where he graduated in 1945.

On the 8th September 1943, in [[Friuli]], he was called to arms with the rank of [[Lieutenant]], after the signing of the Italian [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]]. With the German [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|army]] losing, he sailed along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] to reach unoccupied Italy. After catching [[malaria]], and several other trials, he reached [[Piedmont]], where he was posted to the partisan brigade, the 7th Autonomous Division "Monferrato", as its commander. He was among the first to enter [[Turin]] on the days of liberation. For his participation in the [[Italian resistance movement]], on the 24th September 1951, he was awarded the [[Bronze Medal of Military Valor]] and the 31st March 1952, the [[War Cross for Military Valor|War Cross]].

In 1945 he married Brozolo Elisabetta Radicati of Brozolo. The couple went on to have three children: Irene, Maurizio, and Gabriella.

===Academic career===
He started his career at the [[University of Turin]] as assistant to [[Norberto Bobbio]]. He was promoted to ordinary professor, going on to teach at the [[University of Perugia]], [[University of Trieste]], [[University of Trento]], [[University of Florence]] and finally in Rome. He was one of the promoters of the Faculty of Law of the [[D'Annunzio University]] in [[Teramo]], where he taught [[philosophy of law]]. He held a position at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] of Rome from 1966 to 1990, becoming the Chair of philosophy of law and, for some years, was also the director of the homonymous Institute [[Giorgio Del Vecchio]]. Retiring in 1995, he became a professor [[emeritus]].

He was a corresponding member of the [[Turin Academy of Sciences]] (from 1965) and the 1995 national member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Institut de France]] and the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]], and a member of the [[Buenos Aires Academy of Sciences]]. He was twice president of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] [[International Center of Applied Political Philosophy]] ({{lang-fr|Institut international de philosophie politique}}).

He held the position of President of the Union of Italian Catholic Jurists and of the [[International Union of Catholic Jurists]]. It was among the members of the Promoter Committee of the 1974 Referendum of the Divorce Act.

His pupils included [[Francesco D'Agostino]], [[Bruno Montanari]], [[Gaetano Carcaterra]], [[Bruno Romano]], [[Domenico Fisichella]] and the singer [[Antonello Vaidyanathan]].

==Research==
After studying the [[Age of Enlightenment#Politics|political thought of the Enlightenment]], Cotta's interests focused on the philosophy of law, which he was able to blend with elements of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition. From the 1950s he published many articles and monographs on the  political vision of [[Montesquieu]], [[Gaetano Filangieri]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], devoting himself to theoretical reflections on law and politics. He was the director of the ''International Magazine of Philosophy of Law''.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} His works have been translated into [[French language|French]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D’Agostino|first1=Francesco|title=I remember Sergio Cotta [Ricordo di Sergio Cotta]|url=https://www.loccidentale.it/articoli/2431/ricordo-di-sergio-cotta|website=L'Occidentale|publisher=Western|accessdate=22 August 2017|date=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3999">'''Shadrach Woods''' (June 30, 1923 &amp;ndash; July 31, 1973) was an [[United States|American]] architect, urban planner and theorist.

==Biography==
Schooled in engineering at [[New York University]] and in literature and philosophy at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Woods joined the Paris office of [[Le Corbusier]] in 1948.  Assigned to the project for the ''[[Unité d'Habitation]]'', then under construction in [[Marseille]], France, Woods met the Azerbaijan-born Greek architect [[George Candilis]], with whom he would later form a lasting partnership.

With Candilis and the engineer [[Vladimir Bodiansky]], Woods designed and built housing throughout North Africa during his tenure as head of the [[Casablanca]] office of ATBAT-Afrique (''Atelier des Bâtisseurs'').  Ideas developed during the course of this work led to a winning proposal for ''Opération Million'', a public housing competition in France, in 1954.  Commissioned by the [[welfare state]] to design thousands of suburban housing units, Woods and Candilis joined with the Yugoslavian architect [[Alexis Josic]] to create in 1956 the firm [[Candilis-Josic-Woods]].

Among the firm's major built projects were the extension of the village of [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]] and the development of the quarter of Le Mirail in [[Toulouse]] in France and, with Manfred Schieldhelm, the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] in [[Berlin]].  Simultaneously, Candilis and Woods participated in the proceedings of [[Team X]], a group of architects that emerged from the meetings of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] in the postwar years.  Woods is perhaps best known as a thinker and writer.  He published numerous essays on urban themes, including explanations of his concepts of "stem" and "web", and participated in the 1968 Milan Triennale at the invitation of the Italian architect and fellow [[Team X]] member [[Giancarlo de Carlo]].

After the breakup of the firm in 1969, Woods returned to [[New York City]].  He taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] universities and lectured widely.  Until his untimely death in 1973, he continued to work as an architect and urban planner on such projects as the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] and the renovation of the [[SoHo]] neighborhood.  His book ''The Man in the Street: A Polemic on Urbanism'' was published posthumously by [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] in 1975. Woods' [[architectural drawing]]s and papers are now held by the Drawings and Archives Department of [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] at [[Columbia University]].

'''Student Pugwash USA''' engages students to promote the socially responsible use of [[science]] and [[technology]] in the 21st century.  The organization uses a chapter-based model on U.S. college campuses, in addition to other student-focused events run by the national Board of Directors. The student members discuss the ethical, social and global implications of advances in these fields and explore the pursuit of socially responsible careers involving science and technology.  SPUSA is the U.S. affiliate of [[International Student/Young Pugwash]] and the US student affiliate of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], recipients of the 1995 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

As an educational nonprofit organization, SPUSA does not adopt [[advocacy]] positions on policy or political issues or candidates.  The organization posits that, in order to create effective social change, students must first understand the issues at stake, then contemplate their ethical and moral responsibility to themselves and to society as a whole. Its stated purpose is not to advance a particular [[ethics|ethical]] viewpoint regarding scientific and technological issues, but rather to encourage students to consider ethics when thinking about the role of science and technology in society.

==History==
SPUSA was founded in 1979 by [[UC San Diego]] student Jeffrey Leifer, with the fundamental belief that young people play a vital role in determining the socially responsible application of science and technology. In 1955 [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other eminent scientists issued a [[manifesto]] urging scientists to "think in a new way" about their moral responsibilities in the nuclear age. In 1957, the first Pugwash Conference was held in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], bringing together some of the greatest scientific minds to address nuclear weapons issues and the social responsibility of [[scientist]]s. SPUSA strives to convene the next generation of scientists around today's parallel issues.

SPUSA is the US student affiliate of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], recipients of the 1995 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the U.S.A. affiliate of the [[International Student/Young Pugwash]].

A long-standing icon of the organization has been [[Albert Einstein]], for his commitment to advancing both science and its [[peace movement|peaceful]] use. Another icon is Professor [[Joseph Rotblat]], who was the co-founder of Pugwash and the only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project, refusing to work further on the atomic bomb after the Nazis were defeated. In response to Rotblat's call for an ethical Hippocratic Oath for scientists, Student Pugwash created a student pledge, calling young scientists to make a personal commitment to use science and technology in a socially responsible way. In 1999, Student Pugwash initiated the Joseph Rotblat Lecture on Science and Social Responsibility in honor of Rotblat's pioneering life dedicated to the responsible use of science.

Following a decrease in revenue related to the [[Late-2000s recession|late 2000s recession]], the organization returned to its student-run founding with former student board members Sharlissa Moore and Kyle Gracey leading the rebuilding.

==Mission and activities==

The mission of Student Pugwash USA is ''"to promote [[social responsibility]] in science and technology."'' It seeks to achieve this by:
* ''"examining the societal impacts of science and technology;''
* ''creating open and objective forums for debate;''
* ''fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse communities;''
* ''exploring solutions to current dilemmas in science and technology; and''
* ''cultivating the analytical skills needed to address future challenges."''

Activities have included regional, national and international conferences, speaker events at campuses through a national chapter network, and compilation of issue briefs on scientific and technical issues of social importance. Student Pugwash also maintains a student email list, a web log covering the ethical intersection of science and technology policy, and a database of socially responsible employers.

A science and technology election guide for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]] was profiled in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']]. This project was continued with the launch of ''From Electrons to Elections'', a science and technology policy guide to the 2008 and 2012 elections.  From Electrons to Elections is a non-partisan resource designed to educate young voters on science, technology, and health issues and provide them with the platforms of the leading political candidates on these subjects.

==Pledge==

To encourage commitment to socially responsible applications of science and technology, Student Pugwash USA offers the following pledge for individuals to sign:

:''"I promise to work for a better world, where science and technology are used in socially responsible ways. I will not use my education for any purpose intended to harm human beings or the environment. Throughout my career, I will consider the ethical implications of my work before I take action. While the demands placed upon me may be great, I sign this declaration because I recognize that individual responsibility is the first step on the path to peace."''

'''''The Relativity of Wrong''''' is a collection of seventeen essays on science, written by [[Isaac Asimov]]. The book explores and contrasts the viewpoint that "all theories are proven wrong in time", arguing that there exist degrees of wrongness.&lt;ref name="Asimov 1988 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Asimov | first=Isaac | title=The relativity of wrong | publisher=Doubleday | publication-place=New York | year=1988 | isbn=0-385-24473-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was the twentieth of a series of books collecting essays from ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''. Like most of the essays Asimov wrote for ''F&amp;SF'', each one in ''The Relativity of Wrong'' begins with an autobiographical anecdote which serves to set the mood. Several of the essays form a sequence explaining the discovery and uses of [[isotope]]s.

==Title essay==
In the title essay, Asimov argues that there exist degrees of wrongness, and being wrong in one way is not necessarily as bad as being wrong in another way.  For example, if a child spells the word ''sugar'' as "pqzzf", the child is clearly incorrect.  Yet, Asimov says, a child who spells the word "shuger" (or in some other phonetic way) is "less wrong" than one who writes a random sequence of letters.  Furthermore, a child who writes "[[sucrose]]" or "C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;" completely disregards the "correct" spelling but shows a degree of knowledge about the real thing under study.  Asimov proposes that a better test question would ask the student to spell ''sugar'' in as many ways as possible, justifying each.

Likewise, believing that the [[Earth]] is a sphere is less wrong than believing that the Earth is [[Flat Earth|flat]], but wrong nonetheless, since it is really an [[oblate spheroid]] or a reasonable approximation thereof.  As the state of knowledge advanced, the statement of the Earth's shape became more refined, and each successive advance required a more careful and subtle investigation. Equating the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is flat with the wrongness of the theory that the Earth is a perfect sphere is ''[[wronger than wrong]]''.

Asimov wrote "The Relativity of Wrong" in response to an "English Literature major" who criticized him for believing in scientific progress.  This unnamed individual is portrayed by Asimov as having taken the postmodern viewpoint that all scientific explanations of the world are equally in error.  Irritated, the [[rationalism|rationalist]] Asimov put forth his views in his monthly ''F&amp;SF'' column, and the result became the title essay of this collection.

'''''The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess''''' is a best-selling book about [[Neopagan]] belief and practice written by [[Starhawk]].  It was first published in 1979, with a second edition in 1989 and a third edition in 1999. Since its publication, it has become a classic book on [[Wicca]] and modern [[witchcraft]], [[spiritual feminism]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and [[ecofeminism]]. The book has been translated into other languages, including German and [[Danish language|Danish]].

==Background==
''The Spiral Dance'' is Starhawk's first and most famous book. After a failed attempt to become a fiction writer in New York City, she returned to California, and became active in the Neopagan community in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. She decided to try her hand at nonfiction and wrote a book on Goddess religion, which she finished in 1977 but was unable to publish at first. Her luck changed when feminist religious scholar [[Carol P. Christ]] included an article on Witchcraft and the Goddess movement in the anthology ''[[Womanspirit Rising]]'' (1979). Christ put Starhawk in touch with an editor at [[Harper &amp; Row]], who eventually published the book. In 1979, partly to commemorate the publication of the book, Starhawk and her friends staged a public celebration of the [[Sabbat (neopaganism)|Neopagan holiday]] of [[Samhain]] (Halloween) incorporating an actual [[Spiral Dance|spiral dance]]. This group became the [[Reclaiming (neopaganism)|Reclaiming Collective]]; the annual Spiral Dance ritual now draws hundreds of participants.

The book was revised for 10th- and 20th-anniversary editions in 1989 and 1999, respectively. The original text of the book was left largely untouched. The revisions consist for the most part of introductions and notes reflecting on the origins of the book and the rituals it describes, and changes to the author's beliefs and practices since writing the book.

Although commonly read as a book on Wicca, ''The Spiral Dance'' is distinguished by its visionary mysticism and ecstatic experience, and by its emphasis on women and the Goddess (although it also brings in the God, similar to most forms of Wicca). Starhawk trained with [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor Anderson]], founder of the [[Feri Tradition]] of witchcraft, and with [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]], a feminist separatist involved in [[Dianic Wicca]].

==Casualty figures==
In ''The Spiral Dance'', Starhawk stated that up to nine million people, mostly women, were killed during the [[Witch Hunt]]s in early modern Europe. The number was based on an article by [[Mary Daly]], who based it on the writings of the 19th century feminist [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], and has no basis in research. (Most estimates based on research range from 60,000–100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Levack, ''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'' (New York, Longman, 1987) gives the figure of 60,000. Anne Lewellyn Barstow, ''Witchcraze'' (San Francisco: Harper, 1994) gives 100,000. Other works on the Witch Hunt vary, but between 60–100,000 is the usual range.&lt;/ref&gt;) In the book's 10th anniversary edition, she states: "Actually, estimates range between a low of one hundred thousand and this figure [nine million], which is probably high. The truth, clearly, is that nobody knows exactly how many people died in the persecutions."&lt;ref&gt;Starhawk (1999). ''The Spiral Dance''. 20th Anniversary Edition. San Francisco: Harper. p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thomism}}
[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] ({{circa|1225}}–1274)]]
{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Thomism''' is the philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work and [[thought of Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), philosopher, theologian, and [[Doctor of the church#Catholicism|Doctor of the Church]]. In philosophy, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]' [[Works by Thomas Aquinas|disputed questions and commentaries]] on [[Aristotle]] are perhaps his most well-known works. In theology, his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' is one of the most influential documents in [[Medieval philosophy#Theology|medieval theology]] and continues to be the central point of reference for the philosophy and theology of the [[Catholic Church]]. In the 1914 encyclical ''Doctoris Angelici''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/doctoris.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831110620/http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/doctoris.htm |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 25 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius X]] cautioned that the teachings of the Church cannot be understood without the basic philosophical underpinnings of Aquinas' major theses: {{quote|The capital theses in the philosophy of St. Thomas are not to be placed in the category of opinions capable of being debated one way or another, but are to be considered as the foundations upon which the whole science of natural and divine things is based; if such principles are once removed or in any way impaired, it must necessarily follow that students of the sacred sciences will ultimately fail to perceive so much as the meaning of the words in which the dogmas of divine revelation are proposed by the magistracy of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Pius X]], ''Doctoris Angelici'', 29 June 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Second Vatican Council]] described Aquinas' system as the "Perennial Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], ''[[Optatam Totius]]'' (28 October 1965) 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomistic philosophy==

===General===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] believed that [[truth]] is to be accepted no matter where it is found. His doctrines draw from [[ancient Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Roman philosophy|Roman]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], philosophers. Specifically, he was a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] (i.e., he, unlike the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptics]], believed that the world can be known as it is). He largely followed [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] terminology and [[metaphysics]], and wrote comprehensive [[commentaries on Aristotle]], often affirming [[Aristotle]]'s views with independent arguments. Aquinas respectfully referred to Aristotle simply as "the Philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article7 ''Summa Theologiæ'', Q.84, art.7.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029234148/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm |date=29 October 2009 }}, where the ''sed contra'' is only a quote from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[De anima]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adhered to some [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] principles, for example that "it is absolutely true that there is first something which is essentially being and essentially good, which we call God, ... [and that] everything can be called good and a being, inasmuch as it [[Theory of Forms|''participates'' in it by way of a certain assimilation]]..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1006.htm#article4 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.6, art.4 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204142644/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1006.htm#article4 |archivedate=4 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===24 Thomistic Theses===
With the decree ''Postquam sanctissimus'' of 27 July 1914,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/theses.eht ''Postquam sanctissimus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810225643/http://www.vaxxine.com/hyoomik/aquinas/theses.eht |date=10 August 2007 }}, Latin with English translation&lt;br/&gt;See also [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/24Thomisticpart2.htm P. Lumbreras's commentary on the 24 Thomistic Theses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605055456/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/24Thomisticpart2.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius X]] declared that 24 theses formulated by "teachers from various institutions ... clearly contain the principles and more important thoughts" of Aquinas. Principal contributors to the Church's official statement of the "24 Theses" of Thomism include [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher and theologian [[Edouard Hugon]] of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] philosopher theologian Guido Mattiussi of the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].

==== Ontology ====
{{See also|Ontology}}

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either [[Actus purus|pure act]], or of necessity it is composed of potency and [[Actus primus|act as primary]] and intrinsic principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since act is perfection, it is not limited except through a potency which itself is a capacity for perfection. Hence in any order in which an act is pure act, it will only exist, in that order, as a unique and unlimited act. But whenever it is finite and manifold, it has entered into a true composition with potency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, the one God, unique and simple, alone subsists in absolute being. All other things that participate in being have a nature whereby their being is restricted; they are constituted of essence and being, as really distinct principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thing is called a being because of "esse". God and creature are not called beings univocally, nor wholly equivocally, but analogically, by an analogy both of attribution and of proportionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In every creature there is also a real composition of the subsisting subject and of added secondary forms, i.e. [[Accidental property|accidental]] forms. Such composition cannot be understood unless being is really received in an essence distinct from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides the absolute accidents there is also the relative accident, relation. Although by reason of its own character relation does not signify anything inhering in another, it nevertheless often has a cause in things, and hence a real entity distinct from the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A [[spiritual creature]] is wholly simple in its essence. Yet there is still a twofold composition in the spiritual creature, namely, that of the essence with being, and that of the substance with accidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the corporeal creature is composed of act and potency even in its very essence. These act and potency in the order of essence are designated by the names form and matter respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==== Cosmology ====
{{See also|Cosmology (metaphysics)|l1=Cosmology}}

&lt;ol start="9"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither the matter nor the form have being of themselves, nor are they produced or corrupted of themselves, nor are they included in any category otherwise than reductively, as substantial principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although extension in quantitative parts follows upon a corporeal nature, nevertheless it is not the same for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is truly an accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The principle of individuation, i.e., of numerical distinction of one individual from another with the same specific nature, is matter designated by quantity. Thus in pure spirits there cannot be more than one individual in the same specific nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By virtue of a body's quantity itself, the body is circumscriptively in a place, and in one place alone circumscriptively, no matter what power might be brought to bear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bodies are divided into two groups; for some are living and others are devoid of life. In the case of the living things, in order that there be in the same subject an essentially moving part and an essentially moved part, the substantial form, which is designated by the name soul, requires an organic disposition, i.e. heterogeneous parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==== Psychology ====
{{See also|Psychology}}

&lt;ol start="14"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Souls in the vegetative and sensitive orders cannot subsist of themselves, nor are they produced of themselves. Rather, they are no more than principles whereby the living thing exists and lives; and since they are wholly dependent upon matter, they are incidentally corrupted through the corruption of the composite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, the human soul subsists of itself. When it can be infused into a sufficiently disposed subject, it is created by God. By its very nature, it is incorruptible and immortal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This rational soul is united to the body in such a manner that it is the only substantial form of the body. By virtue of his soul a man is a man, an animal, a living thing, a body, a substance and a being. Therefore, the soul gives man every essential degree of perfection; moreover, it gives the body a share in the act of being whereby it itself exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the human soul there naturally issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the non-organic. The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as their subject. The non-organic powers have the soul alone as their subject. Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectuality necessarily follows upon immateriality, and furthermore, in such manner that the further the distance from matter, the higher the degree of intellectuality. Any being is the adequate object of understanding in general. But in the present state of union of soul and body, quantities abstracted from the material conditions of individuality are the proper object of the human intellect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, we receive knowledge from sensible things. But since sensible things are not actually intelligible, in addition to the intellect, which formally understands, an active power must be acknowledged in the soul, which power abstracts intelligible likeness or species from sense images in the imagination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through these intelligible likenesses or species we directly know universals, i.e. the natures of things. We attain to singulars by our senses, and also by our intellect, when it beholds the sense images. But we ascend to knowledge of spiritual things by analogy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The will does not precede the intellect but follows upon it. The will necessarily desires that which is presented to it as a good in every respect satisfying the appetite. But it freely chooses among the many goods that are presented to it as desirable according to a changeable judgment or evaluation. Consequently, the choice follows the final practical judgment. But the will is the cause of it being the final one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==== God ====
{{See also|God}}

&lt;ol start="22"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not perceive by an immediate intuition that God exists, nor do we prove it ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. But we do prove it ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', i.e., from the things that have been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a [[active intellect|separated intellect]] which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metaphysical motion of the Divine Essence is correctly expressed by saying that it is identified with the exercised actuality of its own being, or that it is subsistent being itself. And this is the reason for its infinite and unlimited perfection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By reason of the very purity of His being, God is distinguished from all finite beings. Hence it follows, in the first place, that the world could only have come from God by creation; secondly, that not even by way of a miracle can any finite nature be given creative power, which of itself directly attains the very being of any being; and finally, that no created agent can in any way influence the being of any effect unless it has itself been moved by the first Cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

== Metaphysics ==
Aquinas says that the fundamental [[axiom]]s of [[ontology]] are the [[principle of non-contradiction]] and the [[principle of causality]]. Therefore, any [[being]] that does not contradict these two laws could theoretically exist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm ''De Ente et Essentia'', 67–68.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |date=26 November 2009 }} "Although everyone admits the simplicity of the First Cause, some try to introduce a composition of matter and form in the intelligences and in souls... But this is not in agreement with what philosophers commonly say, because they call them substances separated from matter, and prove them to be without all matter."&lt;/ref&gt; even if said being were [[incorporeal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/ContraGentiles2.htm#91 |title=''Summa contra Gentiles'', II, chp. 91 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228235648/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/ContraGentiles2.htm#91 |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predication ===
Aquinas noted three forms of descriptive language when [[Predicate (grammar)|predicating]]: univocal, [[analogy|analogical]], and [[Equivocation|equivocal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sproul, R.C. | authorlink = R. C. Sproul | title = Renewing Your Mind: Basic Christian Beliefs You Need to Know | publisher = Baker Books | location = Grand Rapids, MI | year = 1998 | page = 33 | isbn = 978-0-8010-5815-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Univocality''' is the use of a descriptor in the same sense when applied to two objects or groups of objects. For instance, when the word "milk" is applied both to milk produced by cows and by any other female mammal.
* '''Analogy''' occurs when a descriptor changes some but not all of its meaning. For example, the word "healthy" is analogical in that it applies both to a healthy person or animal (those that enjoy of good health) and to some food or drink (if it is good for the health).
* '''Equivocation''' is the complete change in meaning of the descriptor and is an [[informal fallacy]]. For example, when the word "bank" is applied to river banks and financial banks, modern philosophers talk of [[ambiguity]].

Further, the usage of "[[definition]]" that Aquinas gives is the [[genus]] of the being, plus a difference that sets it apart from the genus itself. For instance, the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of "man" is "[[rational animal]]"; its genus being animal, and what sets apart man from other animals is his [[rationality]].&lt;ref name="rationalanimal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm |title=''De Ente et Essentia'', 37 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Being ===
{{see also|Being#Thomistic analogical predication of being}}
{{quote|[E]xistence is twofold: one is essential existence or the '''[[Substance theory|substantial]]''' existence of a thing, for example man exists, and this is existence ''simpliciter''. The other is '''[[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]]''' existence, for example man is white, and this is existence ''secundum quid''.|[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DePrincNaturae.htm ''De Principiis Naturæ'', 1.]}}

In Thomist philosophy, the definition of a [[being]] is "that which is," which is composed of two parts: "which" refers to its ''[[quiddity]]'' (literally "whatness"), and "is" refers to its ''esse'' (the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[infinitive]] [[verb]] "to be").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm ''De Ente et Essentia'', 83.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |date=26 November 2009 }} "And this is why substances of this sort are said by some to be composed of "that by which it is" and "that which is," or as Boethius says, of "that which is" and "existence.""&lt;/ref&gt; "''Quiddity''" is synonymous with [[essence]], [[Theory of Forms|form]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]; whereas "''esse''" refers to the principle of the being's existence. In other words, a being is "an essence that exists."&lt;ref name="definitionofbeing"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article4 ''Summa'', I, Q.3, art.4.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm |date=9 November 2011 }} "Therefore, if the existence of a thing differs from its essence, this existence must be caused either by some exterior agent or by its essential principles."&lt;/ref&gt;

Being is divided in two ways: that which is ''in itself'' ([[Substance theory|substances]]), and that which is ''in another'' ([[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]). Substances are things which exist ''per se'' or in their own right. Accidents are qualities that apply to other things, such as shape or color: "[A]ccidents must include in their definition a subject which is outside their genus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm |title=''De Ente et Essentia'', 17 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they only exist in other things, Aquinas holds that [[metaphysics]] is primarily the study of substances, as they are the primary mode of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm |title=''De Ente et Essentia'', 110 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }} "And because accidents are not composed of matter and form, their genus cannot be taken from matter and their difference from form, as in the case of composed substances."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causality ===
Aristotle categorized causality into [[Four causes|four subsets]] in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', which is an integral part of Thomism:

{{quote|"In one sense the term cause means (a) that from which, as something intrinsic, a thing comes to be, as the bronze of a statue and the silver of a goblet, and the genera of these. In another sense it means (b) the form and pattern of a thing, i.e., the intelligible expression of the ''quiddity'' and its genera (for example, the ratio of 2: 1 and number in general are the cause of an octave chord) and the parts which are included in the intelligible expression. Again, (c) that from which the first beginning of change or of rest comes is a cause; for example, an adviser is a cause, and a father is the cause of a child, and in general a maker is a cause of the thing made, and a changer a cause of the thing changed. Further, a thing is a cause (d) inasmuch as it is an end, i.e., that for the sake of which something is done; for example, health is the cause of walking. For if we are asked why someone took a walk, we answer, "in order to be healthy"; and in saying this we think we have given the cause. And whatever occurs on the way to the end under the motion of something else is also a cause. For example, reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health; for all of these exist for the sake of the end, although they differ from each other inasmuch as some are instruments and others are processes."|[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics5.htm#2 Metaphysics 1013a, trans. John P. Rowan, Chicago, 1961]}}

:* (a) refers to the '''material cause''', what a being's matter consists of (if applicable).
:* (b) refers to the '''formal cause''', what a being's essence is.
:* (c) refers to the '''efficient cause''', what brings about the beginning of, or change to, a being.
:* (d) refers to the '''final cause''', what a being's purpose is.

Unlike many [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greeks]], who thought that an [[infinite regress]] of causality is possible (and thus held that the universe is uncaused), Aquinas argues that an infinite chain never accomplishes its objective and is thus impossible.&lt;ref name="Summa, I, Q.44, art.1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1044.htm#article1 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.44, art.1 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105100607/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1044.htm#article1 |archivedate=5 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a [[first cause]] is necessary for the existence of anything to be possible. Further, the First Cause must continuously be in action (similar to how there must always be a first chain in a [[Chain-link fencing|chain link]]), otherwise the series collapses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics5.htm |title=St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on the ''Metaphysics'', Bk.

{{quote|[[Aristotle|The Philosopher]] says ([http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics2.htm#4 ''Metaph''. ii, 2]) that "to suppose a thing to be indefinite is to deny that it is good." But the good is that which has the nature of an end. Therefore it is contrary to the nature of an end to proceed indefinitely. Therefore it is necessary to fix one last end.|[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm#article4 ''Summa'', II-I, Q.1, art.4.]}}

Thus, both Aristotle and Aquinas conclude that there must be an uncaused Primary Mover,&lt;ref name="Summa, I, Q.44, art.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics2.htm#3 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on the Metaphysics, Bk.

However, the First Cause does not necessarily have to be temporally the first. Thus, the question of whether or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|University of Paris's condemnation of 1270]] denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, [[Bonaventure]], held that the [[Temporal finitism|temporality]] of the universe is demonstrable by reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscan-archive.org/bonaventura/opera/bon02019.html Br. Bugnolo, Alexis, trans., Opera Omnia S.

Poiesis: Philosophy Online, EBSCOhost (Retrieved 13 April 2010): 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1046.htm#article2 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.46, art.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160407/http://newadvent.org/summa/1046.htm#article2 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeEternitateMundi.htm |title=''De aeternitate mundi'' |publisher=Dhspriory.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204111751/http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeEternitateMundi.htm |archivedate=4 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goodness ===
As per the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' of [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics1.htm |title=''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. I, Chp. I, 1094a4 |publisher=Dhspriory.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001211100/http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics1.htm |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defines "[[Value (ethics)|the good]]" as what all things strive for. E.g., a cutting knife is said to be good if it is effective at its function, cutting. As all things have a function/[[final cause]], all real things are good. Consequently, [[evil]] is nothing but ''[[privatio boni]]'', or "lack of good", as [[Augustine of Hippo]] defined it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]]. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1302.htm ''Enchridion'', chp. 11.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109103333/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1302.htm |date=9 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Pseudo-Dionysius|Dionysius]] says (Div. Nom. iv), 'Evil is neither a being nor a good.' I answer that, one opposite is known through the other, as darkness is known through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good. Now, we have said above that good is everything appetible; and thus, since every nature desires its own being and its own perfection, it must be said also that the being and the perfection of any nature is good. Hence it cannot be that evil signifies being, or any form or nature. Therefore it must be that by the name of evil is signified the absence of good. And this is what is meant by saying that 'evil is neither a being nor a good.' For since being, as such, is good, the absence of one implies the absence of the other.|[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1048.htm#article1 ''Summa'', I, Q.48, art.1.]}}

Commentating on the aforementioned, Aquinas says that "there is no problem from the fact that some men desire evil. For they desire evil only under the aspect of good, that is, insofar as they think it good. Hence their intention primarily aims at the good and only incidentally touches on the evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics1.htm#1 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk.

=== Existence of God ===
{{Main|Quinquae viae}}
Thomas Aquinas holds that the [[existence of God]] can be demonstrated by reason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |title=''Summa'', I, Q.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428053715/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm |archivedate=28 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view that is taught by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm CCC 34.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926223727/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c1.htm |date=26 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''quinque viae'' (Latin: '''five ways''') found in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' ([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 I, Q.2, art.3]) are five possible ways of demonstrating the existence of God,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas offers more metaphysical explanations for the existence of God in ''[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm De Ente et Essentia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |date=26 November 2009 }}'' and elsewhere, though the ''Quinquae viae'' are the most well-known and most commonly analyzed among these.&lt;/ref&gt; which today are categorized as:
: 1. ''Argumentum ex motu'', or the argument of the [[unmoved mover]];
: 2. ''Argumentum ex ratione causae efficientis'', or the argument of the [[first cause]];
: 3. ''Argumentum ex contingentia'', or the [[Necessary being|argument from contingency]];
: 4. ''Argumentum ex gradu'', or the [[argument from degree]]; and
: 5. ''Argumentum ex fine'', or the [[teleological argument]].
Despite this, Aquinas also thought that [[sacred mysteries]] such as [[the Trinity]] could only be obtained through [[revelation]]; though these truths cannot contradict reason:

{{quote|The existence of God and other like truths about God, which can be known by natural reason, are not articles of faith, but are preambles to the articles; for faith presupposes natural knowledge, even as grace presupposes nature, and perfection supposes something that can be perfected. Nevertheless, there is nothing to prevent a man, who cannot grasp a proof, accepting, as a matter of faith, something which in itself is capable of being scientifically known and demonstrated.|[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article2 ''Summa'', I, Q.2, art.2.]}}

Aquinas responds to the [[problem of evil]] by saying that God allows evil to exist that good may come of it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3a.htm#10 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Bk.

=== View of God ===
Aquinas articulated and defended, both as a philosopher and a theologian, the orthodox Christian [[God in Christianity|view of God]]. God is the sole being whose [[existence]] is the same as His [[essence]]: "what subsists in God is His existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm |title=''Summa'', I, Q.3, art.4 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Hence why God names himself "[[I Am that I Am]]" in [http://www.newadvent.org/bible/exo003.htm Exodus 3:14].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article11 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.13, art.11 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120065531/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1013.htm#article11 |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Consequently, God cannot be a body (that is, He cannot be composed of [[matter]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article1 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.13, art. 1 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article1 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He cannot have any [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article6 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.13, art. 6 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article6 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and He must be [[Divine simplicity|simple]] (that is, not separated into parts; [[the Trinity]] is one [[Substance theory|substance]] in three persons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.13, art. 7 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, He is [[Good and evil|goodness]] itself,&lt;ref name="Godisgood" /&gt; [[perfect]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1004.htm |title=''Summa'', I., Q.4 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109155637/http://newadvent.org/summa/1004.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infinity|infinite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1007.htm |title=''Summa'', I., Q.7 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163652/http://newadvent.org/summa/1007.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[omnipotent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm#article3 |title=''Summa'', I., Q.25, art.3 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm#article3 |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; omniscient,&lt;ref name="omniscience" /&gt; happiness itself,&lt;ref name="Godishappiness"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article1 ''Summa'', II-I, Q.3, art.1.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312035235/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm |date=12 March 2013 }} "God is happiness by His Essence."&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge itself,&lt;ref name="Godisknowledge" /&gt; [[Agape|love]] itself,&lt;ref name="God is love" /&gt; [[omnipresent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1008.htm |title=''Summa'', I., Q.8 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163509/http://newadvent.org/summa/1008.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immutability (theology)|immutable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1009.htm |title=''Summa'', I., Q.9 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109161542/http://newadvent.org/summa/1009.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1010.htm#article2 |title=''Summa'', I., Q.10, art.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128084320/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1010.htm#article2 |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summing up these properties, Aquinas offers the term ''[[actus purus]]'' (Latin: "pure actuality").

Aquinas held that not only does God have [[knowledge]] of everything,&lt;ref name="omniscience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm |title=''Summa'', I, Q.14, arts. 5, 6, &amp; 9 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162047/http://newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that God has "the most perfect knowledge," and that it is also true to say that God "is" His understanding.&lt;ref name="Godisknowledge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm |title=''Summa'', I, Q.14, art. 4 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162047/http://newadvent.org/summa/1014.htm |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas also understands God as the transcendent cause of the universe, the "first Cause of all things, exceeding all things caused by Him," the source of all creaturely being and the cause of every other cause.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologiae I, Q. 12, art. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God's causality is not like the causality of any other causes (all other causes are "secondary causes"), because He is the transcendent source of all being, causing and sustaining every other existing thing at every instant. Consequently, God's causality is never in competition with the causality of creatures; rather, God even causes some things through the causality of creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Contra Gentiles III, chap. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas was an advocate of the "analogical way", which says that because God is infinite, people can only speak of God by analogy, for some of the aspects of the divine nature are hidden (''Deus absconditus'') and others revealed (''Deus revelatus'') to finite human minds. Thomist philosophy holds that we can know ''about'' God through his creation (general revelation), but only in an analogous manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#30 ''Summa contra Gentiles'', Bk. I, chp. 30.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228055614/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm |date=28 February 2009 }} "For we cannot grasp what God is, but only what He is not and how other things are related to Him, as is clear from what we said above."&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, we can speak of God's goodness only by understanding that goodness as applied to humans is similar to, but not identical with, the goodness of God. Further, he argues that [[sacred scripture]] employs [[figurative language]]: "Now it is natural to man to attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects, because all our knowledge originates from sense. Hence in Holy Writ, spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the ''likeness'' of material things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1001.htm#article9 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.1, art.9 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123045429/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1001.htm#article9 |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to demonstrate God's creative power, Aquinas says: "If a being participates, to a certain degree, in an 'accident,' this accidental property must have been communicated to it by a cause which possesses it essentially. Thus iron becomes incandescent by the action of fire. Now, God is His own power which subsists by itself. The being which subsists by itself is necessarily one."&lt;ref name="Summa, I, Q.44, art.1"/&gt;

In addition to agreeing with the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] definition of man as "the [[rational animal]],"&lt;ref name="rationalanimal" /&gt; Aquinas also held various other beliefs about the [[Substance theory|substance]] of man. For instance, as the [[essence]] ([[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]) of all men are the same,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm ''De Ente et Essentia'', 24.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |date=26 November 2009 }} "It is clear, therefore, that the essence of man and the essence of [[Socrates]] do not differ, except as the non-designated from the designated. Whence [[Averroes|the Commentator]] says in his considerations on the seventh book of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' that "Socrates is nothing other than animality and rationality, which are his ''[[quiddity]]''.""&lt;/ref&gt; and the definition of being is "an essence that exists,"&lt;ref name="definitionofbeing" /&gt; humans that are real therefore only differ by their [[Category of being|specific qualities]]. More generally speaking, all beings of the same [[genus]] have the same essence, and so long as they exist, only differ by [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] and [[substantial form]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte&amp;Essentia.htm ''De Ente et Essentia'', 33.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126104033/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeEnte%26Essentia.htm |date=26 November 2009 }} "The difference, on the contrary, is a name taken from a determinate form, and taken in a determinate way, i.e. as not including a determinate matter in its meaning. This is clear, for example, when we say animated, i.e., that which has a soul; for what it is, whether a body or something other, is not expressed. Whence [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]] says that the genus is not understood in the difference as a part of its essence, but only as something outside its essence, as the subject also is understood in its properties. And this is why the genus is not predicated essentially of the difference, as the Philosopher says in the third book of the Metaphysics and in the fourth book of the Topics, but only in the way in which a subject is predicated of its property."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soul ===

Thomists define the soul as the substantial form of living beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeAnima.htm St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on ''De anima'', Bk. I, 402a1–403b2, §1.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404042737/http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeAnima.htm |date=4 April 2010 }} "Now living beings taken all together form a certain class of being; hence in studying them the first thing to do is to consider what living things have in common, and afterwards what each has peculiar to itself. What they have in common is a life-principle or soul; in this they are all alike. In conveying knowledge, therefore, about living things one must first convey it about the soul as that which is common to them all. Thus when Aristotle sets out to treat of living things, he begins with the soul; after which, in subsequent books, he defines the properties of particular living beings."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, plants have "vegetative souls," animals have "sensitive souls,"&lt;ref name="soul" /&gt; while human beings alone have "intellectual" – rational and immortal – souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm#article6 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.75, art.6 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119083516/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1075.htm#article6 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For Aristotle, the soul is one, but endowed with five groups of faculties (''dunámeis''): (1) the "vegetative" faculty (''threptikón''), concerned with the maintenance and development of organic life; (2) the appetite (''oretikón''), or the tendency to any good; (3) the faculty of sense perception (''aisthetikón''); (4) the "locomotive" faculty (''kinetikón''), which presides over the various bodily movements; and (5) reason (''dianoetikón''). The [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] generally follow Aristotle's classification. For them body and soul are united in one complete substance. The soul is the ''forma substantialis'', the vital principle, the source of all activities. Hence their science of the soul deals with functions which nowadays belong to the provinces of biology and physiology. [...] The nature of the mind and its relations to the organism are questions that belong to philosophy or metaphysics.|[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05749a.htm Dubray, C. (1909). Faculties of the Soul. In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved May 29, 2010 from New Advent.]}}

The appetite of man has two parts, rational and irrational. The rational part is called the will, and the irrational part is called passion.

=== Ethics ===
Aquinas affirms Aristotle's definition of happiness as "an operation according to perfect [[virtue]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q.3, art.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109063700/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article2 |archivedate=9 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/Ethics1.htm#10 St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Lec. 10, §130.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060713/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/Ethics1.htm |date=24 September 2015 }} Aquinas further says that "it is clear that happiness is a virtue-oriented activity proper to man in a complete life."&lt;/ref&gt; and that "happiness is called man's supreme good, because it is the attainment or enjoyment of the supreme good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article1 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q.3, art.1 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109063700/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article1 |archivedate=9 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding what the virtues are, Aquinas ascertained the [[cardinal virtues]] to be [[prudence]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]]. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three [[theological virtues]]: [[faith]], [[hope]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] (which is used interchangeably with love in the sense of ''[[agape]]''). These are [[supernatural]] and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2062.htm#article2 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q.62, art.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109214542/http://newadvent.org/summa/2062.htm#article2 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with [[Roman Catholic theology]], Aquinas argues that humans can neither wish nor do [[Good and evil|good]] without [[Grace (Christianity)#Grace in Catholicism|divine grace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2109.htm#article2 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q.109, art.2 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113214919/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2109.htm#article2 |archivedate=13 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "doing good" here refers to doing good per se: man ''can'' do, moved by God even then but "only" in the sense in which even his nature depends on God's moving, things that happen to be good in some respect, and are not sinful, though if he has not grace, it will be without merit, and he will not succeed in it all the time. Therefore, happiness is attained through the perseverance of virtue given by the Grace of God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2109.htm#article10 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q. 109, art.10 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113214919/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2109.htm#article10 |archivedate=13 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is not fully attained on earth;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2005.htm#article3 ''Summa'', II-I, Q.5, art.3.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021152708/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2005.htm |date=21 October 2012 }} "First, from the general notion of happiness.

Of note is the [[principle of double effect]], formulated in the [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3064.htm#article7 ''Summa'', II-II, Q.64, art.7], which is a justification of [[homicide]] in [[self-defense]]. Previously experiencing difficulties in the world of [[Christian philosophy]], the doctrine of [[Just War]] was expounded by Aquinas with this principle. He says:

{{quote|In order for a war to be just, three things are necessary. First, the authority of the sovereign by whose command the war is to be waged... Secondly, a [[Jus ad bellum|just cause is required]], namely that those who are attacked, should be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault... Thirdly, it is necessary that the belligerents should have a rightful intention, so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil...|[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3040.htm#article1 ''Summa'', II-II, Q.40, art.1.]}}

=== Law ===
{{main|Treatise on Law}}
Thomism recognizes four different species of law, which he defines as "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2090.htm#article4 |title=''Summa'', II-I, Q.90, art.4 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102163652/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2090.htm#article4 |archivedate=2 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But to his supernatural end man needs to be directed in a yet higher way. Hence the additional law given by God, whereby man shares more perfectly in the eternal law."&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of natural law is one of the most influential parts of Thomist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html ''Veritatis splendor'', 12.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027082206/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html |date=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that "[the law of nature] is nothing other than the light of the intellect planted in us by God, by which we know what should be done and what should be avoided. God gave this light and this law in creation... For no one is ignorant that what he would not like to be done to himself he should not do to others, and similar norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/TenCommandments.htm#0 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on the Ten Commandments, prologue, sec.

=== Free will ===
Aquinas argues that [[Argument from free will|there is no contradiction]] between God's [[divine providence|providence]] and human [[free will]]:

{{quote|... just as by moving natural causes [God] does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature.|[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm#article1 ''Summa'', I., Q.83, art.1.]}}

Aquinas argues that God offers man both a prevenient grace to enable him to perform supernaturally good works, and cooperative grace within the same. The relation of prevenient grace to voluntariness has been the subject of further debate; the position known here as "Thomist" was originated by [[Domingo Báñez]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Ott]], Grundriss der Dogmatik, nova &amp; vetera, Bonn 2005, IV/I § 15&lt;/ref&gt; and says that God gives an additional grace (the "efficient grace") to the [[predestination|predestined]] which makes them accept, while [[Luis de Molina]] held that God distributes grace according to a middle knowledge, and man can accept it without a different grace. [[Molinism]] is a school that is part of Thomism in the general sense (it originated in commentaries to Aquinas), yet it must be born in mind that, here, Thomism and Molinism oppose each other. (The question has been declared undecided by the [[Holy See]].)

== Epistemology ==
{{quote|"Whatever is in our [[intellect]] must have previously been in the [[senses]]."|[[Thomas Aquinas]], the [[peripatetic axiom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/QDdeVer2.htm#3 |title=''De veritate'', Q.2, art.3, answer 19 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503051708/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/QDdeVer2.htm#3 |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aquinas adhered to the [[correspondence theory of truth]], which says that something is [[truth|true]] "when it conforms to the external reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/QDdeVer1.htm#3 |title=''De veritate'', Q. 1, art. 3 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424063600/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/QDdeVer1.htm#3 |archivedate=24 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, any being that [[existence|exists]] can be said to be true insofar that it participates in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article6 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.16, art.6 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106040340/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm#article6 |archivedate=6 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's ''[[De anima]]'' (''On the Soul'') divides the [[mind]] into three parts: [[Sense|sensation]], [[imagination]] and [[intellect]]ion. When one perceives an object, his mind composites a sense-image. When he [[memory|remembers]] the object he previously sensed, he is imagining its [[Substantial form|form]] (the image of the imagination is often translated as "phantasm"). When he extracts information from this phantasm, he is using his intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeAnima.htm#212 |title=''De anima'', Bk.

Concerning the question of "Whether the intellect can actually understand through the intelligible species of which it is possessed, without turning to the phantasms?" in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Aquinas quotes Aristotle in the ''sed contra'': "the soul understands nothing without a phantasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article7 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.84, art.7 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102165338/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article7 |archivedate=2 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the peripatetic axiom. (Another theorem to be drawn from this is that [[error]] is a result of drawing false conclusions based on our sensations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeAnima.htm#37 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas's commentary on ''De anima'', §688 |publisher=Op-stjoseph.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107031219/http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/study/thomas/DeAnima.htm#37 |archivedate=7 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas' [[Epistemology|epistemological theory]] would later be classified as [[empiricism]], for holding that sensations are a necessary step in acquiring knowledge, and that [[deductive logic|deductions]] cannot be made from [[rationalism|pure reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article8 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.84, art.8 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102165338/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1084.htm#article8 |archivedate=2 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
Aquinas shifted [[Scholasticism]] away from [[neoplatonism]] and towards [[Aristotle]]. The ensuing school of thought, through its influence on Catholicism and the ethics of the Catholic school, is one of the most influential philosophies of all time, also significant due to the number of people living by its teachings.
[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli - Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas - WGA10334.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, [[Benozzo Gozzoli]],1471. Louvre, Paris]]

Before Aquinas' death, [[Stephen Tempier]], [[Bishop of Paris]], forbade certain positions associated with Aquinas (especially his denial of both universal ''[[hylomorphism]]'' and a plurality of [[substantial form]]s in a single substance) to be taught in the [[University of Paris|Faculty of Arts at Paris]]. Through the influence of traditional Augustinian theologians, some theses of Aquinas were [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|condemned in 1277]] by the ecclesiastical authorities of Paris and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (the most important theological schools in the [[Middle Ages]]). The [[Franciscan Order]] opposed the ideas of the [[Order of Preachers|Dominican]] Aquinas, while the Dominicans institutionally took up the defense of his work (1286), and thereafter adopted it as an official philosophy of the order to be taught in their ''studia''. Early opponents of Aquinas include [[William de la Mare]], [[Henry of Ghent]], [[Giles of Rome]], and [[Duns Scotus|Jon Duns Scotus]].

Early and noteworthy defenders of Aquinas were his former teacher [[Albertus Magnus]], the ill-fated [[Richard Knapwell]], [[William Macclesfeld]], [[Giles of Lessines]], [[John of Quidort]], [[Bernard of Auvergne]], and [[Thomas of Sutton]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The [[canonization]] of Aquinas in 1323 led to a revocation of the condemnation of 1277. Later, Aquinas and his school would find a formidable opponent in the ''[[via moderna]]'', particularly in [[William of Ockham]] and his adherents.

Thomism remained a doctrine held principally by Dominican theologians, such as [[Giovanni Capreolo]] (1380–1444) or [[Thomas Cajetan|Tommaso de Vio]] (1468–1534). Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through for example the Dominicans [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (particularly noteworthy for his work in natural law theory), [[Domingo de Soto]] (notable for his work on economic theory), [[John of St. Thomas]], and [[Domingo Báñez]]; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the [[School of Salamanca|Salmanticenses]]); and even, in a way, the newly formed [[Jesuits]], particularly [[Francisco Suárez]], and [[Luis de Molina]].

The modern period brought considerable difficulty for Thomism.&lt;ref name="decline"&gt;{{CathEncy|last=Kennedy|first=Daniel|wstitle=Thomism|volume=14}} "Gradually, however, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there came a decline in the study of the works of the great Scholastics."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, Aquinas's theological doctrine was often presented in seminaries through his Jesuit manualist interpreters, who adopted his theology in an eclectic way, while his philosophy was often neglected altogether in favor of [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]]. Many think the manualist approach had more in common with Duns Scotus than it did with Aquinas—thus is more properly labeled [[Neo-Scholasticism]]. And in all this, the Dominican Order, was having [[Dominican order#Nineteenth century to present|demographic difficulties]]. Pope [[Leo XIII]] attempted a Thomistic revival, particularly with his 1879 encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' and his establishment of the Leonine Commission, established to produce critical editions of Aquinas' ''opera omnia''. This encyclical served as the impetus for the rise of Neothomism, which brought an emphasis on the [[ethic]]al parts of Thomism, as well as a large part of its views on life, humans, and theology, are found in the various schools of [[Neothomism]]. Neothomism held sway as the dominant philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church until the [[Second Vatican Council]], which seemed to confirm the significance of [[Ressourcement]] theology. Thomism remains a school of philosophy today, and influential in Catholicism, though "The Church has no philosophy of her own nor does she canonize any one particular philosophy in preference to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John Paul II |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_15101998_fides-et-ratio_en.html |title=''Fides et ratio'', 49 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126183043/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_15101998_fides-et-ratio_en.html |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled "Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas."

===Influence on Jewish thought===
Aquinas' doctrines, because of their close relationship with those of Jewish philosophy, found great favor among Jews. [[Judah Romano]] (born 1286) translated Aquinas' ideas from Latin into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] under the title ''Ma'amar ha-Mamschalim'', together with other small treatises extracted from the "Contra Gentiles" ("Neged ha-Umot").

[[Eli Habillo]] (1470) translated, without the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] title, the "Quæstiones Disputatæ," "Quæstio de Anima," his "De Animæ Facultatibus," under the title "Ma'amar be-KoḦot ha-Nefesh," (edited by Jellinek); his "De Universalibus" as "Be-Inyan ha-Kolel"; "Shaalot Ma'amar beNimẓa we-biMehut."

Abraham Nehemiah ben Joseph (1490) translated Aquinas's "Commentarii in Metaphysicam." According to [[Moses Almosnino]], [[Isaac Abravanel]] desired to translate the "Quæstio de Spiritualibus Creaturis." Abravanel indeed seems to have been well acquainted with the philosophy of Aquinas, whom he mentions in his work "Mif'alot Elohim" (vi. 3). The physician Jacob Zahalon (d. 1693) translated some extracts from the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.

==Connection with Jewish thought==
Aquinas did not disdain to draw upon [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophical]] sources. His main work, the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', shows a profound knowledge not only of the writings of [[Avicebron]] (Ibn Gabirol), whose name he mentions, but also of most Jewish philosophical works then existing.

Aquinas pronounces himself energetically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |title=''Summa'', I, Q.3, art. 7 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109160402/http://newadvent.org/summa/1003.htm#article7 |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; against the hypothesis of the eternity of the world, in agreement with both [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Jewish theology]]. But as this theory is attributed to [[Aristotle]], he seeks to demonstrate that the latter did not express himself categorically on this subject. "The argument," said he, "which Aristotle presents to support this thesis is not properly called a demonstration, but is only a reply to the theories of those ancients who supposed that this world had a beginning and who gave only impossible proofs.

==Scholarly perspectives==

===Individual thinkers===

====René Descartes====
Thomism began to decline in popularity in the [[Modern philosophy|modern period]],&lt;ref name="decline" /&gt; which was inaugurated by [[René Descartes]]' works ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' in 1637 and ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' in 1641. The [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] doctrines of [[mind–body dualism]] and [[Rationalism|the fallibility of the senses]] implicitly contradicted [[Aristotle]] and [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]:

{{quote|But, meanwhile, I feel greatly astonished when I observe [the weakness of my mind, and] its proneness to error. For although, without at all giving expression to what I think, I consider all this in my own mind, words yet occasionally impede my progress, and I am almost led into error by the terms of ordinary language. We say, for example, that we see the same wax when it is before us, and not that we judge it to be the same from its retaining the same color and figure: whence I should forthwith be disposed to conclude that the wax is known by the act of sight, and not by the intuition of the mind alone, were it not for the analogous instance of human beings passing on in the street below, as observed from a window. In this case I do not fail to say that I see the men themselves, just as I say that I see the wax; and yet what do I see from the window beyond hats and cloaks that might cover artificial machines, whose motions might be determined by springs? But I judge that there are human beings from these appearances, and thus I comprehend, by the faculty of judgment alone which is in the mind, what I believed I saw with my eyes.|[[s:Meditations on First Philosophy/Meditation II|''Meditations on First Philosophy'', Med. II, §13.]]}}

====G. K. Chesterton====
In describing Thomism as a philosophy of common sense, [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote:
{{quote|
Since the modern world began in the sixteenth century, nobody's system of philosophy has really corresponded to everybody's sense of reality; to what, if left to themselves, common men would call common sense. Each started with a paradox; a peculiar point of view demanding the sacrifice of what they would call a sane point of view. That is the one thing common to [[Hobbes]] and [[Hegel]], to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Bergson]], to [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[William James]]. A man had to believe something that no normal man would believe, if it were suddenly propounded to his simplicity; as that law is above right, or right is outside reason, or things are only as we think them, or everything is relative to a reality that is not there. The modern philosopher claims, like a sort of confidence man, that if we will grant him this, the rest will be easy; he will straighten out the world, if he is allowed to give this one twist to the mind...

Against all this the philosophy of St. Thomas stands founded on the universal common conviction that eggs are eggs. The Hegelian may say that an egg is really a hen, because it is a part of an endless process of Becoming; the Berkelian may hold that [[poached egg]]s only exist as a dream exists, since it is quite as easy to call the dream the cause of the eggs as the eggs the cause of the dream; the Pragmatist may believe that we get the best out of scrambled eggs by forgetting that they ever were eggs, and only remembering the scramble. But no pupil of St. Thomas needs to addle his brains in order adequately to addle his eggs; to put his head at any peculiar angle in looking at eggs, or squinting at eggs, or winking the other eye in order to see a new simplification of eggs. The Thomist stands in the broad daylight of the brotherhood of men, in their common consciousness that eggs are not hens or dreams or mere practical assumptions; but things attested by the Authority of the Senses, which is from God.|Chesterton, ''St. Thomas Aquinas'', p. 147.}}

==History==
J. A. Weisheipl emphasizes that within the [[Dominican Order]] the history of Thomism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas:
{{quote|Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927202339/http://domcentral.org/blog/the-revival-of-thomism-an-historical-survey-weisheipl/ |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} “The Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, ” James Weisheipl, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican Thomism may be derived from the [[list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]].

Outside the [[Dominican Order]] Thomism has had varying fortunes leading some to periodize it historically or thematically. Weisheipl distinguishes "wide" Thomism, which includes those who claim to follow the spirit and basic insights of Aquinas and manifest an evident dependence on his texts, from "eclectic" Thomism which includes those with a willingness to allow the influence of other philosophical and theological systems in order to relativize the principles and conclusions of traditional Thomism. [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] gives an historic division of Thomism including 1) the period of Aquinas and his first followers from the 13th to 15th centuries, a second Thomism from the 16th to 18th centuries, and a Neo-Thomism from the 19th to 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;John Haldane, 1998. "Thomism". In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 18, 2013, from http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/N067&lt;/ref&gt; One might justifiably articulate other historical divisions on the basis of shifts in perspective on Aquinas' work including the period immediately following Aquinas' canonization in 1325, the period following the Council of Trent, and the period after the Second Vatican Council. Romanus Cessario thinks it better not to identify intervals of time or periods within the larger history of Thomism because Thomists have addressed such a broad variety of issues and in too many geographical areas to permit such divisions.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Thomism'', Catholic University of America Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Thomistic School===
The first period of Thomism stretches from Aquinas' teaching activity beginning in 1256 at Paris to Cologne, Orvieto, Viterbo, Rome, and Naples until his canonization in 1325. In this period his doctrines "were both attacked and defended" as for example after his death (1274) the condemnations of 1277, 1284 and 1286 were counteracted by the General Chapters of the [[Dominican Order]] and other disciples who came to Aquinas' defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Thomistic School, Frederick J.

===''Aeterni Patris'' to Vatican II===
{{main|Neo-Scholasticism}}
The Thomist revival that began in the mid-19th century, sometimes called "neo-scholasticism" or "neo-Thomism," can be traced to figures such as ''[[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Angelicum]]'' professor [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] [[Josef Kleutgen]], and [[Giovanni Maria Cornoldi]], and [[Secular clergy|secular priest]] [[Gaetano Sanseverino]]. This movement received impetus from [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' of 1879. Generally the revival accepts the interpretative tradition of Aquinas' great commentators such as [[Jean Capréolus|Capréolus]], [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]], and [[John of St. Thomas]]. Its focus, however, is less exegetical and more concerned with carrying out the program of deploying a rigorously worked out system of Thomistic metaphysics in a wholesale critique of modern philosophy. Other seminal figures in the early part of the century include [[Martin Grabmann]] (1875-1949) and Amato Masnovo (1880-1955). The movement's core philosophical commitments are summarized in "[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/24Thomisticpart2.htm Twenty-Four Thomistic Theses]" approved by [[Pope Pius X]].&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thomistic tradition (Part 1)|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html|author=Feser, Edward|date=15 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129133527/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-i.html|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the twentieth century ''[[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Angelicum]]'' professors [[Edouard Hugon]], [[Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange]] among others, carried on Leo's call for a Thomist revival. Their approach is reflected in many of the manuals&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Thomas Aquinas (1952), edd., Walter Farrell, [[Order of Preachers|OP]], [[Master of Sacred Theology|STM]], and Martin J. Healy, [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|STD]], ''My Way of Life:  Pocket Edition of St. Thomas&amp;mdash;The Summa Simplified for Everyone'', Brooklyn, NY:  Confraternity of the Precious Blood.&lt;/ref&gt; and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before [[Vatican II]].

While the [[Second Vatican Council]] took place from 1962-1965 [[Cornelio Fabro]] was already able to write in 1949 that the century of revival with its urgency to provide a synthetic systematization and defense of Aquinas' thought was coming to an end. Fabro looked forward to a more constructive period in which the original context of Aquinas' thought would be explored.&lt;ref&gt;''La nozione Metafisica di Participazione'', Cornelio Fabro, Preface to the second edition, 5; https://www.scribd.com/doc/90016006/Fabro-La-Nozione-Metafisica-Di-Partecipazione{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed 30 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Scholastic Thomism===
[[Neo-Scholastic Thomism]]&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; identifies with the philosophical and theological tradition stretching back to the time of St. Thomas. In the nineteenth century authors such as [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]] focused not only on exegesis of the historical Aquinas but also on the articulation of a rigorous system of orthodox Thomism to be used as an instrument of critique of contemporary thought. Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, Neo-Scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called "[[strict observance Thomism]]."&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; A discussion of recent and current Neo-Scholastic Thomism can be found in ''La Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti'' (2002) by Battista Mondin, which includes such figures as [[Martin Grabmann]], [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908–1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sofia-vanni-rovighi_(Dizionario-di-filosofia)/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004001024/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sofia-vanni-rovighi_(Dizionario-di-filosofia)/ |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 17 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelio Fabro]] (1911–1995), Carlo Giacon (1900–1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004001026/http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 9 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomáš Týn]] (1950–1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925–2012), Leo Elders (b. 1926) and [[Ventimiglia Giovanni|Giovanni Ventimiglia]] (b. 1964) among others.

===Cracow Circle Thomism&lt;!--'Cracow Circle Thomism' redirects here--&gt;===
'''Cracow Circle Thomism'''&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; (named after [[Cracow]]) has been called "the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars."&lt;ref name="segr-did2.fmag.unict.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313094322/http://segr-did2.fmag.unict.it/~polphil/polphil/Cracow/Cracow.html |archivedate=13 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Circle was founded by a group of philosophers and theologians that in distinction to more traditional Neo-Scholastic Thomism embraced modern formal logic as an analytical tool for traditional Thomist philosophy and theology.&lt;ref name="segr-did2.fmag.unict.it"/&gt; Inspired by the logical clarity of Aquinas, members of the Circle held both philosophy and theology to contain "propositions with truth-values…a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment etc." "The Cracow Circle set about investigating and where possible improving this logical structure with the most advanced logical tools available at the time, namely those of modern mathematical logic, then called 'logistic'." &lt;ref&gt;" Bocheński and Balance: System and History in Analytic Philosophy", Peter Simons, Studies in East European Thought 55 (2003), 281–297, Reprinted in: Edgar Morscher, Otto Neumaier and Peter Simons, Ein Philosoph mit "Bodenhaftung": Zu Leben und Werk von Joseph M.

Bocheński completed a doctorate in theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in 1934 where he taught logic until 1940. Other members included Jan Salamucha and Jan F. Drewnowski.

===Existential Thomism&lt;!--'Existential Thomism' redirects here--&gt;===
[[Étienne Gilson]] (1884–1978), the key proponent of '''existential Thomism''',&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; tended to emphasize the importance of historical exegesis but also to deemphasize Aquinas's continuity with the Aristotelian tradition, and like [[Cornelio Fabro]] of the Neo-scholastic school, to highlight the originality of Aquinas's doctrine of being as existence. He was also critical of the Neo-Scholastics' focus on the tradition of the commentators, and given what he regarded as their insufficient emphasis on being or existence accused them of "[[essentialism]]" (to allude to the other half of Aquinas's distinction between being and essence). Gilson's reading of Aquinas as putting forward a distinctively "Christian philosophy" tended, at least in the view of his critics, to blur Aquinas's distinction between philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Gilson wrote about the topic of [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] in a [http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/ chapter of his book ''Le Thomisme''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605082527/http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/scholastic/gilson/ |date=5 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Maritain]] (1882–1973) introduced into Thomistic metaphysics the notion that philosophical reflection begins with an "intuition of being," and in ethics and social philosophy sought to harmonize Thomism with [[personalism]] and pluralistic democracy. Though "existential Thomism" was sometimes presented as a counterpoint to modern [[existentialism]], the main reason for the label is the emphasis this approach puts on Aquinas's doctrine of existence. Contemporary proponents include [[Joseph Owens (Redemptorist)|Joseph Owens]] and [[John F. X. Knasas]].&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

===Transcendental Thomism&lt;!--'Transcendental Thomism' redirects here--&gt;===
Unlike the first three schools mentioned above, '''transcendental Thomism''',&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; associated with [[Joseph Maréchal]] (1878–1944), [[Karl Rahner]] (1904–84), and [[Bernard Lonergan]] (1904–84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] subject-centered approach to knowledge in general, and [[Kantian]] [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular. It seems fair to say that most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event been far more influential among theologians than among philosophers.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

In particular, it seeks to make use of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] method of philosophical analysis associated with [[Edmund Husserl]] and the [[ethical personalism]] of writers like [[Max Scheler]] in articulating the Thomist conception of the human person. Its best-known proponent is [[Karol Wojtyla]] (1920–2005), who went on to become Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

However, unlike transcendental Thomism, the metaphysics of Lublin Thomism places priority on existence (as opposed to essence), making it an existential Thomism that demonstrates consonance with the Thomism of Étienne Gilson. It should be noted that the phenomenological concerns of the Lublin school are not metaphysical in nature as this would constitute [[idealism]]. Rather, they are considerations which are brought into relation with central positions of the school, such as when dealing with modern science, its epistemological value, and its relation to metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Jaroszynski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |title=A Brief Overview of Lublin Thomism |publisher=Hyoomik.com |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194904/http://www.hyoomik.com/lublin/jarosz1.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical Thomism===
{{main|Analytical Thomism}}
[[Analytical Thomism]]&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; described by [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]], its key proponent, as "a broad philosophical approach that brings into mutual relationship the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the concepts and concerns shared by Aquinas and his followers" (from the article on "analytical Thomism" in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', edited by Ted Honderich). By "recent English-speaking philosophy" Haldane means the [[Analytical philosophy|analytical tradition]] founded by thinkers like [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], which tends to dominate academic philosophy in the English-speaking world. [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001) and her husband [[Peter Geach]] are sometimes considered the first "analytical Thomists," though (like most writers to whom this label has been applied) they did not describe themselves in these terms, and as Haldane's somewhat vague expression "mutual relationship" indicates, there does not seem to be any set of doctrines held in common by all analytical Thomists. What they do have in common seems to be that they are philosophers trained in the analytic tradition who happen to be interested in Aquinas in some way; and the character of their "analytical Thomism" is determined by whether it tends to stress the "analytical" side of analytical Thomism, or the "Thomism" side, or, alternatively, attempts to emphasize both sides equally.&lt;ref name="Feser2"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Edward Feser]] |title=The Thomistic tradition, Part II|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129012252/http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2009/10/thomistic-tradition-part-ii.html|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf The introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526201136/https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Analytical_Thomism_Intro.pdf |date=26 May 2011 }} to [http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 Paterson &amp; Pugh's book on Analytical Thomism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404000911/http://www.worldcat.org/title/analytical-thomism-traditions-in-dialogue/oclc/61211285 |date=4 April 2016 }} is available gratis online.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Togdan Rinpoche''' (born in 1938) was enthroned as the leader of [[Drikung Kagyu]] lineage of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] for [[Ladakh]] in 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Heritage Ladakh Himalaya|last=Singh Jina|first=Prem|publisher=Kalpaz Publication|year=2009|isbn=978-8178357454|location=|pages=209|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and serves today as the Head Lama for all Tibetan Buddhist Lineages in Ladakh. Rinpoche is one of the most senior Lamas for the [[Drikung Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages of Tibetan Buddhism.

In addition to being an accomplished spiritual leader, Rinpoche played an active role in politics from the 1960s when he was elected as the first leader of the ''Ladakh Action Committee,'' until 2003 when he resigned from his post as the ''Minister of State for Ladakh Affairs and Planning''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lotuskingtrust.com/?page_id=74|title=Lotus King Trust - H.E.

}}'''Tongan Guanzhi''' ({{zh|t=同安觀志}}; {{CJKV|j=Dōan Kanshi}}) was a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The True Dharma Eye: Zen Master Dogen's Three Hundred Koans|last=Loori|first=John Daido|last2=Tanahashi|first2=Kazuaki|ISBN=978-1-59030-465-5|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=2009|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, he is considered to be the student of [[Tongan Daopi]]. However, the basis for this belief comes from a text by Huihong called the ''Chanlin sengbao zhuan'' (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan), which was completed in 1119, many years after Tongan's death.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;

==History==
Tongan Guanzhi's name first appears in the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, he is not listed as a student of Tongan Daopi. In fact, it states Daopi has no students at all. The ''Transmission of the Lamp'' instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of [[Tongan Wei]], in turn a student of [[Jufeng Puman]], with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous [[Dongshan Liangjie]].

Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the ''Transmission of the Lamp'', and neither with much information. However, [[Dayang Jingxuan]], who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the ''Transmission of the Lamp'' as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of ''Transmission of the Lamp'', and as such it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage.

This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=93–94,210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Topical logic''' is the [[logic]] of '''topical argument''', a branch of [[rhetoric]] developed in the [[Late Antique]] period from earlier works, such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''Topica''. It consists of [[heuristics]] for developing [[argument]]s, which are in the first place plausible rather than rigorous, from commonplaces (''topoi'' or ''loci''). In other words, therefore, it consists of standardized ways of thinking up debating techniques from existing, thought-through positions. The actual practice of topical argument was much developed by Roman lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero took the theory of Aristotle to be an aspect of rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Long, ''From Epicurus to Epictetus: Studies in Hellenistic and Roman Philosophy'' (2006), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; As such it belongs to ''inventio'' in the classic fivefold division of rhetoric.

The standard classical work on topical logic was the ''De Topicis Differentiae'' (On Topical Differentiae) by [[Boethius]]. ''Differentiae'' refer to [[case study|case analysis]], being the differentiations used to distinguish the cases into which a question is divided. Besides Aristotle and Cicero, Boethius built on [[Themistius]].&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, ''Classical Rhetoric &amp; Its Christian &amp; Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1999), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; In terminology, the Greek ''axioma'' and ''topos'' in Boethius became the Latin ''maxima propositio'' ([[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], universal truth) and ''locus''. 

In the [[Middle Ages]] topical logic became a theory of [[inference]], for which the name "axiomatic topics" has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Kretzmann]], [[Anthony Kenny]], [[Jan Pinborg]], ''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600'' (1988), pp. 111-2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abelard]] wanted to complete a theory of [[Logical consequence|entailment]] by invoking the ''loci'' in Boethius to fill in conditionals, a flawed if bold development.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Martin, ''Logic'', pp. 172-3 in Jeffrey E. Brower, Kevin Guilfoy (editors), ''The Cambridge Companion to Abelard'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]], in his ''De locis'', developed the ideas of Boethius.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peter-spain/&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''De inventione dialectica'' of [[Rodolphus Agricola]] (1479) made large claims for this method, as an aspect of [[dialectic]] (traditionally contrasted with rhetoric) subordinated to ''inventio''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. Conley, ''Rhetoric in the European Tradition'' (1994), pp. 125-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise relationship of "dialectic" and "rhetoric" remained vexed well into the sixteenth century, hinging on the role assigned to ''loci''. It was expounded in different fashions by [[Philipp Melanchthon]] and [[Petrus Ramus]].&lt;ref&gt;Harold J. Berman, ''Law and Revolution, II: The Impact of the Protestant Reformations on the Western Legal Tradition'' (2006), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate fed into the later development of [[Ramism]].

'''Enno Friedrich Wichard Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff''' (22 December 1848 &amp;ndash; 25 September 1931) was a German [[Classical philology|classical philologist]]. Wilamowitz, as he is known in scholarly circles, was a renowned authority on [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|its literature]].

== Life ==

=== Youth ===
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was born in [[Markowice, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Markowitz (Markowice)]], a small village near [[Inowrocław|Hohensalza (Inowrocław)]], in the then [[Province of Posen]] (now part of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]]), to a [[Germanization|Germanized]] family of distant [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry. His father, a [[Prussian Junker]], was Arnold Wilamowitz, of [[Szlachta]] origin and using the [[Ogończyk coat of arms]], while his mother was Ulrika, née Calbo. The couple settled in a small manor confiscated from a local noble in 1836. The Prussian part of their name, von Moellendorf, was acquired in 1813, when Prussian field marshal [[Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf]] adopted Ulrich's ancestors. Wilamowitz, a third child, grew up in [[East Prussia]].

In 1867 Wilamowitz passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' at the renowned boarding school at [[Schulpforta]].

=== Studies ===
Until 1869 Wilamowitz studied [[Classical Philology]] at the [[University of Bonn]]. His teachers, [[Otto Jahn]] and [[Hermann Usener]], had a formative influence on him. Willamowitz's relationship with Usener was strained. He developed a lifelong rivalry with his fellow student [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and a close friendship with his contemporary [[Hermann Diels]]. Together with Diels, he moved to [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1869, where he graduated as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] [[cum laude]] in 1870. After voluntary service in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he embarked on a study tour to Italy and Greece.

=== Conflict with Nietzsche and Wagner ===
Even before he gained a professorial title, Wilamowitz was a member of a scholarly dispute about Nietzsche's ''[[Birth of Tragedy]]'' that attracted much attention. In 1872–73, he published two unusually aggressive polemics ([[German language|German]]: ''"Zukunftsphilologie"'', i.e. ''"Philology of the future"''), which strongly attacked Nietzsche (then Professor at the [[University of Basel]]) and Professor [[Erwin Rohde]] ([[University of Kiel]]). [[Richard Wagner]], whose views on art had influenced Nietzsche and Rohde, reacted by publishing an [[open letter]] and Rohde wrote a damning response. The issue at stake was the deprecation of [[Euripides]], on whom Nietzsche blamed the destruction of [[Greek tragedy]]. Wilamowitz saw the methods of his adversaries as an attack on the basic tenets of scientific thought, unmasking them as enemies of the [[scientific method]]. His polemic was considered as Classical philology's reply to Nietzsche's challenge.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Silk &amp; [[J. P. Stern]], ''Nietzsche on Tragedy'', Cambridge University Press, 1981 pp.90-106&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 80 when Wilamowitz wrote his memoirs, he saw the conflict with Nietzsche less passionately, but did not retract the essential points of his critique. He stated that he had not fully realised at the time that Nietzsche was not interested in scientific understanding but rather in Wagner's musical drama, but also that he was nevertheless right to take his position against Nietzsche's "rape of historical facts and all [[historical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wilt Aden Schröder: "Fünf Briefe des Verlegers Eduard Eggers an Wilamowitz, betreffend die Zukunftsphilologie! und die Analecta Euripidea", in: ''Eikasmos'' '''12''' (2001:367-383) p. 373f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greifswald ===
[[File:Wilamowitz Young.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wilamowitz in Greifswald (1878)]]
In 1875, he gained a professorial title for his study ''Analecta Euripidea''. In the same year he gave his first public academic lecture in Berlin. In 1876, he was employed as ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) for Classical Philology at [[University of Greifswald|Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität]] at [[Greifswald]]. During this period, he also married Marie Mommsen, the eldest daughter of [[Theodor Mommsen]], and published ''Homeric Studies'' (''Homerische Studien'').

=== Göttingen ===
In 1883, he took a further professorial position at [[Göttingen University|Georg-August-Universität]] in [[Göttingen]]. Here, he continued to teach Classical Philology but also gave replacement lectures in [[Ancient History]]. His influence ensured the employment of his Greifswald colleague, [[Julius Wellhausen]], in Göttingen. In 1891, he became vice-chancellor of the university, and he was appointed a member of Göttingen's Royal Academy of Sciences one year later. When Wilamowitz left Göttingen, he was succeeded by [[Georg Kaibel]], a close associate from his student days and his successor at Greifswald.

=== Berlin ===
In 1897, with the support of his friend Diels, Wilamowitz was offered a position at the Royal [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] at Berlin, as successor to [[Ernst Curtius]]. He stayed until his retirement in 1921. In 1915, he was appointed chancellor of the university for one year. Together with Diels, he founded the Berlin Institute for Ancient Studies (''Institut für Altertumskunde'') in 1897. His public lectures on subjects of [[Classical antiquity]], which took place twice a week, attracted large audiences.

=== Teaching activities and memberships ===
In 1891, Wilamowitz was elected a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and he was a full member from 1899. In 1902 he took the academy's presidency. As a member of the Göttingen academy, he strongly encouraged the publication of the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]''. From 1897 he also worked as a member to the academy's Commission for [[Patristics]]. In 1894 he was elected full member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. He also was editor of the series ''Philologische Untersuchungen'' from 1880 to 1925.

Further, Wilamowitz taught as a guest lecturer in [[Oxford]] (1908) and [[Uppsala]] (1912), was a corresponding member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] (1909) and the Scientific Society of [[Lund]] (1921).

===''Inscriptiones Graecae''===
During his presidency of the Prussian Academy, Wilamowitz oversaw the continuation of [[August Böckh]]'s and [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]'s publication series, the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''. Wilamowitz had a formative influence on the further development of that project, which he directed until his death.

=== World War I ===
Wilamowitz was an initiator of the memorandum ''Erklärung der Hochschullehrer des Deutschen Reiches'' ("Declaration by the University Teachers of the German Reich"), in which 3,016 signatories supported German participation in the First World War. Shortly after, he also signed the ''[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]'', from which he distanced himself later. In 1914, his son, Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who was also active as a classical philologist, fell in the battle of [[Dęblin|Ivangorod]]. The memorandum appeared a few days later.

=== Family ===
In 1878 he married Maria Mommsen, the eldest daughter of the famous [[ancient historian]], [[Theodor Mommsen]], whom he actively assisted in the completion of his ''Roman History''.

Wilamowitz spent his last years in seclusion, suffering from severe kidney problems. He died in Berlin on 25 September 1931, having been in a coma for a short time. He is buried in his native village, along with his wife, Maria (1855–1936), and their only son, Tycho. He also had a daughter, Dorothea Freifrau Hiller von Gaertringen, wife of archaeologist [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], who died on 24 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UGv24_aqFs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#PPA92,M1 Greek Literature: Greek literature in the classical period]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Wilamowitz is one of the central figures of 19th and 20th century Classical philology. As a great authority of the literature and history of [[Ancient Greece]], Wilamowitz took a stance against traditional methodology and [[textual criticism]]. As a representative of Postclassicism, he concentrated less on [[literary history]] but rather aimed to extract biographical information on the respective authors from the preserved texts. Thus, he employed historical perspectives to serve philology. Apart from his seminal general works (''Greek Literature from Antiquity'', ''Hellenistic Poetry''), he published numerous detailed studies of [[Euripides]], [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Pindar]] and [[Aristotle]]. As a scientific organiser, he was also responsible for the publication of important standard-setting source material publications, such as ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''.

He also passionately supported the preservation of Classical education in the German school system.

Notable pupils of his include [[Felix Jacoby]], [[Karl Mittelhaus]], [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], [[Eduard Fraenkel]], [[Werner Jaeger]], [[Johannes Geffcken]], [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], [[Eduard Schwartz]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[Paul Friedländer (philologist)|Paul Friedländer]], [[Friedrich Solmsen]] and [[Johannes Sykutris]].

In recent decades, the American scholar [[William M. Calder III]] has been publishing a series of important documents about and by Wilamowitz, including much of his correspondence with Diels, [[Eduard Norden]], [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], [[Paul Wendland]], and others.

[[File:Waarom-ik-geen-christen-ben.jpg|thumb|''Why I Am Not a Christian'' book cover]]

'''''Why I Am Not a Christian''''' is an [[essay]] by the [[British people|British]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]]. Originally a talk given 6 March 1927 at [[Battersea]] Town Hall, under the auspices of the South London Branch of the [[National Secular Society]], it was published that year as a [[pamphlet]] and has been republished several times in English and in translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Chapman | first = Simon |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/320/7242/1152/a |title=A book that changed me |accessdate=27 August 2007 |work=[[British Medical Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Russell begins by defining what he means by the term [[Christian]] and sets out to explain why he does not "believe in God and in immortality" and why he does not "think that [[Christ]] was the best and wisest of men", the two things he identifies as "essential to anybody calling himself a Christian". He considers a number of [[logic]]al arguments for the [[existence of God]] and goes into specifics about [[Christian theology]]. He argues ''[[Reductio ad absurdum|ad absurdum]]'' against the "[[Teleological argument|argument from design]]", and favors [[evolutionism|Darwin's theories]].

Russell also expresses doubt over the [[Historicity of Jesus|historical existence of Jesus]] and questions the morality of religion, which is, in his view, predominantly based on fear.

==History==
The first German edition was published in 1932 by ''Kreis der Freunde monistischen Schrifttums'', a [[Monism|monist]] association in [[Dresden]] inspired by [[Ernst Haeckel]]. In 1957 [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] preferred Russell over the then more trendy [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and published the essay and further texts referring to the background of ''[[The Bertrand Russell Case]]''. Russell had been denied a professorship in New York for his political and secular views and his tolerance for the [[Lesbian until graduation|gay till graduation]] version of homosexuality. Some countries banned the book, including South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;"Literarische Umschau" - E. Katzmann, Karl Ude [ed.]: ''Welt und Wort. Literarische Monatsschrift'', 14 (1959), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced version has been republished in various editions since the 1960s. The [[New York Public Library]] listed it among the most influential books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/events/booklist.html New York Public Library website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The title has inspired other books in a [[snowclone]] fashion. [[William E. Connolly]]'s ''Why I Am Not a Secularist'' (2000) deals directly with various aspects of Russell's argument. He sees Russell's approach as an attempt to exchange a previous center of gravity in public life, based on a Jewish-Christian heritage, with another that is secular-minded. Connolly doubts this exchange of one one-fits-all authoritative approach to public ethics and public reason for a new one that all "reasonable" citizens should abide by.&lt;ref name="wec2"&gt;William E. Connolly, ''Why I Am Not a Secularist'', Minneapolis: U of Minnesota Press, 1999, {{ISBN|9780816633319}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;5ff&lt;/ref&gt; He asks instead for new forms of public engagement that allow for more and more varied perspectives to interact (and restrain) each other. He counts on various important philosophers, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and [[Judith Butler]] to [[Michael J. Shapiro]] and [[Michel Foucault]] to have provided such views. Connolly argues that Russell-style secularism, although admirable in its values, may undercut its own goals of freedom and diversity as a result of a narrow and intolerant understanding of the public sphere and reason.&lt;ref name="wec2" /&gt;
