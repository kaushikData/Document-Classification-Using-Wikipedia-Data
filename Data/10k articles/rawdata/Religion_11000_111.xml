'''After the Development of Agriculture''' ('''A.D.A.''') is a system for counting years forward from 8000 [[Common Era|BCE]]. It was developed in feminist [[thealogy]]. It is not often used.

Whether [[history of agriculture|agriculture began]] 8,000 years before the Common Era may not be agreed with among scholars, but it is close to some estimates. It also did not begin in all places at the same time.

The A.D.A. calendar system is not often used.

==History==
Anubhava Mantapa was an academy of mystics, saints and philosophers of the ‘veerashaiva’ faith in the 12th century. It was the fountainhead of all religious and philosophical thought pertaining to the Human Values, Ethics. It was presided over by the mystic Allama Prabhu and numerous Sharanas from all over Karnataka and other parts of India were participants. The Sharanas belong to the lower strata of the society basically called the Shuydras and the Dalits in the Varna System of Hinduism. Sudras and Dalits where provided equal opportunities by the social reformer Basaveshwara and made them to depend on their own work, think rational and contribute back to society through Dashoha. This institution was also the fountainhead of the Vachana literature which was used as the vector to propagate Sharana’s views and philosophical thought. Other Sharana’s and Sharanes theosophy like Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna were participants in the Anubhava Mantapa.It was a unique socio spiritual revolution to establish an egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ಅನುಭವ ಮಂಟಪ|url=http://www.prajavani.net/news/article/2015/11/30/369391.html|date=30 November 2015|accessdate=15 July 2018|language=kn|website=www.prajavani.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anubhava Mantapa worked to build a Vibrant casteless, creedless Society with full of Human Values propagated through Vachanas

The movement taken over by Basava through Anubhava Mantapa became the basis of a sect of Human values. It gave rise to a system of ethics and education at once simple and exalted. It sought to inspire ideals of social and religious freedom, such as no previous faith of Earth had done. In the medieval age which was characterized by inter-communal jealousy, it helped to shed a ray of light and faith on the homes and hearts of people. But the spirit soon disappeared after the intermarriage that Basava facilitated came to an abrupt end when the couple were punished for the same by the King. The dream of the [[classless society]] was shaken and Basava soon realised the meek picture and left for Kudala Sangama and a year later died.

The movement gave a literature of considerable value in the vernacular language of the country, the literature which attained the dignity of a classical tongue. Its aim was the elimination of the barriers of caste and to remove untouchability, raising the untouchable to the equal of the high born. The sanctity of family relations and the improvement in the status of womanhood were striven for while at the same time the importance of rites and rituals, of fasts and pilgrimages was reduced. It encouraged learning and contemplation of God by means of love and faith. The excesses of polytheism were deplored and the idea of monotheism was encouraged. The movement tended, in many ways, to raise the nation generally to a higher level of capacity both in thought and action. However, the sect failed to bring about a completely classless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ಅನುಭವ ಮಂಟಪ ಮಹಾವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯಾನಿಲಯವಿದ್ದಂತೆ:|url=http://sanjevani.com/sanjevani/ಅನುಭವ-ಮಂಟಪ-ಮಹಾವಿಶ್ವವಿದ್ಯ/|accessdate=24 September 2017|language=kn|website=sanjevani.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Marc Aurel Stein''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|KCIE|FRAS|FBA|size=100%}}
&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obituary, Sir Aurel Stein, K.C.I.E., F.B.A |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |  date= 19 February 1944 |pages=216–217 |volume=153 |doi=10.1038/153216a0 |quote=  |last1=Gray |first1=Basil |issue=3877}}&lt;/ref&gt;
({{lang-hu|Stein Márk Aurél}}; 26 November 1862 – 26 October 1943) was a Hungarian-born British [[archaeologist]], primarily known for his explorations and archaeological discoveries in Central Asia. He was also a professor at [[India]]n universities.

Stein was also an ethnographer, geographer, linguist and surveyor. His collection of books and manuscripts taken from [[Dunhuang]] caves is important for the study of the history of [[Central Asia]] and the art and literature of [[Buddhism]]. He wrote several volumes on his expeditions and discoveries which include ''Ancient Khotan'', ''Serindia'' and ''Innermost Asia''.

==Early life==
Stein was born to Nathan Stein and Anna Hirschler, a Jewish couple residing in [[Budapest]] in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. His parents and his sister retained their Jewish faith but Stein and his brother, Ernst Eduard, were baptised as [[Lutheran]]s, apparently to free them from the anti-semitism which would have denied them access to education and advancement.{{sfnb|Mirsky|1977| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3YKfArws2QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-semitism&amp;f=false 3-4]}} At home the family spoke German and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the language of [[Hungarian nationalism|Hungarian nationalist revival]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Colquhoun, A. R., &amp; Colquhoun, E. M. C. (1914). [https://books.google.com/books?id=mptnAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Whirlpool+of+Europe:+Austria-Hungary+and+the+Habsburgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6uJXp8q7JAhUETSYKHd70DsEQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Whirlpool%20of%20Europe%3A%20Austria-Hungary%20and%20the%20Habsburgs&amp;f=false The whirlpool of Europe, Austria-Hungary and the Habsburgs]. New York: Dodd, Mead.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stein was proud of this  heritage for the rest of his life. He attended Catholic and Lutheran gymnasiums in Budapest, where he mastered Greek, Latin, French, and English before going on for advanced study at Universities of [[University of Vienna|Vienna]], [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Tubingen|Tübingen]]. He graduated in Sanskrit and [[Persian language|Persian]] and received his Ph.D. from Tübingen in 1883.{{sfnb|Mirsky|1977| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3YKfArws2QC&amp;q=Magyar#v=snippet&amp;q=Magyar&amp;f=false 5-6]}}

In 1884 he went to England to study oriental languages and archaeology. He became a [[United Kingdom|British]] citizen in 1904&lt;ref&gt;Annabel Walker. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/lotw/1.html Stein, Sir (Marc) Aurel (1862–1943)], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 26 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and made his famous expeditions with British sponsorship. In 1887, Stein went to India, where he joined the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] as Registrar. Later, between 1888 and 1899, he was the Principal of [[Oriental College, Lahore]].&lt;ref name="bio – British Academy" /&gt; Stein was influenced by [[Sven Hedin]]'s 1898 work ''Through Asia''. Realizing the importance of Central Asian history and archaeology he sent a proposal to the government to explore, map and study the people of Central Asia. In May 1900 he received the approval to lead an expedition to Chinese Turkestan which was strategically located in High Asia where the Russians and Germans were already taking interest.

==Expeditions==
[[File:AurelSteinWithDog.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Aurel Stein, with his dog and research team, in the [[Tarim Basin]]]]
Stein made four major expeditions to [[Central Asia]]—in 1900–1901, 1906–1908, 1913–1916 and 1930.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. 15th Edition. (1977). Vol. IX, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; He brought to light the hidden treasure of a great civilization which by then was practically lost to the world. One of his significant finds during his first journey during 1900–1901 was the [[Taklamakan]] Desert oasis of [[Dandan Oilik]] where he was able to uncover a number of relics. During his third expedition in 1913–1916, he excavated at [[Khara-Khoto]].&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook to the Collections of Sir Aurel Stein in the UK | last1=Wang | first1= Helen (ed.)| author1link=Helen Wang | last2=Perkins | first2 = John (ed.) |year= 2008|publisher= [[British Museum]]|location= |isbn=978 086159 9776|issn=  1747-3640|pages=42–44 |url= https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Stein%20Handbook%20final(131108)a.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Library]]'s Stein collection of Chinese, Tibetan and Tangut manuscripts, Prakrit wooden tablets, and documents in [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] and Eastern Turkic is the result of his travels through central Asia during the 1920s and 1930s. Stein discovered manuscripts in the previously lost [[Tocharian languages]] of the [[Tarim Basin]] at [[Miran (Xinjiang)|Miran]] and other oasis towns, and recorded numerous archaeological sites especially in [[Iran]] and [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]].

When Stein visited Khotan he was able to render in Persian a portion of the Shahnama after he came across a local reading the Shahnama in Turki.&lt;ref name="Mirsky1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeannette Mirsky|title=Sir Aurel Stein: Archaeological Explorer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3YKfArws2QC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=turki+merchants+gifts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgUahUKEwjy8ZWIhLfIAhWFGT4KHdxlC3w#v=onepage&amp;q=turki%20merchants%20gifts&amp;f=false|date=1 October 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-53177-9|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1901 Stein was responsible for exposing forgeries of [[Islam Akhun]].

Stein's greatest discovery was made at the [[Mogao Caves]] also known as "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", near [[Dunhuang]] in 1907. It was there that he discovered a printed copy of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', the world's oldest printed text, dating to AD 868, along with 40,000 other scrolls (all removed by gradually winning the confidence and bribing the [[Taoist]] caretaker).&lt;ref&gt;Deuel, Leo. 1970.

He was knighted for his efforts, but Chinese nationalists dubbed him a burglar and staged protests against him.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Justin (2010) [https://www.academia.edu/772652/Confronting_Indiana_Jones_Chinese_Nationalism_Historical_Imperialism_and_the_Criminalization_of_Aurel_Stein_and_the_Raiders_of_Dunhuang_1899-1944 "Confronting Indiana Jones: Chinese Nationalism, Historical Imperialism, and the Criminalization of Aurel Stein and the Raiders of Dunhuang, 1899–1944"], pp. 65–90 in ''China on the Margins''. Sherman Cochran and Paul G. Pickowicz (eds.).

During his expedition of 1906–1908  while surveying in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] of [[western China]], Stein suffered frostbite and lost several toes on his right foot.

When he was resting from his extended journeys into Central Asia, he spent most of his time living in a tent in the spectacularly beautiful alpine meadow called [[Mohanmarg]] which lies at the mouth atop the [[Sind Valley]] where from he translated ''[[Rajatarangini]] '' from [[Sanskrit]] to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykashmirimages.com/news-jkmhc-trekkers-trek-mohanmarg-60614.aspx |title=JKMHC trekkers trek Mohanmarg |publisher=dailykashmirimages.com |accessdate=2014-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525200257/http://www.dailykashmirimages.com/news-jkmhc-trekkers-trek-mohanmarg-60614.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siraurelstein.org.uk/illustrated.html|title=The illustrated Rajatarangini|publisher=siraurelstein.org|accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein was a lifelong bachelor, but was always accompanied by a dog named "Dash" (of which there were seven).&lt;ref&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/archives/news18/idpnews_18.a4d#3 IDP Newsletter Issue No. 18].

The fourth expedition to Central Asia, however, ended in failure. Stein did not publish any account, but others have written of the frustrations and rivalries between British and American interests  in China, between Harvard's [[Fogg Museum]] and the British Museum, and finally, between [[Paul J. Sachs]] and [[Langdon Warner]], the two Harvard sponsors of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brysac, Shareen Blair |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9711/abstracts/stein.html |title=Last of the "Foreign Devils"|journal=Archaeology|volume =50 |issue=6|date=November–December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein died in [[Kabul]] on 26 October 1943 and is buried in Kabul's British Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;North, Andrew. (2012-06-09) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18369101 Afghanistan's 'graveyard of foreigners']. Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2014-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Game==
Stein, as well as his rivals [[Sven Hedin]], Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] and [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], were active players in the British-Russian struggle for influence in Central Asia, the so-called [[Great Game]]. Their explorations were supported by the British and Russian Empires as they filled in the remaining "blank spots" on the maps, providing valuable information and creating "[[spheres of influence]]" for archaeological exploration as they did for political influence.{{sfnb|Meyer|Brysac|1999|pp=367-368}}

The art objects he collected are divided between the [[British Museum]], the [[British Library]], the [[Srinagar]] Museum, and the [[National Museum, New Delhi]].

==Honours==
Stein received a number of honours during his career. In 1909, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]] by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] 'for his extensive explorations in Central Asia, and in particular his archaeological work'.&lt;ref name="RGS – Gold Medal Recipients"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold Medal Recipients |url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |website=Medals and Awards |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=26 November 2014 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, he was awarded the first Campbell Memorial Gold Medal by the [[Asiatic Society of Mumbai|Royal Asiatic Society of Bombay]]. He was awarded a number of other Gold Medals: the Gold Medal of the [[Société de Géographie]] in 1923; the ''Grande Médaille d’or'' of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1932; and the Gold Medal of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1935. In 1934, he was awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal of [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Sir Aurel Stein’s Medals at the Royal Geographical Society"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Sarah|last2=Wang|first2=Helen|author2link=Helen Wang|title=Sir Aurel Stein’s Medals at the Royal Geographical Society|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/10-Strong-Wang%20pp.pdf|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=26 November 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910 [[King's Birthday Honours]], he was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire]] (CIE) for his service as Inspector-General Of Education and Archaeological Surveyor in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]].&lt;ref name="LG 23 June 1910"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28388 |date=23 June 1910 |page=4478 |supp=y |display-supp=Supplement to the London Gazette Extraordinary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in the 1912 King's Birthday Honours, he was promoted to [[Knight Commander]] of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) for his service as Superintendent of the Archaeological Department, North-West Frontier Circle.&lt;ref name="LG 11 June 1912"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28617|date=23 June 1910 |page=4300|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters]] (DLitt) by the [[University of Oxford]] in 1909. He was made an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc) by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1910.&lt;ref name="Sir Aurel Stein’s Medals at the Royal Geographical Society" /&gt; He was made an honorary [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] (LLD) by the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Sir Aurel Stein’s Medals at the Royal Geographical Society" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Was Who"&gt;{{cite web|title=STEIN, Sir Aurel|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U232156|website=Who Was Who|publisher=A &amp; C Black|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aṅgulimāla''' ([[Pāli language]]; &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; 'finger necklace')&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

Depicted as a ruthless brigand who completely transforms after a conversion to Buddhism, he is seen as the example par excellence of the redemptive power of the Buddha's teaching and the Buddha's skill as a teacher. Aṅgulimāla is seen by Buddhists as the "patron saint" of childbirth and is associated with fertility in South and Southeast Asia.

Aṅgulimāla's story can be found in numerous sources in [[Pāli]], Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese. Aṅgulimāla is born Ahiṃsaka. He grows up as an intelligent young man in [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]], and during his studies becomes the favorite student of his teacher. However, out of jealousy, fellow students set him up against his teacher. In an attempt to get rid of Aṅgūlimāla, the teacher sends him on a deadly mission to find a thousand human fingers to complete his studies. Trying to accomplish this mission, Aṅgulimāla becomes a cruel brigand, killing many and causing entire villages to emigrate. Eventually, this causes [[Pasenadi|the king]] to send an army to catch the killer. Meanwhile, Aṅgulimāla's mother attempts to interfere, almost causing her to be killed by her son as well. The Buddha manages to prevent this, however, and uses [[ṛddhi|his power]] and teachings to bring Aṅgulimāla to the right path. Aṅgulimāla becomes a follower of the Buddha, and to the surprise of the king and others, becomes a monk under his guidance. Villagers are still angry with Aṅgulimāla, but this is improved somewhat when Aṅgulimāla helps a mother with childbirth through an [[sacca-kiriya|act of truth]].

Scholars have theorized that Aṅgulimāla may have been part of a violent cult before his conversion. Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]] has suggested that he was a follower of an early form of [[Tantra]], but this claim has been debunked. Buddhists consider Aṅgulimāla a symbol of spiritual transformation, and his story a lesson that everyone can change their life for the better, even the least likely people. This inspired the official Buddhist prison chaplaincy in the UK to name their organization after him. Moreover, Aṅgulimāla's story is referred to in scholarly discussions of justice and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and is seen by theologian John Thompson as a good example of coping with [[moral injury]] and an [[ethics of care]]. Aṅgulimāla has been the subject of movies and literature, with a [[Angulimala (2003 film)|Thai movie of the same name]] choosing to depict him following the earliest sources, and the book ''The Buddha and the Terrorist'' by [[Satish Kumar]] adapting the story as a [[ahimsa|non-violent]] response to the [[Global War on Terror]].

The story of Aṅgulimāla is most well-known in the [[Theravada|Theravāda]] tradition.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=161}} Two texts in the [[Pali canon|early discourses]] in the [[Pāli language]] are concerned with Aṅgulimāla's initial encounter with the Buddha and his conversion, and are believed to present the oldest version of the story.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=162}}{{refn|group=note|In comparison, {{As of|1994|post=, |lc=yes}} scholars dated the life of the Buddha between the 5th and 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman |first=K.R. |author-link=K.R.

Furthermore, three other Chinese texts dealing with Aṅgulimāla have also been found, of unknown origin but different from the first three Chinese texts.{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |page=655 }}

Apart from these early texts, there are also later renderings, which appear in the commentary to the [[Majjhima Nikāya]] attributed to [[Buddhaghosa]] (5th century CE) and the Theragāthā commentary attributed to [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] (6th century CE).{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=288}} The two commentaries do not appear to be independent of one another: it appears that Dhammapāla has copied or closely paraphrased Buddhaghosa, although adding explanation of some inconsistencies.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=137}}{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=162}} The earliest accounts of Aṅgulimāla's life emphasize the fearless violence of Aṅgulimāla and, by contrast, the peacefulness of the Buddha. Later accounts attempt to include more detail and clarify anything that might not conform with Buddhist doctrine.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|page=176}} For example, one problem that is likely to have raised questions is the sudden transformation from a killer to an enlightened disciple{{em dash}}later accounts try to explain this.{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |page=654 }} Later accounts also include more miracles, however, and together with the many narrative details this tends to overshadow the main points of the story.{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=147}} The early [[Pāli]] discourses ({{lang-pi|sutta|italic=yes}}) do not provide for any motive for Aṅgulimāla's actions, other than sheer cruelty.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=136}} Later texts may represent attempts by later commentators to "rehabilitate" the character of Aṅgulimāla, making him appear as a fundamentally good human being entrapped by circumstance, rather than as a vicious killer.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=141}}{{sfn|Kosuta|2017|p=36}} In addition to the discourses and verses, there are also [[Jātaka]] tales, the [[Milindapanha|Milindapañhā]], and parts of the [[vinaya Pitaka|monastic discipline]] that deal with Aṅgulimāla, as well as the later [[Mahavamsa|Mahāvaṃsa]] chronicle.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|pp=161–2}}

Later texts from other languages that relate Aṅgulimāla's life include the [[Avadāna]] text called Sataka,{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} as well as a later collection of tales called ''Discourse on the Wise and the Fool'', which exists in Tibetan and Chinese.{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=140}} There are also travel accounts of Chinese pilgrims that mention Aṅgulimāla briefly.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|page=105}} In addition to descriptions of the life of Aṅgulimāla, there is a [[Mahāyāna]] discourse called the [[Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra]], which Gautama Buddha addresses to Aṅgulimāla. This is one of the [[Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra]]s, a group of discourses that deal with the [[Buddha Nature]].&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=164}} There is another ''[[sūtra]]'' with the same name, referred to in Chinese texts, which was used to defend the Buddhist stance against alcoholic beverages. This text has not been found, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang-Toutain |first1=Françoise |title=Pas de boissons alcoolisées, pas de viande : une particularité du bouddhisme chinois vue à travers les manuscrits de Dunhuang |trans-title=No alcoholic beverages, no meat: one particular characteristic of Chinese Buddhism, seen through the manuscripts of Dunhuang |journal=[[Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie]] |date=1999 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=101{{en dash}}2, 105, 112{{en dash}}5 |doi=10.3406/asie.1999.1151 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/asie_0766-1177_1999_num_11_1_1151 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from textual evidence, early [[epigraphic]] evidence has also been found. One of the earliest reliefs that depicts Aṅgulimāla dates from approximately 3rd century BCE.{{sfn|Zin|2005|p=709}}

== Story ==
=== Previous incarnations ===
The texts describe a previous incarnation before Aṅgulimāla met the Buddha Gautama. In this life, he was born as a man-eating king turned ''[[yaksha]]'' ({{lang-pi|yakkha|italic=yes}}, a sort of demon; {{lang-sa|yakṣa|italic=yes}}),{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}}{{sfn|Barrett|2004|page=180}} in some texts called [[Saudasa|Saudāsa]].{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=706}} Saudāsa develops an interest in consuming human flesh when he is served the flesh of a dead baby. When he asks for more, his subjects start to fear for their children's safety and he is driven from his own kingdom.{{sfn|Barrett|2004|page=181}}{{refn|group=note|The passage on eating dead babies can only be found in one Chinese version of the story, and may have been added in to criticize such practices in 5th-century China.{{sfn|Barrett|2004|page=181}}}} Growing into a monster, Saudāsa meets a deity that promises Saudāsa can retrieve his status as king if he sacrifices one hundred other kings.{{sfn|Barrett|2004|page=180}} Having killed 99 kings, a king called [[Sutasoma]] changes Saudāsa's mind and makes him a religious man, and he gives up all violence. The texts identify Sutasoma with [[bodhisattva#Early and Theravāda Buddhism|a previous incarnation]] of the Buddha,{{sfn|Barrett|2004|page=180}}{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=706}} and Saudāsa with a previous incarnation of Aṅgulimāla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkens|first1=Jens|title=Studien Zur Alttürkischen Daśakarmapathāvadānamālā (2): Die Legende Vom Menschenfresser Kalmāṣapāda|trans-title=Studies of the Old Turkish Daśakarmapathāvadānamālā (2): The Legend of the Man-eater Kalmāṣapāda|language=de|journal=[[Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae]]|date=2004|volume=57|issue=2|page=169|jstor=23658630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ekottara Agāma, however, in a previous incarnation Aṅgulimāla is a crown prince, whose goodness and virtue irritate his enemies. When his enemies kill him, he takes a vow just before his death that he may avenge his death, and attain [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] in a future life under the guidance of a master. This version makes it look as though Aṅgulimāla's killing is justified.{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |pp=656{{en dash}}7}}

=== Youth ===
[[File:Taxila2.jpg|Remains of [[Taxila]], current-day Pakistan.|thumb|alt=Ruins]]In most texts, Aṅgulimāla is born in [[Savatthi|Sāvatthī]],{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=706}}{{refn|group=note|In two of the early Chinese texts, Aṅgulimāla is born in [[Magadha]] or [[Anga|Aṅga]], and King Pasenadi does not make any appearance.{{sfn|Zin|2005|page=707}}{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |page=655 }}}} in the [[brahmin|brahman]] (priest) caste of the [[Garga|Gagga]] clan, his father Bhaggava being the chaplain of the [[Pasenadi|king of Kosala]], and his mother called Mantānī.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} According to [[atthakatha|commentarial texts]], omens seen at the time of the child's birth (the flashing of weapons and the appearance of the "constellation of thieves" in the sky){{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} indicate that the child is destined to become a brigand.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=138}} As the father is interpreting the omens for the king, the king asks whether the child will be a lone brigand or a band leader. When Bhaggava replies that he will be a lone brigand, the king decides to let it live.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=138}}

Buddhaghosa relates that the father names the child Ahiṃsaka, meaning 'the harmless one'.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} This is derived from the word ''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsa]]'' (non-violence), because no-one is hurt at his birth, despite the bad omens.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt; The commentary by Dhammapāla states that he is initially named Hiṃsaka ('the harmful one') by the worried king, but that the name is later changed.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}

Having grown up, Ahiṃsaka is handsome, intelligent and well-behaved.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}}{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=707}} His parents send him to [[Taxila]] to study under a well-known teacher. There he excels in his studies and becomes the teacher's favorite student, enjoying special privileges in his teacher's house. However, the other students grow jealous of Ahiṃsaka's speedy progress and seek to turn his master against him.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} To that end, they make it seem as though Ahiṃsaka has seduced the master's wife.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}} Unwilling or unable to attack Ahiṃsaka directly,{{refn|group=note|[[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] states that Ahiṃsaka is as "strong as seven elephants", while another text states that the teacher worries his reputation will suffer if he is found to have murdered a student.{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=708}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=138–9}}}} the teacher says that Ahiṃsaka's training as a true brahman is almost complete, but that he must provide the traditional final gift offered to a teacher and then he will grant his approval. As his payment, the teacher demands a thousand fingers, each taken from a different human being, thinking that Aṅgulimāla will be killed in the course of seeking this grisly prize.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=707}}{{refn|group=note|Some versions of the story mention hundred fingers, while others mention thousand.{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=708}}{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=141}} Dhammapāla states that Aṅgulimāla is required to fetch a thousand fingers from right hands,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} seemingly unaware that this could be achieved by killing 200 people,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} or by taking the fingers from people who were already dead.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=176}} [[Buddhaghosa]] states, on the other hand, that Angulimāla is told to "kill a thousand legs", and gathers fingers only as an aid to keep an accurate count.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=142}}}} According to Buddhaghosa, Ahiṃsaka objects to this, saying he comes from a peaceful family, but eventually the teacher persuades him.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} But according to other versions, Ahiṃsaka does not protest against the teacher's command.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}}

In another version of the story, the teacher's wife tries to seduce Ahiṃsaka. When the latter refuses her advances, she is spiteful and tells the teacher Ahiṃsaka has tried to seduce her. The story continues in the same way.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=707}}

=== Life as a brigand ===
Following his teacher's bidding, Aṅgulimāla becomes a highwayman, living on a cliff&lt;!--Wilson--&gt; in a forest called Jālinī&lt;!--Lamotte--&gt; where he can see people passing through, and kills or hurts those travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamotte|first1=Etienne|authorlink1=Etienne Lamotte|title=History of Indian Buddhism: From the Origins to the Saka Era|date=1988|publisher=[[Université catholique de Louvain]], Institut orientaliste|isbn=906831100X|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}} He becomes infamous for his skill in seizing his victims.{{sfn|Wiltshire |1984|page=91}} When the people start to avoid roads, he enters villages and drags people from their homes to kill them. Entire villages become abandoned.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} He never takes clothes or jewels from his victims, only fingers.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} To keep count of the number of victims that he has taken, he strings them on a thread and hangs them on a tree. However, because birds begin to eat the flesh from the fingers,&lt;!--Buswell only from here--&gt; he starts to wear them as a [[Yagnopaveetham|sacrificial thread]]. Thus he comes to be known as ''Aṅgulimāla'', meaning 'necklace of fingers'.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=139}} In some reliefs, he is depicted as wearing a headdress of fingers rather than a necklace.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|pp=108–12}}

=== Meeting the Buddha ===
[[File:054 Angulimala cannot Catch up with Buddha who ordains him and he becomes an Arahant (9270708415).jpg|thumb|Painting at Chedi Traiphop Traimongkhon Temple, [[Hat Yai|Hatyai]], Thailand|upright=0.9]]Surviving villagers migrate from the area and complain to [[Pasenadi]], the king of [[Kosala]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=293–4}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=140}} Pasenadi responds by sending an army of 500 soldiers to hunt down Aṅgulimāla.{{sfn|Loy|2009|p=1246}} Meanwhile, Aṅgulimāla's parents hear about the news that Pasenadi is hunting an outlaw. Since Aṅgulimāla was born with bad omens, they conclude it must be him. Although the father prefers not to interfere,{{refn|group=note|Buddhaghosa says he does not dare to, whereas Dhammapāla says he beliefs he has "no use for such a son".{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=140}}}} the mother disagrees.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=293–4}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=140}}{{refn|group=note|Buddhologist [[André Bareau]] and theologian John Thompson have argued that the passage of the mother trying to interfere has been added to the original story later, but Asian Studies scholar Monika Zin notes that the mother already appears in early Buddhist art.{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=708}}{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=163}}}} Fearing for her son's life, she sets out to find her son, warn him of the king's intent and take care of him.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=163}}{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}} The Buddha perceives through [[abhinna|meditative vision]] ({{lang-pi|abhiñña|italic=yes}}) that Aṅgulimāla has slain 999 victims, and is desperately seeking a thousandth.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=298 n.30}}{{refn|According to some versions, however, the Buddha hears about Aṅgulimāla from monks, who have gone for [[alms#Buddhism|alms round]] and have seen the complaining villagers at [[Pasenadi]]'s palace.{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |p=656 }}|group=note}} If the Buddha is to encounter Aṅgulimāla that day, the latter will become a monk and subsequently attain ''abhiñña''.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=298 n.30}} However, if Aṅgulimāla is to kill his mother instead, she will be his thousandth victim and he will be unsavable,&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=140}} since matricide in Buddhism is considered one of the [[Anantarika-karma|five worst actions a person can commit]].{{sfn|Kosuta|2017|pp=40–1}}{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=146}}

The Buddha sets off to intercept Aṅgulimāla,{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} despite being warned by local villagers not to go.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=136}}{{sfn|van Oosten |2008 |page=251 }} On the road through the forest of Kosala, Aṅgulimāla first sees his mother.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt; According to some versions of the story, he then has a moment of reconciliation with her, she providing food for him.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=183}} After some deliberation, however, he decides to make her his thousandth victim. But then when the Buddha also arrives, he chooses to kill him instead. He draws his sword, and starts running towards the Buddha. But although Aṅgulimāla is running as fast as he can, he cannot catch up with the Buddha who is walking calmly.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt; The Buddha is using some [[Ṛddhi|supernatural accomplishment]] ({{lang-pi|iddhi|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|ṛddhi|italic=yes}}) that affects Aṅgulimāla:{{sfn|Wiltshire |1984|page=91}}{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=162}} one text states the Buddha through these powers contracts and expands the earth on which they stand, thus keeping a distance of Aṅgulimāla.{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=142}} This bewilders Aṅgulimāla so much that he calls to the Buddha to stop. The Buddha then says that he himself has already stopped, and that it is Aṅgulimāla who should stop:&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Mathers|2013|page=127}}
{{blockquote|I, Angulimala, am standing still ({{lang-pi|ṭhita|italic=yes}}), having for all beings laid aside the rod ({{lang-pi|daṇḍa|italic=yes}}); but you are unrestrained ({{lang-pi|asaññato|italic=yes}}) regarding creatures; therefore, I am standing still, you are not standing still.{{sfn|Wiltshire |1984|page=91}}}}
Aṅgulimāla asks for further explanation, after which the Buddha says that a good monk should control his desires.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|pp=162–3}} Aṅgulimāla is impressed by the Buddha's courage,{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=145}} and struck with guilt about what he has done.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=177}} After listening to the Buddha, Aṅgulimāla reverently declares himself converted, vows to cease his life as a brigand and joins the [[Sangha|Buddhist monastic order]].{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=135}}{{sfn|Analayo|2008|pp=142–3}}{{sfn|van Oosten |2008 |page=252 }} He is [[upasampada|admitted]] in the [[Jetavana]] monastery.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=163}}

=== Life as a monk and death ===
[[File:Wat Pangla - 041 Angulimala (10684804324).jpg|thumb|Aṅgulimāla sitting down respectfully in front of the Buddha. Painting in Wat Pangla in [[Songkhla Province|Songhkla]], Southern Thailand|upright=0.5]]
Meanwhile, King Pasenadi sets out to kill Aṅgulimāla. He stops first to pay a visit to the Buddha and his followers at the Jetavana monastery.{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |p=655 }} He explains to the Buddha his purpose, and the Buddha asks how the king will respond if he were to discover that Aṅgulimāla had given up the life of a highwayman and become a monk. The king says that he would salute him and offer to provide for him in his monastic vocation. The Buddha then reveals that Aṅgulimāla is sitting only a few feet away, his hair and beard shaven off, a member of the Buddhist order. The king, astounded but also delighted, addresses Aṅgulimāla by his clan and mother's name ({{lang-pi|Gagga Mantānīputta|italic=yes}}) and offers to donate robe materials to Aṅgulimāla. Aṅgulimāla, however, does not accept the gift, because of an [[dhutanga|ascetic training]] he observes.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=707}}

In the end, the king chooses not to persecute Aṅgulimāla. This passage would agree with Buddhologist [[André Bareau]]'s observation that there was an unwritten agreement of mutual non-interference between the Buddha and kings and rulers of the time.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|pp=166–7}}

Later, Aṅgulimāla comes across a young woman undergoing difficult labor during a childbirth.{{refn|group=note|This passage does not appear in all versions of the [[Tripitaka|Tripiṭaka]].{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=707}}}} Aṇgulimāla is profoundly moved by this, and understands pain and feels compassion to an extent he did not know when he was still a brigand.&lt;ref name="Langenberg" /&gt;{{sfn|van Oosten |2008 |page=252 }}{{sfn |Bareau |1986 |p=656 }} He goes to the Buddha and asks him what he can do to ease her pain. The Buddha tells Aṅgulimāla to go to the woman and say:

{{blockquote|Sister, since I was born, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and may your infant be well.}}

Aṅgulimāla points out that it would be untrue for him to say this, to which the Buddha responds with this revised stanza:

{{blockquote|Sister, since I was born {{em|with noble birth}}, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and may your infant be well.&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt; [emphasis added]}}

The Buddha is here drawing Angulimala's attention to his choice of having become a monk,&lt;ref name="Buswell 2013" /&gt; describing this as a second birth&lt;!--Wilson--&gt; that contrasts with his previous life as a brigand.&lt;!--Gombrich--&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=293}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=136}} ''Jāti'' means birth, but the word is also glossed in the Pāli commentaries as [[gotra|clan or lineage]] ({{lang-pi|gotta|italic=yes}}). Thus, the word ''jāti'' here also refers to the lineage of the [[List of Buddhas|Buddhas]], i.e. the monastic community.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=297–8 n.24}}

However, a resentful few cannot forget that he was responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. With sticks and stones they attack him as he walks for alms. With a bleeding head, torn outer robe and a broken alms bowl, Aṅgulimāla manages to return to the monastery.

After having admitted Aṅgulimāla in the monastic order, the Buddha issues a rule that from now on, no criminals should be accepted as monks in the order.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Kosuta|2017|p=42}} [[Buddhaghosa]] states that Aṅgulimāla dies shortly after becoming a monk.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}}{{sfn|Kosuta|2017|p=42}} After his death, a discussion arises among the monks as to what Aṅgulimāla's [[Buddhist cosmology|afterlife destination]] is. When the Buddha states that Aṅgulimāla has attained Nirvana, this surprises some monks. They wonder how it is possible for someone who killed so many people to still attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. The Buddha responds that even after having done much evil, a person still has a possibility to change for the better and attain enlightenment.{{sfn|van Oosten |2008 |pages=252{{en dash}}3 }}

=== Historical ===
The custom of the giving of goodbye gifts to one's teacher was customary in ancient India. There is an example in the "Book of Pauṣya"{{refn|In Pausyaparvan, ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābharatha]]'' 1,3.|group=note}} of the Vedic epic ''[[Mahabharata|Mahābharatha]]''. Here the teacher sends his disciple Uttanka away after Uttanka has proven himself worthy of being trustworthy and in the possession of all the [[Veda|Vedic]] and [[Dharmashastra|Dharmashastric]] teachings. Uttanka says to his teacher:
{{blockquote|"What can I do for you that pleases you ({{lang-sa|kiṃ te priyaṃ karavāni|italic=yes}}), because thus it is said: Whoever answers without [being in agreement with] the [[Dharma]], and whoever asks without [being in agreement with] the Dharma, either occurs: one dies or one attracts animosity."}}
Indologist Friedrich Wilhelm maintains that similar phrases already occur in the ''[[Manusmriti|Book of Manu]]'' (II,111) and in the ''Institutes of Vishnu''. By taking leave of their teacher and promising to do whatever their teacher asks of them, brings, according to the Vedic teachings, enlightenment or a similar attainment. It is therefore not unusual that Aṅgulimāla is described to do his teacher's horrible bidding—although being a good and kind person at heart—in the knowledge that in the end he will reap the highest attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prüfung und Initiation im Buche Pausya und in der Biographie des Nāropa|language=de|trans-title=Test and Initiation in the Book Pauṣya and in the Biography of Nāropa|location=Wiesbaden|year=1965|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|alt=Chinese monk walking with large rucksack.|thumb|The idea that Aṅgulimāla was part of a violent cult was already suggested by the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] (depicted here).|upright=0.6]]Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]] has postulated that the story of Aṅgulimāla may be a historical encounter between the Buddha and a follower of an early [[Shiva|Saivite]] or [[Shakti]] form of [[tantra]].{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=151}} Gombrich reaches this conclusion on the basis of a number of inconsistencies in the texts that indicate possible corruption,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=144–51}} and the fairly weak explanations for Aṅgulimāla's behavior provided by the commentators.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=136, 141}}{{sfn|Mudagamuwa|Von Rospatt|1998|p=170}} He notes that there are several other references in the early Pāli canon that seem to indicate the presence of devotees of [[Shiva|Śaiva]], [[Kāli]], and other divinities associated with [[violence|sanguinary]] (violent) tantric practices.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=155–62}} The textual inconsistencies discovered could be explained through this theory.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=152–4}}

The idea that Aṅgulimāla was part of a violent cult was already suggested by the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuan Zang]] (602–64 CE). In his [[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions|travel accounts]], Xuan Zang states that Aṅgulimāla's was taught by his teacher that he would be born in the Brahma heaven if he killed a Buddha. A Chinese early text gives a similar description, stating that Aṅgulimāla's teacher followed the gruesome instructions of his guru, to attain immortality.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|pp=105–6}} Xuan Zang's suggestion was further developed by European translators of Xuan Zang's travel accounts in the early twentieth century, but partly based on translation errors.{{sfn|Mudagamuwa|Von Rospatt|1998|p=177 n.25}}{{sfn|Analayo|2008|pp=143–4 n.42}} Regardless, Gombrich is the first recent scholar to postulate this idea. However, Gombrich's claim that tantric practices existed before the finalization of the [[Suttapitaka|canon of Buddhist discourses]] (two to three centuries BCE) goes against mainstream scholarship. Scholarly consensus places the arising of the first tantric cults about a thousand years later, and no corroborating evidence has been found, whether textual or otherwise, of earlier sanguinary tantric practices.{{sfn|Mudagamuwa|Von Rospatt|1998|p=170}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=152 n.7, 155}} Though Gombrich argues that there other, similar [[antinomian]] practices (going against moral norms) which are only mentioned once in [[Tipitaka|Buddhist scriptures]] and for which no evidence can be found outside of the scriptures,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=152, 156}} Buddhist Studies scholars Mudagamuwa and Von Rospatt dismiss these as incorrect examples. They also take issue with Gombrich's metrical arguments, thus disagreeing with Gombrich's hypotheses with regard to Aṅgulimāla. They do consider it possible, however, that Angulimāla's violent practices were part of some kind of historical cult.{{sfn|Mudagamuwa|Von Rospatt|1998|pp=172–3}} Buddhist Studies scholar [[L. S. Cousins]] has also expressed doubts about Gombrich's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=L. S.|authorlink1=L. S. Cousins|title=Review of Richard F. Gombrich: How Buddhism began: the conditioned genesis of the early teachings, 1996|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|date=24 December 2009|volume=62|issue=2|page=373|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00017109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese translation of the Damamūkhāvadāna by Hui-chiao,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Buddhism|title=Aṅgulimāla|volume=1|url=|editor1-last=Malalasekera|editor1-first=G.P.|editor1-link=G.

Ancient texts often describe Saudāsa's life as Aṅgulimāla's previous life, and both characters deal with the problem of being a good ''brahman''.{{sfn|Zin |2005|page=706}}

Studying art depictions in the [[Gandhāra]] region, Archeologist Maurizio Taddei theorizes that the story of Aṅgulimāla may point at an Indian mythology with regard to a ''yakṣa'' living in the wild. In many depictions Aṅgulimāla is wearing a headdress, which Taddei describes as an example of [[dionysian]]-like iconography. Art historian Pia Brancaccio argues, however, that the headdress is an Indian symbol used for figures associated with the wild or hunting.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|pp=108–12}} She concurs with Taddei that depictions of Aṅgulimāla, especially in Gandhāra, are in many ways reminiscent of dionysian themes in Greek art an mythology, and influence is highly likely.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|pp=112–4}} However, Brancaccio argues that the headdress was essentially an Indian symbol, used by artists to indicate Aṅgulimāla belonged to a forest tribe, feared by the early Buddhists who were mostly urban.{{sfn|Brancaccio|1999|pp=115–6}}

Among Buddhists, Aṅgulimāla is one of the most well-known stories.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=135}} Not only in modern times: in ancient times, two important Chinese pilgrims travelling to India reported about the story, and reported about the places they visited that were associated with Aṅgulimāla's life.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=163}} From a Buddhist perspective, Aṅgulimāla's story serves as an example that even the worst of people can overcome their faults and return to the right path.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|page=266}} The commentaries uphold the story as an example of good karma destroying evil karma.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} Buddhists widely regard Aṅgulimāla as a symbol of complete transformation{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}} and as a showcase that the Buddhist path can transform even the least likely initiates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last1=Juergensmeyer|editor-first1=Mark|editor-last2=Kitts|editor-first2=Margo|editor-last3=Jerryson|editor-first3=Michael|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Violence|date=2013|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-975999-6|page=58|title=Buddhist Traditions and Violence|last=Jerryson|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists have raised Aṅgulimāla's story as an example of the [[karuṇā|compassion]] ({{lang-pi|karuṇa|italic=yes}}) and supernatural accomplishment ({{lang-pi|iddhi|italic=yes}}) of the Buddha.{{sfn|Malalasekera|1960}} Aṅgulimāla's conversion is cited as a testimony to the Buddha's capabilities as a teacher,{{sfn|Analayo|2008|page=135}} and as an example of the healing qualities of the teaching of the Buddha ([[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]).{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=188}}

Through his reply, the Buddha connects the notion of [[ahimsa|'refraining from harming']] ({{lang-pi|avihiṃsa|italic=yes}}) with ''{{dfn|stillness}}'', which is the cause and effect of not harming. Furthermore, the story illustrates that there is spiritual power in such stillness, as the Buddha is depicted as outrunning the violent Aṅgulimāla. Though this is explained as being the result of the Buddha's supernatural accomplishment, the deeper meaning is that "... 'the spiritually still person' can move faster than the 'conventionally active' person". In other words, spiritual achievement is only possible through non-violence.{{sfn|Wiltshire |1984|page=91}} Furthermore, this stillness refers to the Buddhist notion of liberation from karma: as long as one cannot escape from the endless law of karmic retribution, one can at least lessen one's karma by practicing non-violence. The texts describe this as form of stillness, as opposed to the continuous movement of karmic retribution.{{sfn|Wiltshire |1984|page=95}}

He was no longer appreciated as an academic talent. His attitude could be summarized as "I have no value: therefore I can kill. If I kill, then that proves I have no value".{{sfn|Mathers|2013|page=127}} Summarizing the life of Aṅgulimāla, Mathers writes, {{nowrap|"[h]e is ... a figure}} who bridges giving and taking life."{{sfn|Mathers|2013|page=129}} Similarly, referring to the psychological concept of [[moral injury]], theologian John Thompson describes Aṅgulimāla as someone who is betrayed by an authority figure but manages to recover his eroded moral code and repair the community he has affected.&lt;ref name="McDonald 2017" /&gt; Survivors of moral injury need a clinician and a community of people that face struggles together but deal with those in a safe way; similarly, Aṅgulimāla is able to recover from his moral injury due to the Buddha as his spiritual guide, and a monastic community that leads a disciplined life, tolerating hardship.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=182}} Thompson has further suggested Aṅgulimāla's story might be used as a sort of [[narrative therapy]]&lt;ref name="McDonald 2017"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McDonald|first1=Joseph|editor1-last=McDonald|editor1-first=Joseph|encyclopedia=Exploring Moral Injury in Sacred Texts|date=2017|publisher=[[Jessica Kingsley Publishers]]|title=Introduction|isbn=978-1-78450-591-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-YpDgAAQBAJ|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the ethics presented in the narrative as inspiring responsibility. The story is not about being saved, but rather saving oneself with help from others. {{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=189}}

Ethics scholar [[David Loy]] has written extensively about Aṅgulimāla's story and the implications it has for the justice system. He believes that in [[Buddhist ethics]], the only reason offenders should be punished is to reform their character. If an offender, like Aṅgulimāla, has already reformed himself, there is no reason to punish him, even as a deterrent. Furthermore, Loy argues that the story of Aṅgulimāla does not include any form of [[restorative justice|restorative]] or [[transformative justice]], and therefore considers the story "flawed" as an example of justice.{{sfn|Loy|2009|p=1247}} Former politician and community health scholar [[Mathura Shrestha]], on the other hand, describes Aṅgulimāla's story as "[p]robably the first concept of transformative justice", citing Aṅgulimāla's repentance and renunciation of his former life as a brigand, and the pardon he eventually receives from relatives of victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shrestha|first1=Mathura P.|author-link=Mathura P.

In Sri Lankan pre-birth rituals, when the Aṅgulimāla Sutta is chanted for a pregnant woman, it is custom to surround her with objects symbolizing fertility and reproduction, such as parts of the coconut tree and earthen pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Daele|first=W.|year=2013|title=Fusing Worlds of Coconuts: The Regenerative Practice in Precarious Life-Sustenance and Fragile Relationality in Sri Lanka|journal=The South Asianist|issn=2050-487X|url=http://www.southasianist.ed.ac.uk/article/view/85/123|archive-url=https://perma.cc/P5FB-BUR3|archive-date=7 May 2018|dead-url=no|volume=2|issue=2|pages=100, 102–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have pointed out that in Southeast Asian mythology, there are links between bloodthirsty figures and fertility motifs.&lt;ref name="Langenberg" /&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=289}} The shedding of blood can be found in both violence and childbirth, which explains why Aṅgulimāla is both depicted as a killer and a healer with regard to childbirth.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=289}}

With regard to the passage when the Buddha meets Aṅgulimāla, feminist scholar Liz Wilson concludes that the story is an example of cooperation and interdependence between the sexes: both the Buddha and Aṅgulimāla's mother help to stop him.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=295–6}} Similarly, Thompson argues that mothers play an important role in the story, also citing the passage of the mother trying to stop Aṅgulimāla, as well as Aṅgulimāla healing a mother giving childbirth. Furthermore, both the Buddha and Aṅgulimāla take on motherly roles in the story.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=184}} Although many ancient Indian stories associate women with qualities like foolishness and powerlessness, Aṅgulimāla's story accepts feminine qualities, and the Buddha acts as a wise adviser to use those qualities in a constructive way.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|pp=185–6}} Nevertheless, Thompson does not consider the story feminist in any way, but does argue it contains a feminine kind of [[ethics of care]], rooted in Buddhism.{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=188}}

Throughout Buddhist history, Aṅgulimāla's story has been depicted in many art forms,{{sfn|Analayo|2008|p=135}} some of which can be found in museums and Buddhist heritage sites. In modern culture, Aṅgulimāla still plays an important role.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=164}} In 1985, the British-born Theravāda monk [[Ajahn Khemadhammo]] founded Angulimala, a Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy organization in the UK.&lt;ref name="Fernquest"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fernquest|first1=Jon|title=Buddhism in UK prisons|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-news/230872/buddhism-in-uk-prisons|via=Bangkok Post Learning|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180507183017/https://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-news/230872/buddhism-in-uk-prisons|archive-date=2018-05-07|dead-url=no|accessdate=2 May 2018|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|date=13 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=450}} It has been recognized by the British government as the official representative of the Buddhist religion in all matters concerning the British prison system, and provides chaplains, counselling services, and instruction in Buddhism and meditation to prisoners throughout England, Wales, and Scotland.&lt;ref name="Fernquest" /&gt; The name of the organization refers to the power of transformation illustrated by Aṅgulimāla's story.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=286}}{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=164}}
According to the website of the organization, "The story of Angulimala teaches us that the possibility of Enlightenment may be awakened in the most extreme of circumstances, that people can and do change and that people are best influenced by persuasion and above all, example."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://angulimala.org.uk/the-story-of-angulimala/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727154909/https://angulimala.org.uk/the-story-of-angulimala/ |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |title=The Story of Angulimala|publisher=Angulimala, the Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy|access-date=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, Aṅgulimāla's legend has received considerable attention. The story has been the main subject of at least three movies.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=164}} In 2003, Thai director [[Suthep Tannirat]] attempted to release a film named ''[[Angulimala (2003 film)|Angulimala]]''. Over 20 conservative Buddhist organizations in Thailand launched a protest, however, complaining that the movie distorted Buddhist teachings and history, and introduced Hindu and theistic influences not found in the Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alongkorn|last=Parivudhiphongs|date=9 April 2003|title=Angulimala awaits fate|work=[[Asia Africa Intelligence Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plea against movie to go to Visanu|date=11 April 2003|work=[[Asia Africa Intelligence Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bangkok Post 2003" /&gt; The [[Censorship in Thailand#Film|Thai film censorship board]] rejected appeals to ban the film, stating it did not distort Buddhist teachings.

|quote=Citizens, this is the first time I have come across a terrorist who sees the error of his ways and actually renounces crime ... As Angulimala changed from being a terrorist to a monk, I changed from being a giver of harsh punishments to a compassionate King. Yes, my citizens, I have seen a new light. I have changed ... It would be easy to declare the Buddha an accomplice and not only arrest Angulimala but also to arrest the Buddha himself—accusing him of being a protector of terrorists, of aiding and abetting terrorism. That would be easy. Neither the Buddha nor Angulimala have any defenses, whereas my army is well equipped—the strongest and most powerful. Yet now I see the world differently. I see we need more Buddhas and more monks rather than more soldiers, more police, more prisons.

Aṅgulimāla has also been the subject of literary works.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=168}} In 2006, peace activist [[Satish Kumar]] retold the story of Aṅgulimāla in his short book ''The Buddha and the Terrorist''. The books deals with the [[Global War on Terror]], reshaping and combining various accounts of Aṅgulimāla, who is described as a ''terrorist''.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=168}} The book emphasizes the passage when the Buddha accepts Aṅgulimāla in the monastic order, effectively preventing King Pasenadi from punishing him. In Kumar's book, this action leads to backlash from an enraged public, who demand to imprison both Aṅgulimāla and the Buddha. Pasenadi organizes a public trial in the presence of villagers and the royal court, in which the assembly can decide what to do with the two accused. In the end, however, the assembly decides to release the two, when Aṅgulimāla admits to his crimes and Pasenadi gives a speech emphasizing forgiveness rather than punishment.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=168}} This twist in the story sheds a different light on Aṅgulimāla, whose violent actions ultimately lead to the trial and a more non-violent and just society.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=169}} Writing about Buddhist texts and Kumar's book, Thompson reflects that ''ahiṃsa'' in Buddhism may have different shades of meaning in different contexts, and often does not mean passively standing by, or ''non-violence'' as usually understood.{{sfn|Thompson|2015|pp=172–3}}{{sfn|Thompson|2017|p=188}}

The introduction of the '''Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam''' first occurred in the 1920s, not long after [[French Indochina]] was mentioned by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] as a potential destination for Bahá'í teachers.&lt;ref name="tab1"&gt;{{cite book|author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0877432333 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-7.html.iso8859-1#gr10 | pages = 40–42 |origyear = 1916–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of brief visits from travelling teachers throughout the first half of the 20th century, the first Bahá'i group in Vietnam was established in [[Saigon]] in 1954, with the arrival of Shirin Fozdar, a Bahá'í teacher from India. The 1950s and 1960s were marked by periods of rapid growth, mainly in [[South Vietnam]]; despite the [[Vietnam War|ongoing war]] affecting the country, the Bahá'í population surged to around 200,000 adherents by 1975. After the end of the war, Vietnam was reunified under a communist government, who proscribed the practice of the religion from 1975 to 1992, leading to a sharp drop in community numbers. Relations with the government gradually improved, however, and in 2007 the Bahá'í Faith was officially registered, followed by its full legal recognition a year later.&lt;ref name="cable-07HANOI1636"&gt;{{cite web| title = Small Baha'i And Muslim Communities Grow in Hanoi | publisher=Embassy of the United States of America in Vietnam | format=Diplomatic cable | date=12 September 2007| url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=07HANOI1636 | accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irfr2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90159.htm | title = International Religious Freedom Report&amp;nbsp;— Vietnam | date = 14 September 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | authors = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | publisher = United States State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, it was reported that the Bahá'í community comprised about 8,000 followers.&lt;ref name="irfr2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=208280#wrapper | title = International Religious Freedom Report—Vietnam | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2013-07-12 | authors = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | publisher = United States State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Indochina (pre-1954)==

===‘Abdu'l-Bahá's ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''===
The earliest association of Vietnam with the Bahá'í Faith was a brief mention of French Indochina—of which the country was then a part—as a destination for Bahá'í teachers in [[‘Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''.&lt;ref name="tab1" /&gt; The specific tablet in question was written on 11 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919, after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on 4 April 1919, and published in [[Star of the West]] magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The moment this divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion..., if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as the continent of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, also to Japan, Asiatic Russia, Korea, French Indochina, Siam, Straits Settlements, India, Ceylon and Afghanistan, most great results will be forthcoming."&lt;ref name="tab1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

‘Abdu’l-Bahá had at one time seriously considered a voyage to India and Indochina, as reported by [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1919,&lt;ref name="indochinavisit"&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum |year = 1969 |title = The Priceless Pearl |page = 31 | edition = Hardcover |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust: 2000 |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-1-870989-91-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although whether such a voyage would have included the territory that would become known as Vietnam is not known.

===Early contact===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:MarthaRoot.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Martha Root]] visited Saigon in 1924.]] --&gt;
The first Bahá'í to visit Vietnam is likely to have been {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney|fr}}, one of the first Bahá'ís of France, who undertook a number of travels around the globe at the request of 'Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name="bahaiworld-xvi-p536"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bahá'í World|volume=16|year=1978|publisher=Bahá'í World Centre|location=Haifa|author=The Universal House of Justice|isbn=0853980756|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial planned visit was aborted in 1914 due to the outbreak of [[World War I]], Dreyfus-Barney arrived in what was then [[French Indochina]] in 1920, visiting Saigon and Hanoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hippolyte Dreyfus, apôtre d'Abdu'l-Bahá |trans-title=Hippolyte Dreyfus, Disciple of 'Abdu'l-Bahá | url= http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-doc/ouvrage/dreyfus/dreyfus_06.htm | date=September 2000 | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of France | accessdate = 2012-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later in May 1924, prominent Bahá'í travelling teacher [[Martha Root]] paid a week-long visit to Saigon. During her stay, she promoted the message and principles of the religion to a number of newspapers, making friends with one Madame Boeuf, editor of an English section in "L'Information de l'Extrême Orient". Boeuf was sympathetic to the principles of the Bahá'í religion, and published a number of favorable French-language articles. Several other newspapers also printed articles describing Bahá'í principles, in French, Chinese and Vietnamese. A public lecture was arranged with the help of the Governor, who, when approached, "himself telephoned the President of the largest school" to communicate his approval. Besides these initiatives, Root made calls to nineteen schools, societies and individuals in Saigon.&lt;ref name="martharoot"&gt;{{cite book|title=Martha Root: Lioness at the threshold|author=M. R. Garis|publisher=Baha'i Publishing Trust|year=1983|isbn=0877431841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sotw-root"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Root |first=Martha |title=A Trip to Indo-China on a Cargo Boat |journal=Star of the West |volume=15 |issue=2 |date=May 1924 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the [[Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of India, Pakistan and Burma adopted the goal of sending [[Pioneering (Baha'i)|pioneers]] to a number of cities throughout Africa and Southeast Asia, including Saigon, in response to the summons of Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="bn-oct51"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=October 1951 | page=9 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to an individual in September of that year, Shoghi Effendi reported that there were Bahá’ís in Indochina at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Japan Will Turn Ablaze! | url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/c/JWTA/jwta-150.html| year=1992 | publisher = Bahá’í Publishing Trust of Japan | accessdate = 2012-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although their settlement seems to have been short-lived; a March 1952 report stated that Indochina remained unopened to the Baha'i Faith.&lt;ref name="bnl-mar52"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í Newsletter|date=March 1952 | number=58 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India, Pakistan and Burma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Vietnam (1954–1975)==
Following nearly a [[First Indochina War|decade of war]] between colonial France and the communist [[Viet Minh]], which ended in a decisive French defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]], both sides met at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] on July 21, 1954. A provisional division of Vietnam was made at the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|17th parallel]], creating the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] in the north and the [[South Vietnam|State of Vietnam]] (later the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]) in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Gary B., Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R. Howe, Peter J. Frederick, Allen F. Davis, Allan M. Winkler, Charlene Mires, and Carla Gardina Pestana. The American People, Concise Edition Creating a Nation and a Society, Combined Volume (6th Edition). New York: Longman, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the development of the Bahá'í Faith during the following period took place in South Vietnam; the first Bahá'í groups in the north would not be established until 1992, long after the country's reunification.

In February 1954, Shirin Fozdar, a Bahá'í from India who had been a member of the National Spiritual Assembly there, went to Saigon to establish the religion in Indochina.&lt;ref name="cable-07HANOI1636" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sharin"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.religiousunity.org/BahArt/Shirin%20Fozdar.htm | title = Shirin Fozdar: An Outstanding Pioneer | first = Anil | last = Sarwal | journal = Bahá'í Digest | year = 1989 | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, she gave a public introduction to the Baha'i Faith in a lecture at the Norodom theatre, which was given significant coverage in the Vietnamese press.&lt;ref name="nodlect-mar54"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vai tro Phu-nu trong trat-tu moi theo Ton-giao BA-HAI|newspaper=Saigon Moi|date=18 March 1954|page=1,3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Pham Huu Chu, a professor living in Saigon, became the first Vietnamese Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="bn-fe62"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=February 1962 | page=14 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamshed and Parvati Fozdar, members of Fozdar's family, arrived to take her place in the summer, settling into an apartment at 88 Bonard St (now Le Loi St).{{sfn|Lộc|1972|p=79}}{{sfn|Baha'i Community of Vietnam|2004|p=8}} By the following year, there were enough Bahá'ís in Saigon to elect the country's first Local Spiritual Assembly there, on 21 April 1955.&lt;ref name="bn-jl55"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=July 1955 |page=5 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly was officially recognized by the government of South Vietnam on 20 September.{{sfn|Baha'i Community of Vietnam|2004|p=9}} Promotion of the religion in Central Vietnam led to the establishment of Vietnam's second Spiritual Assembly in the village of Trừng Giang,&lt;ref name="tgiang"&gt;Now Hoà Giang village, Điện Trung commune, [[Điện Bàn District]], [[Quảng Nam province]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quảng Nam province]], in April 1957.&lt;ref name="bn-se57"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=September 1957 |page=4 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mattran"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tìm hiểu về đạo Baha’i ở Việt Nam|trans-title=Learn about the Baha'i religion in Vietnam|url=http://www.mattran.org.vn/Home/TapChi/so%2057/hdll.htm|publisher=Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front|accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight more Spiritual Assemblies were established in 1958, bringing the total to ten. Of these, most were in Central Vietnam, including those of [[Da Nang]] and [[Quang Ngai]]. Also established in that year was the Bahá'í community of Phuoc Long, where the first Bahá'í school of South Vietnam was established; several other schools were established in Central Vietnam.&lt;ref name="bn-fe62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indbahnews-aug1958"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Progress of the Faith in Viet-Nam|journal=Bahá'í News Letter|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of India, Pakistan &amp; Burma|issue=85|date=August 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=December 1958 |page=8 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 [[Tuskegee Airman]] Dempsey Morgan and his wife Adrienne, both Bahá'ís, came to Vietnam, and over succeeding years helped establish administrative procedures among the Local Spiritual Assemblies of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="lights"&gt;{{cite book | first = Gwendolyn | last = Etter-Lewis |author2=Thomas, Richard Walter | year = 2006 | publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust | isbn = 1-931847-26-6 | pages = 113–119 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=L2KVX4mx1xEC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq= | title = Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Bahá'ís in North America 1898–2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During their stay in Vietnam, the Morgans also identified [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'ís Faith, with the [[Maitreya Buddha]], who in the [[Buddhist]] tradition is the successor to [[Gautama Buddha]] and who is to appear on Earth, achieve complete [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and teach the pure [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]].&lt;ref name="lights"/&gt;&lt;ref name="momen"&gt;{{cite web | title = Buddhism and the Baha'i Faith | first = Moojan | last = Momen | publisher = Baha'i Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_buddhism | accessdate = 2008-02-23 | date = 2 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of growth a number of Buddhist monks also become Baha'is.&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; The Morgan family left Vietnam for Thailand in 1959, staying for two years before continuing to Phnom Penh. They were able to visit Saigon when [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] visited in 1961 and were able to move back to Saigon before the end of the year. There was also a local newsletter the ''Bahá'í News'' in publication by then.

From 1957 to 1963 the Bahá'í community in South Vietnam had more than tripled (including among the [[K'Ho|Koho]], [[Thổ people|Thổ]], [[Vietnamese people|Annamese]], and [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] peoples) and several schools were established.&lt;ref name="custodians"&gt;{{cite book |editor = Rabbani, R. |editor-link = Rúhíyyih Khanum |year = 1992 |title = The Ministry of the Custodians 1957–1963 |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 138, 140, 360 |url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians |isbn = 0-85398-350-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 the [[Bahá'í marriage]] certificate was recognized in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1971 |title = Messages to the Bahá'í World, 1950–1957 |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-036-5 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-54.html.iso8859-1?#gr18 | page = 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 16 Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] formed, and by 1963 there were more than 40 (and perhaps over 100) Spiritual Assemblies in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Bahá'í Faith 1844–1963| url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63 | authors =Compiled by the Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1964 | page = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963 there were also 6 local Bahá'í Centers or [[Haziratu'l-Quds]], including in Saigon and [[Da Nang]], and more lands had been bought for future centers.

Although the Bahá'í community held a generally positive relationship with the government of [[Ngô Đình Diệm]], there is evidence of sporadic opposition at different levels during this period. One account describes government harassment of the Vietnamese Bahá'ís around 1958–59, including the imprisonment of the entire Spiritual Assembly of Saigon.&lt;ref name="lights" /&gt; On 21 April 1963, Bui Van Luong, then Diệm's Interior Minister, formally prohibited Bahá'ís from pursuing "any religious activities in Central Vietnam and the mountainous provinces." Seven months later, the Diệm government was [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|overthrown]], and the prohibition of Bahá'í activities was annulled.&lt;ref name="bkpost-ma63"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddhists March in VN; No Violence Is Reported|newspaper=The Bangkok Post|volume=19|number=115|date=21 May 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-au64"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bahá'í News|date=August 1964 | page=4 | publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States | issn=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account reported in a Swiss Bahá'í newsletter in February 1964 claimed that Bahá'ís in Vietnam had been subject to harassment for over seven years leading up to Diệm's ouster.&lt;ref name="bnswiss-fe64"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Bulletin d'Informations Bahá'íes de Suisse|trans-title=Switzerland Bahá'í News Bulletin|date=February 1964 |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Diệm era (1963–1975)===
As the [[Vietnam war]] continued, there were a number of [[United States|American]] Bahá'ís who were stationed in Vietnam, but following the Bahá'í teaching of the sacredness of all life and of obedience to one's government, Bahá'ís would request to avoid being placed in a position to take the life of another, and thus American Bahá'ís served as clerks and medics as [[non-combatants]].&lt;ref name="child"&gt;{{cite book | title = Religious Dimensions of Child and Family Life: Reflections on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child | chapter = Child and Family in Baha'i Religion| first = John | last = Hatcher | editor = Coward, Harold G. |editorlink=Harold Coward | year = 1996 | publisher = University of Victoria | location = Victoria, B.C. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JD8_s94htQMC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq | pages = 141–160 | isbn = 978-1-55058-104-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.us/node/77 |title=Selected profiles of African-American Baha'is, William H.

By 1975, there were an estimated 200,000 Bahá'ís in South Vietnam, and the Bahá'í community and its institutions were still experiencing growth.&lt;ref name="cable-07HANOI1636" /&gt;&lt;ref name="irfr2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bahaiworld-xvi-p262"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bahá'í World|volume=16|year=1978|publisher=Bahá'í World Centre|location=Haifa|author=The Universal House of Justice|isbn=0853980756|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist Vietnam (post-1975)==
[[File:HoChiMinhCity01c.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A billboard commemorates the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Vietnam.]]In the chaos following the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, the Bahá'í community was severely limited logistically. Contact had already been lost with members in outlying areas, and the national convention scheduled for that time was cancelled; the National Spiritual Assembly was instead elected via mailed-in ballots.{{sfn|Baha'i Community of Vietnam|2004|p=30-31,55}} In a 1978 report, the [[Universal House of Justice]] noted that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the latter part of the period under review &lt;nowiki&gt;[1973-1976]&lt;/nowiki&gt; circumstances beyond the control of the Bahá'ís have hindered the completion of the goals. An administrative committee has been appointed to function on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly.&lt;ref name="bahaiworld-xvi-p262" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a time, the incoming communist government seemed to tolerate Bahá'í activities; Bahá'ís in the newly renamed Ho Chi Minh City (previously Saigon) were allowed to hold a commemoration of the Martyrdom of the Báb in July 1976, and following the setbacks of the previous years, a meeting was held the following year to elect a National Spiritual Assembly.

===Official proscription===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Vietnam}}
Beginning in 1978, open practice of the Bahá'í Faith in Vietnam was officially proscribed. Bahá'ís were forbidden to meet or to practice their religion, and Bahá'í properties throughout the country were closed or confiscated. Two members of the National Spiritual Assembly who were present when the national headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City was confiscated were arrested and sent to [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|reeducation camps]].&lt;ref name="bahaiworld-xviii-96"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bahá'í World|volume=18|year=1986|publisher=Bahá'í World Centre|location=Haifa|author=The Universal House of Justice|isbn=0853982341|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen 1989 63–91"&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a message sent a year later, the Universal House of Justice reported that Vietnam was among "those countries where the Bahá'í Administration cannot operate or has had to be disbanded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_naw-ruz_1979|title=Launching of the Seven Year Plan|author=The Universal House of Justice|year=1979|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community numbers dropped sharply during this time as thousands of Bahá'ís fled the country, arriving as refugees in the United States and other countries, where efforts were made to contact and integrate them into local Bahá'í communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QT3i34vGS-cC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq= | title = The Routledge Historical Atlas of Religion in America| first = Bret E. | last = Carroll | page = 127 | isbn = 0-415-92131-7 | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís in a number of countries throughout the world began sending support to those Bahá'ís who remained in Vietnam, regularly sending parcels of medicine, clothes and other necessities; some were able to visit the country and meet with Bahá'ís personally. The Bahá'ís who remained in Vietnam made appeals to the government requesting the permission to practice their religion and the return of confiscated properties, although progress was limited. At the same time, appeals for the release of Bahá'í prisoners continued, through the [[Bahá'í International Community]] and a number of governments and independent agencies.&lt;ref name="bahaiworld-xviii-96" /&gt; In March 1986, a copy of the Universal House of Justice's statement, ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', was delivered by a messenger to Mr. Bui Xuan Nhat, the Permanent Representative of Vietnam to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="bn-fe88"&gt;Bahá'í News, Feb. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s and early 2000s saw conditions improve gradually. In 1990, [[Collis Featherstone|H. Collis Featherstone]], a [[Hand of the Cause]], visited Vietnam, focusing his efforts on "reinvigorating" the Bahá'ís there.&lt;ref name="ridvan-90"&gt;Ridván message, 1990.

With time, the fortunes of the Vietnamese Bahá'í community continued to improve. Bahá'ís in Ho Chi Minh City were allowed to hold a quiet ceremony in May 2004 to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Baha'i Faith in the country. By 2006, Bahá'í community leaders reported having "good relations with authorities", and that the Bahá'ís "appeared to be able to practice their faith without significant harassment." In November of that year, the US State Department reported that restrictions were being eased.&lt;ref name="irfr2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71363.htm | title = International Religious Freedom Report&amp;nbsp;— Vietnam | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2012-09-25 | authors = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | publisher = United States State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/November/20061114150908mlenuhret0.4384882.html | title = Vietnam Praised, Uzbekistan Faulted on Religious Freedom | first = Lea | last= Terhune | publisher = Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State | date = 14 November 2006 | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after many years of progress, the Bahá'í community was officially registered in early 2007, receiving a certificate of operation from the governmental Committee for Religious Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01REL220307 | title = Nation's Baha'i community gets religious recognition | date = 22 March 2007 | publisher = Viet Nam News, Vietnam News Agency | location = Hanoi, Vietnam | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a year-long probationary period, its nine-member National Spiritual Assembly was elected and its charter adopted on 21 March 2008, at a national congress in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] coinciding with the Bahá'í holy day of [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw-Rúz]].

With previous restrictions relaxed, the Vietnamese Bahá’í Community has continued to achieve marked progress, returning to a normal pace of activities and showing signs of growth in size, in freedom, and in institutional capacity.&lt;ref name="momen"/&gt; Soon after their community's recognition, Vietnamese Bahá'ís were granted permission to attend a major regional conference in [[Battambang|Battambang, Cambodia]], attended by over 2,000 of their co-religionists from Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.&lt;ref name="bbang-09"&gt;http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/battambang.html&lt;/ref&gt; National conventions, held annually in various regions, continue to gather delegates and observers in the hundreds for the election of the National Spiritual Assembly. The fourth national convention, held in April 2011 in the southern city of [[Phan Thiet]], gathered more than 300 Bahá’í members.

The nine-day pilgrimage allowed them to visit religious shrines and meet with fellow believers. In August of the same year, the Bahá’ís of Hanoi celebrated the 20th anniversary of the religion's establishment in that city with a day-long public celebration, attended by nearly 100 followers from the northern area of the country, 20 foreign Bahá’ís representing countries in the region, and government officials.&lt;ref name="irfr2012" /&gt; In May 2013, Vietnamese Bahá’ís were able to send delegates to represent their country at the 11th International Bahá'í Convention in Haifa, where they participated in the election of the Universal House of Justice.&lt;ref name="nctg-conv2013"&gt;http://www.nhipcautamgiao.net/tintuc/4811-chia-se-ve-dai-hoi-bahai-quoc-te-lan-thu-11.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same year, a number of Vietnamese Bahá'í youth joined their counterparts in Cambodia at a youth conference in Battambang.&lt;ref name="bbang-114yc"&gt;''[http://news.bahai.org/community-news/youth-conferences/battambang.html Battambang Youth Conference]''.

'''Brampton Jain Temple''' or the '''Bhagwan 1008 Adinatha Swamy Jain Temple''', is the first [[Jain temple]] in Canada constructed using traditional Indian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bramptonguardian.com/news-story/4615656-minor-injury-at-building-site-after-crane-topples/|title=Minor injury at building site after crane topples|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is located at 7875 Mayfield Road, Brampton, in [[Brampton]], [[Toronto]], ON Canada, L7E 0W1. The temple houses shrines for [[Rishabhanatha]] (also called ''Adinātha'').

The Greater Toronto area has the largest concentration of the followers of [[Jainism]] in Canada and has the most number of Jain temples of all Canadian cities.&lt;ref name="theindiandiaspora.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theindiandiaspora.com/news-details/diaspora-news/general-news/as-more-jains-come-their-temples-flourish-in-toronto.htm|title=As more Jains come, their temples flourish in Toronto|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 10,000 Jains in Canada, mostly concentrated in one province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jd4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT125&amp;dq=jainism+canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoL7Ak8HKAhXGwiYKHTFMCBIQ6AEITjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism%20canada&amp;f=false|title=RELG: World|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of the [[Jain community]] is concentrated in the metropolitan Toronto area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIHXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=jain+community+canada&amp;dq=jain+community+canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibq7WOlMHKAhWB7iYKHbcJBRwQ6AEIIjAB|title=Jainism and ecology|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the temple construction was overseen by [[Bhattarak Charukeerthi, Moodabidri]] from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklyvoice.com/community-news/foundation-laid-for-jain-temple-in-brampton/|title=Foundation Laid For Jain Temple In Brampton|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130133107/http://www.weeklyvoice.com/community-news/foundation-laid-for-jain-temple-in-brampton/#|archive-date=2016-01-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people brought their own bricks to lay for the foundation of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/magazines/ahimsatimesshow.php?id=240|title=Jainism Ahimsa News Religious Non-Violence Celebrities Literature Philosophy Matrimonial Institutions|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple celebrated its [[Pratishta Mahotsav]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/blog/jaina-convention-program-digamber-jinmandir-shilanayas-cere|title=JAINA CONVENTION PROGRAM, DIGAMBER JINMANDIR SHILANAYAS CERE|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=99149|title=HereNow4U.net :: Article Archive - Shree 1008 Adinath Digambar Jinbimb Panch-Kalyanak Pratistha-Mahamahotsav|work=HereNow4u: Portal on Jainism and next level consciousness|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 2000 people visited the temple for its anniversary celebrations, which was marked by religious discourses.&lt;ref name="theindiandiaspora.com"/&gt; MPP [[Dipika Damerla]] was present on the occasion to present Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]]'s wishes to the Jain community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southasiandaily.com/community/first-anniversary-of-canadas-first-shikharbandi-jain-temple-in-brampton/|title=First  Anniversary of Canada's First Shikharbandi Jain Temple in Brampton|work=South Asian Daily - The biggest South Asian Media House|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jainworld.com/GJE.asp?id=34|title=Jainworld|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Jain temple is the first one in Canada to use traditional Indian architecture. The temple also has a [[Manastambh]], the second Jain temple in North America to have one. A Manastambh, or Pride Pillar, indicates a loss of pride for the worshipper before entering the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUz9o-EKTpwC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=manastambha+pride&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq57jMj8HKAhUCVj4KHfz9BmYQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=manastambha%20pride&amp;f=false|title=The A to Z of Jainism|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although purporting to be of ancient origin, it is now generally regarded as a literary forgery,{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=197}} most probably authored in the 16th or 17th century by [[Azar Kayvan]], the leader of the [[Illuminationist]] sect.{{sfn|Mojtabai|1994}} Its [[Neoplatonic]] ideas have been strongly influenced by [[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Suhravardi]],{{sfn|Corbin|1987}}{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=204}} and have only a tenuous connection to mainstream Zoroastrianism.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=197}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dhalla|1938|p=463}} "outside the pale of Zoroastrianism".&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
== Content and language ==
The first part of the Desatir contains sixteen sections written in an invented language which are said to have been revealed to sixteen successive [[prophet]]s, starting with [[Mahabad (prophet)|Mahabad]], going through [[Zarathustra]] and ending with the fifth Sasan, who was supposed to have lived at the time of [[Khosrau II]] (5th–6th centuries).{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=198}}{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=203}} At the end of each section, with the exception of the last one, there is a [[prophecy]] about the next prophet. The second part of the text consists in a Persian translation of the first part, which is attributed to the fifth Sasan, but its linguistic characteristics are typical of the 16th-17th centuries, and it is most likely written by the same author.{{sfn|Mojtabai|1994}}

The [[invented language]] of the first part has been called '''{{lang|fa|Āsmānī zabān}}''' "heavenly language"&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb|Dabestan]] {{harv|Mojtabai|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its grammar is largely [[Persian grammar|Persian]],{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=198}} while its vocabulary is mostly invented, although there are words that have been adapted from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Hindi]], [[Avestan]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Arabic]].{{sfn|Mojtabai|1994}}

== Publication and reception ==
The text, though likely composed in India,{{sfn|Mojtabai|1994}} was first discovered in the Iranian city of [[Isfahan]] at the end of the 18th century by the Parsi Mulla Kaus of [[Bombay]].{{sfn|Mulla Firuz|1818|p=10}} An English translation was begun by the Bombay governor [[Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay)|Jonathan Duncan]], who died before bringing it to completion.{{sfn|Mulla Firuz|1818|pp=11–12}} The task was then taken up by Mulla Kaus's son [[Mulla Firuz]], whose translation was published along with the original in 1818.{{sfn|Boyce|1979|pp=197–98}} An edited version of this was republished by Dhunjeebhoy J. Medhora in 1888, while at the same time a separate translation by Mirza Mohomed Hadi was serialised in the American [[Platonist (magazine)|''Platonist'']]&lt;!--monthly magazine published by Thomas M Johnson--&gt; magazine.{{sfn|Medhora|1888|p=ii}} Other manuscripts have subsequently been discovered.{{sfn|Romer|1857|p=102}}

Upon its publication the text stirred controversy, some scholars at the time regarding it as a genuine ancient text on par with the [[Avesta]], others deeming it to be a forgery.{{sfn|Dhalla|1938|p=463}} The text was accepted by both the [[Parsis|Indian]] and the [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Iranian Zoroastrian]] communities as genuine,{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=204}} and it became popular,{{sfn|Boyce|1979|pp=197–98}} particularly among the [[Qadimi Zoroastrians|Qadimi faction]].{{sfn|Rose|2011|p=203}} The text, with its monotheistic tendency that was more akin to the religious sentiments of the West, was then used by some Bombay Parsis to mount a defence of their religion against the incipient [[Criticism of Zoroastrianism|criticism]] from Christian missionaries like [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]].{{sfn|Boyce|1979|p=197}}

In 1919 ''Der Tog'' absorbed another Yiddish newspaper, ''Di Varhayt'' (Warheit; Wahrheit; "The Truth"),&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt; and between 1919 and 1922 was known as ''Der Tog, di Varhayt''.&lt;ref&gt;Caliendo, Ralph J.

In 1953 ''Der Tog'' merged with the [[Jewish Morning Journal | ''Morgn Zshurnal'']] (Morning Journal), and subsequently appeared under the title ''Der Tog Morgn Zshurnal''; the circulation was estimated at 50,000 in 1970, and the paper ceased publication in 1971.&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt;

It was followed by [[Der Algemeiner Journal]] in 1972.

== Journalists and Writers ==
The founding of the newspaper was the project of a group of businessmen and intellectuals including [[Judah Leon Magnes |Judah Leib Magnes]]&lt;!-- Judah Leon and Judah Leib maybe were not the same person--&gt;, David Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;Documents related to the founding of the newspaper are contained in the [http://www.yivoarchives.org/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&amp;id=34321&amp;top=1 Papers of David Shapiro], held at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research (RG 1912); Newman, Roberta.

''Yedies fun YIVO / News from YIVO''. 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris Weinberg, and [[Herman Bernstein]]. Bernstein became the paper's first editor and Shapiro assumed the role of publisher.&lt;ref name="JTA1929"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Sometime later on, after Shapiro's death, in 1940, Morris Weinberg became the publisher; "'[http://www.jta.org/1954/11/16/archive/der-tog-american-jewish-newspaper-celebrates-40th-anniversary Der Tog' American Jewish Newspaper Celebrates Its 40th Anniversary]. ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', 16 November 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Styled in its masthead as a "newspaper for the Jewish intelligentsia,"&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passow26"&gt;Passow, David. ''The Prime of Yiddish''. New York: Geffen Books, 1996. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Tog'' sought to uphold high journalistic and literary standards, and to rise above ideological divides. 

Under [[William Edlin]], who succeeded Bernstein as editor in 1916, and the first literary editor, Benzion Hoffman (Zivion),&lt;ref name="Cohen161"&gt;Cohen, Nathan. "The Yiddish Press and Yiddish Literature: a Fertile But Complex Relationship." ''Modern Judaism'' 20.2 (May 2008): 149-172; here: 161.&lt;/ref&gt; the newspaper attracted a talented staff, including [[Shmuel Niger]], who was its literary critic for many years.&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen161"/&gt; 

Among the other outstanding staff writers were [[David Pinski]], Aron Glanz (A. Leyeles), Joel Slonim, [[Peretz Hirshbein]], and Abraham Coralnik.&lt;ref name="Halkin"/&gt; Other significant contributors included [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]]  and Samuel Rosenfeld,&lt;ref name="Passow26"/&gt; as well as [[H. Leivick]], [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]], and Ruven Ayzland.&lt;ref name="Cohen161"/&gt; [[Leon Kobrin]] was the paper's chief fiction writer for nearly two decades;&lt;ref name="Passow27"&gt;Passow, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the more famous of other occasional literary contributors were [[Joseph Opatoshu]] and [[Avrom Reyzen | Abraham Reisen]].&lt;ref&gt;Passow, 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper also published the entirety of the Bible translation by the poet [[Yehoash (Blumgarten) | Yehoash]] (pseudonym of Solomon Bloomgarden), and some works of [[Sholem Aleichem]].&lt;ref name="Passow27"/&gt;

Edlin, who had been associated with the paper from its beginnings as a news editor and a theater critic, remained editor in chief until 1925. [[Samuel Margoshes]] filled that role from 1926 until 1942.&lt;ref name="Edlin75yor"&gt;Edlin, William.

Peretz Yiddish Writers Union, 1945. 69-75; here: 72 (editors' note).&lt;/ref&gt; At that point Edlin came back and led the paper again,&lt;ref name="Edlin75yor"/&gt; until his death, in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jta.org/1947/12/01/archive/william-edlin-editor-of-jewish-day-dies-was-69-years-old William Edlin, Editor of Jewish Day, Dies; Was 69 Years Old]," ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency'', 1 December 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Edlin, ''Der Tog'' was the first Yiddish newspaper to include female journalists on the editorial staff. Adella Kean-Sametkin wrote about women's issues, and Dr. Ida Badanes, about health matters; the popular fiction writer Sarah B. Smith was also a regular contributor over many years.&lt;ref&gt;Edlin, 72; also cited in: Rojanski, Rachel, "Socialist Ideology, Traditional Rhetoric: Images of Women in American Yiddish Socialist Dailies, 1918-1922." ''American Jewish History'' 93.3 (September 2007): 329-348; here: 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Before making her mark as a poet, [[Anna Margolin]]  (pseudonym of Rosa Lebensboym) distinguished herself as a reporter and editor for ''Der Tog'', contributing a column, "In der froyen velt" (In the women's world), under her actual name, and articles about women's issues under various pseudonyms, including Clara Levin.&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, Naomi.

==Fictional character biographies==

===First Doctor===
The first of the modern-day Doctors, an African-American, was a member of a group called the [[Changers (Wildstorm)|Changers]], who were led by the superhero the [[High (comics)|High]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The group's plan was to change the world by removing the structure of society itself, eliminating all crime and war in the process. The Doctor's part in the group's plan was to initiate a program of public education about the world's natural resources, such as plants and magic. However, [[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]] attacked the group's base with a tailored acid bomb that killed the Doctor and his companions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} This Doctor was seen several times afterward in the Garden of Ancestral Memory and advised Thornedike whenever needed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Renegade Doctor===
In 1966, a heart surgeon became the Doctor.&lt;ref name="issue18"&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #18 (Oct. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; After acquiring his powers, the Doctor slaughtered the entire population of three countries (in alphabetical order) and fell asleep after drinking every bottle of [[Dom Pérignon (wine)|Dom Pérignon]] in existence at the time.&lt;ref name="issue20"&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #20 (Jan. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor was defeated when every active superhero on Earth joined forces to defeat him. The Doctor was stripped of his powers and imprisoned in a pocket dimension 20 million years in the past.&lt;ref name="issue18"/&gt;

However, the renegade Doctor communicated with the Earth in the present day from his prison and convinced the planet that humanity was killing it, causing mass devastation to places such as New York City and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #17 (Sept. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeroen Thornedike, the then-current Doctor, was forced to give his powers back to his predecessor for an hour in order to fix the damage to the Earth.&lt;ref name="issue19"&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #19 (Nov. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After regaining his powers, the renegade Doctor was brought into the present where he fought the Authority. During the fight, he travelled into the past and retroactively molested the Engineer as a teenager. As he was about to win the fight, the Doctor developed fifteen extra senses, including [[empathy]] with every living creature on the planet, which overwhelmed him. Apollo and the Engineer then used the distraction from the enhanced sensory input to behead the Doctor.&lt;ref name="issue20"/&gt;

'''Jeroen Thornedike''' was a Dutch former dot-com billionaire who became the Doctor after his predecessor died. At first, Jeroen refused to accept the responsibility and spent his days shooting [[heroin]] and playing [[Sonic the Hedgehog series|Sonic the Hedgehog]].&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;''Jenny Sparks: The Secret History of the Authority'' #1 (Aug. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jenny Sparks]] and [[Swift (comics)|Swift]] attempted to recruit him into the Authority. However, Jeroen refused and teleported them away; Sparks again attempted to recruit him, shooting herself in the head to force Jeroen to use his powers to heal her. Jeroen then joined the Authority.&lt;ref name="secret"/&gt;

Jeroen married Courtney, a rock star, and overdosed on heroin while on his honeymoon, causing him to fall into a trance while disasters struck around the world. Jeroen was cured of his heroin addiction when Midnighter gave him a transfusion of his blood.&lt;ref name="issue18"/&gt; Jeroen was later forced to relinquish his powers to the renegade Doctor in order to save the Earth&lt;ref name="issue19"/&gt; and regained them when the renegade Doctor was killed.&lt;ref name="issue20"/&gt;

Soon afterwards, Jeroen was defeated and stripped of his powers, which were then given to The Surgeon, a modern-day French [[alchemy|alchemist]]&lt;ref name="issue27"&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #27 (Jan. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The Surgeon turned Jeroen into a doll and carried him in his pockets, using him to scrub out stains from the Surgeon's underpants.&lt;ref name="issue27"/&gt; The Surgeon brought corporate contractors into the Garden of Ancestral Memory, who murdered the entities living there and later supervised the creation of a corporate religion called "Religimon". The Surgeon was later killed by Midnighter and Jeroen instantly recovered his powers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Thornedike died from a drug overdose given to him by [[Rose Tattoo (Wildstorm)|Rose Tattoo]] and his soul was captured by [[Henry Bendix]] to locate the next Doctor, Habib Ben Hassan.&lt;ref name="revolution9"&gt;''The Authority: Revolution'' #9 (June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeroen’s soul was later freed by [[Jenny Quantum]], where it then moved on and joined his predecessors in the Garden of Ancestral Memory.&lt;ref name="revolution10"&gt;''The Authority: Revolution'' #10 (July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Habib ben Hassan was a young Palestinian suicide bomber. Within the first 24 hours of inheriting his powers after Thornedike's death, Habib engineered a peace in the Middle East that actually had a chance of succeeding until he was captured by [[Henry Bendix]] and imprisoned in a cell which cut him off from his powers.&lt;ref name="revolution9"/&gt; He was secretly freed by [[Jenny Quantum]] and joined in the battle with Bendix and his followers.&lt;ref name="revolution10"/&gt; During the fight, Habib redeemed Rose Tattoo, transforming her from the Spirit of Murder to the Spirit of Life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority: Revolution'' #12 (Sept. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, Habib was unable to stop a cadre of clones of the High from damaging the Carrier, causing it to crash into London.&lt;ref&gt;''Number of the Beast'' #8 (Sept. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; After witnessing the end of the world soon afterwards, Habib committed suicide by jumping from the Carrier and dissolving into butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 5) #10 (July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Habib later appeared alongside Jeroen to Midnighter in a dream, ordering him to find something capable of healing the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

However, Habib's consciousness, badly traumatised by the Earth's present condition, manipulated Gaia Rothstein into turning herself into an island and then built itself a new body out of the vegetables and plant life from Gaia's island form.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Now calling himself the Green Man, Habib vowed to save the Earth by wiping humanity from the face of the planet. Midnighter freed Gaia from Habib's enslavement and sent Habib's consciousness to the Garden of Ancestral Memory, causing the Green Man's body to collapse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The Wildcats then searched for Habib's successor as the Doctor with the help of the spirit of former Doctor Edwin Makepeace.&lt;ref&gt;''Wildcats'' (vol. 5) #28 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shen Li-Min===
Authority member Shen Li-Min (a.k.a. [[Swift (comics)|Swift]]), former friend of the last Doctor, was chosen as Habib's successor as she possessed a connection to the planet's ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority'' vol. 4 #29 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Surgeon===
During the "Transfer of Power" story arc, the members of the Authority were temporarily replaced with analogues that had roughly the same powers; the Surgeon was the Doctor's analogue.&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority'' #22 (March 2001). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Each Doctor has the ability to alter reality by imagining something and causing reality to build it for them.&lt;ref name="issue20"/&gt; As part of their position, each Doctor possesses fifteen extra senses, including empathy with every living creature on Earth.&lt;ref name="issue20"/&gt; However, a Doctor's powers are disrupted if they are startled or distracted.&lt;ref&gt;''The Authority'' (vol. 1) #7 (Nov. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anatolian animal carpets''' represent a special type of pile-woven [[Turkish carpet|carpet]], woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, corresponding to the 14th–16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, and most of them are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th–16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and support our knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surviving carpets ==

=== Dragon and Phoenix carpet ===
A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between the [[fenghuang]], or Chinese [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and the dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. [[Radiocarbon dating]] confirmed that the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet was woven in the mid 15th century, during the early [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rageth|first1=Jürg|title=Dating the dragon &amp; phoenix fragments.|journal=Hali|date=2004|volume=134|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is knotted with symmetric knots.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beselin|first1=Anna|title=Geknüpfte Kunst : Teppiche des Museums für Islamische Kunst = Woven Art: Carpets of the Berlin Museum of Islamic art|date=2011|publisher=Edition Minerva|location=Wolfratshausen|isbn=9783938832806|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese motif was probably introduced into [[Islamic art]] by the Mongols, or artists working for them, during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his original borders, and seems to be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-groud octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles and rows of white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;

The Phoenix and Dragon carpet was first described in 1881 by [[Julius Lessing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Orientalische Teppiche = Oriental Carpets|date=1891|publisher=Ernst Wasmuth|location=Berlin|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Teppich-Erzeugung im Orient. Monographien von Sir George Birdwood in London, Geheimrath Dr. Wilhelm Bode in Berlin, C. Purdon Clarke in London, M. Gerspach in Paris, Sidney J. A. Churchill, M. R. A. S. in Teheran, Vincent J. Robinson in London, u.a.|date=1895|publisher=Verlag des K. K. Österreichischen Handels-Museums|location=Wien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Dragon and Phoenix carpet has been referred to in many books on Oriental carpets.

A similar fragment was discovered in [[Fustat]], with dragon and phoenix depicted in combat on a yellow field. The animals in this fragment are depicted in red, and outlined in blue. The minor border shows a variant of the "kufic" borders known from other Seljuq period carpets.

=== Marby rug ===
Another carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby in [[Jämtland]] province. The rug was radiocarbon dated to 1300–1420.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt; More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have additional rows of knots on their backsides. At a distance of every 6&amp;nbsp;cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from [[Fustat]] has similar additional knots. It has been suggested that these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of the carpet and the amount of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;46–49&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;)

=== Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum ===
The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Anatolian animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the [[Siena|Sienese]]  artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

=== Animal carpets from the Vakıflar Museum ===
The field of an animal carpet in the Vakıflar Museum, [[Istanbul]] (Inv. No. E-1)&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=HIrsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into two rectangular compartments by a band similar to its borders. An octagon containing [[confronted animals]] is inscribed into each compartment. The winged animals face a stylized tree. They show a down-turned, snout-like head, to which antler-like extensions are attached, and their body is spotted. Overall, the animals more resemble [[fallow deer]] than birds, which are usually depicted on animal carpets. Deer and fallow deer are already depicted on the borders of the [[Pazyryk carpet]], and are frequently seen on early textiles and other objects in Anatolia and Iran. Below each deer, and above the main animal, is a bird-like quadruped.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

Another animal carpet with a coarser design compared to the Vakıflar rug is at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in [[Konya]] (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;).

=== Animal carpet from the Pergamon Museum ===
Another carpet in the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a rectangular field surrounded by an eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each at the top and bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional [[Warp and woof|wefts]] can be seen meandering over two [[Warp and woof|warps]] after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;50–1&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;) See: [[knot density]].

=== Batári-Crivelli fragment, Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest ===
The animal carpet fragment is approximately half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second segment of the medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a [[mosque lamp]] ornament. In the center of the long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the "Dragon and Phoenix" and "Marby" rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. [[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, [[indigo]] blue, [[Rubia tinctorum|madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed ([[Reseda luteola]]), and Dyer's sage ([[Salvia fruticosa]]), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batári|first1=Ferenc|title=Ottoman Turkish carpets|date=1994|publisher=Budapest Museum of Applied Arts|location=Budapest|isbn=978-9630492126|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Batári, the late curator of the carpet and textile department of the museum.

Other animal carpets are at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]] and in private collections.

== Animal carpets in Renaissance painting ==
{{see also|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
Animal-style carpets begin to appear in Italian paintings in the 14th, and continue to be depicted in Western European paintings throughout the 15th century. They represent the earliest Oriental carpets which were identified in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance painting]]. The comparison of animal-style carpets on Renaissance paintings, for which the painter and the date of origin are often known, allows for the determination of a [[Terminus post quem|"''terminus ante quem''"]] date for existing carpets of similar design. Wilhelm von Bode identified a carpet on [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s 1440 painting ''The Marriage of the Foundlings'' with marked similarities to the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet. This marks the beginning of the "ante quem" method, which was subsequently further elaborated by the "Berlin School" of History of Islamic Art. By this method, a variety of existing carpets could be dated by comparison to their painted counterparts.

The illustrated rugs are generally drawn by the early Renaissance painters in a simplified manner, compared to the original carpet designs. The artists may sometimes have painted the animals out of their imagination, but the general appearance of the painted rugs still resembles the originals.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;

A general compositional analysis of the animal-style rugs from Renaissance paintings was first developed by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Orientalische Tierteppiche auf Bildern des XIV. und XV Jahrhunderts = Oriental animal carpets on paintings of the 14th and 15th century.|journal=Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen|date=1929|issue=5|pages=261–298|jstor=23350357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of animal carpets is usually divided into rectangular compartments, large or small. Each compartment contains an octagon, which in turn contains animal figures of four types:
# "Heraldic" animals, including single- or double-headed eagles;
# A pair of birds and a tree;
# Single birds or quadrupeds in a geometric frame;
# Paired animals within a frame, sometimes depicted in combat.

=== 14th century ===
At the beginning of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Siena and Florence school]]. During the second half of the 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in [[Lippo Memmi]]'s ''Virgin Mary and Child'', 1340–50, and in [[Sano di Pietro]]'s ''Marriage of the Virgin'', 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar rug in the Vakıflar Halı Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=John|title=Early animal carpets in Western paintings|journal=Hali|date=1978|volume=1|issue=3|pages=234–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A carpet fragment with a single bird with its head turned is now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragment of an animal carpet|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/448133?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=carpet+fragment&amp;pos=18|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painted counterpart can be seen in [[Niccolò di Buonaccorso]]'s "Marriage of the Virgin", 1380.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 15th – 16th century ===
By the beginning of the 15th century, the variations of the animal design increase:

Two animal-style carpet fragments from Fustat were dated to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt; They contain parts of a different version of the tree-and-birds pattern seen in the Marby rug. The field is no longer divided into fields, and the tree-and-paired birds pattern appear in offset rows, covering the field in endless repeat (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;29, plates 18,19&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

A fresco in the [[Palais des Papes]] at Avignon, by [[Matteo di Giovanni]] depicts a carpet with rather indistinct bird figures in front of the Pope's throne. Written sources of the 14th century indicate that [[Pope Benedict XII]] very much liked a carpet with "white swans", which he had set before his throne. A painting by [[Giovanni di Paolo]], 1440, shows an Anatolian animal style rug with birds spread before the pope's throne (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;33, ill. 5 and 6&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

Various examples are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A rug in the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]], dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;31, plate 20&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). A painting by [[Jaume Huguet]] in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs can be seen in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome, and in "Madonna enthroned" by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;34, ill. 7 and 8&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in [[Carlo Crivelli]]'s "Annunciation", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on [[Fra Angelico]]'s [[San Marco Altarpiece]].

The Pergamon Museum's "Phoenix and Dragon" finds its painted counterparts in Domenico di Bartolo's "The Marriage of the Foundlings" (1440) shows a very similar rug, as well as [[Alesso Baldovinetti]]'s "Tale of Saint Vincenzo Ferrerio", and [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s "Annunciation".

The Vakıflar Museum's animal carpet has a painted counterpart in [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]]'s "Portrait of Dorothy Cary, later Viscountess Rochford". The animals shown in the painted rug are very similar to the small bird-like animals in the Vakıflar carpet. As known so far, the carpet depicted in Larkin's portrait is the last of its kind, and the last animal carpet seen in a Western European painting (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62,&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt; Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

The Batári-Crivelli fragment finds its parallel in two paintings by [[Carlo Crivelli]], the ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt and the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery]] (1486). Both paintings depict a carpet with a sixteen-pointed star motif, with some compartments containing highly stylised animal motifs.

"'''Free Thought and Official Propaganda'''" is a speech (and subsequent publication) delivered in 1922 by [[Bertrand Russell]] on the importance of unrestricted freedom of expression in society, and the problem of the state and [[political class]] interfering in this through control of education, fines, economic leverage, and distortion of evidence.

==Freedom of speech==
Russell starts out by describing the more common use of the term "free thought" to mean that one does not accept unquestioning belief in the popular religion of a region, or ideally of any religion at all. But he goes on to say that a more important and global kind of free thought is the freedom of pressure to believe any specific ideas, that one be allowed to have and express any opinion without penalty.

He notes that this is not allowed in any country at all, with the possible exception of China at that time. One could not, for example, immigrate to the US without swearing they are not an [[anarchist]] or [[polygamous]], and once inside must not be [[communist]]. In [[Great Britain]] he must not express disbelief in [[Christianity]], in Japan of [[Shintoism]].

Russell notes that countries like these may think of themselves as having freedom of expression, but that some ideas are so obviously "monstrous and immoral" that such tolerance does not apply to them. But, he points out, this is exactly the same view that allowed torture during the [[Inquisition]], that all ideas must be allowed to be expressed, no matter how obviously bad.

Next, Russell describes incidents in his own life that illustrate the lack of freedom of thought. 

# One is that his father was a Free Thinker (agnostic or atheist), who arranged for three year old Bertrand to be raised as a free thinker when he was dying, but that the courts had overridden this and forced him to be raised Christian. 
# In 1910 Russell failed to receive [[Liberal Party]] nomination for Parliament when the party's inner circle had learned he was agnostic.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/]
# When he became a lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Russell was not allowed to become a [[Fellow]] (like having tenure) because the establishment of the college didn't want to add an "anti-clerical" vote to the college government. When Russell subsequently expressed opposition to [[World War I]], he was fired.

This repression by the political class, Russell notes, is not limited to religion. Believers in [[free love]] or communism are treated even worse.

==Will to doubt==
{{cquote|What we need is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://suebrewton.com/2015/05/31/william-wordsworth-vs-bertrand-russell/ William Wordsworth vs. Bertrand Russell]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Next, Bertrand Russell describes importance of the [[will to doubt]].&lt;ref name="will"/&gt; In 1896, American philosopher [[William James]] had written about the [[will to believe]], and Russell uses this as a foil to express his own opposite position. James claimed that even without (or with conflicting) evidence, one might still simply ''choose' to believe in a thing — he cites Christianity — simply because one thinks the belief has beneficial outcomes. 

Russell, along with [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]] and others, responds to this by describing the ''will to doubt'', the choice to remain [[skeptic]]al because it is the more logical, rational position that will lead to understanding more truth, while a "will to believe" will inevitably bind one into untruths in some way. "None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth 18 in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate."&lt;ref name="free"/&gt;

As an example of the benefits of this kind of actual skepticism, Russell describe's [[Albert Einstein]]'s overturning of the conventional wisdom of [[physics]] at that time, comparing it to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] contradicting [[Biblical literalists]] of the previous century. 

What, Bertrand asks, if instead of overturning physics, Einstein had proposed something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?&lt;ref name="will"&gt;[https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/18/bertrand-russell-free-thought-propaganda-doubt/ The Will to Doubt: Bertrand Russell on Free Thought and Our Only Effective Self-Defense Against Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|English people would have found elements of Prussianism in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers favourable to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the Government of some backward country, where it would have 21 become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. '''This method is the logical outcome of William James’s will to believe.'''&lt;br/&gt;
What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assuming that the need for rational doubt or [[fallibilism]] is understood to be important, Russell then goes on to address the question of why irrational certainty is so common. He says this is largely because of three factors.

* '''Education''' — Instead of public education being used to teach children healthy learning attitudes, they are used for the opposite, to indoctrinate children with dogma, often patently false, even known to be false by the officials imposing the education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/03/07/never-die/ I Would Never Die for My Beliefs Because I Might Be Wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Propaganda''' — After being taught to read but not weigh evidence and form original opinions, children become adults who are then subjected to dubious or obviously false claims for the rest of their lives.
* '''Economic pressure''' — The State and political class will use its control of finances and economy to impose its ideas, by restricting the choices of those who disagree.

"'''He Gives Us All His Love'''" is a song written and performed by [[Randy Newman]].  It first appeared in the 1971 film ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', for which it served as a sort of theme song and played during the opening and closing credits. 

The ballad is both brief (being 1:52 in length) and very sparsely arranged.  It opens with the delicate sounds of a [[String instrument|string section]] and is maintained by Newman's [[piano]] in a slow "four to the bar" [[tempo]].

The song is [[gospel music|gospel]]-influenced and shares both musical and thematic similarities with such [[United States|American]] [[hymn]]s as ''[[Jesus Loves Me]]''.  It does not, however, discuss [[Christianity|Christian]] themes of [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] but merely gives a testament of faith ("he's lookin' down on us, from up above / and he's givin' us all his love").

The tone of the song is bittersweet; the succinct lyrics include the assertion that the divine witnesses human suffering ("he hears the [[infancy|babies]] crying / he sees the [[old age|old folks]] dying") and include the implication that being seen, and loved, might comfort.  More explicitly, the narrator tells the listener "...you can lean on him." As Newman himself is an [[atheism|atheist]] and regularly included satire in his compositions, the song can be interpreted through that lens as a sarcastic critique of religion, as it portrays a god who witnesses human suffering but merely "gives us all his love" while doing nothing tangible to intervene. Its presence in the film ''Cold Turkey'' certainly supports this ironical interpretation, since the song is played over the closing credits, as the town which has tried to be smoke-free for the duration of the movie is rewarded with a new factory, spewing smoke into the atmosphere.

The song has sometimes been taken at face value, however, and has been covered by [[Wanda Jackson]] and [[Sherie Rene Scott]], both  [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christians]].

It has also been covered by [[Roy Ayers]], [[Birtles &amp; Goble]] and others.  Some versions are extended to four minutes or more in length and few, if any, are as brief as Newman's original rendition.

==Re-release==

In the 2002 CD reissue of ''Sail Away'', this song is extended by three seconds.

In the belated 2007 CD issue of the ''Cold Turkey'' soundtrack (which was Newman's first film work, and had never been issued in any format to that time), the two original versions of this song as featured in the film were included (2:35" and 2:03"). In the first version as played over the film's opening credits, the song segues into a choral gospel number called "I Love the Lord"; this portion is omitted from the soundtrack.

'''Islam in Mozambique''' is the religion of approximately 17.9% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.sapo.mz/vida/noticias/artigo/1263687.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] Muslims are [[Sunni]] belonging to [[Shafi]] school of [[jurisprudence]], although some [[Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] Muslims are also registered. The Muslims consists primarily of indigenous Mozambicans, citizens of [[South Asian]] ([[India]]n and [[Pakistan]]i) descent, and a very small number of [[North Africa]]n and Middle Eastern immigrants.
[[Image:Mosque Mozambique Island.jpg|left|A [[mosque]] in [[Mozambique Island]]|thumb|180px]]

==Pre-colonial history==
Mozambique has long historic ties with the [[Muslim world]]. Initially by way of Sufi merchants, mostly from [[Yemen]], and centuries after through a more organized system of coastal trading cities, more heavily influenced by the [[Ibadi]] Muslims from [[Oman]] along the shores of Eastern Africa.

The arrival of the Arab trade in Mozambique dates to the fourth Hijri century when Muslims established small emirates on the coast of [[East Africa]]. Links between Islam and the chiefly clans in Mozambique have existed since the eighth century, when Islam made inroads into the northern Mozambican coast and became associated with the [[Shirazi people|Shirazi]] ruling elites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17116/ISIM_19_Islam_and_Chiefship_in_Northern_Mozambique.pdf?sequence=1|title = Islam and Chiefship in Northern Mozambique|last = Bonate|first = Liazzat J. K. Bonate|date = Spring 2007|journal = ISIM Review|issue=1|volume=19|pages=56-57|accessdate = 2014-06-10|doi = |ref = Bonate1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the founding of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] in the 10th CE century by [[Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi]], [[Islam]] had become a major religion in the region. The former port city of [[Sofala]], which became famous for its trade in ivory, timber, slaves, gold (by way of [[Great Zimbabwe]]) and Iron with the Islamic [[Middle East]] and [[India]], was one of the most important trading centers on the Mozambique coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sofala - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761595824/sofala.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrYydwp?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761595824/sofala.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sofala [https://web.archive.org/web/20070211222323/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Sofala] and much of the rest of coastal Mozambique was part of the Kilwa Sultanate from Arab arrival (believed to be the 12th century) until the Portuguese conquest in 1505.

During the subsequent period of the Omani [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Said]] dynasty, Muslim merchants expanded their trading zones south along the coast. It is believed that nearly all of the cities' inhabitants were Muslim before the arrival of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the 16th century.

==Colonial history==
Islam faced serious challenges in Mozambique during the colonial era. During the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' period (1926–1974), [[Roman Catholicism]] became the dominant religion following a formal alliance (Concordat) between the Church and the government. Only with the start of the [[Portuguese Colonial War|War of Liberation]] did the state lower its opposition to Islam and try to coopt the religion, in order to avoid an alliance between Muslims and the dissident liberation movement.

==Modern Mozambique==
[[File:Mesquita Maputo.jpg|thumb|175px|A mosque in Mozambique]]
Since the end of the socialist period (1989 onwards), Muslims have been able to proselytise freely and build new mosques. Muslims have also made their way into the parliament. Several [[South Africa]]n, [[Kuwait]]i and other Muslim agencies are active in Mozambique, with one important one being the [[African Muslim Agency]]. An Islamic University has been set up in [[Nampula]], with a branch in [[Inhambane]]. Mozambique is also an active member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC).

Rather than relying on the culturally loaded notions of a "chief" of régulo, the [[FRELIMO]] government has preferred to use the term "traditional authorities" to indicate a group of chiefs and their entourage of subordinate chiefs and healers. Realizing the social importance of this group, FRELIMO gradually reinstated "traditional authority."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the Muslim leadership in northern Mozambique seems to have recovered the "traditional" side of their authority and power with legal reforms, they are still largely associated with chiefship and African culture rather than Islam. Because of this they are barely able to access benefits or gain socio-political influence through Islamic platforms or organizations. This situation has been the source of their continual frustration and resistance to the alleged racial and cultural discrimination perpetrated by FRELIMO allied with southern Wahhabis, Afro-Indians, and Indians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Whereas Sudan, for instance, has made [[sharia]] the law of the land, Mozambique has made attempts to recognize both traditional and religious marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004|isbn=978-0028656038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Jain rituals''' play an everyday part in [[Jainism]].  [[Ritual]]s take place daily or more often. Rituals include obligations followed by Jains and various forms of idol worships.

Jains rituals can be separated broadly in two parts: ''Karya'' (Obligations which are followed) and ''Kriya'' (Worships which are performed).&lt;ref name=nsok&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six essential duties==
In Jainism, six essential duties (''avashyakas'') are prescribed for ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakas]]'' (householders).&lt;ref name=psja&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=188–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsom&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six duties are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Umasvami's Tattvārthsūtra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmx9bvtglkC|year=2011|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-2-1|quote=Non-Copyright|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Worship of ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' (five supreme beings)
#Following the preachings of Jain saints.
#Study of [[Jain scriptures]]
#''[[Samayika]]'': practising serenity and meditation
#Following discipline in their daily engagement
#Charity (''dāna'') of four kinds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangave|first=Vilas Adinath|title=Facets of Jainology: Selected Research Papers on Jain Society, Religion, and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzEQJHWUwXQC|year=2001|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-839-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=QzEQJHWUwXQC&amp;pg=PA157 157]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
##''Ahara-dāna''- donation of food
##''Ausadha-dāna''- donation of medicine
##''Jnana-dāna''- donation of knowledge
##''Abhaya-dāna''- saving the life of a living being or giving of protection to someone under threat

These duties became fundamental ritual activities of a [[Jain]] householder. Such as spreading the [[grain]] for the [[birds]] in the morning, and [[filter (water)|filtering]] or [[boiling]] the water for the next few hours' use became ritual acts of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] and [[non-violence]].&lt;ref name=psja/&gt; ''Samayika'' was used as a word for all spiritual activity including icon worship during medieval times.&lt;ref name=psja/&gt;

===Samayika===

Samayika is the practice of [[equanimity]], translating to [[meditation]].  It is a ritual act undertaken early in the morning and perhaps also at noon and night. It lasts for forty-eight minutes (Two [[Hindu units of measurement|Ghadi]]s) and usually involves not only quiet recollection but also usually the repetition of routine [[prayers]].
The ritual is chanting and also praying about the good things.&lt;ref name=psja/&gt;

===Pratikramana===

Pratikramana is performed in the morning for the [[repentance]] of [[violence]] committed during the night, and in the evening for the violence during the day and additionally on certain days of the year. During this, the Jain expresses remorse for the harm caused, or wrongdoing, or the duties left undone.&lt;ref name=psja/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual and lifetime obligations==
There are eleven annual obligations for a year and some obligations for once in a life which should be completed by Jain lay person individually or in a group. They are prescribed by ''Shravak Pragyapti''.&lt;ref name=nsoo&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=173–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===11 annual obligations===
They are following:&lt;ref name="nsoo" /&gt;
# ''Deva dravya'' : Fundraising for temples
# ''Mahapuja'' : Elaborate ritual in which temples and icons decorated and sacred texts recited 
# ''Ratri-jagarana'' : singing hymns and religious observance throughout night
# ''Sadharmik Bhakti'': Deep respect to fellow follower of [[Jainism]]
# ''Sangha-puja'': service to [[Sangha (Jainism)|Sangha]]
# ''Shuddhi'' : confession of faults
# ''Snatra puja'' : a ritual related to [[Panch Kalyanaka|Janma Kalyanaka]]
# ''Sutra-puja'' : veneration of scriptures
# ''Tirth prabhavana'' : promotion of Jainism. by celebrating important occasion
# ''Udyapana'' : displaying objects of worship and participant at end of religious activities
# ''Yatratnika'' or ''Yatratrik'' : Participation in religious festivals and pilgrimage to three sites

===Obligations performed at least once in a lifetime===
They are the following:&lt;ref name="nsoo"/&gt;
# Build a temple
# Celebrate renunciation of a family member
# Donate a [[Tirthankara]] icon to a temple
# Participate in [[Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha]]

==Worship==

''Devapuja'' means worship of [[tirthankara]]s. It is usually done in front of images of any liberated soul ([[Siddha#Siddha#Siddha in Jainism|Siddha]]) such as Tirthankara, or [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]. In Jainism, the [[Tirthankara]]s represent the true goal of all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich|title=Philosophies Of India |year=1953|editor=Joseph Campbell|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |location=London, E.C. 4 |url=https://archive.org/details/Philosophy.of.India.by.Heinrich.Zimmer |isbn=978-8120807396|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their qualities are worshipped by the Jains.

[[Sthanakavasi]] oppose idol worship. They believe in meditation and silent prayers.&lt;ref name=psjb&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=191–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain idols are seen as a personification of ideal state which one should attain.&lt;ref name=psjb/&gt;

During medieval period, worship of some [[Yaksha#Yaksha and Yakshini in Jainism|Yaksha and Yakshini]], [[God in Jainism#Heavenly Beings|heavenly beings]] who are not liberated souls, started. They are believed to help a person by removing obstacles in life.&lt;ref name=psjb/&gt;

Elaborate forms of ritual usually done in the temple. Jains wear clean three clothes for many rituals and enter temple with words related to respect for [[Tirthankara]]. He bows down to Tirthankara at main shrine and will circumambulate him three times.&lt;ref name=psjb/&gt;

Jain form of worship is also called ''Jain Puja''. The worship is done in two ways:&lt;ref name=nsap&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Dravya puja'' (worship with materials)
* ''Bhava puja'' (Psychic worship, no need of materials)

Jains worship the God, the scripture and the saint.{{sfn|Jain|1926|p=1}}

===Dravya Puja===
''Dravya puja'' (worship with articles) includes ''Ashtaprakari Puja''(means ''eight worships'') which is done by paying homage with eight articles in prescribed way. It is also called ''archana'':&lt;ref name=nsap/&gt;&lt;ref name=psjc&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=196–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following articles are used, in the Jaina Puja:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Puja !! Material used !!  Purpose
|-
| ''Jala'' || Pure water || Get rid of cycle of life and death,i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Chandana'' || Sandalwood diluted in water || Get rid of (metamorphic) heat of this life i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Akshata'' || Uncooked rice || To get something which doesn't decay i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Pushpa'' || Colored uncooked rice representing flowers or real flowers in some beliefs || Freedom from passions and worldly desires i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Naivedhya'' || Dry coconut shell or sweets in some beliefs || Freedom from greed.
|-
| ''Deepak'' || Colored coconut shell or Lamp in some beliefs || Omniscience, to destroy the darkness of delusions.
|-
| ''Dhupa'' || cloves, sandalwood powder or Incense stick || To get rid of karmas i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Fala'' || Fruits like dry complete almond, cloves, cardamom or even green fruits in some beliefs || Liberation of soul i.e., Moksha
|-
| ''Arghya'' || Mixture of all of the above || Moksha

The combination of all the eight articles is called ''arghya''. Of these, rice and coconut bits and almonds are to be washed and then all the articles are to be placed in a plate side by side, excepting water which is to be kept in a small pot separately. There should be provided a bowl for the pouring of water, another for the burning of incense, and a receptacle for lighting camphor.{{sfn|Jain|1926|p=Introduction}}

After that some Jains also use ''Chamara'' (Whisk), ''Darpana'' (Mirror) and a ''Pankho'' ([[Hand fan]]) also for worship.&lt;ref name=nsap/&gt;

===Bhava Puja===

''Bhava puja''(means Psychic worship) is done by ritual called ''Chaitya Vandana''. It includes number of prayers and rituals done in prescribed manner and positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aarti and Mangal Deevo===
''[[Aarti]]'' and ''Mangal Deevo'' is a lamp ritual waving it in rotational manner in front of icons same as [[Hindu]] traditions. Lamps represent knowledge. It is performed everynight at all [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms===
Many other forms of worships are mainly performed on special occasions.&lt;ref name=nsdg&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=181–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some forms of worships have close relationship with these five auspicious life events of [[Tirthankara]] called [[Panch Kalyanaka]].&lt;ref name=psjc/&gt;

# '''[[Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha|Panch Kalyanak Pratishtha Mahotsava]]:''' When a new [[Jain Temple]] is erected, these Five Auspicious Life Events are celebrated known as ''Panch Kalyanak Pratishtha Mahotsava''. After these an icons of [[Tirthankara]] gets a status of real [[Tirthankara]] which can be worshipped by Jains.&lt;ref name=psjc/&gt;
# '''Panch Kalyanak Puja''':This ritual solemnizes all five Kalyanaka. It was narrated by Pandit Virvijay.&lt;ref name=psjc/&gt;
# '''Snatra Puja''': Snatra Puja is a ritual related to birth of [[Tirthankara]] are bathed symbolising [[Indra#In Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism and Bali|Indra]] doing [[Abhisheka]] on [[Tirthankara]] on [[Mount Meru]] after birth of [[Tirthankara]]. It performed before many other rituals and before starting of new enterprises, birthdays.&lt;ref name=psjc/&gt;

Others are:&lt;ref name=nsdg/&gt;
# '''Adhara Abhisheka'''(18 [[Abhisheka]]: It is temple purification ceremony. 18 urns of different pure water, herbs etc. used to clean all icons for purification. It is performed periodically.
# '''Antaraya Karma Puja''': It comprises a series of prayers to remove those [[karmas]] which obstruct the spiritual uplifting power of the soul.
# '''Arihanta Mahapujan''': paying respect to the [[Arihant (Jainism)|arihants]].

==Observances==

He is known for his energetic [[slapstick]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanlin|first=Calum|title=Throwback Thursday: Jim Carrey at 20|url=http://www.cbc.ca/live/throwback-thursday-jim-carrey-at-20.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey first gained recognition in America in 1990 after landing a recurring role in the [[sketch comedy]] television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.

In the 2000s, he gained further popularity for his portrayal of the [[Grinch]] in ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' and for the comedy ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'' (both in 2000), as well as ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003), ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) for which he was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004), ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' (2005), ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008), ''[[Horton Hears a Who!

==Early life==
Carrey was born in the [[Toronto]] suburb of [[Newmarket, Ontario]], Canada,&lt;ref name=cbcbirth /&gt; to Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/03_issues/030525/030525carrey.html |title=USA WEEKEND Magazine |work=USA Weekend |date=May 25, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/1/Jim-Carrey.html |title=Jim Carrey Biography (1962–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a Roman Catholic and has three older siblings: John, Patricia, and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig |first=Claudia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-05-20-carrey_x.htm |title=Spiritual Carrey still mighty funny |work=USA Today |date=May 27, 2003 |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieline.com/1994/07/carreyd-away.php?page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120908072700/http://www.movieline.com/1994/07/carreyd-away.php?page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |title=Jim Carrey: Carrey'd Away |publisher=[[Movieline]] |date=January 7, 1994 |accessdate=October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish descent and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry (the family's original surname was ''Carré'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimcarreyonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=75657&amp;sid=c288b4a04f1da0728280242f21ef58de |title=Jim Carrey Online • View topic&amp;nbsp;– Scottish Interview &amp; Clip |publisher=Jimcarreyonline.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stated"&gt;{{YouTube|cpEfiRUu64Q|Stated}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}} on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book | author = Knelman, Martin. | title=Jim Carrey: The Joker Is Wild (2000) | publisher=U.S.: Firefly Books Ltd. | page = 8 | isbn = 1-55209-535-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 10, Carrey wrote a letter to [[Carol Burnett]] of the ''[[Carol Burnett Show]]'' pointing out that he was already a master of [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]] and should be considered for a role on the show; he was overjoyed when he received a [[form letter]] reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/jim-carrey-we-love-breathing-what-youre-burning-baby|publisher=Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee|first=Jerry|last=Seinfeld|year=2016|title=Jim Carry: We Love Breathing What You're Burning Baby|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512035503/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/jim-carrey-we-love-breathing-what-youre-burning-baby|archivedate=May 12, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey lived in north [[Scarborough, Ontario]] (in historic home next to the then Titan Wheels factory and attended Grade 10 at [[Agincourt Collegiate Institute]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://poplyft.com/the-family-lived-in-a-van-jim-carrey-beat-the-odds/&lt;/ref&gt; North York (attended Blessed Trinity Catholic Elementary School) and [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], Ontario for eight years, and attended [[Aldershot School|Aldershot High School]]. In a ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'' interview (February 2007), Carrey said, "If my career in show business hadn't panned out I would probably be working today in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Ontario, at the [[Dofasco]] steel mill." When looking across the Burlington Bay toward Hamilton, he could see the mills and thought, "Those were where the great jobs were."&lt;ref name=JIMSTEEL&gt;{{Cite news| last=Holt|first=Jim|title=Its all in the numbers: Jim Carrey could be at Dofasco if Hollywood hadn't worked out|newspaper=The Hamilton Spectator|pages=Go14|date=February 26, 2007| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
While Carrey was struggling to obtain work and make a name for himself, his father tried to help the young comedian put together a stage act, driving him to [[Toronto]] to debut at [[comedy club]] [[Yuk Yuk's]].&lt;ref name="ref94"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Carrey Biography |url=http://94.236.123.155:8082/biographies/jim-carrey.html |work=Bio |publisher=Bio |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725203210/http://94.236.123.155:8082/biographies/jim-carrey.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey's impersonations bombed and this gave him doubts about his capabilities as a professional entertainer. His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's ambitions.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Eventually, the family's financial problems were resolved and they moved into a new home.&lt;ref name="ref94" /&gt; With more domestic stability, Carrey returned to the stage with a more polished act. In a short period of time, he went from open-mic nights to regular paid shows, building his reputation in the process. A reviewer in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' raved that Carrey was "a genuine star coming to life".&lt;ref&gt;"Up, up goes a new comic star", Bruce Blackadar, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 27, 1981, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey was soon noticed by comedian [[Rodney Dangerfield]], who signed the young comic to open his tour performances. Dangerfield eventually brought Carrey to Las Vegas. However, Carrey soon decided to move to Hollywood, where he began performing at [[The Comedy Store]] and, in 1982, appeared on the televised stand-up show ''[[The Improv|An Evening at the Improv]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evening at the Improv|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401003/fullcredits|work=IMDB|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he debuted his act on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|title=Carrey: 'Life Is Too Beautiful'|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-656547.html|work=CBS News|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his increasing popularity as a stand-up comic, Carrey turned his attention to the film and television industries, auditioning to be a cast member for the [[Saturday Night Live (season 6)|1980–81 season]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]].'' Carrey was not selected for the position, although he later hosted the show in [[Saturday Night Live (season 21)|May 1996]], [[Saturday Night Live (season 36)|January 2011]], and [[Saturday Night Live (season 40)|October 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGlynn|first=Katla|title=Jim Carrey Spoofs 'Black Swan' on 'SNL'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/09/jim-carrey-black-swan_n_806425.html|work=Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 25, 2012|date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Elizabeth Barber|title=Jim Carrey Is Booked to Host Saturday Night Live on Oct. 25|url=http://time.com/3501079/jim-carrey-booked-host-october-25-snl-saturday-night-live/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 10, 2014|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Carrey was in the short-lived sitcom ''[[The Duck Factory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0086702|The Duck Factory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1994, Carrey was a regular cast member of the ensemble comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/tv-news/top-5-jim-carrey-characters-living-color|title=The Top 5 Jim Carrey Characters from In Living Color|date=2017-06-13|work=TVOvermind|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–1997: Rise to fame===
1994 was a break-out year for Carrey. He appeared in the lead roles in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'' and ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Mask| work = | publisher = rogerebert.com| date = July 29, 1994| url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940729/REVIEWS/407290304/1023| format =| doi = | accessdate =August 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dumb and Dumber'' was a commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D6153BF930A35752C0A963958260 | work=The New York Times | title='Dumb and Dumber' Tops Holiday Film Grosses | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=January 3, 1995 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for his work in ''The Mask''.

[[File:Jim-Carrey-2008.jpg|thumb|Carrey in [[Madrid]], Spain, on December 13, 2008]]

In 1995, Carrey co-starred in the [[Joel Schumacher]]-directed [[superhero film]] ''[[Batman Forever]]'', in which [[Batman]] tries to stop [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]] (played by Carrey) in their villainous scheme to drain information from all the brains in [[Gotham City]]. The feature received poor reviews, with most criticism aimed at the movie's "blatant [[commercialism]]", as characterized by [[Peter Travers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948895/review/5948896/batman_forever | title = Batman Forever | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = December 8, 2000 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, Carrey reprised his role as [[Ace Ventura]] in ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]''. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but heavily criticised by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend.&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aceventura2.htm |title=Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey earned $20 million for his next film, ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' (1996). Directed by [[Ben Stiller]], the film was a [[satire|satirical]] [[black comedy]], in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by [[Matthew Broderick]]). The role was a departure from the "hapless, hyper, overconfident" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey's change of tone from previous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cable_guy |title=The Cable Guy&amp;nbsp;– Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey also starred in the music video of the film's closing song, "[[Leave Me Alone (Jerry Cantrell song)|Leave Me Alone]]" by [[Jerry Cantrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQExlqz6slk |title=Jerry Cantrell - Leave Me Alone |website=YouTube |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reviews, ''The Cable Guy'' grossed $102 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cableguy.htm |title=The Cable Guy (1996) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=August 30, 1996 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon bounced back in 1997 with the critically acclaimed comedy ''[[Liar Liar]]'', playing Fletcher Reede, a successful lawyer who has built his career on lying, regularly breaking promises that he makes to his son, Max. Max soon makes a birthday wish that for just that one day, his dad would not be able to lie. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally turns up in a straightforward comic vehicle, and the results are much wilder and funnier than this mundane material should have allowed."&lt;ref&gt;Maslin, Janet.

===1998–2006: Critical acclaim===
The following year he decided to take a pay cut to play the serious role of [[The Truman Show|Truman Burbank]] in the satirical [[comedy-drama]] film ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/truman_show/ |title=The Truman Show Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was highly praised and brought Carrey further international acclaim, leading many to believe he would be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]].&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;{{cite news | author = Svetkey, Benjamin | title = The Truman Pro | publisher = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date = June 5, 1998 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283442,00.html | accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he did pick up his first Golden Globe Award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama]].

A [[Film4]] critic stated that the film "allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy", adding that it was "a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film4 Review|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/truman_show/reviews/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Film4|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Carrey appeared as a fictionalized version of himself on the final episode of [[Garry Shandling]]'s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', in which he deliberately ripped into [[Larry Sanders (character)|Shandling's character]]. In 1999, Carrey had the lead role in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. He portrayed comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] to critical acclaim and received his second Golden Globe in a row.

Carrey played the role of state trooper Charlie Baileygates, who has [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] and romances a woman portrayed by [[Renée Zellweger]]. That same year, Carrey starred in the second highest-grossing Christmas film of all time, ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'', playing the [[title character]], for which he received both praise and criticism from critics alongside a Golden Globe nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas/ | title=How the Grinch Stole Christmas | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his next feature film, Carrey starred opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] in [[Tom Shadyac]]'s international hit comedy ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' (2003). Carrey played a TV newsman who unexpectedly receives God's [[Omnipotence|omnipotent abilities]] when the deity decides to take a vacation. The film received mixed reviews upon release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bruce_almighty/|title=Bruce Almighty|date=May 23, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but despite this still became a financial success, earning over $484 million worldwide, and going on to become the seventeenth highest-grossing live action comedy of all time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | title = Box Office Mojo&amp;nbsp;– Bruce Almighty | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brucealmighty.htm | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher = Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood.com's Highest Grossing Comedy Films of All Time List|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Hollywoodcoms_Highest_Grossing_Comedy_Films_of_All_Time_List/3467963|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey's next appearance was in the 2004 black comedy fantasy film ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', which was based on the popular children's novels [[A Series of Unfortunate Events|of the same name]]. The film was positively received; [[Desson Thomson]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said of Carrey's approach to the character of [[Count Olaf]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Desson Thomson |first=Deeson |last=Thomson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4634-2004Dec16.html |title=A Fortunate Series of Scenes |date=April 17, 2004 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lemony_snicket/ |title=Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; That same year, Carrey was inducted into the [[Canadian Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Carrey, 2004 inductee |url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame |accessdate=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106114251/http://canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/jim-carrey |archivedate=November 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–present: Continued success===
In 2007, Carrey reunited with [[Joel Schumacher]], director of ''[[Batman Forever]]'', for ''[[The Number 23]]'', a psychological thriller co-starring [[Virginia Madsen]] and [[Danny Huston]]. In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the [[23 enigma|number 23]], after finding a book about a man with the same obsession. The film was panned by critics. The following year Carrey provided his voice for [[Dr. Seuss]]' ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). Carrey voiced the beloved elephant for the CGI-animated feature, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews and delivered family crowds [[en masse]]. The film was also a box office success, raking in over $290 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/horton-hears-a-who2008/ |title=Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year, Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite [[Zooey Deschanel]] and [[Bradley Cooper]] in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008). Carrey played down-and-out man, Carl Allen, who had gone nowhere in life, thanks to always saying no to everything, until he signs up for a self-help program that teaches him the power of saying yes. Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' stated, "''Yes Man'' is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article/ | title=Miami Herald ''Yes Man'' Review | work=[[The Miami Herald]] | date=December 19, 2008 | accessdate=December 21, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503130332/http://www.miami.com/yes-man-pg-13-article | archivedate=May 3, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a decent performance at the box office, earning $225 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=yesman.htm | title=Yes Man (2008) | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, Carrey's work has included a leading role in [[Glenn Ficarra]] and [[John Requa]]'s ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', premiering in January 2009 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] before receiving a wide release in February 2010. Carrey portrayed [[Steven Jay Russell]], a [[con artist]], imposter, and multiple prison escapee who falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris (played by [[Ewan McGregor]]). The film received largely positive reviews, with Damon Wise of ''[[The Times]]'' giving the film four stars out of five, stating, "''I Love You Phillip Morris'' is an extraordinary film that serves as a reminder of just how good Carrey can be when he's not tied into a generic Hollywood crowd-pleaser. His comic timing remains as exquisite as ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article5548068.ece |title=I Love You Phillip Morris at the Sundance Film Festival, Utah |publisher=The Times |author=Wise, Damon |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 19, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]], the film also starred [[Robin Wright Penn]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Cary Elwes]].

In 2011, Carrey landed the lead role in ''[[Mr. Popper's Penguins (film)|Mr. Popper's Penguins]]'', playing Thomas "Tom" Popper Jr. a realtor who becomes the caretaker of a family of penguins.

In 2013, he starred alongside former co-star [[Steve Carell]] in the [[Don Scardino]]-directed comedy film ''[[The Incredible Burt Wonderstone]]''. Carrey played Steve Gray, a dangerous street magician who overshadows the formerly successful magician Burt Wonderstone (played by Carell).

In 2013, he appeared in  ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]''  as Colonel Stars and Stripes. He retracted support for the film two months prior to its release. He issued a statement via his Twitter account that, in light of the shootings at [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary]], "Now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/dailyfirst/135434_Jim_Carrey_Bashes_Kick_Ass_2_For_Being_Violent/index.html|title=Jim Carrey Bashes 'Kick-Ass 2' For Its Violence|author=WILLIS,JACKIE|date=June 24, 2013|publisher=ET Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827101241/http://www.etonline.com/dailyfirst/135434_Jim_Carrey_Bashes_Kick_Ass_2_For_Being_Violent/index.html|archivedate=August 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 19, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Carrey announced that he had written a children's book titled ''How Roland Rolls'', about a scared wave named Roland.

In April 2010, the two ended their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Jim-Carrey-And-Jenny-McCarthy-Announce-Split-After-Five-Years-Together/Article/201004115596449?f=rss |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629044704/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Jim-Carrey-And-Jenny-McCarthy-Announce-Split-After-Five-Years-Together/Article/201004115596449?f=rss |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Jim Carrey And Jenny McCarthy Announce Split After Five Years Together |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the split and media circulations, in October 2010 McCarthy said, "Jim and I are still good friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jenny McCarthy: Jim and I are still good friends|url=http://www.scoopcelebrity.com/jenny-mccarthy-jim-good-friends|work=Scoop Celebrity|accessdate=April 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601002233/http://www.scoopcelebrity.com/jenny-mccarthy-jim-good-friends|archivedate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2015, Carrey's former girlfriend Cathriona White, a native of [[County Tipperary]], Ireland, was found dead from a prescription drug [[overdose]]. The couple first met in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11899510/Jim-Carreys-girlfriend-Cathriona-White-dies-aged-30.html|title=Jim Carrey's girlfriend Cathriona White dies, aged 30|date=September 29, 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Carrey's ex-girlfriend-dead-in-suspected-suicide|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/29/jim-carreys-ex-girlfriend-dead-in-suspected-suicide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey was a [[pallbearer]] at her funeral in [[Cappawhite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jim-carrey-attends-funeral-late-831197|title=Jim Carrey Attends Funeral of Late Girlfriend Cathriona White, Carries Coffin|author=Natalie Stone|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2016, Mark Burton, White's husband from 2013 until her death, filed a [[wrongful death]] lawsuit against Carrey, claiming that he had used his "immense wealth and celebrity status" to illegally obtain and distribute prescription drugs involved in her death. Carrey released a statement the following day: {{quote|text=What a terrible shame. It would be easy for me to get in a back room with this man's lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life when you have to stand up and defend your honor against the evil in this world. I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman I loved. Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic end was beyond anyone's control. I really hope that some day soon people will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/09/19/jim-carrey-sued-wrongful-death-girlfriend/90704556|title=Jim Carrey sued for wrongful death of girlfriend|author=Puente, Maria|website=[[USA Today]]|date=September 19, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/jim-carrey-sued-over-former-girlfriends-suicide-cathriona-white|title=Jim Carrey sued over former girlfriend's suicide|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 20, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October 2016, White's mother, Brigid Sweetman, also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cathriona-whites-mom-sues-jim-carrey-for-wrongful-death-w444401|title=Cathriona White's Mom, Brigid Sweetman, Sues Jim Carrey for Daughter's Wrongful Death|website=Us Weekly|first=Sierra|last=Marquina|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this suit, Sweetman's attorney states that Carrey underwent a test for [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and "purposely hid the results from Ms. White, whom he was intimately involved with, and failed to inform her that he had tested positive for [[hepatitis A]], HSV ([[herpes]]) I and II, and [[chlamydia]]. To make matters worse, Carrey then proceeded to have unprotected sex with Ms. White with full knowledge that he was STD positive."&lt;ref name=std&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrities-gone-bad/jim-carrey-alleged-std-test-has-been-submitted-as-evidence/news-story/a3cb917d20ce8a954da2ca593d3c0901|title=Jim Carrey alleged STD test has been submitted as evidence|website=News.com.au|date=October 22, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweetman herself later issued a statement: "These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the public and the court. Carrey has now been shown for what he is — a dishonest Hollywood celebrity who thinks he can say anything and fool people just because he is famous."&lt;ref name=std/&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed on January 25, 2018, and attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLevy|first1=Alex|title=Court dismisses wrongful death lawsuit against Jim Carrey|url=https://www.avclub.com/court-dismisses-wrongful-death-lawsuit-against-jim-carr-1822630778|website=The A.V.

===Citizenship===
Carrey received [[U.S. citizenship]] in October 2004 and remains a [[dual citizen]] of the United States and his native Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Jim Carrey Becomes New U.S. Citizen|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,714343,00.html|work=People.com|accessdate=September 10, 2011|date=October 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Carrey believes the [[MMR vaccine controversy|MMR vaccine]] causes [[autism]], a fraudulent claim advanced by [[Andrew Wakefield]] so the now-discredited scientist could attempt to enrich himself. In 2009, Carrey wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination and vaccine research for ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html |title=Jim Carrey: The Judgment on Vaccines Is In??? |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With former partner [[Jenny McCarthy]], Carrey led a "Green Our Vaccines" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of toxic substances from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children had received "too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758 |publisher=ABC News |title=Celeb Couple to Lead 'Green Vaccine' Rally |first1=Jonann |last1=Brady |first2=Stephanie |last2=Dahle |date=June 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was criticized by [[David Gorski]], an American [[surgical oncologist]] on ''[[Science-Based Medicine]]'' blog for being anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/jenny-mccarthy-jim-carrey-and-green-our-vaccines-anti-vaccine-not-pro-safe-vaccine/ |title=Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and "Green Our Vaccines": Anti-vaccine, not "pro-safe vaccine" |work=Science Based Medicine |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Steven Parker on [[WebMD]] website for being "irresponsible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-children/2008/06/green-our-vaccines.html |title=Green Our Vaccines? |work=WebMD |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a [[California Senate Bill 277|new vaccination law]], Carrey called [[California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] a "corporate [[Fascist (insult)|fascist]]" who was poisoning children by enacting the vaccination requirements.&lt;ref name=fascist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-actor-jim-carrey-vaccines-20150701-story.html |title=Jim Carrey calls Gov. Brown a 'fascist' for signing new vaccination law |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law disallowed religious and philosophical reasons for exemption from vaccination. Carrey was criticized for being "ignorant when it comes to vaccines" by [[Arthur Caplan]], head of the Division of Medical Ethics, at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/commentary-why-jim-carrey-wrong-about-vaccines-n385321 |title=Ethicist: Why Jim Carrey is Wrong About Vaccines |work=NBCnews |accessdate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Jeffrey Kluger]], senior writer at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', who described his anti-vaccination statements as "angry, dense and immune to reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3944067/jim-carrey-vaccines/ |title=Ethicist: Jim Carrey, Please Shut Up About Vaccines |work=Times Magazine |accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey believes in and advocates for the so-called "[[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]]". In an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] on February 17, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|nPU5bjzLZX0|What Oprah Learned from Jim Carrey – Oprah's Lifeclass – Oprah Winfrey Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use [[Creative visualization|visualization]] techniques to get work. He also stated that he visualized a $10,000,000 check given to him for "acting services rendered", placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a $10,000,000 check for his role in ''Dumb and Dumber.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahs-lifeclass/what-oprah-learned-from-jim-carrey-video|title=What Oprah Learned from Jim Carrey|newspaper=Oprah.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrey has been showing his own [[political cartoon]] drawings since August 2017, including controversial renderings of White House Press Secretary [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] and President [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/03/19/a-short-history-of-jim-carreys-burgeoning-career-as-an-anti-trump-political-cartoonist/&lt;/ref&gt; His show titled "IndigNation" opened on October 23, 2018 at the Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles and features 108 pen-and-ink drawings from Carrey's Twitter feed from 2016-2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/jim-carrey-trump-political-cartoons/index.html|title=Jim Carrey targets Trump with blunt political cartoons|date=2018-11-14|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Raleigh Mott''' (May 25, 1865 – January 31, 1955) was an evangelist and long-serving leader of the Young Men's Christian Association ([[YMCA]]) and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (WSCF).  He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1946 for his work in establishing and strengthening international Protestant [[Christianity|Christian]] student organizations that worked to [[peace movement|promote peace]]. He shared the prize with [[Emily Balch]]. From 1895 until 1920 Mott was the General Secretary of the WSCF. Intimately involved in the formation of the [[World Council of Churches]] in 1948, that body elected him as a lifelong honorary President.  His best-known book, ''The Evangelization of the World in this Generation'', became a missionary slogan in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cracknell &amp; White, 233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Mott was born in [[Livingston Manor, New York]], [[Sullivan County, New York]] on May 25, 1865, and his family moved to [[Postville, Iowa]] in September of the same year. He attended [[Upper Iowa University]], where he studied history and was an award-winning student debater. He transferred to [[Cornell University]], where he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1888. He was influenced by [[Arthur Tappan Pierson]] one of the forces behind the [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]], which was founded in 1886. Mott married Leila Ada White (1866-1952) in 1891 and had two sons and two daughters.

In 1910, Mott, an [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist]] layperson, presided at the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]], which was an important milestone in the modern [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christian)|missions movement]] and some say the modern [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movement]].

Mott and a colleague were offered free passage on the ''[[Titanic]]'' in 1912 by a [[White Star Line]] official who was interested in their work, but they declined and took the more humble liner the [[SS Lapland]]. According to a biography by C. Howard Hopkins, upon hearing of the news in [[New York City]], the two men looked at each other and remarked that, "The Good Lord must have more work for us to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Seven Famous People Who Missed the Titanic | author=Greg Daugherty| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Seven-Famous-People-Who-Missed-the-Titanic.html|  date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After touring Europe and promoting ecumenism, Mott traveled to Asia where, from October 1912 to May 1913, he held a series of 18 regional and national conferences, including in Ceylon, India, Burma, Malaya, China, Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Ecumenical Movement 1517-1848, 2d edition, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked with [[Robert Hallowell Gardiner III]] to maintain relations with the Russian Orthodox Church, and Archbishops Tikhon after the Russian Revolution.

From 1920 until 1928, Mott served as the WSCF Chairperson. For his labors in both missions and ecumenism, as well as for peace, some historians consider him to be "the most widely traveled and universally trusted Christian leader of his time".&lt;ref&gt;Cracknell &amp; White, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The papers of John R. Mott are held at the Yale Divinity School Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/divinity.045 Yale University Divinity School Library]. hdl.handle.net&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--He retired to [[Orlando, Florida]] and lived at 528 E. Washington Street. It was there he learned he had won the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Veneration==
Mott is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on October 3.

'''Joseph Fort Newton''' (1876–1950) was an American [[Baptist]] minister.

He was born in [[Decatur, Texas]], the son of a Baptist minister turned attorney. He attended [[Southern Baptist Seminary]], and [[Harvard University]]. While at Harvard he studied under [[William James]]. Newton held the honorary degrees of Doctor of Hebrew Literature ([[Coe College]], 1912), Doctor of Divinity ([[Tufts University]], 1919), Doctor of Humane Letters ([[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]], 1926), and Doctor of Laws ([[Temple University]], 1929).

Newton was ordained a Baptist minister in 1895. He held Baptist pastorates in Texas, and led non-sectarian and [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]] congregations in Illinois and Iowa. While in Iowa, he taught English literature at the extension campus of the University of Iowa in Cedar Rapids. While in Cedar Rapids, many of Newton's sermons were published and gained wide circulation. Their popularity in England led him to be called to the pulpit of the [[City Temple (London)]] in 1916. During his four years at City Temple, he made trips throughout the British Isles and gained international fame&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=J. F. Newton Dies, Pulpit Orator, 73|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 Jan 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; through sermons in which he urged understanding between England and the United States as a basis of world order and abiding peace.

In 1920, Newton returned to the United States and assumed the pulpit at the [[Fourth Universalist Society of New York|Church of the Divine Paternity]], New York City, NY. While there Newton served as an editor of the [[Christian Century]], edited the ''Best Sermons of the Year'' series, and preached at colleges and universities across the United States.

At the invitation of the [[Diocese of Pennsylvania]] Bishop Thomas J. Garland, Newton entered the ministry of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in September 1925, and came to the Memorial Church of St. Paul, [[Overbrook Farms, Philadelphia|Overbrook]], Philadelphia, PA, as a "special minister." He was ordained as a priest in 1926 at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia]], PA. Newton remained at the Memorial Church of St. Paul until 1930. From 1930 to 1938, Newton assisted the Rev. Dr. John C. H. Mockridge at St. James Church, Philadelphia, PA. In 1938 he assumed the rectorship of [[Church of St. Luke and The Epiphany (Philadelphia)|Church of St. Luke and The Epiphany, Philadelphia, PA]], where he remained until his death in 1950. In 1939, Newton was ranked among the top 5 Protestant Clergyman in the United States. From 1944 until his death, Newton reviewed religious books and wrote a Saturday sermon column for the [[Philadelphia Evening Bulletin]]. Newton authored over 30 books, perhaps his most famous being ''The Builders: A Story and Study of Freemasonry'', published in 1914, and translated into six different languages. ''The Builders'' is still regarded as one of the best books on the topic.

'''Khurshid''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''𐭧𐭥𐭫(𐭧)𐭱𐭩𐭲‎'', ''Khwar(kh)šēd''; [[Mazandarani language|Tabari]]/{{lang-fa|اسپهبد خورشید}}, '''Spāhbed Khōrshīd''' 'General Khorshid'; 734–761), erroneously designated '''Khurshid II''' by earlier scholars, was the last [[Dabuyid]] ''[[ispahbadh]]'' of [[Tabaristan]]. He succeeded to the throne at an early age, and was supervised by his uncle as regent until he reached the age of fourteen. Khurshid tried to assert his independence from his vassalage to the [[Caliphate]], supported various rebellions and maintained diplomatic contacts with [[Tang China]]. Finally, the [[Abbasids]] conquered his country in 759–760, and captured most members of his family. Khurshid fled to [[Daylam]], where he ended his life.

== Biography ==
[[File:Tabaristan-EN.svg|thumb|right|250px| Map of Tabaristan and its neighbouring territories]]
Khurshid was born in 734/735, the son of [[Dadhburzmihr]] or Dadmihr (died 740) and grandson of [[Farrukhan the Great]] (died ca. 728), the first ruler (''[[ispahbadh]]'')  of the [[Dabuyid]] dynasty from whose reign coins are known.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Rekaya (1986), pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Madelung (1993), pp. 541–544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 312–313&lt;/ref&gt; According to the traditional account, the Dabuyids had established themselves as the quasi-independent rulers of [[Tabaristan]] in the 640s, during the tumults of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] and the collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. They owed only the payment tribute and nominal vassalage to the [[Arab Caliphate]], and managed, despite repeated Muslim attempts at invasion, to maintain their autonomy by exploiting the inaccessible terrain of their country.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent interpretation of the sources by P. Pourshariati, however, supports that Farrukhan was the one who actually established the family's rule over Tabaristan, sometime in the 670s.&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 308–313&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier works on the dynasty, Khurshid is named Khurshid II, due to erroneous interpretation of numismatic evidence, which led earlier scholars to interpolate a first Khurshid before Farrukhan, whose rule was thought to have begun ca. 710.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

Khurshid succeeded his father at the age of only six, and for eight years the regency was exercised by his uncle Farrukhan-i Kuchak ("[[Farrukhan the Little]]"). When Khurshid came of age, Farrukhan's own sons refused to recognize his claim and tried to usurp the throne. Their plot was allegedly betrayed to Khurshid by a slave girl, Varmja Haraviya. With the help of the sons of his cousin Jushnas, Khurshid managed to defeat and imprison Farrukhan's sons. He later took Varmja Haraviya as his wife, while the sons of Jushnas were given high positions in the state.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 313–314&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ibn Isfandiyar]] gives a vivid description of the prosperity of Tabaristan at this time, which was a major centre for textile production (including silk), and which traded with the Turks of Central Asia, probably via the [[Caspian Sea]]. Khurshid is said to have contributed to this prosperity by building numerous bazaars and [[caravanserai]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Khurshid also tried to consolidate and even extend his royal power, and used the turmoil within the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Third Islamic Civil War]] to this effect, rebelling against Caliph [[Marwan II]] (r. 744–750), and even sending an embassy to the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] court in 746, which recognized him ("king Hu-lu-ban") as a vassal prince.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

During the [[Abbasid Revolution]], however, he was forced to submit to the Abbasid armies under [[Abu Muslim]]. As one of Abu Muslim's vassals, he supported the latter in his quarrel with the Caliph [[al-Mansur]] (r. 754–775). After the Caliph had Abu Muslim murdered in 755, Khurshid supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of [[Sunbadh]], who entrusted part of Abu Muslim's treasure to Khurshid's keeping. When Sunbadh's revolt was defeated, Sunbadh fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 314–315&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Mansur sent his son and heir, [[al-Mahdi]] (r. 775–785), to recover the treasure of Abu Muslim. Khurshid denied having it, and al-Mansur tried to unseat Khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ''ispahbadh''. This did not have the desired effect of challenging the loyalty of Khurshid's subjects, but Khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate the Abbasids by accepting an increase in the annual tribute, which brought it to the level paid to the Sassanids.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1975), pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, nevertheless, Khurshid took advantage of the rebellion of [[Abd al-Jabar ibn Abd al-Rahman]], the governor of Khurasan, to once again throw off allegiance to the Caliphate. Al-Mansur sent an army into Tabaristan, with the intention of completely subduing the country and making it a province. Khurshid fled to the fortress of al-Tak in the mountains, where he was besieged in 759–760. Although Khurshid himself escaped to nearby [[Daylam]], the fortress eventually fell, and with it his family fell into the hands of the Abbasids and brought to [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; From Daylam, Khurshid tried to regain his kingdom. He raised an army from the mountain dwellers of the region, and invaded Tabaristan in 760. Repulsed, he returned to Daylam.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; After learning of his family's capture, he is said to have exclaimed "after this there is no inclination to life and joy, and death is the very solace and respite itself", and took poison, probably in 761.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung200"&gt;Madelung (1975), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabaristan became a regular province of the Caliphate, ruled from [[Amol|Amul]] by an Arab governor, although the local dynasties of the [[Bavandids]], [[Qarinvand dynasty|Karinids]] and [[Zarmihrids]], formerly subject to the Dabuyids, continued to control the mountainous interior as tributary vassals of the Abbasid government. Coins were minted in Tabaristan in Khurshid's name until 764, whereafter the name of the Abbasid governor was substituted. As a result some earlier works also mention 767 as the date of Khurshid's death.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung200"/&gt;

== Family ==
After their capture, Khurshid's sons, the crown prince Dadmihr, Hormozd and Vandad-Hormozd, received Arabic names, but otherwise their fate is unknown.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"/&gt; According to Chinese sources, on the other hand, one of them was on embassy in the Tang court at the time Tabaristan was conquered.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt; Khurshid's daughters were distributed as concubines to members of the Abbasid dynasty. The names and genealogy of these princesses are confused, but one was taken by al-Mansur himself and another by his brother, Abbas ibn Muhammad. Al-Bakhtariyya, a daughter of Farrukhan-i Kuchak, became the concubine of al-Mahdi, and it is reported that another of al-Mahdi's concubines, Shakla, was a daughter of Khurshid. In 817, during the [[Fourth Islamic Civil War]], the populace of Baghdad turned to their sons to make them caliphs in opposition to [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833). Al-Bakhtariyya's son [[al-Mansur ibn al-Mahdi]] refused, but his half-brother [[Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi]] accepted and ruled as anti-caliph until 819.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pourshariati317"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4232">'''Ramsey Dukes''' is the current and most well-known [[pen name]] of '''Lionel Snell''', a contemporary English [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]], publisher and author on [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[philosophy]]. He has also under the pen names '''Lemuel Johnston''', '''Angerford and Lea''', '''Adamai Philotunus''' and '''Per Anum Ad Astra'''. His regular satirical column ''The Satanist's Diary'' was published in the magazine ''Aquarian Arrow'' during the 1980s and early 1990s under the pen name '''The Hon Hugo C StJ l'Estrange''' and included a multitude of other pen names as contributors.

==Early life==
Born April 1945 in [[Kings Langley]], [[Hertfordshire]] before his family moved to the [[Gloucestershire]], [[Cotswolds]] that year. In his youth, Snell enjoyed a series of [[scholarship]]s that brought him to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he graduated in Pure Mathematics. His writings on [[Austin Osman Spare]] in  ''Agape Occult Review'' (1972) and his magical theories published in ''SSOTBME - An Essay on Magic'' (1974) and ''Thundersqueak'' (1978) brought him into contact with the nascent [[chaos magic]] movement in the 1970s. This comparatively rigorous and modern style of magic, largely shaped by fellow scientist [[Peter J. Carroll|Peter Carroll]], provided a fertile ground for his own ideas.

==Career==
In 1977, he performed a well-known, but notably laborious and rarely attempted{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[ritual]] called the [[The Book of Abramelin#Abramelin operation|Abramelin operation]].&lt;ref name=hine&gt;[[Phil Hine|Hine, Phil]]. [http://www.philhine.org.uk/writings/ess_dukesint.html An Interview with Ramsey Dukes] in ''HEAD''  magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 1972 he has written and published several books noted for their impact on late 20th-century [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and humor.  ''Words Made Flesh'' (1987) was written from a more philosophical point of view and notable for its original outline of the "information model" theory of magic that our universe could be a virtual reality&amp;mdash;as later explored in [[The Matrix (film)|''The Matrix'']]. It is an example of the author's ongoing studies in the relationship between magic and [[rationalism]].

Dukes has worked on the subject of magic with diverse associates including the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and [[Illuminates of Thanateros]].&lt;ref name=hine&gt;[[Phil Hine|Hine, Phil]].

'''Mal Fletcher''' (born 1957 in Melbourne, Australia) is a media/social futurist and commentator, [[keynote speaker]], author, business [[leadership]] consultant and [[broadcasting|broadcaster]] currently based in London. He holds joint Australian and British [[citizenship]].

From 1985, Fletcher was the founding National Director of [[Youth Alive Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthaliveqld.com/site/about_index.cfm Youth Alive Queensland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203221524/http://www.youthaliveqld.com/site/about_index.cfm |date=3 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a large faith-based organization teaching positive values to young people. Prior to the founding of the national organization, he was the State Director for [[Youth Alive Victoria]], which began in 1981. At a time when Australia had one of the highest [[teenage]] suicide rates in the developed world, this movement – a large network of local youth groups and charities – grew from a few thousand in Melbourne to an estimated 60,000 young people across the nation in its first decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextwaveonline.com/mal_bio.asp |title=Next Wave Online |publisher=Next Wave Online |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the movement has grown further and has helped to spark other youth movements including [[PlanetShakers]] and [[Hillsong United]]. The model has also inspired similar movements in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthaliveuk.com/ |title=YA:UK |publisher=Youthaliveuk.com |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthalivemsia.org |title=Youth Alive Malaysia – Welcome to the official website of the Youth Alive Malaysia |publisher=Youthalivemsia.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletcher left Australia in 1994, to found Next Wave International, a communications group which helps European community organizations and charities to deal with future change and move society forward in a positive direction. Based for ten years first in [[Copenhagen]], then in London, he also launched the Euro Youth Events network, hosting ongoing, alcohol-free concerts in eight major European capitals over ten years. He also founded the Strategic Leadership Consultation, an annual summit for European community and church leaders from 20 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextwaveonline.com/networks.asp|title=Next Wave Online|work=nextwaveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/interview.mal.fletcher.of.next.wave.international/813.htm|title=Interview: Mal Fletcher of Next Wave International™ - Christian News on Christian Today|work=christiantoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summit focuses on engaging the future of society in a proactive way. Guest speakers at this [[think-tank]] forum have included social justice campaigners [[Steve Chalke|Steve Chalke MBE]], [[Tim Costello|Tim Costello, OA]] and [[Joel Edwards (UK)|Dr. Joel Edwards]]; [[futurists]] [[Patrick Dixon|Dr. Patrick Dixon]] and Dr. Tom Sine; ethics campaigner [[Michael Nazir-Ali|Bishop Michael_Nazir-Ali]]; theologian [[Alister McGrath]] and others including [[Reinhard Bonnke]].

In 2008, he launched the 2020Plus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2020Plus.net/|title=2020Plus with Mal Fletcher|work=2020plus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization to assist [[City|civic]] authorities, companies, charities and media groups as they prepared for rapid change during a near-global recession. The group produces research and publications dealing with future social change and innovative [[leadership]] solutions.

He was the brother of [[John Anstey]] and also a keen 'Anstey' genealogist, mapping many of the early branches of the Devon Ansteys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ANSTEY: Our True Surname Origin and Shared Medieval Ancestry|last=Anstey|first=G.M. and T.J.|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Romance of Bible Chronology ==
Anstey identified five apparent chronological gaps within the Bible text, that had been attempted to be resolved with varying degrees of success by previous Bible chronologers.

The five apparent chronological gaps that Anstey identified were:

1. The Noah-Shem connection, which determines the exact age of [[Noah]] at the birth of Shem, (which Anstey calculated to be 502 years).

2. The Terah-Abraham connection, which determines the exact age of Terah at the birth of [[Abraham]], (which Anstey calculated to be 130 years).

3. The Joseph-Moses connection, which determines the exact number of years which elapsed between the death of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], with which the Chronology of the book of Genesis ends (Gen. 50:26), and the birth of [[Moses]], with which the Chronology of the book of Exodus begins (Exodus 7:7), (which Anstey calculated to be 64 years).

4. The Joshua-Judges connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed during the administration of [[Joshua]] and the Elders that survived him, between the division of the land at the end of the Seven Years' War of Conquest, with which the Chronology of the Book of Joshua ends (Joshua 14:7,10 with Numbers 10:11,12; 13:17,20), and the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim of Mesopotamia, with which the Chronology of the Book of Judges begins (Judges 3:8), (which Anstey calculated to be 13 years).

5. The Eli-Saul connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed between the death of Eli and the beginning of the reign of Saul, (which Anstey calculated to be 20 years). This is given in the summary of I Samuel 7:2.

== Contribution to Biblical Literalism ==
Having resolved the apparent chronological gaps in the Bible text, Anstey was able to argue that the Bible provided a coherent yet select historical record of human civilization. Anstey's thesis also critiqued other chronological records for their chronological errors compared to the Bible text. While archaeological discoveries during the twentieth and twenty-first century have in some instances dated the arguments and data presented in Anstey's thesis, his original chronological calculations and observations remain accurate.

The '''Marunthuvazh Malai''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: மருந்துவாழ் மலை, [[Malayalam]]: മരുത്വാ മല ), also known as the '''Marunthu Vazhum Malai''' ("the abode of medicinal herbs"),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kanyakumari.tn.nic.in/tourist.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/2004/10/29/stories/2004102904560300.htm&lt;/ref&gt; forms the part and the southernmost tip of the [[Western Ghats]] of [[Agasteeswaram]] taluk of [[Kanyakumari district]].

According to tradition, the Maruthuva Malai is a fragment of the Sanjeevi Mountain, a piece of which fell down here, and it was carried by [[Hanuman]] from [[Mahendragiri]] to [[Lanka Kingdom|Lanka]] for healing the fatal wounds of [[Lakshmana]], the brother of [[Raghava Rama|Rama]], the epic hero.  It stretches for more than a km, reaching a height of 800 feet at the highest point.  It is about 1&amp;nbsp;km from [[pothaiyadi]], 2&amp;nbsp;km from [[Swamithoppe]] and 11&amp;nbsp;km from   [[Nagercoil]].

This hill is also believed to be noted in [[Ayyavazhi mythology]] as [[Parvatha Ucchi Malai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unni Vasudev|first1=Subramonian|title=Professor’s Diary|date=17 November 2015|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=9789352065189|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the [[Mythology]], this hill is historically related to the life of [[Vaikundar]]. So few theologians consider this hill as sacred and consider it one among the [[Ayyavazhi holy sites]]. Backing some quotes from [[Arul Nool]] and [[Akilam]] some even argue that Marunthuvazh Malai is one among the [[Vaikundapathi]]'s. [[Narayana Guru]] attained enlightenment while undergoing penance (tapas) at this hill.

There is a mention about this Marunthu Vazh Malai in Sri Pada Sri Vallbha Charithamrutham written during thirteenth century in Sanskrit, which is a biography of Lord Sri Pada Sri Vallabha(first avatar of Sri Dattatreya). This place is mentioned as Maruthuva Malai and the legend about this mountain is captured. It is also said in the holy book that this is a Holy land and Siddhas and saints live in this Mountain

'''''Messenger of the fullness of the Gospel''''' is a [[Mormon fundamentalist]] publication, originally printed in [[Birmingham]], England, starting in 1991, which was in print in that country until 2001, and continues as a web-based publication. It went under the original title of ''Truth Seeker'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/91617.stm BBC News: ''No stopping Mormons' millennium momentum''], 19 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020415031746/http://mormons.org.uk/editor.htm Messenger: ''About the On-Line Editor''], archived at Internet Archive, April 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion_and_Spirituality/Faiths_and_Practices/Christianity/News_and_Media/Magazines/?o=a Yahoo! Directory: Christian Magazines]&lt;/ref&gt; until it was found that there was an existing periodical that shared that name.

Although originally printed quarterly, it was printed bi-monthly when it moved to an American-produced edition in 2003.

It was edited by a former [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), along with a member who worked for the LDS Church. It is unique in being the only such Mormon fundamentalist magazine printed outside of the [[United States]], and probably the only one edited and authored by active LDS Church members (although they were subsequently excommunicated for their beliefs).  Their involvement in the magazine was possibly one of the factors that led to their [[excommunication]] from the LDS Church.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

It was perhaps the first Mormon publication on the [[Internet]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} having first appeared online in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980508151153/http://troubador.com/~mahonri/ts/ The earliest archived version is from 1998 -]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''Vigor'' [[ezine]] was available in [[plain text]] on [[Compuserve]] before this.

This magazine was not, nor did it claim to be, an official publication of the LDS Church.

'''Michael R. Saso''' (born December 7, 1930) is a professor emeritus of the  Department of Religion at the [[University of Hawaiʻi]]. He is a scholar of the religious practices of [[Japan]] and [[China]], with a particular emphasis on [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{cite book |title=Experimental essays on Chuang-tzu |last=Mair |first=Victor H. |authorlink=Victor H. Mair |year=1983 |publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]] |location=Honolulu |isbn=0-8248-0836-3 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ptGvyOnDOW8C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=%22Michael+Saso%22+%22University+of+Hawaii%22&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Michael%20Saso%22%20%22University%20of%20Hawaii%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Portland, Oregon]] to Andrew Saso and Beatrice Saso, ''née'' Huth.  He earned the following degrees: B.A., Literature, [[St. Clara University]], 1952; M.A., Philosophy/Anthropology, [[Gonzaga University]], 1955; M.A., Chinese Studies, [[Yale University]], 1964; Ph.D., Classical Chinese/Anthropology, [[University of London]] 1971.  He joined the University of Hawaiʻi as an associate professor in 1974, later becoming a professor of Chinese religion.

Saso has translated Japanese and Chinese religious texts and related works and has written several books on Asian religion. His knowledge of Taoism and [[Buddhism]] comes from within those communities: he is an initiated Taoist priest of the [[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi school]] as well as an ordained [[Tendai]] Buddhist priest.

His first ordination, however, was as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]].  He left the order in the 1960s, and in 1968 married Nariko Akimoto, with whom he had two daughters. The marriage was later annulled. Saso requested reinstatement to the Catholic priesthood in 1998 and is now connected with the [[New Life Center]] in [[Carmel, California]], as a priest in the Diocese of San Jose.

==Ethnic Use==
Several world regions have historically used psychoactive cacti for their properties, particularly Indigenous peoples from Central and South America, such as in Mexico and the Andes region.
For this purpose (which includes commercial harvesting) cacti plants are specifically grown in the millions.&lt;ref name="Peyote and Other"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Adam|title=Peyote and Other Psychoactive Cacti|year=1997|publisher=Ronin Publishing|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lophophora williamsii]] (peyote) is used by the [[Native American Church]] (aka Peyotism).

The name "Qianliyan" literally means "He of the Thousand-[[li (unit)|Mile]]" or "League Eyes"{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=89}} but may be taken more generally as "Hawkeye", "Lynx-Eyed",&lt;ref name=thailex&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.thailex.info/thailex/thailexeng/lexicon/c.HTM |contribution=Chien Li Yen |title=ThaiLex |last=Masure |first=Yves |url=http://www.thailex.info/thailex/thailexeng/lexicon/Homepage.htm }}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Far-Seeing",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/ |contribution-url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2007/07/27/2003371538 |contribution=The Good, the Bad, and the Divine |title=Taipei Times |last=Ho |first=Yi |authormask=Ho Yi }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or even "[[Omniscience|All-Seeing]]"&lt;ref name=bspot/&gt; or "[[Clairvoyant]]"&lt;ref name=qingan&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nbqahg.com/ |title=''Official site'' |contribution-url=http://www.nbqahg.com/info.aspx?id=36731 |contribution=A Guide to Qing'an Guild Hall |location=Ningbo |publisher=East Zhejiang Maritime Affairs Folk Custom Museum |date=2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a distance of 1,000 [[li (unit)|li]] was idiomatic in Chinese for any great distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Yu |first=Ning |authormask=Yu Ning |title=The Chinese Heart in a Cognitive Perspective: Culture, Body, and Language |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin |date=2009 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bZACQnUEr40C&amp;pg=PA288 288] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears as {{nowrap|'''Qianli Yan'''}}&lt;ref name=hopee&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA857 |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC |contribution=Tianhou |title=Holy People of the World, ''Vol. II'' |last=Giuffrida |first=Noelle |editor=Phyllis G.

Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], Qianliyan was also known as '''Li{{nbsp}}Lou'''.{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} 

==History==
Qianliyan is first attested in the early-16th century [[Four Classic Novels|novel]] ''[[Journey to the West]]'',{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} where he appears as the [[personification|personified form]] of the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] [[Jade Emperor]]'s eyes&lt;ref name=bspot/&gt; and one of his lieutenants.{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} There is, however, an earlier depiction of him in the caves of Shimen {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|石|門|山}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|石|门|山}}}},}} ''Shíménshān'') in [[Sichuan]] which has been dated to the [[Southern Song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hu |first=Wenhe |authormask=Hu Wenhe |title=Taoist and Buddhist Sichuan Rock Cave Art ''[四川道教仏教石窟芸術,'' Sichuan Daojiao Fojiao Shiku Yishu'']'' |publisher=Sichuan People's Publishing |date=1994 |p=16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese [[Fable|folk tale]] about the [[Ten Brothers]] also probably long predates its first publication during the Ming Dynasty; in it, the eldest two brothers have powers just like those of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er.&lt;ref name=macky&gt;{{citation |last=Sam |first=Chris W.C |author2=Eliza S.K. Leong |display-authors=1 |contribution-url=http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/archive-2007-2009/the-goddess-of-the-sea-and-her-guardians.html |contribution=The Goddess of the Sea and Her Guardians |url=http://macaudailytimes.com.mo/ |title=The Macau Daily Times |location=Macao |date=28 September 2008 |publisher=Macau Times Publications }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qianliyan next appeared as a lieutenant of the [[Huaguang Dadi|Emperor of Flowering Brightness]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|華|光|大|帝}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|华|光|大|帝}}}},}} ''Huáguāng Dàdì'') in [[Yu Xiangdou]]'s ''[[Journey to the South]]''{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} and as a character in [[Xu Zhonglin]]'s ''[[Creation of the Gods]]''.&lt;ref name=macky/&gt; He was confused with the [[door god]] [[Shenshu (deity)|Shenshu]] {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|神荼}}}},}} ''Shēnshū'') and, particularly, gradually conflated with the earlier [[sea god]] [[Zhaobao Qilang]] {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|招宝七郎}}}},}} ''Zhāobǎo Qīláng'') as he was supplanted by the cult of [[Lin Moniang|Mazu]].{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}}

==Religion stories==
Qianliyan's sharp vision is employed to help protect sailors at night and during fog and other inclement weather.&lt;ref name=szhen/&gt; In some accounts, he is capable of seeing everything in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=_W7sCgAAQBAJ |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=_W7sCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA644 644] |title=The Boxer Codex |date=2016 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill |location=Leiden }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Qianliyan is most often portrayed as a [[Chinese demon|demon]] defeated and tamed or befriended by the [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]]. By one account, he and Shunfeng'er appeared off [[Meizhou Island]] during a storm and were defeated by Mazu's magical silk scarf, which blew clouds of sand into their eyes and ears. After their submission, they pledged their loyalty when she kindly healed them of the damage she had caused them.&lt;ref name=rmb&gt;{{harvp|Yuan|2006|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=UBHQC_Iz6OMC&amp;pg=PA123 123–4]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another, the two were Song generals who competed for her hand at Peach Blossom Mountain {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|桃花山}},}} ''Táohuā Shān'') but were both defeated by her [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/2008/09/02/mazu-the-princess-of-tides.html/ |contribution=Mazu: The Princess of Tides |date=2008 |url=http://www.chinaexpat.com/ |title=China Expat |last=Devonshire-Ellis |first=Chris |publisher=Asia Briefing }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another, the two were the brothers Gao Ming and Gao Jue. Ruthless generals, they fell at Peach Blossom Mountain and subsequently haunted it as demons. They appeared to Mazu when she traveled nearby and challenged her to battle, with the loser to do the winner's bidding. They intended to have her marry them both but were defeated by her magic and became her servants.&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt;&lt;ref name=bspot&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://chinesefolktales.blogspot.hk/2011/06/some-legends-about-sea-goddess-mazu.html |contribution=Mazu and General Sees All and General Hears All |date=2011 |title=Chinese Folktales |url=http://chinesefolktales.blogspot.hk |last=Lobb |first=Fred |publisher=Blogspot |location=Hong Kong }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In still another, the Gao brothers were bandits during the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] before they began to haunt the mountain.&lt;ref name=szhen&gt;{{citation |last=Baquet |first=James |date=2015 |contribution=Mazu's Consorts |contribution-url=http://www.szdaily.com/content/2015-06/29/content_11821624.htm |url=http://www.szdaily.com/ |title=Shenzhen Daily |location=Shenzhen }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In still another account, the pair were originally warriors or guards of [[King Zhou of Shang|King&amp;nbsp;Zhou]] of Shang.&lt;ref name=qingan/&gt; In this version of the story, they are sometimes said to have already possessed their superhuman powers and to have used them to foil the first moves towards rebellion by the [[Zhou Empire|Zhou]]. Ji Fa's advisor [[Jiang Ziya]] is made out to have been a [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] adept, however, who uses the esoteric knowledge he received from the [[Yuanshi Tianzun|Primordial Lord of Heaven]] on {{nowrap|[[Mount Kunlun (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]]}} to defeat them. Their powers fail them when he covers them in the blood of a black dog and Ji Fa is able to triumph at [[Battle of Muye|Muye]] and finally establish himself as the [[King Wu of Zhou|Martial King of Zhou]] ("King Wu").&lt;ref name=macky/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Worship===
Qianliyan most often appears as a [[door god]] at [[Mazuist]] temples&lt;ref name=rmb/&gt; or as a guardian beside [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] at her altars&lt;ref name=hopee/&gt; or on her yellow paper charms.{{sfnp|Soo|1990|p=41}} He is separately worshipped in some villages{{sfnp|Dean|2010|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=zOB_X10kjYMC&amp;pg=PA147 147]}} and by mariners for assistance avoiding danger. During the 8-day, {{convert|250|km|sp=us|adj=on|0}} annual pilgrimages from [[Dajia Jenn Lann Temple|Dajia]] to [[Chaotian Temple|Beigang]], Mazu's idol is accompanied by {{convert|10|ft|sp=us|adj=on|0}} figures of Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er played by masked men on [[stilts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;pg=PA375 375] |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=FmnKSfAS4PcC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions |editor=Randall L.

===In art===
Qianliyan typically appears as a green-skinned demon shielding his eyes from the sun's glare.&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt; This was not his original position: The Southern Song statue mentioned above and another in the [[Nanhai Longwang Temple]] {{nowrap|(&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|南海|龍王|廟}}}},}} {{nowrap|&lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|{{linktext|南海|龙王|庙}}}},}} ''Nánhǎi Lóngwáng Miào'') in eastern [[Guangzhou]] in [[Guangdong]] give him [[third eye|three eyes]] but do not have either of his hands raised to his brow. He apparently picked up the pose from the earlier [[Zhaobao Qilang]] as that god's followers came to worship Mazu.{{sfnp|Nikaido|2011|p=90}} Qianliyan also occasionally appears with three heads and six arms.&lt;ref name=thailex/&gt; He usually appears to the right of his companion [[Shunfeng'er]]. He sometimes appears as the red demon, in which case he usually has two horns and [[yellow sapphire]] eyes.{{sfnp|Ruitenbeek|1999|p=319}}

'''Rahovart''' (or ''Rahouart'') is a [[demon]] identified in [[Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' (1818), according to which he is referenced in Durzel's ''Moralité'', a [[Renaissance]] book. Rahovart is a companion of [[Satan]]; little is known about the demon himself. In Durzel's undated account (allegedly printed at [[Rouen]]), which plays out to the end of the 15th century, Rahovart is attributed to the torment of evil, rich [[miser]]s and old [[wikt:curmudgeon|curmudgeons]]. He is also charged with [[avalanche]]s and [[ghost]]ly torment.

Reportedly, the elderly are most easily subject to [[Demonic possession|possession]] by this demon, and if the person should die under the demonic effect, their souls are collected into Rahovart's basket until the [[day of judgment]].

Rahovart is also the main hero in the award-winning paranormal romance series, ''The Demon Side'' by Heaven Leigh Eldeen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3980">[[File:Judge Rachel Freier - Photo Jordan Rathkopf.jpg|thumb|Judge [[Rachel Freier]], a married [[Hasidic|Hasid]], wearing a sheitel]]

'''Sheitel''' ({{lang-yi|שייטל}}, ''{{transl|yi|sheytl}}'' m.sg.; {{lang|yi|שייטלעך}}, ''{{transl|yi|sheytlekh}}'' m.pl. or {{lang|yi|שייטלען}}, ''{{transl|yi|sheytlen}}'' m.pl.; {{lang-he|פאה נוכרית}}) is a [[Wig (hair)|wig]] or half-wig worn by some [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]]  married women in order to conform with the requirement of [[halakha|Jewish law]] to [[Tzniut#Hair covering|cover their hair]]. Depending on different Hasidic groups, sheitels are either encouraged or avoided.&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt;

==Purpose==
This practice is part of the modesty-related dress standard called ''[[tzniut]]''. The word is probably derived from the German word ''{{lang|de|{{linktext|Scheitel}}}}'' ("hair parting") or ''{{lang|de|{{linktext|Schädel}}}}'' ("skull"). The related term in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is ''pei'ah'' ({{lang|he|פאה}}). Traditional sheitels are secured by elastic caps and are often designed with heavy bangs to obscure the hairline of their wearers. However, more modern designed [[lace-front wig]]s with realistic hairlines are growing in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canopycanopycanopy.com/10/she_goes_covered |title=She goes covered |first=Julia |last=Sherman |date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptability==
The ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', the 16th-century compilation of [[Jewish law]], cites the opinion of Rabbi [[Joshua Boaz ben Simon Baruch]] (d. 1557), who permitted the wearing of wigs.

In 2004, there was a degree of controversy over natural hair sheitels procured from India. It was discovered that the hair used for the production of these wigs was taken from a [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Hindu temple]]. According to [[Halacha]], one cannot derive benefit from anything used in [[Idolatry in Judaism|what Judaism considers to be idolatry]]. The controversy ceased when it became clear that the hair was neither worshiped nor offered as a sacrifice to the deity, but shaven as a rite of purification, thus excluding it from the category of forbidden items.{{Dubious|reason=The article on the temple clearly says it is an offering|date=January 2013}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-09/news/0406090169_1_wigs-idol-worship-hair |title=Orthodox Jews in hairy dilemma on wigs |author=Ron Grossman |date=June 9, 2004 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, many wigs used by Jewish women come with [[kosher certification]], indicating that they are not made with hair originating from rituals deemed to be idolatrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=hair sources and background |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb11024213.htm |title=Kosher Wigs |publisher=prweb.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups, sheitels are avoided, as they can give the impression that the wearer's head is uncovered. In other Hasidic groups, women wear some type of covering over the sheitel to avoid this misconception, for example a scarf or a hat. Married [[Sephardi]] and [[National Religious]] women do not wear wigs, because their rabbis believe that wigs are insufficiently modest, and that other head coverings, such as a scarf (''[[tichel]]''), a [[Snood (headgear)|snood]], or a hat, are more suitable. In stark contrast, the [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]] encouraged all married Jewish women to wear only sheitels.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/72875/jewish/Wearing-A-Sheitel.htm Letters on the importance of wearing a sheitel from the Lubavitcher Rebbe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shingaku has been characterized as coming from a [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] tradition, integrating principles from [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]. (Chang 2010) It has been speculated, Shingaku was one of the cultural foundations for Japan's industrialization. (Sawada, 1993; Bellah, 1957)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9561">'''''Surnaturel''''' is a book written by the [[Roman-Catholic]] theologian [[Henri de Lubac]]. It stands among his most famous and controversial works.

In this book he traces the historical meaning of the word 'supernatural' and notes a shift in implication. Up to the High Middle Ages, the essential contrast was drawn between 'natural' and 'moral'. After that, the contrast was seen between 'natural and supernatural'. De Lubac is trying here to establish the correct understanding of [[Aquinas]] on this subject.

==Context==
De Lubac began work on the ideas which would eventually appear as ''Surnaturel'' in his days as a student in Hastings.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p72&lt;/ref&gt; De Lubac published several articles in the 1930s which were to make up much of ''Surnaturel''. The development of the book itself, though, was greatly hindered by the war. In June 1940, fleeing the advancing Nazis, de Lubac left Lyon with a bag which included the notebook for ''Surnaturel'', on which he worked for several days. De Lubac stated in later years that the book had taken sufficient shape by 1941 to be ready for review; the ''nihil obstat'' was granted in February 1942. However, paper shortages prevented publication. In 1943, while being hunted by the Gestapo, de Lubac fled, again carrying his notebook, this time to Vals. He used the resources in the Vals library to continue his work on the book. Eventually, in October 1945 the ''Imprimatur'' was issued, and in 1946, the book was published (though only as an edition of 700 copies, due to ongoing paper shortages).&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
De Lubac's overall question in ''Surnaturel'' is therefore how human persons in the natural order can be interiorly directed to the order of grace that fulfils them, without in the least possessing this grace in anticipation, and without being able at all to claim it for themselves. In the book, de Lubac attempts to show how, in an attempt to answer this question, what he calls "the system of pure nature" had come to prevail in Catholic theology.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that in the Fathers and the great scholastics there was only one concrete order of history, that in which God had made humanity for himself, and in which human nature had thus been created only for a single destiny, which was supernatural. Neither the Fathers nor the scholastics, therefore, ever envisioned the possibility of a purely natural end for human persons attainable by their own intrinsic powers of cognition and volition.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac argues that this unified vision began to unravel in the thought of theologians such as [[Denys the Carthusian]] and, more pertinently, [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]]. While Denys had argued for a natural end of the human person to which a supernatural end must be 'superadded', he did so consciously in opposition to the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, however, while making a similar argument to Denys, did so while claiming simply to be ''commenting on'' Thomas: he therefore introduced the idea of human nature as "a closed and sufficient whole" into Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a 'pure nature', argues de Lubac, intensified in the wake of the naturalism of Baius and Jansenius: a state of pure nature - a hypothesis according to which human persons might have been created with an end proportionate to their natural powers - was seen as necessary to protect the gratuity of the supernatural. Affirmation of such a state, argued de Lubac, overlooked the decisive difference between the created human spirit and other natures. Moreover, while allowing Catholic theologians to defend the essential integrity of fallen human nature against the Protestantism that denied it, the system effected a separation between nature and the supernatural that would prove pernicious - by rendering the latter (seemingly) superfluous. Although, de Lubac argues, the system of 'pure nature' was perceived to be a novelty when it first developed, it eventually came to be taken for granted, such that, by the twentieth century, rejecting it became synonymous with denying the gratuity of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surnaturel ''is broken into four parts, which are pieced together from a number of earlier preparatory studies. 
* The first part, entitled 'Augustinianism and Baianism', examines the interpretation of Augustine by [[Michael Baius|Baius]] and [[Cornelius Jansen|Jansenius]], showing how these two early modern thinkers misconstrue Augustine's true intention. That is, de Lubac argued that, influenced by a juridical-naturalistic way of thinking foreign to Augustine (and to his disciples, including Thomas Aquinas), Baius and Jansenius in their different ways denied the gratuity of the gifts made by God to Adam. De Lubac shows how the hypothesis of 'purely natural finality' attributed to a 'purely spiritual nature' was developed to insure this gratuity.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second part, 'Spirit and Freedom in the Theological Tradition', examines one of the essential aspects of the spiritual 'nature' (both human and angelic), namely, its freedom of choice with respect to its end. De Lubac considers the tradition from the Fathers up to the seventeenth century, and provides further evidence for the claim that Aquinas, for example, never envisioned any finality for the created spirit but a supernatural one.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third part examines the origins of the word 'supernatural', including the problematic epithet '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''superadditum''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ('something superadded'), and the confusion of the 'supernatural' with the 'miraculous' (in the sense of a completely arbitrary addition). De Lubac shows in this section that the term 'supernatural' was first used systematically by St Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth part offers six 'Historical Notes' on St Thomas and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the conclusion, 'Divine Exigence and Natural Desire', de Lubac indicates why it is unnecessary to have recourse to the hypothetical system of pure nature to protect the gratuity of the beatific vision.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The publication of the work caused immediate controversy in Catholic thought. De Lubac's thought came to be associated as representing a ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', a name applied to de Lubac's thought by his critics. In 1950, de Lubac was asked by the General of the Jesuits to stop teaching, and to give up working at the journal ''Recherches de Science Religieuse. ''An order was issued to withdraw from Jesuit libraries and from the trade three of his books - ''Surnaturel, Corpus Mysticum'' and ''De la Connaissance de Dieu'', as well as a 1949 article in ''Recherches'' in which de Lubac addressed some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, it was widely suspected that it was his views which were attacked in the papal encyclical ''[[Humani generis|Humani Generis]]''. De Lubac was ostracised for a decade.

In the early 1960s, however, his ideas became more accepted in the Catholic hierarchy, and he was among the first summoned by [[Pope John XXIII]] to help draft the texts for Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 de Lubac published two works:'' Le Mystere du surnaturel'', and ''Augustinisme et théologie moderne, ''which served primarily to clarify numerous objections to ''Surnaturel. Mystere ''largely followed the structure of the 1949 article with the same title in which de Lubac had responded to some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''. ''Augustinisme ''was a reprint of the first part of ''Surnaturel'', enlarged with some new texts.

"'''Teddy'''" is a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]], completed on November 22, 1952 and originally published in the January 31, 1953
issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', Salinger created an engaging child character, Teddy McArdle, to introduce to his readership some of the basic concepts of [[Zen]] enlightenment and [[Vedanta]] reincarnation – a task that Salinger recognized would require overcoming some 1950s American cultural chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "In 1952, most Americans thought their way of life superior to that of Eastern cultures. Salinger was well aware of this chauvinism. It was clear to him that his reading audience was not going to accept the notions of mysticism or reincarnation easily."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger wrote "Teddy" while he was arranging publication for a number of his [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|short stories]] and crafted the story to balance and contrast the collections' intended opening work "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]".&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;

In Salinger's novella, "[[Seymour: An Introduction]]", a meditation written by a member of the fictional Glass family, [[Buddy Glass]] writes about his brother, [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], where Buddy claims authorship to "Teddy" as well as other pieces in ''Nine Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;Wenke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The story comprises several vignettes which take place aboard a luxury liner. The events occur roughly between 10:00 and 10:30 am on October 28, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teddy is Theodore "Teddy" McArdle, a 10-year-old mystic-savant returning home to America with his entertainer-socialite parents and his younger sister. As part of their tour of [[Great Britain]], Teddy has been interviewed as an academic curiosity by professors of religious and philosophical studies - the "Leidekker examining group" - from various European universities in order to test his claims of advanced spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first scene opens in the McArdles' stateroom. Teddy is standing on his father’s expensive suitcase, peering out of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "His father, a bellicose actor and not in the best of moods, struggles to assert his authority over his child. Teddy’s mother lies under the covers in bed, taunting her husband and listlessly issuing commands to Teddy in an attempt to irritate his father."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates the nature of existence and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from [[Zen]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to his father and mother, they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.

Teddy is ordered to retrieve his six-year-old sister, Booper, who has absconded to the sport deck with her father’s expensive camera, which Teddy -  indifferent to its material value -  has bestowed upon her as a plaything. 
As he departs, Teddy delivers a short, cryptic caveat to his parents, informing them that they may never see him again outside the realm of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Main Deck, Teddy has a brief encounter with one of the ship's female officers, Ensign Mathewson. Forthright and exacting,  the boy questions the officer and obtains information about a shipboard word game competition - and disabuses the bemused woman as to her misapprehensions regarding his advanced intellectual development.

Teddy proceeds to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts the girl to return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.

The final scene takes place on the Sun Deck, where Teddy, reclining on one of his family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following ''non sequitur'': “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen. It is ridiculous to mention it even.”

Teddy is interrupted by a passenger named Bob Nicholson, a graduate of an unnamed university, who teaches curriculum and instruction. Nicholson is on a first name basis with the Leidekker group and has listened to a taped interview with Teddy, in which he shows a lurid interest. He peppers Teddy with questions on the boy’s commitment to the precepts of Vedantic reincarnation; Teddy remains composed in the face of the young man’s veiled hostility, and provides him with a brief sketch of this discovery of God, his relationships with his parents and his views on Zen philosophy. The boy offers Nicholson an extended metaphor on the nature of logic that challenges the young man’s rational and orthodox commitment to material reality. Teddy, in explaining his position on death and reincarnation gives a hypothetical example describing a series of events at his upcoming swimming lesson in which a fatality occurs: his own.

Teddy disengages from the interview and hurries to his lesson. Nicholson pursues him through the levels of the ship's decks, and as he begins to descend the stairs to the swimming pool, he hears the scream of "a small, female child" emanating from the enclosed walls of the indoor pool. The story ends on this ambiguous note.

==Analysis==

===The porthole and the orange peel===

In the opening scene set in the Mr. and Mrs. McArdle's state room, Salinger presents two facets of Zen enlightenment: "God-consciousness", a profound awareness of "inner spirit", in contrast to material concerns, and secondly, "the notion of impermanence", based on "the Vedantic belief that separate existence is an illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy, perched on a piece of luggage, pokes his head through the open porthole, penetrating figuratively into a zone of enlightenment and sublimity; his body remains in the cabin, where his parents – “materialistic and self-centered” – engage in mildly abusive repartee, issuing petulant and ineffectual commands to their son, who endures them with tolerant detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy’s astonishing self-possession is a product of his adherence to Vedantic “philosophy of non-attachment”, enabling him to distinguish between “the world of illusion” – the material world – and “the world of reality”, where “only unity of God is real.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy focuses his attention on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “[[Solipsism|solipsistic]] contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this door, I may only exist in the minds of all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237: “It foreshadows the story’s ending…”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booper===

The same studied disengagement that characterizes Teddy’s relationship with his parents also informs the “amazing” toleration he exhibits toward his younger sister – a child that biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes as “a cruel little girl” and “perhaps the most vicious child ever discharged by Salinger’s imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booper announces that she “hates everybody in the ocean”, Salinger calls attention to the setting of his story: the sea, with its infinite horizons and indefinite boundaries where his characters drift – a seascape that reflects “the Zen and Vedantic concepts of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy’s tolerance of his sister is due to his understanding that few reincarnations have contributed to the six-year old’s spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238: “[Teddy] recognizes that  she has only just begun her spiritual journey and has many reincarnations ahead of her.”&lt;/ref&gt; Booper’s misanthropic persona make plausible her role in the sinister and unsettling denouement at the swimming  pool.

===Bob Nicholson===

The final vignette occurs on the Sun Deck. Bob Nicholson, a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, is acquainted with some members of the Leidekker group who examined Teddy; he engages the boy in an ''ad hoc'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238: “[Nicholson] imposes himself on Teddy and begins to pepper him with philosophical questions.”&lt;/ref&gt; This serves two purposes in Salinger’s story. First, he functions as a foil to Teddy,  posing logical questions challenging the tenets of Vendantic and Zen philosophy. Salinger uses this device to respond to hostile skeptics among his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p.238: “Nicholson’s character serves two purposes. Salinger uses him as a sounding board against which Teddy can express Vedantic and Zen viewpoints that Nicholson reacts to skeptically.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slawenski, Nicholson “embodies the logic that poisons God-consciousness, and he represents the power of the intellect to blind individuals from spiritual truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson additionally functions as a witness to Teddy’s final discourse on the nature of existence and death, in which the boy formulates the circumstances that might lead to his reincarnation. In a lull in their exchange, Teddy becomes momentarily distracted by an inner voice or vision, and spontaneously recites to Nicholson two haiku by the 17th Century poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]: “Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die” and “Along this road goes no one, this autumn eve.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson, pursuing Teddy to the indoor swimming pool, hears, but does not see, the event that the boy prophesied, providing the reader with tantalizing evidence that leaves the boy's ultimate fate a mystery.

===The "swimming pool ending"===

The ending of Salinger’s “Teddy” has been described as “controversial” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 1999,  p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; and “the most widely criticized ending of any story that he ever wrote.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger thrice provides the  reader with intimations of Teddy’s demise: in statements to his parents, in his diary and to Nicholson. This has led readers to interpret the final passage as confirmation of the boy’s premonition  i.e. Booper shoves her older brother into the empty concrete pool and screams when she sees the deadly consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239: “Most readers have interpreted the closing lines of “Teddy” as indicating Teddy’s death at the hand of Booper. This conclusion is derived from Teddy’s own predictions rather than the text itself.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Slawenski reports two additional interpretations that might be derived from the final passage. One option is that Teddy “recognizing the threat his sister poses” evades her thrust and pushes her to her death, as act of premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; A third option is that both children plunge into the empty basin when Teddy carries Booper with him off the precipice – in order to advance her into her next reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these" says Slawenski, "is very satisfying."

Critics of the story may have targeted the ending for disapproval, rather than engage in a culturally biased critique of Salinger’s foray into Zen philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240: “[T]he story's critics – many of whom found fault with in its Eastern tenets – conveniently delivered the brunt of disapproval to the story's ambiguous ending, rather than condemn cultural philosophies they did not understand.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger himself regarded the work as “exceptionally Haunting [sic]” and “memorable” yet “unpleasantly controversial” and “thoroughly unsuccessful.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Summit of World Religious Leaders''' is an annual meeting of religious leaders.  Although there are other Interfaith World Summits where religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions attend, these particular meetings are unique in that they deliver collaborative statements to the G8 political leaders about the mutual responsibility faith groups and political leaders share for improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable people and species in the world. These Summits have now met for one complete round of G8 meetings.  The first meeting to deliver a statement to the G8 was held in the United Kingdom and was ecumenical. It became interfaith the following year when Russia hosted the event. The statements can be viewed at the [http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/interfaith/index.html G8 Research Group] website.

== Round Two of Meetings and Initiatives ==
* 2013 --  [[United Kingdom]]  [http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2013/04/05/global-religious-leaders-call-on-g8-to-strike-at-causes-of-poverty/ "Global Religious Leaders Call on G8 to 'Strike at Causes of Poverty.'"] This meeting was technologically mediated rather than face-to-face.

== Scholarly Work ==
Peer-reviewed articles studying the significance of these meetings include: 
* 2011 - [http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/1/3/2158244011428085 "Religious Soft Power as Accountability Mechanism for Power in World Politics: The InterFaith Leaders' Summit(s)."]  This case study of the InterFaith Leaders’ Summit(s) from 2005 to 2010 considers how interfaith leaders exercise public reputational and peer accountability among their constituents in relation to the G8/G20 leaders. The theoretical validity of the dialogue process is not contingent on political leader responsiveness but is ascertained using a complex theoretical standard for assessing the legitimacy of global governance institutions against which observations are then gauged. The InterFaith Dialogue is a specific illustration of a FAM that shows increasing compliance with the complex standard between 2005 and 2010. The Dialogue Mechanism FAM is a form of religious soft power that combines soft institution with soft technique. The next stage in the research is to identify specific characteristics of the FAM ideal type.
* 2012 - [http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/05/25/2158244012450705 "Faith-Based Accountability Mechanism Typology:  The 2011 Interfaith Summit as Soft Power in Global Governance."]  The conditions associated with the stability of democratic global governance have been a leading concern of political sociology. Globalization, a situation of “governance without government,” has accountability gaps that International Nongovernmental Organizations—religious and secular—bridge with activism. They strengthen democratic norms by exercising soft power as accountability mechanisms in international relations. Religious and secular accountability mechanisms differ in structure and function. This article presents a Faith-Based Accountability Mechanism typology that outlines a set of attributes for an exercise of religious soft power that might strengthen the democratic process in global governance. A coalition service model that preserves the public trust in appropriate contexts is developed in contrast to monopolistic religious surveillance models. The typology is illustrated with case study data from the 2011 Interfaith Summit in Bordeaux, France.

* 2013 - [http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/4/2158244013511830.abstract?ct "Reflexive Governance Dynamics Operative Within Round One of World Religious Leaders' Dialogue With the G8 (2005-2013)."]  This case study of the World Religious Leaders’ Summits illustrates reflexive governance dynamics operative within the religious summitry process from 2005 to 2013. Past research explored reflexivity within the cultural capital produced by religious leaders and delivered to G8 political leaders. Data are drawn from qualitative interviews, questionnaires, and summit presentations to further explore how reflexivity variously opens up and closes down throughout the 9-year cycle. Rather than choosing between keeping up action capacity or opening problem handling for further contextualization, reflexive governance is best understood as that which both interplays and combines variously. A coevolutionary approach to the reflexive governance of religious summitry is discussed in light of the changing dynamics associated with the upcoming transition from Millennium Development Goals to the proposed [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

'''Yitzchak Kaduri''' ({{Lang-he|יצחק כדורי}}, {{lang-ar|يسحاق كدوري}}), also spelled '''Kadouri''', '''Kadourie''', '''Kedourie'''; "[[Yitzhak]]" ({{circa|1902}} – January 28, 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner |first=Matthew |title=Judaism: The magic of the late Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2006-02-06 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/Judaism-The-magic-of-the-late-Rabbi-Yitzhak-Kaduri |accessdate=2008-09-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRWijFrF?url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1138622536007 |archivedate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a renowned [[Mizrahi Haredi]] [[rabbi]] and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] who devoted his life to [[Torah]] study and [[prayer]] on behalf of the [[Jews|Jewish]] people. He taught and practiced the ''kavanot'' of the [[Shalom Sharabi|Rashash]]. His blessings and [[amulet]]s were also widely sought to cure people of illnesses and [[infertility]]. In his life, he published no religious articles or books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/31/guardianobituaries.israel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRWkeG3W?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/jan/31/guardianobituaries.israel |archivedate=February 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, estimates of his age ranged from 103 to 118, and his birth year is still disputed.

His funeral which was held in Jerusalem drew over half a million followers in what was described as the largest funeral in Israel's history.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Baghdad]], (some say in 1902 - although his true birth year isn't known for sure), then part of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|vilayets]]'', to Rabbi Katchouri Diba ben Aziza, who was a spice trader. This birth year was published in ''Mishpacha'' magazine from a live interview with the rabbi in 2005.

As a youngster, Kaduri excelled in his studies and began learning [[Kabbalah]] while still in his teens, a study that would last his entire life. He was a child student{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} of the ''[[Ben Ish Chai]]'' (Rabbi Yosef Chaim of Baghdad, d. 1909) and studied at the Zilka Yeshivah in [[Baghdad]].

Rabbi Kaduri moved to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] (Eretz Israel, the Holy Land) in 1923. It was here that he changed his name from Diba to Kaduri.

==Student of Kabbalah==
He went to study at the Shoshanim LeDavid [[Yeshiva]] for [[kabbalah|kabbalists]] from Iraq. There he learned from the leading kabbalists of the time, including [[Yehuda Fatiyah|Rabbi Yehuda Ftaya]], author of ''Beit Lechem Yehudah'', and Rabbi [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]], author of ''Kaf Hachaim''. He later immersed himself in regular [[Talmud]]ic study and rabbinical law in the [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem's [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], where he also studied Kabbalah with the Rosh Yeshivah, Rabbi [[Ezra Attiya]], Rabbi Saliman Eliyahu (father of Sephardic Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]), and other learned rabbis.

In 1934, Rabbi Kaduri and his family moved to the Old City, where the Porat Yosef Yeshivah gave him an apartment nearby with a job of binding the yeshivah's books and copying over rare manuscripts in the yeshivah's library. The books remained in the yeshivah's library, while the copies of manuscripts were stored in Rabbi Kaduri's personal library. Before binding each book, he would study it intently, committing it to memory. He was reputed to have [[photographic memory]] and also mastered the [[Talmud]] by heart, including the adjoining [[Rashi]] and [[Tosafot]] commentaries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

During the period of [[Arab]]-[[Israel]]i friction that led up to the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Israeli war of Independence]], the Porat Yosef Yeshivah was virtually turned into a fortress against frequent flashes of violence. When the Jewish quarter of the Old City fell to the invading [[Jordan]]ian Army, the Jordanians set fire to the yeshivah and all surrounding houses, destroying all the books and manuscripts that Rabbi Kaduri could not smuggle to [[Beit El Yeshiva]] (''Yeshivat HaMekubalim'') in Jerusalem. He knew all the writings of Rabbi [[Yitzhak Luria]], the founder of modern Kabbalah by heart. After the passing of the leading kabbalist, Rabbi Efraim Hakohen, in 1989, the remaining kabbalists appointed Rabbi Kaduri as their head.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Rabbi Kaduri did not publish any of the works that he authored on Kabbalah; he allowed only students of Kabbalah to study them. He did publish some articles criticizing those who engage in "practical Kabbalah", the popular dissemination of advice or amulets, often for a price.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Kadouri said "It is forbidden to teach a non-Jew Kabbalah, not even Talmud, not even simple Torah;" perhaps referring to [[celebrity|pop celebrity]] Madonna's publicised interest in Kabbalah; he also said that women (even Jewish) are not allowed to study Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culteducation.com/group/1008-kabbalah-centre/11553-madonna-to-visit-israeli-rabbis-graves.html|title=Madonna to visit Israeli rabbis' graves|author="Associated Press September 10, 2004"|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blessings, amulets and prophecies==

Over the years, thousands of people (mainly but not exclusively [[Sephardi Jews]]) would come to seek his advice, blessings and [[amulet]]s which he would create specifically for the individual in need. He had learned the Kabbalistic secrets of the amulets from his teacher, Rabbi [[Yehuda Fatiyah]]. Many people directly attributed personal miracles to receiving a blessing from Rabbi Kaduri, such as recovery from severe illnesses and diseases, children born to couples with [[fertility]] problems, finding a spouse, and economic blessings.{{or|date=April 2014}}

His rise to fame, though, began when his son, Rabbi David Kaduri, who ran a poultry store in the [[Bukharim]] Market, decided to found a proper yeshivah organization under his father. Called Nachalat Yitzchak yeshiva, it was located adjacent to the family home in the Bukharim neighbourhood of [[Jerusalem]]. His grandson, Yossi Kaduri, took part in this endeavour with him
Kaduri was seen as a prophesier. In late 2004, Kaduri said "Great tragedies in the world are foreseen" two weeks before the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]]; reporter Baruch Gordon of [[Arutz Sheva]] connected the two by saying Kaduri "predicted" the tragedy.&lt;ref name=arutz_sheva_2005_09_21&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/89850|title=Kabbalist Urges Jews to Israel Ahead of Upcoming Disasters|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]|date=21 September 2005|accessdate=August 6, 2012|last=Gordon |first=Baruch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
The last two decades of his life were marred by the controversial way that some would use him to promote various political parties during Israeli elections. Rabbi Kaduri achieved celebrity status during the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 Knesset elections]] when he was flown by [[helicopter]] to multiple political rallies in support of the [[Shas]] party, and for amulets that were produced in his name for supporters of that party.

In October 1997, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], then in his first term as [[Prime Minister of Israel]], came to visit Kaduri at his synagogue and was recorded as whispering in his ear "the left has forgotten what it is to be a Jew". This was considered as a divisive action and resonated in the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1085803.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRWmkQbp?url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1085803.html |archivedate=February 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final days and death==

Kaduri lived a life of poverty and simplicity. He ate little, spoke little, and prayed each month at the gravesites of [[tzaddik]]im in Israel. His first wife, [[Rabbanit]] Sara, died in 1989. He remarried in 1993 to Rabbanit Dorit, a [[baalat teshuva]] just over half his age.

In January 2006, Rabbi Kaduri was hospitalized with [[pneumonia]] in the [[Bikur Holim Hospital]] in Jerusalem, where there wasn't an automatic artificial respirator, which was donated by a close person. He died at around 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. January 28, 2006 (29 [[Tevet]] 5766). He was alert and lucid until his last day.

An estimated 300,000 people took part in his funeral procession on January 29, which started from the Nachalat Yitzchak Yeshivah and wound its way through the streets of Jerusalem to the [[Givat Shaul]] cemetery near the entrance to the city of [[Jerusalem]].

==Mashiach==
[[File:Yitzhak Kaduri's note.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The note in question, sealed to be opened posthumously]]
Before his death, Kaduri had said that he expected the [[Mashiach]], the [[Mashiach#Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Messiah]], to arrive soon, and that he had met him a year earlier.&lt;ref name=Maariv&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/040/022.html |archivedate=August 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kTr7v00?url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/040/022.html |deadurl=no |publisher=[[nrg Maariv]] |script-title=he:הרב כדורי הלך לעולמו |language=he |trans-title=Rav Kaduri dies |date=January 29, 2006 |accessdate=September 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arutz_sheva_2006_01_24&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/97225 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69kU8bTtI?url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/97225 |archivedate=August 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |title=Rabbi Kaduri's Most Recent Words |publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]] |date=2006-01-24 |accessdate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that he left a hand-written note to his followers and they were reportedly instructed to only open the note after Rabbi Kaduri had been dead for one year. After this time period had passed, the note was opened by these followers and was found to read, "{{lang|he|ירים העם ויוכיח שדברו ותורתו עומדים}}" (translated as "he will raise the people and confirm that his word and law are standing"), which by acronym, suggested the name "[[Yehoshua (given name)|Yehoshua]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/001-D-120924-00.html |title=A note of Rabbi Kaduri with the name of the messiah |work=News 1 |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SEw5OR2t?url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/001-D-121332-00.html |archivedate=2014-08-31 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/001-D-121332-00.html|title=The note of Rabbi Kaduri - the messiah: Yehoshua| work=News First Class | date=2007-01-23 | accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaduri.net/_uploads/extraimg/note3.jpg |title=Image of the note of Rabbi Kaduri - the messiah: Yehoshua |work=Rabbi Kaduri's former official website |accessdate=2013-09-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6e6zrf4B4?url=http://www.kaduri.net/_uploads/extraimg/note3.jpg |archivedate=2015-12-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[acrostic]]s are a well recognised phenomenon in the Tanakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therain.org/appendixes/app60.html |first=Ethelbert William |last=[[E.

'''Zechariah Mendel ben Aryeh Leib''' (died 1791) ([[Hebrew]]: '''זכריה מנדל בן אריה ליב''') was a [[Galician Jews|Galician]] and [[History of the Jews in Germany|German]] preacher and scholar born at [[Podhaice]] in the early part of the 18th century. He died at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt-on-the-Oder]] on December 20, 1791.

He was of the same family as [[Solomon Luria]] and [[Moses Isserles]], who traced their genealogy to [[Rashi]]. Zechariah Mendel's principal teacher was [[Jacob Joshua]], author of ''Pene Yehoshua''. Zechariah Mendel was preacher in the [[Talmud Torah]] at Frankfurt-on-the-Oder. He left many writings, of which only the following three have been published (at Frankfort-on-the-Oder):
* ''Menorat Zekaryah'' (1776), a work containing novellæ on the tractate [[Moed|Shabbat]] and homilies for the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and holy days
* ''Zekaryah Meshullam'' (1779), a sequel to the preceding work, and containing novellæ on the [[Talmud]]
* ''Zekaryah ha-Mebin'' (1791), a guide to religious philosophy and to the knowledge of the true [[Kabbalah|Kabala]].
