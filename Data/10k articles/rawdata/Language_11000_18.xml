      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1808">An '''allonge''' (from French ''allonger'', "to draw out") is a slip of paper affixed to a [[negotiable instrument]], as a bill of exchange, for the purpose of receiving additional [[negotiable instrument|endorsements]] for which there may not be sufficient space on the bill itself. An endorsement written on the allonge is deemed to be written on the bill itself. An allonge is more usually met with in countries using the [[Napoleonic Code]], as the code requires every endorsement to express the [[consideration]]. Under [[English law]], the simple signature of the endorser on the bill, without additional words, is sufficient to operate as a negotiation and so an allonge is seldom necessary.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Allonge|volume=1|page=699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basavangudi Gundappa Lakshminarayana Swamy''' (1918–1980, also known as '''B. G. L. Swamy''') was an Indian [[botanist]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] writer who was professor and head of the department of [[Botany]] and a principal of [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. He was the son of [[D. V. Gundappa]], an Indian writer and philosopher.

==Education and career==

Swamy studied in Central College, [[Bangalore]] and obtained his bachelor's degree in [[botany]]. He got his PhD from the [[University of Mysore]] in 1947 and had a brief post-doctoral period at [[Harvard University]], under Irving Bailey. 

From 1953, he served as professor of botany (and later principal) at [[Presidency College, Chennai]].

The Swamy Botanical Club was formulated in his commemoration in [[Bharathidasan University]] at Tiruchirappalli.&lt;ref name="Swamy Botanical Club"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bdu.ac.in/schools/life_sciences/plant_science/jlsbc/index.php|title=Swamy Botanical Club|accessdate=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010723/http://www.bdu.ac.in/schools/life_sciences/plant_science/jlsbc/index.php|archive-date=1 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Swamy's primary research area was [[plant anatomy]], particularly the structure of connections between plants' roots and stem. He discovered a few plant species — examples are ''Ascarina maheshwarii'' and ''Sarcandra irvingbaileyi'', named for two of his teachers. In 1976, he was awarded the [[Birbal Sahni]] gold medal by the [[Government of India]] for his work in botany.
&lt;ref name="Birbal Sahni"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniraj.ac.in/ibs-2008/sheet12.html#b|archive-date=21 October 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131021075925/http://www.uniraj.ac.in/ibs-2008/sheet12.html%23b#b|dead-url=yes|title=Birbal Sahni Medal|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==

Swamy's literary works encompass a wide range of topics. Many of them are related to botany and introduce botanical concepts to the layperson. A few of his books cover plants used in everyday life in a scientific manner — such as ''Namma hotteyalli Dakshina amerika'' ("South America in our stomach").

Other works by Swamy pertain to literature, and some are partially autobiographical, dealing with his experiences as professor and principal. Apart from being an acclaimed botanist, B G L Swamy was widely respected in the history and literary circles.

He extensively studied and researched the histories and literatures of the [[Kannada]] and [[Tamil language]]s. His book ''Tamilu Talegala Naduve'' ("Among Tamil heads") is devoted to examining theories pertaining to language's origins (examining the claims that were being made in those days by the Dravidian parties) and mostly debunking them.&lt;ref name="B G L andre "&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mukthabalaga.wordpress.com/2007/02/07/b-g-l-andre-ivare-nodi/|author=Usha B R|title=B G L andre Ivare Nodi|work=muktha balaga|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shashi Rangarathna"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://churumuri.wordpress.com/2006/05/12/disgrace-why-are-so-we-lacking-in-swabhimana/#comment-1535|author=Shashi Rangarathna|title=Tamilu talegala naduve|work= churumuri|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ananthesha"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sampada.net/article/22569|author=ananthesha nempu|title=Tamilu talegala naduve|work=sampada|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book he debunks some of the theories put forward by Tamil linguists and historians such as Iravatham Mahadevan and Nilkanta Shastri. He raised questions regarding gaping holes and contradictions in their theories.&lt;ref name="Shashi Rangarathna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ananthesha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B G L andre"/&gt;

''Hasiru honnu'' is a treatise on some familiar and unfamiliar botanical species. It is also a travelogue enlivened by human drama and humor. Students of advanced botany undertake scientific tours in the company of their teachers for the identification and collection of botanical specimens. Swamy was a gifted man of letters with an observant eye and a sense of humour and, at the same time, deeply interested in history and the fine arts such as music, painting and architecture. Thus, as an artist and a scientist, he could explore and explain the world of botany in the light of a wider understanding. He describes the externals of a specimen with vivid precision and technical detail but his account of the genus and species is only a prelude to a livelier non-technical account of its appearance, its locations and practical uses. Sometimes the reader discovers how the specimen claimed attention by figuring in well-known literary works of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Datta1988"/&gt;

The book thus unfolds before the reader the abundant riches and the endless variety of the botanical world and the hundred ways it helps humans. The human variety and the different characters all memorably visualized provide ample scope for portraying dramatic situations of all kinds, from the comic to the romantic. The book primarily deals with the world of plants but it deals also with the world of humans. ''Hasiru honnu'' is as informative as it is delightful.&lt;ref name="Datta1988"/&gt;

The internet service derived its name from the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Babel fish]], a fictional species in [[Douglas Adams]]'s book and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' that could instantly translate [[language]]s. In turn, the name of the fictional creature refers to the [[Bible|biblical]] account of the [[Confusion of tongues|confusion of language]]s that arose in the city of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]].

== History ==
On December 9, 1997, [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) and [[SYSTRAN]] S.A. launched AltaVista Translation Service at babelfish.altavista.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotektur.com/demos/babelfish/en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427232555/http://www.infotektur.com/demos/babelfish/en.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1999-04-27|title=Babelfish: English|date=1999-04-27|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by a team of researchers at DEC.&lt;ref name="yahoo 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edge|first=Business|url=http://www.businessedge.ca/archives/article.cfm/babelfish-on-the-move-3074/|title=BabelFish on the move - Business Edge News Magazine Archives|publisher=Businessedge.ca|date=2003-05-15|accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by [[Yahoo!

In July 2003, Overture, in turn, was taken over by Yahoo!.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo to acquire Overture |url=http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1102.html |date=July 13, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708055621/http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1102.html |archivedate=July 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The web address for Babel Fish remained at babelfish.altavista.com until May 9, 2008, when the address changed to babelfish.yahoo.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websearchworkshop.co.uk/altavista_history.php|title=AltaVista history|publisher=Websearchworkshop.co.uk|date=1995-12-15|accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 30, 2012, the Web address changed yet again, this time redirecting babelfish.yahoo.com to www.microsofttranslator.com when Microsoft's Bing Translator replaced Yahoo Babel Fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/translation/archive/2012/05/30/welcoming-yahoo-babel-fish-users.aspx|title=Welcoming Yahoo!

Yahoo! Babel Fish should not be confused with The Babel Fish Corporation founded by [[Oscar Jofre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BabelFish continues to grow international presence|url=http://canadait.ca/cfm/index.cfm?It=106&amp;Id=14925&amp;Se=2&amp;Lo=442|date=March 7, 2003|accessdate=2012-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208210045/http://canadait.ca/cfm/index.cfm?It=106&amp;Id=14925&amp;Se=2&amp;Lo=442|archive-date=2016-02-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was operated at the URL [https://www.babelfish.com www.babelfish.com] (created in 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwhois.com/babelfish.com|title=Public Whois of BabelFish|publisher=Verisign Registry|accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2013, babelfish.yahoo.com no longer redirected to the Microsoft Bing Translator. Instead, it refers directly back to the main Yahoo.com page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8993">The '''Berry paradox''' is a [[self-referential]] [[paradox]] arising from an expression like "The smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters" (a phrase with fifty-seven letters). [[Bertrand Russell]], the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G. G. Berry (1867–1928),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Nicholas Griffin| title = The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=obY48lTt-2AC&amp;pg=PA63| date = 2003-06-23| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63634-6| page = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a junior [[librarian]] at [[Oxford]]'s [[Bodleian library]].

== Overview ==
Consider the expression:

:"The smallest [[Positive number|positive]] [[integer]] not definable in under sixty letters."

Since there are only twenty-six letters in the English alphabet, there are finitely many phrases of under sixty letters, and hence finitely many positive integers that are defined by phrases of under sixty letters. Since there are infinitely many positive integers, this means that there are positive integers that cannot be defined by phrases of under sixty letters. If there are positive integers that satisfy a given property, then there is a ''smallest'' positive integer that satisfies that property; therefore, there is a smallest positive integer satisfying the property "not definable in under sixty letters". This is the integer to which the above expression refers. The above expression is only fifty-seven letters long, therefore it ''is'' definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters, and is ''not'' defined by this expression. This is a paradox: there must be an integer defined by this expression, but since the expression is self-contradictory (any integer it defines is definable in under sixty letters), there cannot be any integer defined by it.

Perhaps another helpful analogy to Berry's Paradox would be the phrase, "indescribable feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menken|first1=Alan|last2=Ashman|first2=Howard|last3=Rice|first3=Tim|title=Aladdin (Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook)|date=1 Dec 1992|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0793517824}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the feeling is indeed indescribable, then no description of the feeling would be true.  But if the word "indescribable" communicates something about the feeling, then it may be considered a description: this is self-contradictory.

Mathematician and computer scientist Gregory J. Chaitin in ''The Unknowable'' (1999) adds this comment: "Well, the Mexican mathematical historian Alejandro Garcidiego has taken the trouble to find that letter [of Berry's from which Russell penned his remarks], and it is rather a different paradox. Berry’s letter actually talks about the first ordinal that can’t be named in a finite number of words. According, to Cantor’s theory such an ordinal must exist, but we’ve just named it in a finite number of words, which is a contradiction."

== Resolution ==
{{Confusing|section|date=December 2015}}

The Berry paradox as formulated above arises because of systematic [[ambiguity]] in the word "definable". In other formulations of the Berry paradox, such as one that instead reads: "...not [[name]]able in less..." the term "nameable" is also one that has this systematic ambiguity. Terms of this kind give rise to [[vicious circle principle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Whitehead (1927).&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve one of these paradoxes means to pinpoint exactly where our use of language went wrong and to provide restrictions on the use of language which may avoid them.

This family of paradoxes can be resolved by incorporating stratifications of meaning in language. Terms with systematic ambiguity may be written with subscripts denoting that one level of meaning is considered a higher priority than another in their interpretation. "The number not nameable&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words" may be nameable&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in less than eleven words under this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Quine|Quine, Willard]] (1976). ''Ways of Paradox''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal analogues ==

Using programs or proofs of bounded lengths, it is possible to construct an analogue of the Berry expression in a formal mathematical language, as has been done by [[Gregory Chaitin]].  Though the formal analogue does not lead to a logical contradiction, it does prove  certain impossibility results.

[[George Boolos]] (1989) built on a formalized version of Berry's paradox to prove [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]] in a new and much simpler way. The basic idea of his proof is that a [[proposition]] that holds of ''x'' if and only if ''x'' = ''n'' for some natural number ''n'' can be called a ''definition'' for ''n'', and that the set {(''n'', ''k''): ''n'' has a definition that is ''k'' symbols long} can be shown to be representable (using [[Gödel number]]s). Then the proposition "''m'' is the first number not definable in less than ''k'' symbols" can be formalized and shown to be a definition in the sense just stated.

==Relationship with Kolmogorov complexity==
{{main | Kolmogorov complexity}}

It is not possible in general to unambiguously define what is the minimal number of symbols required to describe a given string (given a specific description mechanism). In this context, the terms ''string'' and ''number'' may be used interchangeably, since a number is actually a string of symbols, e.g. an English word (like the word "eleven" used in the paradox) while, on the other hand, it is possible to refer to any word with a number, e.g. by the number of its position in a given dictionary or by suitable encoding. Some long strings can be described exactly using fewer symbols than those required by their full representation, as is often achieved using [[data compression]]. The complexity of a given string is then defined as the minimal length that a description requires in order to (unambiguously) refer to the full representation of that string.

The Kolmogorov complexity is defined using [[formal language]]s, or [[Turing machines]] which avoids ambiguities about which string results from a given description. It can be proven that the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. The proof by contradiction shows that if it were possible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity, then it would also be possible to systematically generate paradoxes similar to this one, i.e. descriptions shorter than what the complexity of the described string implies. That is to say, the definition of the Berry number is paradoxical because it is not actually possible to compute how many words are required to define a number, and we know that such computation is not possible because of the paradox.

In [[information technology]], a '''Christmas tree packet''' is a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] with every single option set for whatever protocol is in use.  The term derives from a fanciful image of each little option bit in a header being represented by a different-colored light bulb, all turned on, as in "the packet was lit up like a [[Christmas tree]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raymond|first1=Eric S.|title=Christmas tree packet|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/Christmas-tree-packet.html|website=The Jargon File|accessdate=30 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be known as a ''kamikaze packet'', ''nastygram'', or ''lamp test segment''. 

Christmas tree packets can be used as a method of [[TCP/IP stack fingerprinting]], exposing the underlying nature of a [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] stack by sending the packets and then awaiting and analyzing the responses. When used as part of scanning a system, the [[Transmission Control Protocol#TCP segment structure|TCP header]] of a Christmas tree packet has the flags FIN, URG and PSH set.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Many operating systems implement their compliance with the [[Internet Protocol]] standard (RFC 791) in varying or incomplete ways.  By observing how a host responds to an odd packet, such as a Christmas tree packet, inferences can be made regarding the host's operating system.  Versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BSD/OS]], [[HP-UX]], [[Cisco IOS]], [[MVS]], and [[IRIX]] display behaviors that differ from the [[Request for Comments|RFC]] standard when queried with said packets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html|title=Port Scanning Techniques|work=nmap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Christmas tree packets can also be used to conduct a [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS attack]] by exploiting the fact that Christmas tree packets require much more processing by routers and end-hosts than the "usual" packets do.

Christmas tree packets can be easily detected by [[intrusion-detection system]]s or more advanced [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]s. From a [[network security]] point of view, Christmas tree packets are always suspicious and indicate a high probability of network [[reconnaissance]] activities.

'''Clarify''' (Formerly known as Op3nvoice) is a conversation intelligence platform that synthesizes all 3 forms of dialogue (audio, written and video) so that this data can be used to improve compliance, productivity, and intelligence applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.op3nvoice.com/OrbispheretouseOP3Nvoiceplatform.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104123212/http://www.op3nvoice.com/OrbispheretouseOP3Nvoiceplatform.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarify enables customers to monitor audio, video and text conversations across channels including fixed lines, mobile and [[Skype]] and search to locate conversation data quickly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2013/06/18/nsa-style-intelligence-comes-to-financial-services-communications/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clarify platform offers [[API]]s that make voice and video data searchable by translating its audio to text. The software is targeted at developers and businesses wishing to turn any unstructured audio data (recordings of meetings, for instance, or audio books, phone calls, conferences, interviews, and so on) into data their business can analyse and act upon.&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/27/techstars-london-top-pick/&lt;/ref&gt;

== API ==
Clarify.io API, SDKs and plugins enable anyone to extract data from video and voice recordings. The API was released in October 2014 and is in use by disruptors, innovators and some of the world's largest institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clarify.io/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Paul Murphy, Clarify CEO and founder said the idea came out of another business that he founded in 2011, called [[Calltrunk|CallTrunk]]. That was a phone call recording platform for consumers. While users liked the service they complained they couldn’t find their call recordings — so the idea for building an audio search was born. (See [[Calltrunk#ARGOSearch|ARGO Search]])&lt;ref name=techcrunch /&gt;

== Reach ==
Rather than build products and apps itself Clarify integrates its software into existing platforms, and can already be seen in action on educational video platforms like [[Mobento]].

[[Mobento]] was the first platform that made Clarify realize it could utilize its [[ARGOsearch]] technology on video as well as pure audio files.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/09/27/the-10-techstars-demo-day-startups-and-our-3-favorites/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14386">[[Image:Communications men.jpg|thumb|220px|Old telephone wires are a challenging communications channel for modern digital communications.]]

A '''communication channel''' or simply '''channel''' refers either to a physical [[transmission medium]] such as a wire, or to a [[connection-oriented communication|logical connection]] over a [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] medium such as a radio channel in [[telecommunication]]s and [[computer network]]ing. A channel is used to [[information transfer|convey]] an [[information]] signal, for example a digital [[bit stream]], from one or several ''[[sender]]s'' (or transmitters) to one or several ''[[receiver (information theory)|receivers]]''. A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information, often measured by its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in [[Hertz|Hz]] or its [[Data signaling rate|data rate]] in [[bit rate|bits per second]].

Communicating data from one location to another requires some form of pathway or medium. These pathways, called communication channels, use two types of media: [[network cable|cable]] (twisted-pair wire, cable, and fiber-optic cable) and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] (microwave, satellite, radio, and infrared). Cable or wire line media use physical wires of cables to transmit data and information. Twisted-pair wire and coaxial cables are made of copper, and fiber-optic cable is made of glass.

In [[information theory]], a channel refers to a theoretical ''channel model'' with certain error characteristics. In this more general view, a [[Data storage device|storage device]] is also a kind of channel, which can be sent to (written) and received from (reading ).

==Examples==
Examples of communications channels include:

# A connection between initiating and terminating nodes of a [[telecommunication circuit|circuit]].
# A single path provided by a [[transmission medium]] via either
#* physical separation, such as by multipair [[Electrical cable|cable]] or
#* electrical separation, such as by [[Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division]] or [[Time-division multiplexing|time-division]] [[multiplexing]].
# A path for conveying electrical or electromagnetic signals, usually distinguished from other parallel paths.
#* A [[data storage device|storage]] which can communicate a message over time as well as space
#* The portion of a storage medium, such as a [[Track (disk drive)|track]] or band, that is accessible to a given reading or writing station or head.
#* A buffer from which messages can be 'put' and 'got'. See [[Actor model and process calculi]] for discussion on the use of channels.
# In a [[communications system]], the physical or logical link that connects a [[data]] source to a data sink.
# A specific [[radio frequency]], pair or band of frequencies, usually named with a letter, number, or codeword, and often allocated by international agreement.&lt;br /&gt;Examples:
#* [[Marine VHF radio]] uses some 88 channels in the VHF band for two-way FM voice communication. Channel 16, for example, is 156.800&amp;nbsp;MHz. In the US, seven additional channels, WX1 - WX7, are allocated for weather broadcasts.
#* [[Television channels]] such as North American TV Channel 2 = 55.25&amp;nbsp;MHz, Channel 13 = 211.25&amp;nbsp;MHz. Each channel is 6&amp;nbsp;MHz wide. Besides these "physical channels", television also has "[[virtual channel]]s".
#* [[Wi-Fi]] consists of unlicensed channels 1-13 from 2412&amp;nbsp;MHz to 2484&amp;nbsp;MHz in 5&amp;nbsp;MHz steps.
#* The radio channel between an [[amateur radio repeater]] and a ham uses two frequencies often 600&amp;nbsp;kHz (0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz) apart. For example, a repeater that transmits on 146.94&amp;nbsp;MHz typically listens for a ham transmitting on 146.34&amp;nbsp;MHz.

All of these communications channels share the property that they transfer information. The information is carried through the channel by a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]].

==Channel models==
A channel can be modelled physically by trying to calculate the physical processes which modify the transmitted signal. For example, in wireless communications the channel can be modelled by calculating the reflection off every object in the environment. A sequence of random numbers might also be added in to simulate external interference and/or electronic noise in the receiver.

Statistically a communication channel is usually modelled as a triple consisting of an input alphabet, an output alphabet, and for each pair ''(i, o)'' of input and output elements a transition probability ''p(i, o)''. Semantically, the transition probability is the probability that the [[symbol]] ''o'' is received given that ''i'' was transmitted over the channel.

Statistical and physical modelling can be combined. For example, in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation (known as [[fading]]) of the transmitted signal, followed by additive noise. The attenuation term is a simplification of the underlying physical processes and captures the change in signal power over the course of the transmission. The noise in the model captures external interference and/or electronic noise in the receiver. If the attenuation term is complex it also describes the relative time a signal takes to get through the channel. The statistics of the random attenuation are decided by previous measurements or physical simulations.

Channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined.

Communication channels are also studied in a discrete-alphabet setting. This corresponds to abstracting a real world communication system in which the analog → digital and digital → analog blocks are out of the control of the designer. The mathematical model consists of a transition probability that specifies an output distribution for each possible sequence of channel inputs. In [[information theory]], it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input.

A channel model may either be digital (quantified, e.g. binary) or analog.

===Digital channel models===
In a digital channel model, the transmitted message is modelled as a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] at a certain [[protocol layer]]. Underlying protocol layers, such as the physical layer transmission technique, is replaced by a simplified model. The model may reflect channel performance measures such as [[bit rate]], [[bit error]]s, [[latency (engineering)|latency]]/[[Network delay|delay]], [[delay jitter]], etc. Examples of digital channel models are:
* [[Binary symmetric channel]] (BSC), a discrete memoryless channel with a certain [[bit error probability]]
* Binary [[Error burst|bursty bit error]] channel model, a channel "with memory"
* [[Binary erasure channel]] (BEC), a discrete channel with a certain bit error detection (erasure) probability
* [[Packet erasure channel]], where packets are lost with a certain [[packet loss]] probability or [[packet error rate]]
* [[Arbitrarily varying channel]] (AVC), where the behavior and state of the channel can change randomly

===Analog channel models===
In an analog channel model, the transmitted message is modelled as an [[analog signal]]. The model can be a linear or non-linear, [[Continuous signal|time-continuous]] or [[Discrete signal|time-discrete]] (sampled), [[memorylessness|memoryless]] or dynamic (resulting in [[burst error]]s), time-invariant or [[time-variant system|time-variant]] (also resulting in burst errors), [[baseband]], [[passband]] (RF signal model), real-valued or complex-valued signal model. The model may reflect the following channel impairments:
* [[Electronic noise|Noise]] model, for example
** [[Additive white Gaussian noise]] (AWGN) channel, a linear continuous memoryless model
** [[Phase noise]] model
* [[Interference (communication)|Interference]] model, for example [[cross-talk]] ([[co-channel interference]]) and [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI)
* [[Distortion]] model, for example a non-linear channel model causing [[intermodulation distortion]] (IMD)
* [[Frequency response]] model, including [[attenuation]] and [[phase-shift]]
* [[Group delay]] model
* Modelling of underlying [[physical layer]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] techniques, for example a complex-valued [[equivalent baseband model]] of [[modulation]] and [[frequency response]]
* [[Radio frequency propagation model]], for example
** [[Log-distance path loss model]]
** [[Fading]] model, for example [[Rayleigh fading]], [[Ricean fading]], log-normal shadow fading and frequency selective (dispersive) fading
** [[Doppler shift]] model, which combined with fading results in a [[time-variant system]]
** [[Ray tracing (physics)|Ray tracing]] models, which attempt to model the signal propagation and distortions for specified transmitter-receiver geometries, terrain types, and antennas
** [[Mobility model]]s, which also causes a [[time-variant system]]

==Types==
* [[Digital signal (electronics)|Digital]] ([[Discrete signal|discrete]]) or [[Analog signal|analog]] ([[Continuous signal|continuous]]) channel
* [[Transmission medium]], for example a [[fibre channel]]
* [[Multiplexing|Multiplexed channel]]
* Computer network [[Virtual connection|virtual channel]]
* [[Simplex communication]], [[duplex communication]] or [[half duplex communication]] channel
* [[Return channel]]
* [[Uplink]] or [[downlink]] ([[Upstream (networking)|upstream]] or [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] channel)
* [[Channel (broadcasting)|Broadcast channel]], [[unicasting|unicast channel]] or [[multicasting|multicast channel]]

==Channel performance measures==
These are examples of commonly used channel capacity and performance measures:
* [[Spectral bandwidth]] in Hertz
* [[Symbol rate]] in baud, pulses/s or symbols/s
* [[Digital bandwidth]] bit/s measures: [[gross bit rate]] (signalling rate), [[net bit rate]] (information rate), [[channel capacity]], and [[maximum throughput]]
* [[Channel utilization]]
* [[Link spectral efficiency]]
* [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] measures: [[signal-to-interference ratio]], [[Eb/No]], [[carrier-to-interference ratio]] in [[decibel]]
* [[Bit-error rate]] (BER), [[packet-error rate]] (PER)
* [[Latency (engineering)|Latency]] in [[second]]s: [[propagation time]], [[transmission time]] 
* [[Delay jitter]]

==Multi-terminal channels, with application to cellular systems==
{{Confusing section|date=March 2010}}
:''See also [[network topology]]''
In networks, as opposed to [[point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] communication, the communication media is shared between multiple nodes (terminals). Depending on the type of communication, different terminals can cooperate or interfere on each other. In general, any complex multi-terminal network can be considered as a combination of simplified multi-terminal channels. The following channels are the principal multi-terminal channels which was first introduced in the field of information theory{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}:
* A [[point-to-multipoint communication|point-to-multipoint channel]], also known as broadcasting medium (not to be confused with broadcasting channel): In this channel, a single sender transmits multiple messages to different destination nodes. All wireless channels except radio links can be considered as broadcasting media, but may not always provide broadcasting service. The [[downlink]] of a cellular system can be considered as a point-to-multipoint channel, if only one cell is considered and inter-cell co-channel interference is neglected. However, the communication service of a phone call is unicasting.
* [[Multiple access]] channel: In this channel, multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes. This requires a [[channel access]] scheme, including a [[media access control]] (MAC) protocol combined with a [[multiplexing]] scheme. This channel model has applications in the [[uplink]] of the cellular networks.
* [[Relay channel]]: In this channel, one or several intermediate nodes (called relay, [[repeater]] or [[gap filler]] nodes) cooperate with a sender to send the message to an ultimate destination node. Relay nodes are considered as a possible add-on in the upcoming cellular standards like [[3GPP Long Term Evolution]] (LTE).
* [[Interference channel]]: In this channel, two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes. Hence, the different senders can have a possible cross-talk or co-channel interference on the signal of each other. The inter-cell interference in the cellular wireless communications is an example of the interference channel. In spread spectrum systems like 3G, interference also occur inside the cell if non-orthogonal codes are used.
* A [[unicasting]] channel is a channel that provides a unicasting service, i.e. that sends data addressed to one specific user. An established phone call is an example.
* A [[broadcast]]ing channel is a channel that provides a broadcasting service, i.e. that sends data addressed to all users in the network. Cellular network examples are the [[paging]] service as well as the [[Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service]].
* A [[multicasting]] channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users. LTE examples are the Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH) and MBSFN (Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network).

From the above 4 basic multi-terminal channels, multiple access channel is the only one whose capacity region is known. Even for the special case of the Gaussian scenario, the capacity region of the other 3 channels except the broadcast channel is unknown in general.

'''Distributed language''' represents an [[externalist]] perspective on human cognition. Instead of tracing communication to individual knowledge of a [[symbolic system]], language-activity is taken to sustain the human world.  Extending work by [[Humberto Maturana]], priority is given to how [[face-to-face interaction]] draws on multimodal activity or languaging .[1] As people language together, they gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in a range of activities in which wordings play a part. Over time, these activities construct and maintain language as a whole. Distributed language thus links a biological theory of the [[origin of language]] to [[distributed cognition]]. Human cognitive and communicative abilities arise as people do things together while drawing on material, linguistic and other resources. Language activity is constrained by [[biology]], circumstances, and collective ways of life. While bodies sustain coordination, our lived realities are extended by the resources of a partly shared collective world. Thus, language cannot be separated from the artifacts and institutions or the behaviour of the living beings who undertake collaborative (and solo) tasks. This distributed perspective challenges the mainstream view that language use can be explained by individual competencies and microsocial rules. To ascribe 'language' to individual organisms is, on the distributed perspective, an error. Building on [[cognitive science]], the perspective challenges cognitive internalism by presenting language as a prime case of embodied and culturally embedded cognition. It emphasizes that the heterogeneity of human language does much to shape people, mind and society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11445">An '''endangered species recovery plan''' is a document describing the current status, threats and intended methods for increasing [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species]] population sizes. The U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1973 requires that all species considered endangered must have a plan implemented for their recovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1533|title=16 U.S. Code § 1533 - Determination of endangered species and threatened species|work=LII / Legal Information Institute | accessdate= 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the format is also useful when considering the conservation of any endangered species. Recovery plans act as a foundation from which you can build a conservation effort and they can help to make conservation more effective.&lt;ref name ="Guidance"&gt;{{Cite journal | author =  National Marine Fisheries Service | title = Interim Endangered and Threatened Species Recovery Planning Guidance | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/guidance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The United States congress said in 1973 that endangered species "are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/species/why-save-species.html|title=Endangered Species Program - Species - Why Save Species?|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore set laws to protect endangered species. Section 4(f) of the United States [[Endangered Species Act]] from 1973 directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to develop and implement recovery plans to promote the conservation of endangered and threatened species.&lt;ref name="noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/recovery/|title=Recovery of Species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service are responsible for administering the act. The recovery plan is a document which specifies what research and management actions are necessary to support recovery, but does not itself commit manpower or funds. Recovery plans are used in setting funding priorities and provide direction to local, regional, and state planning efforts. Recovery is when the threats to species survival are neutralized and the species will be able to survive in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esrp.csustan.edu/publications/pubhtml.php?doc=sjvrp&amp;file=cover.html#guide|title=Recovery Plan for Upland Species of the San Joaquin Valley, California|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] also create similar documents, Species Action Plans, which are used to outline the conservation strategies of species, normally between set dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |title=IUCN - Species Action Plans |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325163018/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/publications/species_actions_plans/ |archivedate=25 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are used to clearly define the status and threats to the species, and set aims for conservation so that parties involved can work towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/species/action_plans/index_en.htm|title=Species Action Plan - Conservation - Environment - European Commission|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==

[[FIle:Status_ESA.svg|thumb|220px|U.S. Endangered Species Act Categories]]

An [[endangered species]] is a species which is likely to become extinct.
The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] has 17 categories of species status. These categories are used in the documents produced for the U.S. Endangered species act. The categories include:
*Endangered (E) for species “in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Threatened (T) for species “likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range”
*Candidate (C) for species currently under consideration
*Species endangered due to “similarity of appearance” (SAE)
*Species of concern (SC) for species that are considered “important to monitor” but have not been categorized as E,T or C
*Delisted species removed from the list due to species recovery or extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/about/listing-status-codes.html|title=Endangered Species Program - About Us - Frequently Asked Questions - Species Status Codes|author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species Program|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Status iucn3.1.svg|thumb|right|220px|IUCN red list categories]]

The IUCN also has categories that it uses to classify species, which are more widely used in conservation. These are:
*[[Extinct]] (EX) – there are no individuals remaining of that species at all
*[[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – there are no individuals remaining of that species in the wild at all
*[[Critically Endangered]] (CR) – there is a very high risk that the species will soon go extinct in the wild, for example because there is only a very small population remaining
*[[Endangered]] (EN) – there is a high risk of the species soon becoming extinct in the wild 
*[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – there is a high risk that the species will soon become endangered 
*[[Near threatened]] (NT) – there is a risk that the species will become threatened in the near future
*[[Least concern]] (LC) – there is a low risk that the species will become threatened. This category is used for “widespread and abundant taxa”
*[[Data Deficient]] (DD) – there is not enough data on the species to be able to make a reliable assessment on the status of the species
*[[Not evaluated]] (NE) – the species has not yet been evaluated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1|title=2001 Categories &amp; Criteria (version 3.1)|publisher= | accessdate = 21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of a recovery plan==
The recovery plan must contain at least:
#A description of what is needed to return the species to a healthy state
#Criteria for what this healthy state would be, so that the species can be removed from the endangered list when it is achieved
#Estimates of how long the recovery will take and how much it will cost &lt;ref name="noaa.gov"/&gt;

A recovery plan often contains the following sections:
*Background of the species - a description of the species, its taxonomy, population structure and life history. This includes the distribution, food sources, reproduction and abundance
*Threats - the main reasons why the species is now at risk of extinction
*Recovery strategy - details of how the species can be returned to a healthy state, including the goals, timeline, methods and criteria for delisting.&lt;ref name= "Guidance"/&gt;

==Adaptive management==

When recovery plans are carried out well, they do not simply act as stop gaps to prevent extinction, but can restore species to a state of health so they are self-sustaining. There is evidence to suggest that the best plans are adaptive and dynamic, responding to changing conditions. However, [[adaptive management]] requires the system to be constantly monitored so that changes are identified.&lt;ref name="Clark2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Clark JA et. al. | title= Improving U.S. Endangered Species Act Recovery Plans: Key Findings and Recommendations of the SCB Recovery Plan Project | journal=''Conservation Biology'' | volume=16 | year=2002 | pages=1510–1519 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01376.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surprisingly this is frequently not done, even for species that have already been [[IUCN Red List|red listed]].&lt;ref name="Grouse"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Storch, I | title= Grouse: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan 2006-2010 | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2007-034.pdf }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The species must be monitored throughout the recovery period (and beyond) to ensure that the plan is working as intended. The framework for this monitoring should be planned before the start of the implementation, and the details included in the recovery plan. Information on how and when the data will be collected should be supplied.&lt;ref name="Bonobo"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Aveling, C. et. al. | title= Bonobo (''Pan paniscus'') | url = https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2012-083.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat conservation plan==

An alternative method of conserving a species is to conserve the habitat that the species is found in. In this process, there is no target species for conservation, but rather the habitat as a whole is protected and managed, often with a view to returning the habitat to a more natural state. In theory, this method of conservation can be beneficial because it allows for the entire ecosystem and the many species within to benefit from conservation, rather than just the single target species.&lt;ref name="Rohlf1991"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Rohlf, DJ. | title= Six Biological Reasons Why the Endangered Species Act Doesn't Work - And What to Do About It | journal=Conservation Biology | volume=5 | year=1991 | pages=273–282 | jstor=2385897 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1991.tb00139.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] suggest there is evidence that habitat based approaches do not have enough focus on individual species to protect them sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |title=IUCN - Conservation Planning |publisher= |accessdate=21 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215803/http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/species/our_work/conservation_planning/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However much research now is turning towards area-based strategies in preference to individual species approaches such as endangered species recovery plans.&lt;ref name= "Rohlf1991"/&gt;

A '''front vowel''' is any in a class of [[vowel]] sound used in some spoken [[language]]s, its defining characteristic being that the highest point of the tongue is positioned relatively in front in the mouth without creating a constriction that would make it a [[consonant]]. Front vowels are sometimes also called '''bright vowels''' because they are perceived as sounding brighter than the [[back vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsur|first=Reuven|title=The Poetic Mode of Speech Perception|publisher=Duke University Press|date=February 1992|page=20|isbn=0-8223-1170-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yh4p69MaI4C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=dark+vowels}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Near-front''' vowels are essentially a type of front vowel; no language is known to contrast front and near-front vowels based on backness alone.

Rounded front vowels are typically [[Centralization (phonetics)#Centralized|centralized]], that is, near-front in their articulation. This is one reason they are written to the right of unrounded front vowels in the IPA vowel chart.

==Partial list==
The front vowels that have dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] are:

* [[close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[i]}}
* [[close front compressed vowel]] {{IPA|[y]}}
* [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[&amp;#618;]}}
* [[near-close front compressed vowel]] {{IPA|[&amp;#655;]}}
* [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[e]}}
* [[close-mid front compressed vowel]] {{IPA|[ø]}}
* [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɛ]}}
* [[open-mid front compressed vowel]] {{IPA|[œ]}}
* [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[æ]}}
* [[open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[a]}}
* [[open front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɶ]}}

There also are front vowels without dedicated symbols in the IPA:

* [[close front protruded vowel]] {{IPA|[yʷ] (y̫)}}
* [[near-close front protruded vowel]] {{IPA|[ʏʷ] (ʏ̫)}}
* [[close-mid front protruded vowel]] {{IPA|[øʷ] (ø̫)}}
* [[mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[e̞]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ̝]}} (commonly written {{angbr|{{IPA|e}}}} as if it were [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]])
* [[mid front compressed vowel]] {{IPA|[ø̞]}} or {{IPA|[œ̝]}} (commonly written {{angbr|{{IPA|ø}}}} as if it were [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]])
* [[mid front protruded vowel]] {{IPA|[ø̞ʷ]}} or {{IPA|[œ̝ʷ]}}
* [[open-mid front protruded vowel]] {{IPA|[œʷ] (œ̫)}}

As above, other front vowels can be indicated with diacritics of [[relative articulation]] applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as {{angbr|{{IPA|i̞}}}}, {{angbr|{{IPA|e̝}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|ɪ̟}}}} for a near-close front unrounded vowel.

==Articulatory front vowels==
[[File:Esling vowel chart.png|thumb|Front vowels are one of three articulatory dimensions of vowel space]]
In articulation, front vowels contrast with [[raised vowel]]s and [[retracted vowel]]s.  In this conception, front vowels are a broader category than those listed in the IPA chart, including {{IPA|[ɪ ʏ]}}, {{IPA|[ɨ ʉ]}}, and, marginally, mid-central vowels.  Raised or retracted vowels may be fronted by certain consonants, such as [[palatal consonant|palatals]] and in some languages [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeals]].  For example, {{IPA|/a/}} may be fronted to {{IPA|[æ]}} next to {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/ħ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Moisik, Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins, &amp; John H. Esling (2012) [https://www.mcgill.ca/mcgwpl/files/mcgwpl/moisik2012.pdf "The Epilaryngeal Articulator: A New Conceptual Tool for Understanding Lingual-Laryngeal Contrasts"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on preceding consonant==
{{main|Palatalization (sound change)}}
In the history of many languages, for example [[History of French|French]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], front vowels have altered preceding [[velar consonant|velar]] or [[alveolar consonant]]s, bringing their [[place of articulation]] towards [[palatal consonant|palatal]] or [[postalveolar]]. This change can be [[allophone|allophonic variation]], or it can have become [[phonemic]].

This historical palatalization is reflected in the [[orthography|orthographies]] of several European languages, including the "c" and "g" of almost all [[Romance languages]], the "k" and "g" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and the "κ", "γ" and "χ" in [[modern Greek|Greek]].  [[English language|English]] follows the French pattern, but without as much regularity.
However, for native or early borrowed words affected by palatalization, English has generally altered the spelling after the pronunciation (Examples include ''cheap, church, cheese, churn'' from {{IPA|*k}}, and ''yell, yarn, yearn, yeast'' from {{IPA|*ɡ}}.)

'''Harpal Singh Tiwana''' (born 8 August 1935 in District Ludhiana Punjab) was one of the most prominent [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] playwrights of all time. 
&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-06-28/news-interviews/27185270_1_theatre-personality-om-puri-harpal-tiwana|title=Om Puri pays tribute to stage actor|date=28 June 2003|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His two ventures into film making ''[[Long Da Lishkara]]'' and ''[[Diva bale Sari Raat]]'' became landmarks in [[Punjabi cinema]]. He also directed two television productions – ''Sanjhi Deewar'' and an unfinished project on ''Maharaja Ranjit singh''.

His famous plays include ''Sirhind di Deewar''.&lt;ref&gt;http://fatehgarhsahib.nic.in/Sir_deewar.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He established ''Punjab Kala Manch'' at [[Patiala]] along with his wife to promote local artists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/entertai/apr/04puri.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Both Tiwana and his wife Neena Tiwana are graduates from [[National School of Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ludhianadistrict.com/personality/nirmal-rishi.php&lt;/ref&gt; Neena Tiwana and his son Manpal Tiwana are also playing a key role in promoting the theatre in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].

Harpal died in a road accident near [[Palampur]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], on 19 May 2002, was cremated at Badungar cremation ground at [[Patiala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25621196_ITM | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire | title=Tiwana cremated | date=22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hema''' is a [[Bantu language]] and one of three languages spoken by the [[Hema people]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

Hema is sometimes called ''Southern Hema'' in contrast to the unrelated language [[Lendu language|Lendu]], also known as ''Northern Hema''.

The ethnically Hema dialect of [[Nyankore language|Nyankore]], called ''Hima'', is related but distinct.

The United States National Forum on Information Literacy defines '''information literacy''' as "... the hyper ability to know when there is a need for information, to be able to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information for the issue or problem at hand."&lt;ref name=NFIL &gt;{{cite web |url=http://infolit.org/about-the-national-forum/what-is-the-nfil/ |title=What is the NFIL? |publisher=National Forum on Information Literacy |accessdate=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/whitepapers/presidential |title=Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report |date=January 10, 1989 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Library Association defines "information literacy" as a set of abilities requiring individuals to "recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency#f1 Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education | Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions incorporate aspects of "skepticism, judgement, free thinking, questioning, and understanding..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillmor|first=Dan|title=Mediactive|url=http://mediactive.com/2-0-chapter-2-becoming-an-active-user-principles/|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or incorporate competencies that an informed citizen of an information society ought to possess to participate intelligently and actively in that society.&lt;ref&gt;Toth, M. ''Definitions of Information Literacy.'' Retrieved from http://www.plattsburgh.edu/library/instruction/informationliteracydefinition.php{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of efforts have been made to better define the concept and its relationship to other skills and forms of [[literacy]]. Although other educational goals, including traditional [[literacy]], [[computer literacy]], library skills, and [[critical thinking]] skills, are related to information literacy and important foundations for its development, information literacy itself is emerging as a distinct skill set and a necessary key to one's social and economic well-being in an increasingly complex [[information society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/1c/ba/3d.pdf |title=Information Skills for an Information Society: A Review of Research |date=Dec 1987 |author=Carol Collier Kulthau |publisher=ERIC |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to McTavish (2009), in order to increase and maximize people's contributions to a healthy, democratic and pluralistic society and maintain a prosperous and sustainable economy, governments and industries around the world are challenging education systems to focus people's attention on literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McTavish|first=Marianne|title="I get my facts from the Internet": A case study of the teaching and learning of information literacy in in-school and out-of-school contexts|journal=Journal of Early Childhood Literacy|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3–28|doi=10.1177/1468798408101104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, because of a great focus on a supposed literacy crisis, it has caused some alarm in some educational sectors.  Brink (2006) researched government organization, such as Human Resources and Skill Development Canada, claims that almost half of working-age Canadians do not have the literacy skills they need to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brink|first=S|title='The International Adult Literacy and Skills Survey (IALSS)', a presentation sponsored by Literacy BC and the National Literacy Secretariat (HRSDC), Vancouver.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The phrase ''information literacy'' first appeared in print in a 1974 report written on behalf of the [[National Commission on Libraries and Information Science]] by Paul G. Zurkowski, who was at the time president of the [[Software and Information Industry Association]]. Zurkowski used the phrase to describe the "techniques and skills" learned by the information literate "for utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary sources in molding information solutions to their problems" and drew a relatively firm line between the "literates" and "information illiterates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED100391 |title=The Information Service Environment: Relationships and Priorities. Related Paper No.5 |date=Nov 1974 |author=Paul G. Zurkowski |publisher=National Commission on Libraries and Information Science |accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy released a report on January 10, 1989, outlining the importance of information literacy, opportunities to develop information literacy, and an Information Age School. The report's final name is the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report.&lt;ref name="Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/whitepapers/presidential |title=Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report |date=10 Jan 1989 |accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations of the Presidential Committee led to the creation later that year of the National Forum on Information Literacy, a coalition of more than 90 national and international organizations.&lt;ref name=NFIL /&gt;

In 1998, the [[American Association of School Librarians]] and the [[Association for Educational Communications and Technology]] published ''Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning'', which further established specific goals for information literacy education, defining some nine standards in the categories of "information literacy", "independent learning", and "social responsibility".&lt;ref name="AASL Standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/informationpower/InformationLiteracyStandards_final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226225205/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/informationpower/InformationLiteracyStandards_final.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 26, 2009 |title=Information Literacy Standards for Student Learning |year=1998 |publisher=American Association of School Librarians and the Association for Educational Communications and Technology |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1998, the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy produced an update on its Final Report.&lt;ref name="A Progress Report on Information Literacy: An Update on the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/whitepapers/progressreport |title=A Progress Report on Information Literacy: An Update on the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report |date=March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This update outlined the six main recommendations of the original report and examined areas where it made progress and areas that still needed work. The updated report supports further information literacy advocacy and reiterates its importance.

In 1999, the Society of College, National and University Libraries (SCONUL) in the UK, published "The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy" model to "facilitate further development of ideas amongst practitioners in the field ... stimulate debate about the ideas and about how those ideas might be used by library and other staff in higher education concerned with the development of students' skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sconul.ac.uk/groups/information_literacy/sp/model.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028011653/http://www.sconul.ac.uk/groups/information_literacy/sp/model.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-28 |title=The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy Original model |date=November 2007 |author=Moira Bent |publisher=SCONUL |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other countries have developed information literacy standards since then.

In 2003, the National Forum on Information Literacy, together with [[UNESCO]] and the [[National Commission on Libraries and Information Science]], sponsored an international conference in Prague with representatives from some twenty-three countries to discuss the importance of information literacy within a global context. The resulting [[Prague Declaration]] described information literacy as a "key to social, cultural, and economic development of nations and communities, institutions and individuals in the 21st century" and declared its acquisition as "part of the basic [[human right]] of lifelong learning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/files/19636/11228863531PragueDeclaration.pdf/PragueDeclaration.pdf |title=The Prague Declaration – 'Toward an Information Literate Society' |date=September 2003 |publisher=Information Literacy Meeting of Experts |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://www.webcitation.org/68gfMAeC1?url=http://archive.ifla.org/III/wsis/BeaconInfSoc.html Alexandria Proclamation] linked Information literacy with lifelong learning. More than that, it sets Information Literacy as a basic Human right that it ''"promotes social inclusion of all nations".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.ifla.org/III/wsis/BeaconInfSoc.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131205075330/http://archive.ifla.org/III/wsis/BeaconInfSoc.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 5, 2013 |title=The Alexandria Proclamation on Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning |date=November 9, 2005 |publisher=IFLA |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-06-09, establishing a California ICT Digital Literacy Leadership Council, which in turn, was directed to establish an ICT Digital Literacy Advisory Committee. "The Leadership Council, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, shall develop an ICT Digital Literacy Policy, to ensure that California residents are digitally literate." The Executive Order states further: "ICT Digital Literacy is defined as using digital technology, communications tools and/or networks to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create, and communicate information in order to function in a knowledge-based economy and society..." The Governor directs  "...The Leadership Council, in consultation with the Advisory Committee... [to] develop a California Action Plan for ICT Digital Literacy (Action Plan)." He also directs "The California Workforce Investment Board (WIB)... [to] develop a technology literacy component for its five-year Strategic State Plan." His Executive Order ends with the following: "I FURTHER REQUEST that the Legislature and Superintendent of Public Instruction consider adopting similar goals, and that they join the Leadership Council in issuing a "Call to Action" to schools, higher education institutions, employers, workforce training agencies, local governments, community organizations, and civic leaders to advance California as a global leader in ICT Digital Literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=12393 |title=EXECUTIVE ORDER S-06-09 |publisher=Office of Governor Edmund G.

Information literacy rose to national consciousness in the U.S. with President [[Barack Obama]]'s Proclamation designating October 2009 as National Information Literacy Awareness Month.&lt;ref name=Obama&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/2009literacy_prc_rel.pdf |title=National Information Literacy Awareness Month |year=2009 |author=Barack Obama |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021192357/http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/2009literacy_prc_rel.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama's Proclamation stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;"Rather than merely possessing data, we must also learn the skills necessary to acquire, collate, and evaluate information for any situation... Though we may know how to find the information we need, we must also know how to evaluate it. Over the past decade, we have seen a crisis of authenticity emerge. We now live in a world where anyone can publish an opinion or perspective, whether true or not, and have that opinion amplified within the information marketplace. At the same time, Americans have unprecedented access to the diverse and independent sources of information, as well as institutions such as libraries and universities, that can help separate truth from fiction and signal from noise."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Obama's proclamation ended with: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Now, therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009 as National Information Literacy Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the important role information plays in our daily lives, and appreciate the need for a greater understanding of its impact."&lt;ref name=Obama /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Presidential Committee on Information Literacy==

The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy was formed in 1987 by the [[American Library Association]]'s president at the time Margaret Chisholm. The committee was formed with three specific purposes
# to define Information Literacy within the higher literacies and its importance to student performance, lifelong learning, and active citizenship
# to design one or more models for information literacy development appropriate to formal and informal learning environments throughout people's lifetimes
# to determine implications for the continuing education and development for teachers&lt;ref name=ACRL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/whitepapers/presidential.cfm |title=Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report |date=January 10, 1989 |publisher=ACRL |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Library Association]]'s Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defined information literacy as the ability "to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information" and highlighted information literacy as a skill essential for [[lifelong learning]] and the production of an informed and prosperous citizenry.&lt;ref name="Presidential Committee on Information Literacy: Final report" /&gt;

The committee outlined six principal recommendations: to "reconsider the ways we have organized information institutionally, structured information access, and defined information's role in our lives at home in the community, and in the work place"; to promote "public awareness of the problems created by information illiteracy"; to develop a national research agenda related to information and its use; to ensure the existence of "a climate conducive to students' becoming information literate"; to include information literacy concerns in [[teacher education]]; and to promote public awareness of the relationship between information literacy and the more general goals of "literacy, productivity, and democracy."&lt;ref name=ACRL /&gt;

In March 1998 the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy re-evaluated its Final Report and published an update. The update looks at what the Final Report set out to accomplish, its six main goals, and how far it had come to that point in meeting those objectives. Before identifying what still needs to be done, the updated report recognizes what the previous report and the National Forum were able to accomplish. In realizing it still had not met all objectives, it set out further recommendations to ensure all were met. The updated report ends with an invitation, asking the National Forum and regular citizens to recognize that "the result of these combined efforts will be a citizenry which is made up of effective lifelong learners who can always find the information needed for the issue or decision at hand. This new generation of information literate citizens will truly be America's most valuable resource", and to continue working toward an information literate world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/publications/whitepapers/progressreport.cfm Link text]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important things to come out of the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy was the creation of the National Forum on Information Literacy.

==National Forum on Information Literacy==

===Background===
In 1983, the seminal report "A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform" declared that a "rising tide of mediocrity" was eroding the very foundations of the American educational system. It was, in fact, the genesis of the current educational reform movement within the United States. Ironically, the report did not include in its set of reform recommendations the academic and/or the public library as one of the key architects in the redesign of our K-16 educational system.
This report and several others that followed, in conjunction with the rapid emergence of the information society, led the [[American Library Association (ALA)]] to convene a blue ribbon panel of national educators and librarians in 1987. The ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy was charged with the following tasks:
:(1) to define information literacy within the higher literacies and its importance to student performance, lifelong learning, and active citizenship;
:(2) to design one or more models for information literacy development appropriate to formal and informal learning environments throughout people's lifetimes; and
:(3) to determine implications for the continuing education and development of teachers.
In the release of its Final Report in 1989, the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy summarized in its opening paragraphs the ultimate mission of the National Forum on Information Literacy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

"How our country deals with the realities of the Information Age will have enormous impact on our democratic way of life and on our nation's ability to compete internationally. Within America's information society, there also exists the potential of addressing many long-standing social and economic inequities. To reap such benefits, people—as individuals and as a nation—must be information literate. To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information. Producing such a citizenry will require that schools and colleges appreciate and integrate the concept of information literacy into their learning programs and that they play a leadership role in equipping individuals and institutions to take advantage of the opportunities inherent within the information society.

Ultimately, information literate people are those who have learned how to learn. They know how to learn because they know how knowledge is organized, how to find information, and how to use information in such a way that others can learn from them. They are people prepared for lifelong learning because they can always find the information needed for any task or decision at hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becoming An Active User: Principles|url=http://mediactive.com/2-0-chapter-2-becoming-an-active-user-principles/|website=Media Active|publisher=Dan Gilmor|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Acknowledging that the major obstacle to people becoming information literate citizens, who are prepared for lifelong learning, "is a lack of public awareness of the problems created by information illiteracy," the report recommended the formation of a coalition of national organizations to promote information literacy."

Thus, in 1989, the A.L.A. Presidential Committee established the National Forum on Information Literacy, a volunteer network of organizations committed to raising public awareness on the importance of information literacy to individuals, communities, the economy, and to engage citizenship participation.

===The forum today===
Since 1989, the National Forum on Information Literacy has evolved steadily under the leadership of its first chair, Dr. Patricia Senn Breivik.  Today, the Forum represents over 90 national and international organizations, all dedicated to mainstreaming the philosophy of information literacy across national and international landscapes, and throughout every educational, domestic, and workplace venue.

Although the initial intent of the Forum was to raise public awareness and support on a national level, over the last several years, the National Forum on Information Literacy has made significant strides internationally in promoting the importance of integrating information literacy concepts and skills throughout all educational, governmental, and workforce development programs. For example, the National Forum co-sponsored with UNESCO and IFLA several "experts meetings", resulting in the Prague Declaration (2003) and the Alexandria Proclamation (2005) each underscoring the importance of information literacy as a basic fundamental human right and lifelong learning skill.

In the United States, however, information literacy skill development has been the exception and not the rule, particularly as it relates to the integration of information literacy practices within our educational and workforce development infrastructures. In a 2000 peer-reviewed publication, [[Nell K. Duke]], found that students in first grade classrooms were exposed to an average of 3.6 minutes of informational text in a school day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duke|first= N. K. |year=2000 |title=3.6 minutes per day: The scarcity of informational texts in first grade |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |volume=35 |issue= 2|pages=202–224 |url=  |doi=10.1598/RRQ.35.2.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the first national Summit on Information Literacy brought together over 100 representatives from education, business, and government to address America's information literacy deficits as a nation currently competing in a global marketplace. This successful collaboration was sponsored by the National Forum on Information Literacy, Committee for Economic Development, Educational Testing Service, the Institute for a Competitive Workforce, and National Education Association (NEA). The Summit was held at NEA headquarters in Washington, D.C.

A major outcome of the Summit was the establishment of a national ICT literacy policy council to provide leadership in creating national standards for ICT literacy in the United States.

As stated on the Forum's Main Web page, it recognizes that achieving information literacy has been much easier for those with money and other advantages. For those who are poor, non-White, older, disabled, living in rural areas or otherwise disadvantaged, it has been much harder to overcome the [[digital divide]]. A number of the Forum's members address the specific challenges for those disadvantaged. For example, The Children's Partnership advocates for the nearly 70 million children and youth in the country, many of whom are disadvantaged. The Children's Partnership currently runs three programs, two of which specifically address the needs of those with low-incomes: Online content for Low-Income and Underserved Americans Initiative, and the California Initiative Program. Another example is the National Hispanic Council on Aging, which is:

{{quote|Dedicated to improving the quality of life for Latino elderly, families, and communities through advocacy, capacity and institution building, development of educational materials, technical assistance, demonstration projects, policy analysis and research (National Hispanic Council on Aging, and, Mission Statement section).}}

The National Forum on Information Literacy will continue to work closely with educational, business, and non-profit organizations in the U.S. to promote information literacy skill development at every opportunity, particularly in light of the ever-growing social, economic, and political urgency of globalization, prompting citizens to re-energize our promotional and collaborative efforts.

==Global==

===The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)===
IFLA has established an Information Literacy Section. The Section has, in turn, developed and mounted an Information Literacy Resources Directory, called InfoLit Global. Librarians, educators and information professionals may self-register and upload information-literacy-related materials (IFLA, Information Literacy Section, n.d.)  According to the IFLA website, "The primary purpose of the Information Literacy Section is to foster international cooperation in the development of information literacy education in all types of libraries and information institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifla.org/en/about-information-literacy|title=About the Information Literacy Section|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Alliance for Information Literacy (IAIL)===
This alliance was created from the recommendation of the Prague Conference of Information Literacy Experts in 2003. One of its goals is to allow for the sharing of information literacy research and knowledge between nations. The IAIL also sees "lifelong learning" as a basic human right, and their ultimate goal is to use information literacy as a way to allow everyone to participate in the "Information Society" as a way of fulfilling this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infolit.org/about-the-national-forum/international-alliance-2/ |title=International Alliance |publisher=The National Forum of Information Literacy |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following organizations are founding members of IAIL:
*Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL); based in Australia and New Zealand. {{Official website|http://www.anziil.org/}}
*European Network on Information Literacy (EnIL); based in the European Union. {{Official website|http://enil.ceris.cnr.it/Basili/EnIL/}}
*National Forum on Information Literacy (NFIL); based in the United States. {{Official website|http://www.infolit.org}}
*NORDINFOlit; based in Scandinavia
*SCONUL (Society of College, National and University Libraries) Advisory Committee on Information Literacy; based in the United Kingdom. {{Official website|http://www.sconul.ac.uk/groups/information_literacy}}

===UNESCO Media and Information Literacy===
According to the UNESCO website, this is their "action to provide people with the skills and abilities for critical reception, assessment and use of information and media in their professional and personal lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513135303/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 13, 2016 |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal is to create information literate societies by creating and maintaining educational policies for information literacy. They work with teachers around the world, training them in the importance of information literacy and providing resources for them to use in their classrooms.

UNESCO publishes studies on information literacy in many countries, looking at how information literacy is currently taught, how it differs in different demographics, and how to raise awareness. They also publish pedagogical tools and curricula for school boards and teachers to refer to and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22445&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=-465.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513222338/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22445&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=-465.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 13, 2016 |title=Media and Information Literacy: Documents |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=October 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific aspects==
In "Information Literacy as a Liberal Art", Jeremy J. Shapiro and Shelley K. Hughes (1996) advocated a more holistic approach to information literacy education, one that encouraged not merely the addition of information technology courses as an adjunct to existing curricula, but rather a radically new conceptualization of "our entire educational curriculum in terms of information".

Drawing upon Enlightenment ideals like those articulated by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Condorcet]], Shapiro and Hughes argued that information literacy education is "essential to the future of [[democracy]], if citizens are to be intelligent shapers of the [[information society]] rather than its pawns, and to humanistic culture, if information is to be part of a meaningful existence rather than a routine of production and consumption".

To this end, Shapiro and Hughes outlined a "prototype curriculum" that encompassed the concepts of [[computer literacy]], library skills, and "a broader, critical conception of a more humanistic sort", suggesting seven important components of a holistic approach to information literacy:

*'''Tool literacy''', or the ability to understand and use the practical and conceptual tools of current information technology relevant to education and the areas of work and professional life that the individual expects to inhabit.
*'''Resource literacy''', or the ability to understand the form, format, location and access methods of information resources, especially daily expanding networked information resources.
*'''Social-structural literacy''', or understanding how information is socially situated and produced.
*'''Research literacy''', or the ability to understand and use the IT-based tools relevant to the work of today's researcher and scholar.
*'''Publishing literacy''', or the ability to format and publish research and ideas electronically, in textual and multimedia forms ... to introduce them into the electronic public realm and the electronic community of scholars.
*'''Emerging technology literacy''', or the ability to continuously adapt to, understand, evaluate and make use of the continually emerging innovations in information technology so as not to be a prisoner of prior tools and resources, and to make intelligent decisions about the adoption of new ones.
*'''Critical literacy''', or the ability to evaluate critically the intellectual, human and social strengths and weaknesses, potentials and limits, benefits and costs of information technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeremy J. Shapiro |author2=Shelley K. Hughes |date=Mar–Apr 1996 |title=Information Literacy as a Liberal Art |journal=Educom Review |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://net.educause.edu/apps/er/review/reviewArticles/31231.html |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115853/http://net.educause.edu/apps/er/review/reviewArticles/31231.html |archivedate=June 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ira Shor further defines critical literacy as "[habits] of thought, reading, writing, and speaking which go beneath surface meaning, first impressions, dominant myths, official pronouncements, traditional clichés, [[received wisdom]], and mere opinions, to understand the deep meaning, root causes, social context, ideology, and personal consequences of any action, event, object, process, organization, experience, text, subject matter, policy, mass media, or discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ira Shor |date=Fall 1999 |title=What is Critical Literacy? |journal=The Journal of Pedagogy, Pluralism, &amp; Practice |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= |url=http://www.lesley.edu/journals/jppp/4/shor.html |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807061955/http://www.lesley.edu/journals/jppp/4/shor.html |archivedate=August 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information literacy skills==
===Big6 skills===
The Big6 skills have been used in a variety of settings to help those with a variety of needs. For example, the library of Dubai Women's College, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates which is an English as a second language institution, uses the Big6 model for its information literacy workshops. According to Story-Huffman (2009), using Big6 at the college "has transcended cultural and physical boundaries to provide a knowledge base to help students become information literate" (para. 8). In primary grades, Big6 has been found to work well with variety of cognitive and language levels found in the classroom.

{{quote|Differentiated instruction and the Big6 appear to be made for each other. While it seems as though all children will be on the same Big6 step at the same time during a unit of instruction, there is no reason students cannot work through steps at an individual pace. In addition, the Big 6 process allows for seamless differentiation by interest.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, 2009, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Issues to consider in the Big6 approach have been highlighted by Philip Doty:

{{quote|This approach is problem-based, is designed to fit into the context of Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive objectives, and aims toward the development of critical thinking. While the Big6 approach has a great deal of power, it also has serious weaknesses. Chief among these are the fact that users often lack well-formed statements of information needs, as well as the model's reliance on problem-solving rhetoric. Often, the need for information and its use are situated in circumstances that are not as well-defined, discrete, and monolithic as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Doty, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eisenberg (2004) has recognized that there are a number of challenges to effectively applying the Big6 skills, not the least of which is information overload which can overwhelm students. Part of Eisenberg's solution is for schools to help students become discriminating users of information.

===Another conception===
This conception, used primarily in the [[library science|library and information studies]] field, and rooted in the concepts of [[library instruction]] and bibliographic instruction, is the ability "to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively the needed information".&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, information literacy is the basis for lifelong learning. It is also the basis for evaluating contemporary sources of information. 

In the publication Information power: Building partnerships for learning (AASL and AECT, 1998), three categories, nine standards, and twenty-nine indicators are used to describe the information literate student. 

The categories and their standards are as follows:

====Category 1: Information literacy====

Standards:

# The student who is information literate accesses information efficiently and effectively.
# The student who is information literate evaluates information critically and competently.
# The student who is information literate uses information accurately and creatively.

====Category 2: Independent learning====

Standards:

# The student who is an independent learner is information literate and pursues information related to personal interests.
# The student who is an independent learner is information literate and appreciates literature and other creative expressions of information.
# The student who is an independent learner is information literate and strives for excellence in information seeking and knowledge generation.

====Category 3: Social responsibility====

Standards:

# The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and recognizes the importance of information to a democratic society.
# The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and practices ethical behavior in regard to information and information technology.
# The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and participates effectively in groups to pursue and generate information.&lt;ref&gt;AASL and AECT, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since information may be presented in a number of formats, the term "information" applies to more than just the printed word. Other [[Literacy|literacies]] such as visual, media, computer, network, and basic literacies are implicit in information literacy.

Many of those who are in most need of information literacy are often amongst those least able to access the information they require:

{{quote|Minority and at-risk students, illiterate adults, people with English as a second language, and economically disadvantaged people are among those most likely to lack access to the information that can improve their situations. Most are not even aware of the potential help that is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. 1989, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the Presidential Committee report points out, members of these disadvantaged groups are often unaware that libraries can provide them with the access, training and information they need. In Osborne (2004), many libraries around the country are finding numerous ways to reach many of these disadvantaged groups by discovering their needs in their own environments (including prisons) and offering them specific services in the libraries themselves.

==Effects on education==
The rapidly evolving information landscape has demonstrated a need for education methods and practices to evolve and adapt accordingly. Information literacy is a key focus of educational institutions at all levels and in order to uphold this standard, institutions are promoting a commitment to lifelong learning and an ability to seek out and identify innovations that will be needed to keep pace with or outpace changes.&lt;ref name="skills"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eisenberg, B. M., Lowe, C., &amp; Spitzer, K. |title=Information Literacy: Essential Skills for the Information Age | edition = 2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational methods and practices, within our increasingly information-centric society, must facilitate and enhance a student's ability to harness the power of information. Key to harnessing the power of information is the ability to evaluate information, to ascertain among other things its relevance, authenticity and modernity. The information evaluation process is crucial life skill and a basis for lifelong learning.&lt;ref name="evaluation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/aaslpubsandjournals/slmrb/slmrcontents/volume21999/ALA_print_layout_1_202785_202785.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529090404/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/aaslpubsandjournals/slmrb/slmrcontents/volume21999/ALA_print_layout_1_202785_202785.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |title=Evaluating information: An information literacy challenge |author=Fitzgerald, M. A. |publisher=School Library Media Research, 2 |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lankshear and Knobel, what is needed in our education system is a new understanding of literacy, information literacy and on literacy teaching.  Educators need to learn to account for the context of our culturally and linguistically diverse and increasingly globalized societies.  We also need to take account for the burgeoning variety of text forms associated with information and multimedia technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankshear|first=C|title=New Literacies: Changing Knowledge and Classroom Learning|year=2003|publisher=Open University Press|location=Buckingham|author2=Knobel, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluation consists of several component processes including metacognition, goals, personal disposition, cognitive development, deliberation, and decision-making. This is both a difficult and complex challenge and underscores the importance of being able to think critically.

Critical thinking is an important educational outcome for students.&lt;ref name="evaluation" /&gt; Education institutions have experimented with several strategies to help foster critical thinking, as a means to enhance information evaluation and information literacy among students. When evaluating evidence, students should be encouraged to practice formal argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kuhn | first =D | year = 1991 |title = The Skills of Argument | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = {{page needed|date=February 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates and formal presentations must also be encouraged to analyze and critically evaluate information.

Education professionals must underscore the importance of high information quality. Students must be trained to distinguish between fact and opinion. They must be encouraged to use cue words such as "I think" and "I feel" to help distinguish between factual information and opinions. Information related skills that are complex or difficult to comprehend must be broken down into smaller parts. Another approach would be to train students in familiar contexts. Education professionals should encourage students to examine "causes" of behaviors, actions and events. Research shows that people evaluate more effectively if causes are revealed, where available.&lt;ref name="skills"/&gt;

Information in any format is  produced to convey a    message and is shared via a selected delivery method. The iterative processes of researching, creating, revising, and disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these differences (Association of College, p. 5).

Some call for increased critical analysis in Information Literacy instruction. Smith (2013) identifies this as beneficial "to individuals, particularly young
people during their period of formal education. It could equip them with the skills they need to understand the political system and their place within it, and, where necessary, to challenge this" (p.&amp;nbsp;16).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L. l. (2013). Critical information literacy instruction for the development of political agency. Journal of Information Literacy, 7(2), 15-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education in the US==

===Standards===
National content standards, state standards, and information literacy skills terminology may vary, but all have common components relating to information literacy.

Information literacy skills are critical to several of the National Education Goals outlined in the [[Goals 2000|Goals 2000: Educate America Act]], particularly in the act's aims to increase "school readiness", "student achievement and [[citizenship]]", and "[[literacy|adult literacy]] and [[lifelong learning]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/legislation/GOALS2000/TheAct/index.html |title= GOALS 2000: Educate America Act |publisher=Ed.gov |date=January 25, 1994 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of specific relevance are the "focus on [[lifelong learning]], the ability to [[critical thinking|think critically]], and on the use of new and existing information for [[problem solving]]", all of which are important components of information literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/1999-4/information.htm |title=Information Literacy. ERIC Digest |publisher=Ericdigests.org |date=October 20, 1988 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the [[American Association of School Librarians]] and the [[Association for Educational Communications and Technology]] published "Information Literacy Standards for Student Learning", which identified nine standards that librarians and teachers in K-12 schools could use to describe information literate students and define the relationship of information literacy to independent learning and social responsibility:

*Standard One: The student who is information literate accesses information efficiently and effectively.
*Standard Two: The student who is information literate evaluates information critically and competently.
*Standard Three: The student who is information literate uses information accurately and creatively.
*Standard Four: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and pursues information related to personal interests.
*Standard Five: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and appreciates literature and other creative expressions of information.
*Standard Six: The student who is an independent learner is information literate and strives for excellence in information seeking and knowledge generation.
*Standard Seven: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and recognizes the importance of information to a democratic society.
*Standard Eight: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and practices ethical behavior in regard to information and information technology.
*Standard Nine: The student who contributes positively to the learning community and to society is information literate and participates effectively in groups to pursue and generate information.&lt;ref name="AASL Standards" /&gt;

In 2007 AASL expanded and restructured the standards that school librarians should strive for in their teaching. These were published as "Standards for the 21st Century Learner" and address several literacies: information, technology, visual, textual, and digital. These aspects of literacy were organized within four key goals: that "learners use of skills, resources, &amp; tools" to "inquire, think critically, and gain knowledge"; to "draw conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new situations, and create new knowledge"; to "share knowledge and participate ethically and productively as members of our democratic society"; and to "pursue personal and aesthetic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Standards for the 21st Century Learner | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/learningstandards/AASL_LearningStandards.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = American Association of School Librarians | year = 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090630060254/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/guidelinesandstandards/learningstandards/AASL_LearningStandards.pdf | archivedate = 2009-06-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA), released "Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education", describing five standards and numerous performance indicators considered best practices for the implementation and assessment of postsecondary information literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency#f1&lt;/ref&gt; The five standards are:

*Standard One: The information literate student determines the nature and extent of the information needed.
*Standard Two: The information literate student accesses needed information effectively and efficiently.
*Standard Three: The information literate student evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value system.
*Standard Four: The information literate student, individually or as a member of a group, uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose.
*Standard Five: The information literate student understands many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/standards.pdf | format = PDF | title = Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education | publisher = Association of College and Research Libraries | date = January 2000 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091122142555/http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/standards.pdf | archivedate = 2009-11-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These standards were meant to span from the simple to more complicated, or in terms of Bloom's [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]], from the "lower order" to the "higher order". Lower order skills would involve for instance being able to use an online catalog to find a book relevant to an information need in an academic library. Higher order skills would involve critically evaluating and synthesizing information from multiple sources into a coherent interpretation or argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Section|first=edited by Jesús Lau ; IFLA Information Literacy|title=Information literacy : international perspectives|year=2008|publisher=K.G. Saur|location=München|isbn=978-3598220371|page=23|edition=2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Association of College and Research Librarians (ACRL) rescinded the Standards and replaced them with the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, which offers the following set of core ideas:

*Authority is Constructed and Contextual
*Information Creation as a Process
*Information Has Value
*Research as Inquiry
*Scholarship as Conversation
*Searching as Strategic Exploration

The Framework is based on a cluster of interconnected core concepts, with flexible options for implementation, rather than on a set of standards or learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of skills. At the heart of this Framework are conceptual understandings that organize many other concepts and ideas about information, research, and scholarship into a coherent whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework | title = Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education | publisher = Association of College and Research Libraries | date = January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===K-12 education restructuring===
Today instruction methods have changed drastically from the mostly one-directional teacher-student model, to a more collaborative approach where the students themselves feel empowered. Much of this challenge is now being informed by the [[American Association of School Librarians]] that published new standards for student learning in 2007.

Within the K-12 environment, effective curriculum development is vital to imparting Information Literacy skills to students. Given the already heavy load on students, efforts must be made to avoid curriculum overload.&lt;ref name="effective"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eisenberg | first = B. M. | title = Information Literacy: Essential Skills for the Information Age | journal = Journal of Library &amp; Information Technology |date=March 2008 | volume = 28 |issue = 2 | pages =  39–47 | accessdate = July 10, 2009 | url = http://publications.drdo.gov.in/ojs/index.php/djlit/article/viewFile/288/182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberg strongly recommends adopting a collaborative approach to curriculum development among classroom teachers, librarians, technology teachers, and other educators. Staff must be encouraged to work together to analyze student curriculum needs, develop a broad instruction plan, set information literacy goals, and design specific unit and lesson plans that integrate the information skills and classroom content. These educators can also collaborate on teaching and assessment duties

Educators are selecting various forms of [[resource-based learning]] (authentic learning, problem-based learning and work-based learning) to help students focus on the process and to help students learn from the content. Information literacy skills are necessary components of each. Within a school setting, it is very important that a students' specific needs as well as the situational context be kept in mind when selecting topics for integrated information literacy skills instruction. The primary goal should be to provide frequent opportunities for students to learn and practice information problem solving.&lt;ref name="effective" /&gt; To this extent, it is also vital to facilitate repetition of information seeking actions and behavior. The importance of repetition in information literacy lesson plans cannot be underscored, since we tend to learn through repetition.  A students’ proficiency will improve over time if they are afforded regular opportunities to learn and to apply the skills they have learnt.

The process approach to education is requiring new forms of student assessment. Students demonstrate their skills, assess their own learning, and evaluate the processes by which this learning has been achieved by preparing portfolios, learning and research logs, and using rubrics.

===Efforts in K-12 education===
Information literacy efforts are underway on individual, local, and regional bases.

Many states have either fully adopted AASL information literacy standards or have adapted them to suit their needs.&lt;ref name="skills"/&gt; States such as Oregon (OSLIS, 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100528162338/http://old.oslis.org/teacherResources/highGatherOrganize/aaslstandards1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing rely on these guidelines for curriculum development and setting information literacy goals. Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blake | first = P | year = 2006 | title = Restructuring Relationships in Virginia: The Changing Compact between Higher Education Institutions and the State | journal = [[Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–33 | doi = 10.3200/CHNG.38.1.26-33}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, chose to undertake a comprehensive review, involving all relevant stakeholders and formulate its own guidelines and standards for information literacy. At an international level, two framework documents jointly produced by UNESCO and the IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) developed two framework documents that laid the foundations in helping define the educational role to be played by school libraries: the School library manifesto (1999),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Endrizzi | first = L. | website = Lettre d'information n° 17 |date=April 2006 | title = Information Literacy | publisher = Institut Français de l'Éducation | url = http://ife.ens-lyon.fr/vst/LettreVST/english/17-april-2006_en.php | accessdate = February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another immensely popular approach to imparting information literacy is the Big6 set of skills.&lt;ref name="effective"/&gt; Eisenberg claims that the Big6 is the most widely used model in K-12 education.  This set of skills seeks to articulate the entire information seeking life cycle. The Big6 is made up of six major stages and two sub-stages under each major stages. It defines the six steps as being: task definition, information seeking strategies, location and access, use of information, synthesis, and evaluation.  Such approaches seek to cover the full range of information problem-solving actions that a person would normally undertake, when faced with an information problem or with making a decision based on available resources.

===Efforts in higher education===

Information literacy instruction in higher education can take a variety of forms: stand-alone courses or classes, online tutorials, workbooks, course-related instruction, or course-integrated instruction. One attempt in the area of physics was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. W.|author2=M. D. Chabot |author3=T. C. Messina |title=A student's guide to searching the literature using online databases|journal=Am. J. Phys.|year=2009|volume=77|issue=12|page=1112|doi=10.1119/1.3213525|arxiv=1003.0931|bibcode=2009AmJPh..77.1112M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six regional accreditation boards have added information literacy to their standards,&lt;ref name="Accreditation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/issues/infolit/standards/accred/accreditation.cfm |title=Accreditation &amp;#124; Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) |publisher=Ala.org |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Librarians often are required to teach the concepts of information literacy during "one shot" classroom lectures. There are also credit courses offered by academic librarians to prepare college students to become information literate.

In 2016, the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL, part of the American Library Association) adopted a new [http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework|title=Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education|last=DMUELLER|date=2015-02-09|newspaper=Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL)|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the ACRL's [http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/informationliteracycompetency#stan Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education] that had been approved in 2000. The standards were largely criticized by proponents of [[critical information literacy]], a concept deriving from [[critical pedagogy]], for being too prescriptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewell|first=Eamon|year=2015|title=A Decade of Critical Information Literacy: A Review of the Literature|url=http://www.comminfolit.org/index.php?journal=cil&amp;page=article&amp;op=viewArticle&amp;path%5B%5D=v9i1p24|journal=[[Communications in Information Literacy]]|volume=9|pages=24–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's termed a "framework" because it consists of interconnected core concepts designed to be interpreted and implemented locally depending on the context and needs of the audience.  The framework draws on recent research around threshold concepts, or the ideas that are gateways to broader understanding or skills in a given discipline. It also draws on newer research around meta-literacy, and assumes a more holistic view of information literacy that includes creation and collaboration in addition to consumption, so is appropriate for current practices around social media and Web 2.0. The six concepts, or frames, are:
* Authority Is Constructed and Contextual
* Information Creation as a Process
* Information Has Value
* Research as Inquiry
* Scholarship as Conversation
* Searching as Strategic Exploration
This draws from the concept of metaliteracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackey|first1=Thomas P.|last2=Jacobson|first2=Trudi E.|title=Reframing Information Literacy as a Metaliteracy|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=January 2011|volume=72|issue=1|page=62–78|url=https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16132|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers a renewed vision of information literacy as an overarching set of abilities in which students are consumers and creators of information who can participate successfully in collaborative spaces (Association of College, p. 2)
There is a growing body of scholarly research describing faculty-librarian collaboration to bring information literacy skills practice into higher education curriculum, moving beyond "one shot" lectures to an integrated model in which librarians help design assignments, create guides to useful course resources, and provide direct support to students throughout courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mounce|first=Michael|date=2010-10-04|title=Working Together: Academic Librarians and Faculty Collaborating to Improve Students' Information Literacy Skills: A Literature Review 2000–2009|journal=The Reference Librarian|volume=51|issue=4|pages=300–320|doi=10.1080/02763877.2010.501420|issn=0276-3877}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Junisbai|first=Barbara|last2=Lowe|first2=M.

===Distance education===
{{main article|Distance education}}
Now that information literacy has become a part of the core curriculum at many post-secondary institutions, it is incumbent upon the library community to be able to provide information literacy instruction in a variety of formats, including online learning and distance education. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) addresses this need in its Guidelines for Distance Education Services (2000):

{{quote|Library resources and services in institutions of higher education must meet the needs of all their faculty, students, and academic support staff, wherever these individuals are located, whether on a main campus, off campus, in distance education or extended campus programs—or in the absence of a campus at all, in courses taken for credit or non-credit; in continuing education programs; in courses attended in person or by means of electronic transmission; or any other means of distance education.}}

Within the e-learning and distance education worlds, providing effective information literacy programs brings together the challenges of both distance librarianship and instruction. With the prevalence of course management systems such as WebCT and Blackboard, library staff are embedding information literacy training within academic programs and within individual classes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Presti, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher Education in Asia ===
An online article published by the Asian Development Bank described higher education in Asia as remarkably successful. Majority of Asian government and political leaders support secondary and college education knowing it is crucial to fostering socio-economic development across the region. These bureaucracies understand that market globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1983/05/the-globalization-of-markets|title=The Globalization of Markets|date=1983-05-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, interdependence in international financial systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/cross-border-financial-interdependence-helpful-and-hazardous/|title=Cross-Border Financial Interdependence: Helpful and Hazardous|last=Bryant|first=Ralph C.|date=2001-11-30|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and prompt communications generated huge need for competent technical and managerial personnel. As a result, enrollment has increased and contribution to higher education diversified with the creation of more universities and educational institutions experimenting with various modes of delivery of instructions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|others=Asian Development Bank|title=Higher Education Across Asia: An Overview of Issues and Strategies|url=https://www.adb.org/publications/higher-education-across-asia-overview-issues-and-strategies|journal=Asian Development Bank|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Higher education in Asia continues to face numerous challenges. For one, Higher Education Institutions need to handle the sudden upsurge of enrollment. There are instances of lack of qualified mentors, questions about quality of instructions, and serious financial issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-05-01|others=Asian Development Bank|title=Administration and Governance of Higher Education in Asia: Patterns and Implications|url=https://www.adb.org/publications/administration-and-governance-higher-education-asia-patterns-and-implications|journal=Asian Development Bank|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tan Keo|first=Peter|title=Higher Education Institutions and ASEAN: Current Trends and Implications for Future Innovation and Change|date=2016-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308926261|pages=615–624|access-date=2018-06-21|last2=Jun|first2=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;. University World News said there has been substantial progress in higher education in Southeast Asia as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is laying the foundation of collaboration with regards to the education systems of member-nations. Collaboration has grown significantly during the last two decades&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170704111700957|title=Towards a Southeast Asian Higher Education Area - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Assessment==
Many academic libraries are participating in a culture of assessment, and attempt to show the value of their information literacy interventions to their students.  Librarians use a variety of techniques for this assessment, some of which aim to empower students and librarians and resist adherence to unquestioned norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Accardi|first1=Maria T.|editor1-last=Accardi|editor1-first=Maria T.|editor2-last=Drabinski|editor2-first=Emily|editor3-last=Kumbier|editor3-first=Alana|title=Critical library instruction theories and methods|date=2010|publisher=Library Juice Press|location=Duluth, Minn.|isbn=9781936117406|pages=251–264|chapter=Teaching against the grain: Critical assessment in the library classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakleaf describes the benefits and dangers of various assessment approaches: [[Multiple choice test|fixed-choice tests]], performance assessments, and [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]].

The logo of the IALA consists of 12 golden stars that circle around an image of the Earth. Inside the Earth, the letters "ia" is printed in bold, representing the first two letters of the name of the association. Finally, the phrase "interlingua de IALA" is depicted in a smaller, black typeface.

This article discusses the '''[[grammar]] of the [[Irish language]]'''.

The morphology of Irish is in some respects typical of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]]. [[Noun]]s are declined for [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]], and verbs for [[grammatical person|person]] and number. Nouns are classified by masculine or feminine [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Other aspects of Irish morphology, while typical for an [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]], are not typical for Indo-European, such as the presence of [[inflected preposition]]s and the [[Irish initial mutations|initial consonant mutation]]s. Irish syntax is also rather different from that of most Indo-European languages, due to its use of the [[verb–subject–object]] word order.

== Syntax ==
{{Main|Irish syntax}}
Word order in Irish is of the form VSO (verb–subject–object) so that, for example, "He hit me" is {{lang|ga|Bhuail}} [hit-past tense] {{lang|ga|sé}} [he] {{lang|ga|mé}} [me].

One distinctive aspect of Irish is the distinction between '''is''', the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (known in Irish as {{lang|ga|an chopail}}), and '''tá'''. '''Is''' describes identity or quality in a permanence sense, while temporary aspects are described by '''tá'''. This is similar to the difference between the verbs {{lang|es|ser}} and {{lang|es|estar}} in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (see [[Romance copula]]), although this is not an exact match; '''is''' and '''tá''' are cognate respectively with the Spanish '''es''' and '''está'''.

Examples are:
*{{lang|ga|Is fear é}}. "He is a man." (Spanish {{lang|es|Es un hombre}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|(Ele) é um homem}})
*{{lang|ga|Is duine fuar é}}. "He is cold (a cold-hearted person)." (Spanish {{lang|es|Es frío}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|(Ele) é frio}})
*{{lang|ga|Tá sé/Tomás fuar}}. "He/Thomas is cold" (= feels cold) (Alt. ''Tá fuacht air'' [= "Cold is on him"]). (Spanish {{lang|es|Tiene frío}} – in this case Spanish uses 'tener' (to have) instead of 'estar' (to be), Portuguese {{lang|pt|(Ele) está com frio}})
*{{lang|ga|Tá sé ina chodladh}}. "He is asleep." (Spanish {{lang|es|Él está durmiendo}}, Portuguese {{lang|es|Ele está a dormir}})
*{{lang|ga|Is duine maith é}}. "He is good (a good person)." (Spanish {{lang|es|Es bueno}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|(Ele) é bom}})
*{{lang|ga|Tá sé go maith}}. "He is well." (Spanish {{lang|es|Está bien}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|(Ele) está bem}})

==Nouns==
{{Main|Irish declension#Nouns}}

Irish is an [[inflected language]], having, in its standard form, the following cases: ''common'' (the old [[nominative]] and [[accusative]]), ''[[vocative]]'' and ''[[genitive]]''. In Munster dialects a [[dative]] form persisted, though this has been largely discarded by younger speakers. The present inflectional system represents a radical simplification of the grammar of [[Old Irish]].

Irish nouns may be [[grammatical gender|masculine or feminine]] (the neuter having disappeared). To a certain degree the gender difference is indicated by specific word endings, ''-án'' and ''-ín'' being masculine and ''-óg'' feminine. While it has disappeared from vocabulary, the neuter gender is still to be seen in various place names in Ireland.

==Articles==
{{Main|Irish declension#Articles}}

The Irish [[definite article]] has two forms: ''an'' and ''na''. ''An'' may cause [[lenition]], [[eclipsis]], or neither. ''Na'' may cause eclipsis, but the only instance of lenition with ''na'' is with the genitive singular of the word ''céad'' meaning '''first'''. ''An'' is used in the common case singular for all nouns, and lenites feminine nouns. In the genitive singular, ''an'' with lenition is used with masculine nouns, ''na'' with feminine nouns. In the dative singular, ''an'' may cause lenition or eclipsis depending on the preposition preceding it and on regional norms (in Ulster usage, lenition is standard with all prepositions, while in other regions eclipsis is used with many). ''Na'' is the only plural form of the article; it causes eclipsis in the genitive for both genders, and no mutation in other cases.

There is no indefinite article in Irish; the word appears by itself, for example: Tá peann agam. - "I have a pen", Tá madra sa seomra. - "There's a dog in the room".

==Adjectives==
{{Main|Irish declension#Adjectives}}

Irish adjectives always follow the noun. The adjective is influenced by the case, number and gender of the noun preceding it.

* An cailín beag
* An bhean bhocht
* Na buachaillí óga

Adjectives in Irish have two morphological degrees of [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]]: the positive ({{lang-ga|bunchéim}}), e.g. {{lang|ga|Tá an buachaill '''cairdiúil'''}} "the boy is friendly", and the [[comparative]] ({{lang-ga|breischéim}}), e.g. {{lang|ga|Tá an cailín '''níos cairdiúla''' ná an buachaill}} "the girl is nicer than the boy".  A [[superlative]] ({{lang-ga|sárchéim}}) sense is rendered by the comparative in a relative clause, e.g. {{lang|ga|Is é Seán an páiste '''is cairdiúla''' den triúr}} "Seán is the nicest child of the three".

==Verbs==
{{Main|Irish conjugation}}

There are two conjugations and 11 irregular verbs. [[grammatical tense|Tenses]] or [[grammatical mood|moods]] are formed by inflecting the [[word stem|stem]], and in the [[past tense|past]] and [[habitual aspect|habitual]] past tenses and the [[conditional mood]] also by leniting any initial consonant. The inflected tense and mood forms are: present indicative, present habitual indicative (differs from present only in the verb ''bí'' "to be"), future, past indicative, past habitual indicative, conditional, imperative, present subjunctive, and past subjunctive. Verbs also have a [[verbal noun]] and past [[participle]], and [[progressive aspect|progressive]] constructions similar to those using the English present participle may be formed from the verbal noun and an appropriate tense of ''bí''. Examples of tense conjugations: (all third person forms without subject pronoun):

* 1st conjugation: ''Fág'' "to leave" – ''d'fhág'' (past) – ''fágann'' (present) – ''fágfaidh'' (future) – ''d'fhágfadh'' (conditional) – ''d'fhágadh'' (habitual past) – ''fága'' (subjunctive) – ''fágadh'' (imperative)
* 2nd conjugation: ''Ceannaigh'' "to buy" – ''cheannaigh'' (past) – ''ceannaíonn'' (present) – ''ceannóidh'' (future) – ''cheannódh'' (conditional) – ''cheannaíodh'' (habitual past) – ''ceannaí'' (subjunctive) – ''ceannaíodh'' (imperative)
* Irregular: ''Téigh'' "to go" – ''chuaigh'' (past) – ''téann'' (present) – ''rachaidh'' (future) – ''rachadh'' (conditional) – ''théadh'' (habitual past) – ''té'' (subjunctive) – ''téadh'' (imperative)

There is no passive proper in Irish, but there is an [[impersonal verb|impersonal form of the verb]], termed the ''saorbhriathar'' or "autonomous verb".

Verbs can be conjugated either [[synthetic language|synthetically]] (with the [[personal pronoun]] included in the verb inflection) or [[analytic language|analytically]] (with the verb inflected for tense only and a separate subject). However, the official standard generally prescribes the analytic form in most person-tense combinations, and the synthetic in only some cases, such as the first person plural. The analytic forms are also generally preferred in the western and northern dialects, except in answer to what would in English be "yes/no" questions, while [[Munster Irish]] prefers the synthetic forms. For example, the following are the standard form, synthetic form and analytical form of the past tense of ''rith'' "to run":

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person !! Standard !! Synthetic !! Analytic
|-
| 1st sing || rith mé || ritheas || rith mé
|-
| 2nd sing || rith tú || rithis || rith tú
|-
| 3rd sing || rith sé || rith || rith sé
|-
| 1st plural || ritheamar || ritheamar || rith sinn / rith muid*
|-
| 2nd plural || rith sibh || ritheabhar || rith sibh
|-
| 3rd plural || rith siad || ritheadar || rith siad
|-
| Impersonal || ritheadh || ritheadh || ritheadh
|-
| colspan=4 | &lt;nowiki/&gt;*''muid'' is non-standard but is the usual 1st person plural pronoun in the western and northern dialects.
|}

==Pronouns==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pronoun]] --&gt;

===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns in Irish do not inflect for case, but there are three different sets of pronouns used: conjunctive forms, disjunctive forms, and emphatic forms (which may be used either conjunctively or disjunctively)

====Conjunctive forms====
The normal [[word order]] in Irish is verb–subject–object ([[Verb–subject–object|VSO]]). The forms of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] pronoun directly following the verb are called ''conjunctive'':
{|class="wikitable"
! Person
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1st || {{Lang|ga|mé}} || {{Lang|ga|(muid)}}
|-
| 2nd || {{Lang|ga|tú}} || {{Lang|ga|sibh}}
|-
| 3rd || masc. {{Lang|ga|sé}}&lt;br /&gt;fem. {{Lang|ga|sí}} || {{Lang|ga|siad}}
|}
The form {{Lang|ga|muid}} in the 1st person plural is not used in the standard language, but is very common in western and northern dialects. The standard and southern dialects have no subject pronoun in the 1st person plural, using the synthetic verb ending '''-imíd''' (alt '''-imid''') instead.

Irish has no [[T–V distinction]], i.e. it does not differentiate between formal and familiar forms of second person pronouns. The difference between {{Lang|ga|tú}} and {{Lang|ga|sibh}} is purely one of number.

There is no equivalent to the English "it", either "sé" or "sí" are used depending on whether the thing the speaker is referring to is a masculine noun or a feminine noun. The exception is the pronoun '''ea''', used in impersonal copula phrases, particularly in the phrases '''is ea''' (&gt; ''''sea''') "''yes''", "''so''", "''that is so''", '''ní hea''' (the opposite of '''is ea'''), '''nach ea?''' "''is that not so?''", '''an ea''' (Kerry '''am b'ea''') "''Is that so?''", '''fear is ea é''' "''it's a man''", and so on.

====Disjunctive forms====
If a pronoun is not the subject or if a subject pronoun does not follow the verb (as in a verbless clause, or as the subject of the copula, where the pronoun stands at the end of the sentence), the so-called [[disjunctive pronoun|''disjunctive'' forms]] are used:
{|class="wikitable"
! Person
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1st || {{Lang|ga|mé}} || {{Lang|ga|sinn, muid}}
|-
| 2nd || {{Lang|ga|thú}} || {{Lang|ga|sibh}}
|-
| 3rd || masc. {{Lang|ga|é}};&lt;br /&gt;fem. {{Lang|ga|í}} || {{Lang|ga|iad}}
|}

In Munster dialects the form ''thú'' is either (a) archaic (replaced by ''tú'') or (b) is only found after words ending in a vowel.

;Standard:''Buailim thú'' ("I hit you", present tense), ''Bhuail mé thú'' ("I hit you", past tense)
;Dialect type (a):''Buailim tú'', ''Bhuail mé tú''
;Dialect type (b):''Buailim tú'', ''Bhuail mé thú''

====Intensive forms====
Irish also has [[intensive pronoun]]s, used to give the pronouns a bit more weight or emphasis.
{|class="wikitable"
! Person
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1st || {{Lang|ga|mise}} || {{Lang|ga|muidne, sinne}}
|-
| 2nd || {{Lang|ga|t(h)usa}} || {{Lang|ga|sibhse}}
|-
| 3rd || masc. {{Lang|ga|(s)eisean}}&lt;br /&gt;fem. {{Lang|ga|(s)ise}} || {{Lang|ga|(s)iadsan}}
|}

The forms ''thusa'', ''eisean'' and ''ise'' are disjunctive forms, while ''tusa'', ''seisean'' and ''sise'' are conjunctive forms.

The word {{Lang|ga|féin}} ({{IPA|/fʲeːnʲ/}} or {{IPA|/heːnʲ/}}) "-self" can follow a pronoun, either to add emphasis or to form a reflexive pronoun.

:{{Lang|ga|Rinne mé féin é.}} "I did it myself."
:{{Lang|ga|Ar ghortaigh tú thú féin?}} "Did you hurt yourself?"
:{{Lang|ga|[[Sinn Féin]]}} is thus "We Ourselves"

===Possessive determiners===
The possessive determiners cause different initial consonant mutations.
{{Col-start}}
{{Col-2}}
{{Lang|ga|mo}} "my" lenites; {{Lang|ga|m’}} precedes vowels
:{{Lang|ga|mo chara}} "my friend"
:{{Lang|ga|m'fheirm}} "my farm"
:{{Lang|ga|m'athair}} "my father"

{{Lang|ga|do}} "your (sg.)" lenites; {{Lang|ga|d’}} (or t' in many dialects) precedes vowels
:{{Lang|ga|do chara}} "your friend"
:{{Lang|ga|d'fheirm/t'fheirm}} "your farm"
:{{Lang|ga|d'athair/t'athair}} "your father"

{{Lang|ga|a}} "his" lenites
:{{Lang|ga|a chara}} "his friend"
:{{Lang|ga|a fheirm}} "his farm"
:{{Lang|ga|a athair}} "his father"

{{Lang|ga|a}} "her" takes the radical of a consonant and adds an {{Lang|ga|h}} to a vowel
:{{Lang|ga|a cara}} "her friend"
:{{Lang|ga|a feirm}} "her farm"
:{{Lang|ga|a hathair}} "her father"
{{Col-2}}
{{Lang|ga|ár}} "our" eclipses
:{{Lang|ga|ár gcara}} "our friend"
:{{Lang|ga|ár bhfeirm}} "our farm"
:{{Lang|ga|ár n-athair}} "our father"

{{Lang|ga|bhur}} "your (pl.)" eclipses
:{{Lang|ga|bhur gcara}} "your friend"
:{{Lang|ga|bhur bhfeirm}} "your farm"
:{{Lang|ga|bhur n-athair}} "your father"

{{Lang|ga|a}} "their" eclipses
:{{Lang|ga|a gcara}} "their friend"
:{{Lang|ga|a bhfeirm}} "their farm"
:{{Lang|ga|a n-athair}} "their father"
{{Col-end}}
The forms {{Lang|ga|a}} and {{Lang|ga|ár}} can also blend with certain prepositions:
{|class="wikitable"
| {{Lang|ga|de}} &amp; {{Lang|ga|do}} || {{Lang|ga|dá chara}} "from/to his friend"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|dá feirm}} "from/to her farm"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|dár n-athair}} "from/to our father"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|dá n-athair}} "from/to their father"
|-
| {{Lang|ga|faoi}} || {{Lang|ga|faoina chara}} "about his friend"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|faoinár n-athair}} "about our father"
|-
| {{Lang|ga|i}} || {{Lang|ga|ina feirm}} "in her farm"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|inár bhfeirm}} "in our farm"
|-
| {{Lang|ga|le}} || {{Lang|ga|lena n-athair}} "with their father"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|lenár bpáiste}} "with our child"
|-
| {{Lang|ga|ó}} || {{Lang|ga|óna bhean}} "from his wife"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|ónár dtaighde}} "from our research"
|-
| {{Lang|ga|trí}} || {{Lang|ga|trína cos}} "through her foot"&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|trínár dteach}} "through our house"
|}

The object of a verbal noun is in the genitive case:
*{{Lang|ga|Tá sé ag plé a rothair.}} "He's discussing his bicycle" (lit.: He is at the discussing of his bicycle)

Similarly, if the object of the verbal noun is a pronoun, then it is a possessive pronoun:
*{{Lang|ga|Tá sé '''á''' phlé.}} "He's discussing it." (lit.: He is at its (i.e. the bicycle's) discussing)

More examples:
*{{Lang|ga|Tá sí '''do mo''' bhualadh.}} "She's hitting me."
*{{Lang|ga|Tá siad '''do do''' phlé.}} "They are discussing you."
*{{Lang|ga|Tá sé '''á''' pógadh.}} "He's kissing her."
*{{Lang|ga|Tá tú '''dár''' mbualadh.}} "You're hitting us."
*{{Lang|ga|Tá mé '''do bhur''' bplé.}} "I'm discussing you (pl.)."
*{{Lang|ga|Tá sibh '''á''' bpógadh.}} "You (pl.) are kissing them."

===Interrogative pronouns===
Interrogative pronouns introduce a question, e.g. the words ''who, what, which''. The Irish equivalents are:
*{{Lang|ga|cé}} "who?, which?"
*{{Lang|ga|cad}} or {{Lang|ga|céard}} "what?"
*{{Lang|ga|cá}} "which?"

Examples:
*{{Lang|ga|Cé a rinne é?}} "Who did it?"
*{{Lang|ga|Cé a chonaic tú?}} "Who did you see?"
*{{Lang|ga|Cé ar thug tú an leabhar dó?}} "Who did you give the book to?"
*{{Lang|ga|Cad atá ort?}} "What's wrong (with you)?" (lit. "What is on you?")
*{{Lang|ga|Céard a dúirt tú?}} "What did you say?"
*{{Lang|ga|Cá hainm atá ort?}} "What's your name?" (lit. "Which name is upon you?")
*{{Lang|ga|Cá haois tú?}} "How old are you?" (lit. "Which age are you?")

==Prepositions==
As the object of a preposition, a pronoun is fused with the preposition; one speaks here of "inflected" prepositions, or, as they are more commonly termed, [[conjugated preposition|prepositional pronouns]].

==Numbers==

===Cardinal numbers===
There are three kinds of cardinal numbers in Irish: disjunctive numbers, nonhuman conjunctive numbers, and human conjunctive numbers.

====Disjunctive numbers====
{|
| width=20 | 0
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|náid}}
| width=30 | 13
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|a trí déag}}
|-
| 1 || {{Lang|ga|a haon}} || 14 || {{Lang|ga|a ceathair déag}}
|-
| 2 || {{Lang|ga|a dó}} || 20 || {{Lang|ga|fiche}}
|-
| 3 || {{Lang|ga|a trí}} || 21 || {{Lang|ga|fiche a haon}}
|-
| 4 || {{Lang|ga|a ceathair}} || 30 || {{Lang|ga|tríocha}}
|-
| 5 || {{Lang|ga|a cúig}} || 40 || {{Lang|ga|daichead}}
|-
| 6 || {{Lang|ga|a sé}} || 50 || {{Lang|ga|caoga}}
|-
| 7 || {{Lang|ga|a seacht}} || 60 || {{Lang|ga|seasca}}
|-
| 8 || {{Lang|ga|a hocht}} || 70 || {{Lang|ga|seachtó}}
|-
| 9 || {{Lang|ga|a naoi}} || 80 || {{Lang|ga|ochtó}}
|-
| 10 || {{Lang|ga|a deich}} || 90 || {{Lang|ga|nócha}}
|-
| 11 || {{Lang|ga|a haon déag}} || 100 || {{Lang|ga|céad}}
|-
| 12 || {{Lang|ga|a dó dhéag}} || 1000. || {{Lang|ga|míle}}
|}
These numbers are used for example in arithmetic, in telling time, in telephone numbers and after nouns in forms like {{Lang|ga|bus a trí déag}} "bus 13" or {{Lang|ga|seomra a dó}} "room 2".

====Nonhuman conjunctive numbers====
These numbers are used to count nouns that do not refer to human beings, e.g. {{Lang|ga|capall}} "horse"
{|
| width=20 | 1
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|aon chapall amháin}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|capall amháin}}
| width=20 | 13
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|trí chapall déag}}
|-
| 2 || {{Lang|ga|dhá chapall}} || 20 || {{Lang|ga|fiche capall}}
|-
| 3 || {{Lang|ga|trí chapall}} || 21 || {{Lang|ga|capall is fiche}}
|-
| 4 || {{Lang|ga|ceithre chapall}} || 22 || {{Lang|ga|dhá chapall is fiche}}
|-
| 5 || {{Lang|ga|cúig chapall}} || 30 || {{Lang|ga|tríocha capall}}
|-
| 6 || {{Lang|ga|sé chapall}} || 40 || {{Lang|ga|daichead capall}}
|-
| 7 || {{Lang|ga|seacht gcapall}} || 50 || {{Lang|ga|caoga capall}}
|-
| 8 || {{Lang|ga|ocht gcapall}} || 60 || {{Lang|ga|seasca capall}}
|-
| 9 || {{Lang|ga|naoi gcapall}} || 70 || {{Lang|ga|seachtó capall}}
|-
| 10 || {{Lang|ga|deich gcapall}} || 80 || {{Lang|ga|ochtó capall}}
|-
| 11 || {{Lang|ga|aon chapall déag}} || 90 || {{Lang|ga|nócha capall}}
|-
| 12 || {{Lang|ga|dhá chapall déag}} || 100 || {{Lang|ga|céad capall}}
|}
"One" as a [[pronoun]] is rendered with {{Lang|ga|ceann}} (lit. "head") when it concerns things and animals, e.g.:
:{{Lang|ga|Tá cúig chapall agam; tá ceann acu breoite.}} "I have five horses; one of them is sick."

====Human conjunctive numbers====
These numbers are used to count nouns that refer to human beings, e.g. '''páiste''' 'child'
{|
| width=20 | 1
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|aon pháiste amháin}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Lang|ga|páiste amháin}}
| width=20 | 7
| width=150 | {{Lang|ga|seachtar páistí}}
|-
| 2 || {{Lang|ga|beirt pháistí}} || 8 || {{Lang|ga|ochtar páistí}}
|-
| 3 || {{Lang|ga|triúr páistí}} || 9 || {{Lang|ga|naonúr páistí}}
|-
| 4 || {{Lang|ga|ceathrar páistí}} || 10 || {{Lang|ga|deichniúr páistí}}
|-
| 5 || {{Lang|ga|cúigear páistí}} || 11 || {{Lang|ga|aon pháiste déag}}
|-
| 6 || {{Lang|ga|seisear páistí}} || 12 || {{Lang|ga|dáréag páistí}}
|}
"One" as a pronoun is rendered with {{Lang|ga|duine}} (lit. "person") with people. The other "personal" numbers can also be used pronominally, e.g.:
:{{Lang|ga|Tá cúigear páistí agam; tá duine acu breoite.}} "I have five children; one of them is sick."
:{{Lang|ga|Tá seisear sa seomra.}} "Six people are in the room."

Higher numbers are done as with the nonhuman conjunctive numbers: {{Lang|ga|trí pháiste déag}}, {{lang|ga|fiche páiste}}, etc.

==Phonology==
{{Main|Irish phonology}}

A notable feature of Irish phonology is that consonants (except {{IPA|/h/}}) come in pairs, one "broad" ([[velarization|velarized]], pronounced with the back of the tongue pulled back towards the soft palate) and one "slender" ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]], pronounced with the middle of the tongue pushed up towards the hard palate).

'''Ixil''' (Ixhil) is one of the 21 different [[Mayan languages]] spoken in Guatemala. According to historical linguistic studies Ixil emerged as a separate language sometime around the year 500AD.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, Benjamin N., Pierre L. van den Berghe. 1977. Ixiles y Ladinos: El Pluralism Social en el Altiplano de Guatemala. Guatemala: Editorial "Jose de Pineda Ibarra". p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary language of the [[Ixil people]], which comprises the three towns of [[San Juan Cotzal]], [[Santa Maria Nebaj]], and [[San Gaspar Chajul]] in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands. There is also an Ixil speaking migrant population in Guatemala City and the United States. Although there are slight differences in vocabulary in the dialects spoken by people in the three different Ixil towns, they are all mutually intelligible and should be considered dialects of a single language.

A notable feature of Ixil is that all short vowels are either central or back vowels and all long vowels are front vowels. This is a unique feature not found in other Mayan languages. As an exception, some speakers do not pronounce {{angbr|oo}} as front {{IPA|[øː]}} but rather as a back {{IPA|[oː]}}. Also, some speakers also pronounce {{angbr|i}} as {{IPA|[i]}} rather than {{IPA|[ɪ]}}. Short vowels are very short in Ixil, and long {{angbr|uu}} {{IPA|[yː]}} is extra long and stressed.

'''Julius''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[speech recognition]] engine.

Julius is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for speech-related researchers and developers. It can perform almost real-time decoding on most current PCs in 60k word dictation task using word [[Trigram|3-gram]] and context-dependent [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]]. Major search techniques are fully incorporated.     It is also modularized carefully to be independent from model structures, and various HMM types are supported such as shared-state [[triphone]]s and tied-mixture models, with any number of mixtures, states, or phones. Standard formats are adopted to cope with other free modeling toolkit. The main platform is [[Linux]] and other Unix workstations, and also works on Windows. Julius is open source and distributed with a revised [[BSD]] style license.

Julius has been developed as part of a free software toolkit for Japanese LVCSR research since 1997, and the work has been continued at Continuous Speech Recognition Consortium (CSRC), Japan from 2000 to 2003.

From rev.3.4, a grammar-based recognition parser named "Julian" is integrated into Julius. Julian is a modified version of Julius that uses hand-designed [[Finite state machine|DFA]] grammar as a language model. It can be used to build a kind of voice command system of small vocabulary, or various spoken [[dialog system]] tasks.

==About Models==
To run the Julius recognizer, you need a [[language model]] and an [[Acoustic Model|acoustic model]] for your language.

Julius adopts acoustic models in [[HTK (software)|HTK]] [[ASCII]] format, pronunciation dictionary in HTK-like format, and word 3-gram language models in ARPA standard format (forward 2-gram and reverse 3-gram as trained from [[speech corpus]] with reversed word order).

Although Julius is only distributed with Japanese models, the [[VoxForge]] project is working on creating English acoustic models for use with the Julius Speech Recognition Engine. 

Recently in April 2018 thanks to the effort of [[Mozilla]] foundation, where a 350 hours of spoken English audio corpus was made available, a new English ENVR-v5.4 open source speech model was released alongside with Polish PLPL-v7.1 models, available from &lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/juliusmodels/files/&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations in the [[number]] of [[lexemes|lexical categories]] across the [[language]]s is a notable idea in [[cultural anthropology]]. A former study on "[[color terms]]" explores such variations. Brent Berlin and Paul Kay (1969) argued that these qualitative and quantitative differences can be organized into a [[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution|coherent hierarchy]].
As far as [[kinship]] terms are concerned, the variation is not found as an hierarchical organization, but as a result of conditions or constraints. That is to say, the number of kinship terms varies across the [[language]]s because of [[Sociocultural system|sociocultural]] conditions or constraints on the [[biology|biological]] traits.

== Introduction ==

This article does not include all the studies on kinship, but only those relevant studies which indicate a relation with the number of kinship terms. References include: first, of course the base, the 1871 [[Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family]] by [[Lewis H. Morgan]]; second, the 1949 'Social Structure' by [[George Peter Murdock]]; and third, the 1949 "Elementary Structures of Kinship" by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. In a succession to these studies on kinship terminology study of [[Raj Tilak Saxena|Saxena R. T.]] (2012) on Hindi and Telugu kinship terminology explained the variations in the number of kinship terms.

=== Classical patterns ===

Morgan's (see in [[kinship]]) (1971) work is well known for six classical patterns. These patterns were based on two kinds of terminological systems: 1)descriptive and 2)classificatory. Descriptive systems have the terms indicating unique relatives, whereas classificatory systems classify relatives in a term on the basis of generalization. Collateral merging is one of the example (see more in Morgan, 1971). 
A classificatory system, by definition, implies relatively less term; and a descriptive system more terms. Morgan was not interested in the number of the terms but in the distribution of the terms.

=== Features ===

Murdock's (1949) explanation was an attempt to define kinship terminology in terms of distinctive features and deterministic factors. He described nine features on the basis of which a term can be said as a classificatory term or as a descriptive term. Some features are age, affinity, polarity, generation, gender (see more in Murdock, 1949). He explained that number of factors (such as morphological, social, psychological etc.) are the factors which determine whether a terminology will describe or classify relatives. It was the first time when an attempt towards numerical evaluation of kinship terms was made. Though for Morgan too number was not the primary concern but the concern was "nuclear family".

=== Famous analogy ===

Claude Lévi-Strauss (1969) came up with a new approach. His first idea (in 1969) was that 'the culture is universal and innate'. His ideas (in 1969) resemble the impact of structural linguistics. In linguistics Phonemes are known as the realization of hidden neurological binary opposition. On the same principle Claude Lévi-Strauss (1969) claimed that culture is a realization of some hidden property. Though in the case of culture the universal property is not neurological but "Attitudinal". Latter in 2004 he showed, taking examples from different culture, that how attitudinal opposition construct the structure of kinship terms.

== Numerical variation ==

Humans have a set of distinctive features (known as phonetic features), and by this set they can produce any speech sound (phoneme) of any human language. BUT NOTE: a particular language have limited features and phonemes, thus speaker of language A may not produce phonemes of language B. In this way a particular language is a "Constraint" on the ability of humans to produces many more speech sounds.
On the same schema [[Raj Tilak Saxena|Saxena R. T. (2012)]] claims that Kinship terms are formed on some biological features (like "gene" and "sexuality") and some social features ("consanguinity" and "affinity"). The former is universal and latter is particular. Say every one have sexual instinct by birth but it is the society that constrains the use of this ability to the limited members by exogamy. Exogamy vary cross culturally, so the number of kinship term. Take an example from Hindi (Hindu Brahmin in North India. They can not may within the kinship group of birth. On the other hand, take Telugu speakers (Reddi caste) into account, they can marry the child of mother's brother. The result of kin-group exogamy among Hindi speaking Hindu is that they have EXTRA terms for IN-LAW RELATIVES, on the contrary Telugu speakers LACK those terms for in-laws. THUS there is a variation in the number. 
Based on these examples four classes of relatives were declared:
#Consanglineal Relatives 
#Consanglateral Relatives 
#Affilateral Relatives and 
#Affilineal relatives. 
Kingroup-exogamous systems have the four classes whereas kin-group endogamous systems have only three (first three) classes. We should note that the features such as relative age, gender, generation etc. are also responsible for numerical variations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">{{sociology}} 
'''Manifest and latent functions''' are [[social concept|social scientific concepts]] created by anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski in 1922 while studying the Trobiand Islanders in the Western Pacific. It was later modified for [[sociology]] by [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diligio.com/notes26.htm Diligio, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Merton appeared interested in sharpening the conceptual tools to be employed in a [[Structural functionalism|functional analysis]].  

Manifest [[Structural functionalism|function]]s are conscious, deliberate and beneficial, the latent ones the unconscious, unintended and beneficial, and [[Dysfunction (sociology)|dysfunctions]] are unconscious, unintended and harmful. &lt;ref name=B63&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/manlat.html Berger, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; While functions are intended (manifest) or unintended (latent), and have a positive effect on [[society]], dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized (latent) and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004&gt;[Brinkerhoff et al. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify| reason=The ideas in the paragraph are hard to follow|date=July 2016}}

==Functions==
Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the consequences that people observe or expect. It is explicitly stated and understood by the participants in the relevant action. The manifest function of a [[rain dance]], used as an example by Merton in his 1967 '' [[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', is to produce [[rain]], and this outcome is intended and desired by people participating in the ritual.&lt;ref name=M57&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/TheoryWeb/Merton.htm Merton, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M2001&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/ecologic.htm M.D. Murphy, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latent functions are those that are neither recognized nor intended. A latent function of a behavior is not explicitly stated, recognized, or intended by the people involved. Thus, they are identified observers.&lt;ref name=M2001/&gt; In the example of rain ceremony, the latent function [[reinforce]]s the [[group identity]] by providing a regular opportunity for the members of a [[group (sociology)|group]] to meet and engage in a common activity.&lt;ref name=M57/&gt;

[[Peter L. Berger]] describes a series of examples illustrating the differences between manifest functions and latent dysfunctions:
{{cquote|"...the “manifest” function of antigambling legislation may be to suppress gambling, its “latent” function to create an illegal empire for the gambling syndicates. Or Christian missions in parts of Africa “manifestly” tried to convert Africans to Christianity, “latently” helped to destroy the indigenous tribal cultures and this provided an important impetus towards rapid social transformation. Or the control of the Communist Party over all sectors of social life in Russia “manifestly” was to assure the continued dominance of the revolutionary ethos, “latently” created a new class of comfortable bureaucrats uncannily bourgeois in its aspirations and increasingly disinclined toward the self-denial of Bolshevik dedication (''nomenklatura''). Or the “manifest” function of many voluntary associations in America is sociability and public service, the “latent” function to attach status indices to those permitted to belong to such associations.” "&lt;ref name=B63/&gt;}}

While [[Talcott Parsons]] tends to emphasize the manifest functions of [[social behavior]], Merton sees attention to latent functions as increasing the understanding of society: the distinction between manifest and latent forces the [[sociologist]] to go beyond the reasons individuals give for their actions or for the existence of [[Tradition|customs]] and [[institution]]s; it makes them look for other [[social consequence]]s that allow these practices’ survival and illuminate the way society works.

== Dysfunctions ==
[[Dysfunction (sociology)|Dysfunction]]s can also be manifest or latent. While functions are intended or recognized (manifest), and may have a positive effect on society, dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized, and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004/&gt;

Manifest dysfunctions are anticipated disruptions of social life. For example, a manifest dysfunction of a [[festival]] might include disruptions of transportation and excessive production of garbage.&lt;ref name=f2005&gt;[Ferrante, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Latent dysfunctions are unintended and unanticipated disruptions of order and stability. In the festival example, they would be represented by people missing work due to the traffic jam.&lt;ref name=f2005/&gt;

== Medical science model ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2013}}
Broadly stated and here relying on the systems model first developed in medical science, an interrelated bundle of [[social structure]]s (e.g., [[Zulu culture]]), treated as a [[social system]], involves the parts (structural elements) acting in such a fashion so as to help maintain the [[homeodynamic]] equilibrium of the system of which they are an element. Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the obvious and intended consequences a structural feature displays in the maintenance of the steady state of the system of which it is a part. Latent functions are less obvious or [[unintended consequence]]s. Both manifest and latent functions contribute to the social system’s unchanging ongoingness or stasis. In this very specific sense both may be interpreted as useful and positive.

In conducting a functional analysis, '''dysfunctions''' are consequences of structural elements that produce changes in their environing social system. The flame of the candle system flickers. The structural cause would be labeled dysfunctional. The candle’s steady state has been disturbed or changed. The concept affords the only relief to structural-functionalism’s inherent conservative bias. Dysfunction signifies the mechanism by which social change is evidenced within a social system.  Whether that change is manifest or latent is a relatively simple empirical question. Whether that change is good or bad would seem to require interpretative criteria not afforded by a social scientific paradigm for functional analysis.

'''Mesoamerican languages''' are the [[language]]s [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] to the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural area, which covers southern Mexico, all of [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]] and parts of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]] and [[Nicaragua]]. The area is characterized by extensive linguistic diversity containing several hundred different languages and seven major language families. Mesoamerica is also an area of high linguistic [[diffusion]] in that long-term interaction among speakers of different languages through several millennia has resulted in the convergence of certain linguistic traits across disparate language families. The Mesoamerican [[sprachbund]] is commonly referred to as the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]].

The languages of Mesoamerica were also among the first to evolve independent traditions of [[writing]]. The oldest texts date to approximately 1000 BCE while most texts in the indigenous scripts (such as [[Mayan languages|Maya]]) date to c. 600–900 CE. Following the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] in the 16th century, and continuing up until the 19th century, most Mesoamerican languages were written in [[Latin script]].

The languages of Mesoamerica belong to 6 major families – [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Mangue]], [[Mixe–Zoquean languages|Mixe–Zoque]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]], [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] and [[Chibchan languages]] (only on the southern border of the area) – as well as a few smaller families and isolates – [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]], [[Huave language|Huave]], [[Tequistlatecan languages|Tequistlatec]] and [[Misumalpan]]. Among these Oto-Manguean and Mayan families account for the largest numbers of speakers by far – each having speakers numbering more than a million. Many Mesoamerican languages today are either [[Language death|endangered or already extinct]], but others, including the [[Mayan languages]], [[Nahuatl]], [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec]] and [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], have several hundred thousand speakers and remain viable.

==Language vs. dialect==
The distinction between related [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s is notoriously vague in Mesoamerica. The dominant Mesoamerican socio-cultural pattern through millennia has been centered around the town or city as the highest level community rather than the nation, realm or people. This has meant that within Mesoamerica each city-state or town community, called in [[Nahuatl]] an [[altepetl]], has had its own language standard which, in the typical case, has evolved separately from closely related but geographically remote languages. Even geographically close communities with closely related, mutually intelligible languages have not necessarily seen themselves as being ethnically related, or their language as being a unifying factor between them. The relative [[endogamy]] of the town community has also resulted in a large linguistic diversification between communities despite geographical and linguistic proximity, often resulting in a low intelligibility between varieties of the same language spoken in adjacent communities. The exception to this rule is when a common “[[lingua franca]]” has evolved to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. This has been the case for [[Classical Nahuatl]] and [[Classical Maya]], both of which, at different times in history, have been used as a common language between different ethnic groups. Further complicating matters are the semi-[[nomad]]ic lifestyle of many Mesoamerican peoples, and political systems which often have used relocation of entire communities as a political tool. Dialect or variant [[Dialect continuum|“chaining”]] is common, where any adjacent two or three towns in a sequence are similar enough in speech to understand each other fairly well, but those separated more widely have trouble understanding each other, and there are no clear breaks naturally separating the continuum into coherent sub-regions.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez, 1983 pp. 13–20&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these factors together have made it exceedingly difficult to distinguish between what constitutes a language or a dialect in Mesoamerica. Linguistic [[isogloss]]es do not coincide often or strongly enough to prove very useful when trying to decide, and sociological factors often further cloud the picture. The significance of measurements of intelligibility (which is itself difficult to measure) depends very much on analysts' purposes and theoretical commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Suaréz 1983 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish the word “''dialecto''” has often been used generically about indigenous languages in order to describe them as inherently inferior to the European languages. In recent years this has caused an aversion to the term “dialect” among Spanish-speaking linguists and others, and the term “''variante''” has often been applied instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/capacitar/sociolx/lenguadialecto.htm#dialectopopular SIL international description of the use of the word "dialecto" in popular speech] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Mesoamerican linguistic groupings have not had different names in common usage for their different languages and some linguistic groups known by a single name show a sufficiently significant variation to warrant division into a number of languages which are quite low in mutual intelligibility. This is the case for example for the Mixtecan, Zapotecan and Nahuan linguistic groups, which all contain distinct languages that are nonetheless referred to by a single name. Sometimes a single name has even been used to describe completely unrelated linguistic groups, as is the case with the terms "[[Popoluca]]" or "[[Chichimeca]]". This shortage of language names has meant that the convention within Mesoamerican linguistics when writing about a specific linguistic variety is to always mention the name of the broad linguistic group as well as the name of the community, or geographic location in which it is spoken, for example [[Isthmus-Mecayapan Nahuatl]], [[Zoogocho Zapotec]] or [[Usila Chinantec]]. Some language groups however have been more adequately named. This is the case of the Mayan languages, with an internal diversity that is arguably comparable to that found between the [[Nahuatl dialects]], but many of whose linguistic varieties have separate names, such as [[K'iche' language|K'iche']], [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] or [[Wastek language|Huastec]].&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical overview==
{{main|Geography of Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Mesoamerica english.PNG|right|thumb|350px|Mesoamerica and its cultural areas]]
Mesoamerica can be divided into smaller linguistic subareas wherein linguistic diffusion has been especially intense, or where certain families have extended to become predominant. One such subarea would be the '''Maya area''' covering the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], all of Guatemala and Belize, and parts of the states of [[Chiapas]] and [[Tabasco]], where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. In Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages were initially dominant, but with the spread of Mayan languages they were pushed out on the fringes of the areas, or into isolated pockets, and the same was the case for speakers of [[Xinca language|Xinca]] and [[Lenca language|Lenca]] which were probably also spoken in the area in the preclassic period. Another linguistic area is '''[[Oaxaca]]''', which is dominated by speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]; here Mixe–Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of [[Zapotecan languages]], as well as by speakers of [[Huave language|Huave]] and [[Tequistlatecan]] languages. [[Oaxaca]] is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its {{convert|36820|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}} contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The subarea commonly called '''Central Mexico''', covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the [[Valley of Mexico]], originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The '''Western area''' was inhabited mostly by speakers of [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] and some [[Uto-Aztecan languages]] such as [[Huichol people|Huichol]] and Nahuatl. The '''Northern Rim''' area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the [[Piman languages|Tepiman]] and [[Cora language|Cora]]-[[Huichol language|Huichol]] groups) as well as [[Pame language|Pame]]an (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The '''Gulf area''' is traditionally the home of speakers of [[Totonacan languages]] in the northern and central area and Mixe–Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The '''Central American''' area was originally inhabited by speakers of [[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]], [[Jicaquean languages|Jicaquean]] and [[Chibchan languages]] which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. '''Guerrero''' does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.

==Linguistic prehistory==
The linguistic history of Mesoamerican languages can roughly be divided into [[pre-Columbian]], [[Colonialism|colonial]] and modern periods.

===Pre-Columbian period===
{{main|Mesoamerican chronology}}

The first human presence in Mesoamerica is documented around 8000 BCE, during a period referred to as the [[History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)|Paleo-Indian]]. Linguistic data, however, including language reconstruction derived from the [[Historical linguistics|comparative method]], do not reach further back than approximately 5000 years (towards the end of the Archaic period). Throughout the history of Mesoamerica, an unknown number of languages and language families became extinct and left behind no evidence of their existence. What is known about the pre-Columbian history of the Mesoamerican languages is what can be surmised from linguistic, [[archeological]] and [[Ethnohistory|ethnohistorical]] evidence. Often, hypotheses concerning the linguistic prehistory of Mesoamerica rely on very little evidence.

====Archaic period (–2000 BCE)====
Three large language families are thought to have had their most recent common homelands within Mesoamerica. The time frames and locations in which the common ancestors of these families, referred to by linguists as [[proto-language]]s, were spoken are reconstructed by methods of historical linguistics. The three earliest known families of Mesoamerica are the [[Mixe–Zoquean languages]], the [[Oto-Manguean languages]] and the [[Mayan languages]]. [[Proto-Oto-Manguean]] is thought to have been spoken in the [[Tehuacán Valley|Tehuacán]] valley between 5000 and 3000 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997:159)&lt;/ref&gt; although it may only have been one center of Oto-manguean culture, another possible Oto-Manguean homeland being Oaxaca. [[Proto-Mayan]] was spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of [[Guatemala]] around 3000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997), p. 165. The earliest proposal (Sapper 1912) which identified the Chiapas-Guatemalan highlands as the likely "cradle" of Mayan languages was published by the German antiquarian and scholar [[Karl Sapper]]; see attribution in Fernández de Miranda (1968), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proto-Mixe–Zoquean]] was spoken on the gulf coast and on the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast around 2000 BCE, in a much larger area than its current extension.&lt;ref&gt;Wichmann, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Totonacan languages]], Purépecha, Huave and the Tequistlatecan languages can also be assumed to have been present in Mesoamerica at this point although it is unknown.

====Preclassic period (2000 BCE – 200 CE)====
The first [[complex society]] in Mesoamerica was the [[Olmec|Olmec civilization]], which emerged around 2000 BCE during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Preclassic]]. It is documented that around this time many Mesoamerican languages adopted loanwords from the Mixe–Zoquean languages, particularly loanwords related to such culturally fundamental concepts as [[agriculture]] and [[religion]]. This has led some linguists to believe that the carriers of Olmec culture spoke a Mixe–Zoquean language and that words spread from their language into others because of their potential cultural dominance in the Preclassic period,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Kaufman (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; though the relationship between the Olmec and other Preclassic groups is still debated (see [[Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures]]). During this time the Oto-Manguean languages diversified and spread into [[Oaxaca]] and central Mexico. In the Valley of Oaxaca, the Oto-Manguean [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec culture]] emerges around c. 1000 BCE. The splitting of Proto-Mayan into the modern Mayan languages slowly began at roughly 2000 BCE when the speakers of Huastec moved north into the Mexican [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast region]]. [[Uto-Aztecan languages]] were still outside of Mesoamerica during the Preclassic, their speakers living as semi-[[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherers]] on the northern rim of the region and co-existing with speakers of [[Corachol]]an and [[Oto-Pamean languages]].

====Classic period (200–1000 CE)====
During the Classic period the linguistic situation simultaneously becomes both clearer and more obscure. While the Maya actually left examples of their writing, researchers have been unable to determine the linguistic affiliations of several important Classic civilizations, including [[Teotihuacan]], [[Xochicalco]], [[Cacaxtla]], and [[El Tajín]]. During this time it is well established that Mixtec languages were spoken at [[Tilantongo]] and Zapotec at [[Monte Albán]] (in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]]). The linguistic situation of the Maya area is relatively clear – Proto-Yucatec and Proto-Cholan were established in their respective locations in Yucatán and in the Tabasco area. Around 200 CE speakers of the Tzeltalan branch of Proto-Cholan moved south into Chiapas displacing speakers of Zoquean languages.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the southern part of the Maya area and the highlands the [[elite]] of the Classic Maya centers spoke a common prestige language based on Cholan, a variant often referred to as [[Classic Ch'olti'an]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Robertson, and Stuart (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

An important question that remains to be answered is what language or languages were spoken by the people and rulers of the empire of Teotihuacan. During the first part of the Classic period Teotihuacan achieved dominance over central Mexico and far into the Maya area. Possible candidates for the language of Teotihuacan have been Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque. [[Terrence Kaufman]] has argued that Nahuatl is an unlikely candidate because Proto-Nahuan did not enter Mesoamerica until around the time of the fall of Teotihuacan (c. 600 AD), and that Totonac or Mixe–Zoque are likely candidates because many Mesoamerican languages have borrowed from these two languages during the Classic period.&lt;ref name="albany.edu"&gt;Kaufman, Terrence, (2001) "Nawa Linguistic Prehistory", paper published at [http://www.albany.edu/anthro/maldp/papers.htm website of the Mesoamerican Language Documentation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Others find Mixe–Zoque an unlikely candidate because no current Mixe–Zoque settlements are found in central Mexico. Around 500–600 CE a new language family entered Mesoamerica when speakers of Proto-[[Nahuatl|Nahuan]], a southern [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]], moved south into central Mexico. Their arrival, which coincides with the decline of Teotihuacan and a period of general turmoil and mass migration in Mesoamerica, has led scientists to speculate that they might have been involved somehow in the fall of the Teotihuacan empire.&lt;ref name="albany.edu"/&gt;

What is known is that in the years following Teotihuacan’s fall Nahuan speakers quickly rose to power in central Mexico and expanded into areas earlier occupied by speakers of Oto-Manguean, Totonacan and Huastec. During this time Oto-Manguean groups of central Mexico such as the [[Chiapanec]], [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] and [[Subtiaba]] migrated south some of them reaching the southern limits of Mesoamerica in El Salvador and Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Terrence, (2001) "Nawa linguistic Prehistory", paper published at [http://www.albany.edu/anthro/maldp/papers.htm website of the Mesoamerican Language Documentation Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Also some speakers of Nahuan moved south, some settling on the coast of Oaxaca where their speech became the language [[Pochutec]], and others moving all the way to El Salvador, becoming the ancestors of the speakers of modern [[Pipil language|Pipil]].&lt;ref name="albany.edu"/&gt;

====Postclassic period (1000–1521 CE)====
In the Postclassic period Nahuan languages diversified and spread, carried by the culture commonly known as [[Toltec]]. In the early Postclassic period feuds between royal [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] in the Yucatán Peninsula caused the forefathers of the [[Itza]]' to move south into the Guatemalan jungle. In northwestern Oaxaca speakers of Mixtec and [[Chochotec|Chocho]]-[[Popolocan languages]] built successful [[city-state]]s, such as [[Teotitlan del Camino]], which did not fall under Nahuan subjugation. Speakers of Otomian languages ([[Otomi language|Otomi]], [[Mazahua language|Mazahua]] and [[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]]) were routinely displaced to the edges of the Nahuan states. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]] of Xaltocan, for example, were forcibly relocated to Otumba by the early Aztec empire.

As Nahuatl, carried by the Toltec and later the [[Aztec]] culture, became a lingua franca throughout Mesoamerica even some Mayan states such as the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj]] adopted Nahuatl as a prestige language. In Oaxaca Zapotec and Mixtec peoples expanded their territories displacing speakers of the [[Tequistlatecan]] languages slightly. During this time the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] (Tarascans) consolidated [[Tarascan state|their state]] based at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]]. They were resistant to other states of Mesoamerica and had little contact with the rest of Mesoamerica. Probably as a result of their isolationist policy the [[Purépecha language]] is the only language of Mesoamerica to not show any of the traits associated with the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In [[Guerrero]] the [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanecs]] of [[Yopitzinco]] speaking the Oto-Manguean [[Tlapanec language]] remained independent of the Aztec empire as did some of the Oaxacan cultures such as the Mixtecs of [[Tututepec]] and the Zapotec of [[Zaachila]]. In the late postclassic around 1400 CE Zapotecs of Zaachila moved into the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] creating a wedge of Zapotec speaking settlements between the former neighbors the [[Mixe]] and the [[Huave people|Huave]] who were pushed into their current territories on the edges of the Isthmus.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period (1521–1821)===
[[File:OlmosArtep32r.jpg|210px|right|thumb|Page from Olmos' "Arte de la Lengua Mexicana", a grammar of the Nahuatl language published in 1547 three years earlier than the first Grammar of French]]
The Spanish arrival in the new world turned the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica upside down. And from then on the indigenous languages have been subject to varying policies imposed on them by the colonial rule. The first impact came from the decimation of the indigenous population by diseases brought by the Europeans. Within the first two centuries of Spanish rule Mesoamerica experienced a dramatic population decline and it is well documented that several small linguistic groups became completely extinct already during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The policies that contributed most to a change in the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica were the policies used for conversion of Indians to Christianity. The first victim of this process was the native writing systems which were banned and prohibited and the existing texts destroyed – the pictorial scripts were see as an idolatry by the Catholic Church. At first missionaries favoured the teaching of Spanish to their prospect converts but from 1555 the first Mexican Council established the policy that the Indians should be converted in their own languages and that parish priests should know the indigenous language of their parishioners. This called for a massive education of clergymen in native languages and the church undertook this task with great zeal. Institutions of learning such as the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco]] which was inaugurated in 1536 and which taught both indigenous and classical European languages to both Indians and priests were opened. And missionary grammarians undertook the job of writing grammars for the indigenous languages in order to teach priests. For example, the first grammar of [[Nahuatl]], written by [[Andrés de Olmos]], was published in 1547 – three years before the first grammar of French. During this time some literacy in indigenous languages written in the Latin script began to appear. In 1570 [[Philip II of Spain]] decreed that Nahuatl should become the official language of the colonies of [[New Spain]] in order to facilitate communication between the Spanish and natives of the colonies. Throughout the colonial period grammars of indigenous languages were composed, but strangely the quality of these were highest in the initial period and declined towards the ends of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible and they began to focus on Nahuatl. During this period the linguistic situation of Mesoamerica was relatively stable. However, in 1696 [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] made a counter decree banning the use of any languages other than Spanish throughout the [[Spanish Empire]]. And in 1770 a decree with the avowed purpose of eliminating the indigenous languages was put forth by the Royal Cedula.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; This put an end to the teaching of and writing in indigenous languages and began a strict policy of hispanization of the Indians. However the fact that today around five million people in Mesoamerica still speak indigenous languages suggest that this policy wasn't as effective after all. The most important factor towards the decline of indigenous languages in this period has probably been the social marginalization of the native populations and their languages – and this process has been particularly effective during modern times.

===Modern period (1821–)===
In the modern period what has affected the indigenous languages most has been the pressure of social marginalization put on the indigenous populations by a growing mestizo class and a growing institutionalization of Hispanic society.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez 1983 pp. 167–68&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous languages have been seen by the governing classes as a hindrance to building homogeneous nation states and as an impediment to social progress. These viewpoints sparked a renewed interest in the hispanization of indigenous communities and while the introduction of compulsory education in Spanish has undoubtedly resulted in a more homogeneous society it has also done much for the decline of indigenous languages throughout the 20th century. In a number of indigenous communities it has become practice to learn Spanish first and the indigenous language second. Parents have refrained from teaching their children their own language in order not to subject them to the social stigma of speaking an Indian language – and youths have learned their languages only when they came of age and started taking part in the adult society.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the last 20 years there has been an overt change in the policies of governments of Mesoamerican countries towards the indigenous languages. There has been official recognition of their right to existence and some kind of governmental support, to the point of recognizing them as national languages. Bilingual (rather than monolingual Spanish) education has been recognized as desirable even if not always actually achieved in practice. In Guatemala the recognition of the indigenous languages as official languages and a valuable part of the country’s identity came after the [[Guatemalan Civil War|Civil War]] which ended in 1996. In Mexico shifting governments had talked about the value of the country’s indigenous heritage but it was not until 2003 that the ''[[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas]]'' established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;*Cuevas, Susana (2004): ''Ley de Derechos Lingüísticos en México''. En [http://www.linguapax.org/congres04/pdf/4_cuevas.pdf http://www.linguapax.org/congres04/pdf/4_cuevas.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205055217/http://www.linguapax.org/congres04/pdf/4_cuevas.pdf |date=2012-02-05 }}. Accessed in August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these official changes, old attitudes persist in many spheres, and indigenous languages are not in any practical sense on a par with Spanish. At present the linguistic situation of Mesoamerican languages is most difficult in the Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua where indigenous languages still do not enjoy the rights or privileges now granted them elsewhere, and are still subject to social stigmatization.

==Writing==
{{main|Mesoamerican writing systems}}
[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|300x300px|Detail showing glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]] dating from the 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]]]]
[[Mesoamerica]] is one of the relatively few places in the world where writing has developed independently throughout history. The Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]] combining the use of [[logograms]] with a [[syllabary]], and they are often called hieroglyphic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica but archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest and hence the forebear from which the others developed. Candidates for being the first writing system of the Americas are Zapotec writing, the [[Isthmian script|Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script]] or the scripts of the [[Izapa]]n culture. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and hence the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. Post-Classic cultures such as the [[Aztec]] and [[Mixtec]] cultures do not seem to have developed true writing systems, but instead used semasiographic writing although they did use phonetic principles in their writing by the use of the [[rebus]] principle. Aztec name glyphs for example do combine logographic elements with phonetic readings. From the colonial period on there exists an extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] written in the [[Latin script]].

==Literary traditions==
{{main|Mesoamerican literature}}

The literature and texts created by indigenous Mesoamericans are the earliest and well-known from the [[Americas]] for two primary reasons. First, the fact that native populations in Mesoamerica were the first to interact with Europeans assured the documentation and survival of literature samples in intelligible forms. Second, the long tradition of Mesoamerican writing contributed to them readily embracing the [[Latin script]] used by the Spanish and resulted in many literary works written in it during the first centuries after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]. Some important literary works in Mesoamerican languages are: The mythological narrative of the [[Popol Vuh]] and the theatrical dance-drama the [[Rabinal Achí]] both written in [[Classical K'iche' language|Classical K'iche' Maya]]. The ethnographical work in the [[Florentine Codex]] and the songs of the [[Cantares Mexicanos]] both written in [[Classical Nahuatl]]. The prophetical and historical accounts of the books of [[Chilam Balam]] written in the [[Yucatec Maya language]]. As well as numerous smaller documents written in other indigenous languages throughout the colonial period. No true literary tradition for Mesoamerican languages of the modern period has yet emerged.

==Mesoamerican Linguistic Area==
{{main|Mesoamerican Linguistic Area}}
Throughout the millennia in which speakers of different Mesoamerican languages were engaged in contact the languages began to change and show similarities with one another. This has resulted in Mesoamerica evolving into a linguistic area of diffusion, a "[[Sprachbund]]", where most languages, even though they have different origins share some important linguistic traits.&lt;ref name="Language 62 Vol. 3. 530-558"&gt;(Language 62 Vol. 3. 530–58)&lt;/ref&gt; The traits defining the Mesoamerican sprachbund are few but well established: the languages use [[relational noun]]s to express spatial and other relations, they have a [[vigesimal|base 20 (Vigesimal)]] numeral system, their syntax is never verb-final and as a consequence of this they don't use [[switch reference]], they use a distinct pattern for expressing nominal [[possession (linguistics)|possession]] and they share a number of semantic [[calques]]&lt;ref name="Language 62 Vol. 3. 530-558"/&gt;]. Some other traits are less defining for the area, but still prevalent such as: the presence of [[whistled language]]s, [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] of bodypart nouns into verbs, the derivation of [[locative]]s from bodypart nouns, grammatical indication of [[inalienable possession|inalienable or intimate possession]].&lt;ref name="Language 62 Vol. 3. 530-558"/&gt; Terrence Kaufman has worked with documenting the process of this linguistic convergence and he argues that the most probable donor languages of the borrowings into other Mesoamerican languages are the Mixe–Zoquean and Totonacan languages,&lt;ref name="albany.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Kaufman 1976&lt;/ref&gt; this supports a theory of either or both of these cultures having a prominent role as a dominating power in early Mesoamerican history.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Narcissistic personality disorder''' ('''NPD''') is a [[personality disorder]] with a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by [[grandiosity|exaggerated feelings of self-importance]], excessive need for [[admiration]], and a lack of [[empathy]].&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington [etc.]|isbn=9780890425558|pages=645, 669–72|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected often spend much time thinking about achieving [[Abusive power and control|power]] or success, or on their [[vanity|appearance]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; They often take advantage of the [[interpersonal relationships|people around them]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of social situations.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;&lt;!-- Quote = pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations --&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown.&lt;ref name="Sed2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_7-5dQIpBQC&amp;pg=PA29|title=Blueprints psychiatry|last1=Sederer|first1=Lloyd I.|date=2009|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9780781782531|edition=Fifth|location=Philadelphia|page=29|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111195341/https://books.google.com/books?id=7_7-5dQIpBQC&amp;pg=PA29|archivedate=11 January 2017|deadurl=no|via=Google Books|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a personality disorder classified within [[Cluster B personality disorders|cluster B]] by the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM).&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt; Diagnosis is made by a healthcare professional interviewing the person in question.&lt;ref name="Cal2015" /&gt; The condition needs to be differentiated from [[mania]] and [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, history, and epidemiology --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by persistent [[grandiosity]], excessive need for [[admiration]], and a personal disdain and lack of [[empathy]] for others.&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=5th |location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–72|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ronningstam2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2016|title=New Insights Into Narcissistic Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/new-insights-narcissistic-personality-disorder|journal=[[Psychiatric Times]]|volume=33|issue=2|page=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of superiority, and they seek to establish [[abusive power and control]] over others.&lt;ref name="pmid21430487"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2011|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Clinical Perspective|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Practice]]|volume=17|issue=2|pages=89–99|doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000396060.67150.40|pmid=21430487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder - Symptoms &amp; causes|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=November 18, 2017|accessdate=June 28, 2018|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego ([[self-concept]]), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

The [[DSM-5]] indicates that persons with NPD usually display some or all of the following symptoms, typically without the commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;

# Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from other people
# Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.
# Self-perception of being unique, superior, and associated with high-status people and institutions
# Needing continual admiration from others
# Sense of [[entitlement]] to special treatment and to obedience from others
# Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain
# Unwilling to empathize with the feelings, wishes, and needs of other people
# Intensely envious of others, and the belief that others are equally envious of them
# Pompous and arrogant demeanor

Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; It is not uncommon for children and adolescents to display traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and below the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they significantly impair the person's capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

===Associated features===
People with NPD tend to exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their level of intimacy with people they consider high-status. This sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; or to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation,&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be [[control freak|controlling]], blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others' views, unaware of others' needs and the effects of their behavior on others, and insist that others see them as they wish to be seen.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate, insult, and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Identifying and understanding the narcissistic personality|first=Elsa F|last=Ronningstam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of [[shame]], humiliation, and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt; They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; The merging of the "inflated self-concept" and the "actual self" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of [[denial]], [[idealization and devaluation]].&lt;ref name="pmid16937998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Siegel|first=Judith P.|date=|year=2006|title=Dyadic splitting in partner relational disorders|url=|journal=[[Journal of Family Psychology]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=418–22|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.3.418|pmid=16937998|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DSM-5: "Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder."&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; Due to the high-functionality associated with narcissism, some people may not view it as an impairment in their lives.&lt;ref name="ronningstam" /&gt; Although overconfidence tends to make individuals with NPD ambitious, it does not necessarily lead to success and high achievement professionally. These individuals may be unwilling to compete or may refuse to take any risks in order to avoid appearing like a failure.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; In addition, their inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements, or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional relationships with superiors and colleagues.&lt;ref name="gol2"&gt;{{citation|last=Golomb|first=Elan|title=Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self|volume=|page=22|pages=|year=1992|location=New York|publisher=Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown.&lt;ref name=mayo1/&gt;&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; Experts tend to apply a [[biopsychosocial model]] of causation,&lt;ref name="Paris"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paris|first=Joel|date=|year=2014|title=Modernity and narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=220–226|doi=10.1037/a0028580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a combination of environmental, social, genetic and neurobiological factors are likely to play a role in formulating a narcissistic personality.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

=== Genetic ===
There is evidence that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals are much more likely to develop NPD if they have a family history of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;&lt;ref name= Torgersen/&gt; Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high [[heritability]] for narcissistic personality disorder.&lt;ref name="Torgersen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torgersen|first1=Svenn|last2=Lygren|first2=Sissel|last3=Øien|first3=Per Anders|last4=Skre|first4=Ingunn|last5=Onstad|first5=Sidsel|last6=Edvardsen|first6=Jack|last7=Tambs|first7=Kristian|last8=Kringlen|first8=Einar|date=December 2000|title=A twin study of personality disorders.|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|volume=41|issue=6|pages=416–25|doi=10.1053/comp.2000.16560|pmid=11086146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichborn-Kjennerud|first1=Ted|date=1 March 2010|title=The genetic epidemiology of personality disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181941/pdf/DialoguesClinNeurosci-12-103.pdf|journal=[[Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=103–14|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181941|pmid=20373672|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the specific [[genes]] and [[Epistasis|gene interactions]] that contribute to its cause—and how they may influence the developmental and physiological processes underlying this condition—have yet to be determined.

Environmental and social factors are also thought to have a significant influence on the onset of NPD.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired [[Attachment theory|attachment]] to their primary caregivers, usually their parents.&lt;ref name="Magid"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Magid|title=High risk children without a conscience|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/High_Risk.html?id=88C74pQcIm4C|accessdate=17 November 2012|year=1987|publisher=Bantam|isbn=0-553-05290-X|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in the child's perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted.&lt;ref name="Johns"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen M. Johnson|title=Humanizing the narcissistic style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxV2QgAACAAJ|accessdate=29 October 2013|date=1 May 1987|publisher=W.W.

According to Leonard Groopman and Arnold Cooper, the following have been identified by various researchers as possible factors that promote the development of NPD:&lt;ref name="AMN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder|author1=Groopman|first=Leonard C.|author2=Cooper|first2=Arnold M.|date=|year=2006|work=Personality Disorders – Narcissistic Personality Disorder|publisher=Armenian Medical Network|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515054225/http://www.health.am/psy/narcissistic-personality-disorder/|archivedate=15 May 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An oversensitive [[temperament]] (personality traits) at birth.
* Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback.
* Excessive [[praise]] for good behaviors or excessive [[criticism]] for bad behaviors in childhood.
* Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents, other family members, or peers.
* Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or abilities by adults.
* Severe [[emotional abuse]] in childhood.
* Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents.
* Learning [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] behaviors from parents or peers.
* Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own [[self-esteem]].

Cultural elements are believed to influence the prevalence of NPD as well since NPD traits have been found to be more common in modern societies than in traditional ones.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
There is little research into the neurological underpinnings of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of [[gray matter]] in the left anterior [[Insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name="Schulze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulze|first=Lars|last2=Dziobek|first2=Isabel|last3=Vater|first3=Aline|last4=Heekeren|first4=Hauke R.|last5=Bajbouj|first5=Malek|last6=Renneberg|first6=Babette|last7=Heuser|first7=Isabella|last8=Roepke|first8=Stefan|date=|year=2013|title=Gray matter abnormalities in patients with narcissistic personality disorder|url=|journal=[[Journal of Psychiatric Research]]|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1363–69|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2013.05.017|pmid=23777939|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychCentral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|title=Narcissists’ Lack of Empathy Tied to Less Gray Matter|last=Pedersen|first=Traci|date=6 October 2015|website=|publisher=[[PsychCentral]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424210941/http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/07/06/narcissists-lack-of-empathy-tied-to-less-gray-matter/56907.html|archivedate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=2014-04-24|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nenadic|first1=Igor|last2=Güllmar|first2=Daniel|last3=Dietzek|first3=Maren|last4=Langbein|first4=Kerstin|last5=Steinke|first5=Johanna|last6=Gader|first6=Christian|date=February 2015|title=Brain structure in narcissistic personality disorder: A VBM and DTI pilot study|url=|journal=[[Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging]]|publisher=Elsevier Ireland|volume=231|issue=2|pages=184–86|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2014.11.001|pmid=25492857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain regions identified in the above studies are associated with [[empathy]], [[compassion]], [[emotional regulation]], and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ronningstam|first1=Elsa|date=19 January 2016|title=Pathological Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Recent Research and Clinical Implications|url=http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports|volume=3|issue=1|pages=34–42|doi=10.1007/s40473-016-0060-y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817021647/http://bostonneuropsa.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBNsR-NPD-ER-in-Print-01-20-2016-2-1.pdf|archive-date=17 August 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===DSM-5===
The formulation of narcissistic personality disorder in the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s (APA) [[DSM-IV-TR|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', 4th Edition, Text Revision]] (DSM-IV-TR) was criticised for failing to describe the range and complexity of the disorder. Critics said it focuses overly on "the narcissistic individual's external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns—at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering", which they argued reduced its clinical utility.&lt;ref name="ronningstam"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ronningstam|first=Elsa|date=|year=2010|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A Current Review|url=|journal=[[Current Psychiatry Reports]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=68–75|doi=10.1007/s11920-009-0084-z|pmid=20425313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group originally proposed the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in [[DSM-5]] as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DSM-5: Proposed Revisions: Personality and Personality Disorders|date=2010-02-13|publisher=''[[American Psychiatric Association]]''|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203170307/http://www.dsm5.org/PROPOSEDREVISIONS/Pages/PersonalityandPersonalityDisorders.aspx|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20223959"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holden|first=Constance|date=|title=Psychiatry.

Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shedler|first=Jonathan|last2=Beck|first2=Aaron|last3=Fonagy|first3=Peter|last4=Gabbard|first4=Glen O.|last5=Gunderson|first5=John|author-link5=John G.

===ICD-10===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) [[ICD-10|''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'', 10th Edition]] (ICD-10) lists narcissistic personality disorder under ''Other specific personality disorders''. It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of [[Personality disorder#General diagnostic criteria 2|general personality disorder criteria]].

===Subtypes===
While the DSM-5 regards narcissistic personality disorder as a homogeneous syndrome, there is evidence for variations in its expression.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; In a 2015 paper, two major presentations of narcissism are typically suggested, an "overt" or "grandiose" subtype, characterized by grandiosity, arrogance, and boldness, and a "covert" or "vulnerable" subtype characterized by defensiveness and hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt; Those with "narcissistic grandiosity" express behavior "through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pincus|first=Aaron L.|last2=Emily B.|first2=Ansell|last3=Pimentel|first3=Claudia A.|last4=Cain|first4=Nicole M.|last5=Wright|first5=Aidan G. C.|last6=Levy|first6=Kenneth N.|date=|year=2009|title=Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory|url=|journal=[[Psychological Assessment (journal)|Psychological Assessment]]|volume=21|issue=3|pages=365–79|doi=10.1037/a0016530|pmid=19719348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] described the subtype, which he referred to as the "oblivious" subtype as being grandiose, arrogant, and thick-skinned. The subtype of "narcissistic vulnerability" entails (on a conscious level) "helplessness, emptiness, low self-esteem, and shame, which can be expressed in the behavior as being socially avoidant in situations where their self-presentation is not possible so they withdraw, or the approval they need/expect is not being met."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Gabbard described this subtype, which he referred to as the "[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]" subtype as being easily hurt, oversensitive, and ashamed. In addition, a "high-functioning" presentation, where there is less impairment in the areas of life where those with a more severe expression of the disorder typically have difficulties in, is suggested.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

[[Theodore Millon]] suggested five subtypes of narcissism.&lt;ref name="millon"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Theodore |last= Millon |year=1996 |title=Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |page=393 |isbn= 0-471-01186-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=millon9&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |title=Millon, Theodore, Personality Subtypes |publisher=Millon.net |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055645/http://millon.net/taxonomy/summary.htm |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are few pure variants of any subtype,&lt;ref name=millon9/&gt; and the subtypes are not recognized in the DSM or ICD.

Will Titshaw also suggested three subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder which are not officially recognized in any editions of the DSM or the ICD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Subtype
!Description
!Description
|-
| '''Pure Narcissist'''
| Mainly just NPD characteristics.
| Someone who has narcissistic features described in the DSM and ICD and lacks features from other personality disorders.
|-
| '''Attention Narcissist'''
| Including histrionic (HPD) features.
| They display the traditional NPD characteristics described in the ICD &amp; DSM along with histrionic features due to the fact that they think they are superior and therefore they should have everyone's attention, and when they do not have everyone's attention they go out of their way to capture the attention of as many people as possible.
|-
| '''Beyond The Rules Narcissist'''
| Including antisocial (ASPD) features.
| This type of narcissist thinks that because they are so superior to everyone they do not have to follow the rules like most people and therefore show behavior included in the ICD for dissocial personality disorder and behavior, included in the DSM for antisocial personality disorder.
|}

===Comorbidity===
NPD has a high rate of [[comorbidity]] with other mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; Individuals with NPD are prone to bouts of depression, often meeting criteria for co-occurring [[depressive disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{citation|last=Berger|first=FK|date=31 Oct 2014|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|title=Medical Encyclopedia: Narcissistic personality disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, NPD is associated with [[bipolar disorder]], [[anorexia]], and [[substance use disorders]],&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; especially [[cocaine use disorder|cocaine]].&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt; As far as other personality disorders, NPD may be associated with [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], and [[paranoid personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=dsm5/&gt;

==Treatment==
Narcissistic personality disorder is rarely the primary reason for people seeking mental health treatment. When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[substance use disorder]]s, [[bipolar disorder]], or [[eating disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt; or at the insistence of relatives and friends.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor [[Insight#Psychiatry|insight]] and [[Egosyntonic and egodystonic|fail to recognize]] their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive [[self-image]].&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

Treatment for NPD is centered around [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name=mayo2&gt;{{cite web |title=Narcissistic personality diorder - Diagnosis and treatment |author=Mayo Clinic Staff |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366690 |website=www.mayoclinic.org |accessdate=28 June 2018 |language=en |date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Heinz Kohut]] and [[Otto Kernberg]] challenged the conventional wisdom of the time by outlining clinical strategies for using psychoanalytic psychotherapy with clients with NPD that they claimed were effective in treating the disorder. Contemporary treatment modalities commonly involve [[transference|transference-focused]], [[metacognitive]], and [[schema therapy|schema-focused]] therapies. Some improvement might be observed through the treatment of symptoms related to comorbid disorders with psychopharmaceuticals, but {{asof|2016|lc=y}}, according to Elsa Ronningstam, psychologist at [[Harvard Medical School]], "Alliance building and engaging the patient's sense of agency and reflective ability are essential for change in pathological narcissism."&lt;ref name=ronningstam2016/&gt;

Pattern change strategies performed over a long period of time are used to increase the ability of those with NPD to become more empathic in everyday relationships. To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema, the strategy is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others for reasons other than their own personal gain. This is not so much to change their self-perception of their "entitlement" feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change.&lt;ref name=sperry&gt;{{citation|last=Sperry|first=Lynn|year=1999|title=Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Cognitive Behavior Therapy of DSM-IV Personality Disorders: Highly Effective Interventions for the Most Common Personality Disorders|pages=131–38|location=Ann Arbor, MI|publisher=Edwards Brothers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Anger, rage, impulsivity, and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Therapy may not be effective because patients may receive feedback poorly and defensively. [[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] and [[Somatoform Disorders|somatoform disorders]] are prevalent, but the most common would be depression.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Group psychotherapy|Group treatment]] has its benefits, as the effectiveness of receiving peer feedback rather than the clinician's may be more accepted, but group therapy can also contradict itself as the patient may show "demandingness, [[egocentrism]], social isolation and withdrawal, and socially deviant behavior". Researchers originally thought group therapy among patients with NPD would fail because it was believed that group therapy required empathy that NPD patients lack. However, studies show group therapy does hold value for patients with NPD because it lets them explore boundaries, develop trust, increase self-awareness, and accept feedback. Relationship therapy stresses the importance of learning and applying four basic interpersonal skills: "...effective expression, empathy, discussion and problem solving/conflict resolution".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} [[Relationship counseling|Marital/relationship therapy]] is most beneficial when both partners participate.&lt;ref name=sperry/&gt;

No [[Psychiatric medication|medications]] are indicated for treating NPD, but may be used to treat co-occurring mental conditions or symptoms that may be associated with it such as depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness if present.&lt;ref name=mayo2/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The effectiveness of [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] interventions in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder has yet to be systematically and empirically investigated. Clinical practice guidelines for the disorder have not yet been created, and current treatment recommendations are largely based on theoretical [[psychodynamic]] models of NPD and the experiences of clinicians with afflicted individuals in clinical settings.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

The presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates.&lt;ref name=Cal2015/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Lifetime prevalence of NPD is estimated at 1% in the general population and 2% to 16% in clinical populations.&lt;ref name="bd2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|title=Megalomaniacs abound in politics/medicine/finance|last=|first=|date=January 7, 2011|work=Business Day Live|accessdate=17 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924072524/http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/01/07/megalomiacs-abound-in-politicsmedicinefinance|archivedate=24 September 2016|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AMN/&gt; A 2010 [[systematic review]] found the prevalence of NPD to be between 0% to 6% in community samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=Nikhil|last2=Kunik|first2=Mark E.|last3=Oldham|first3=John|last4=Coverdale|first4=John|date=|title=Prevalence and treatment of narcissistic personality disorder in the community: a systematic review|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=July–August 2010|volume=51|issue=4|pages=333–39|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2009.09.003|pmid=20579503|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small gender difference, with men having a slightly higher incidence than in women.&lt;ref name=Grijalva/&gt;

According to a 2015 meta-analysis that looked at gender differences in NPD, there has recently been a debate about a perceived increase in the prevalence of NPD among younger generations and among women. However, the authors found that this was not reflected in the data and that the prevalence has remained relatively stable for both genders over the last 30 years (when data on the disorder were first collected).&lt;ref name="Grijalva"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grijalva|first=Emily|last2=Newman|first2=Daniel A.|last3=Tay|first3=Louis|last4=Donnellan|first4=M.

==History==
The [[history of narcissism|use of the term "narcissism"]] to describe excessive vanity and self-centeredness predates by many years the modern medical classification of narcissistic personality disorder. The condition was named after [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], a [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] youth who became infatuated with his own reflection in a lake. He did not realize at first that it was his own reflection, but when he did, he died out of grief for having fallen in love with someone that did not exist outside himself.

The term "narcissistic personality structure" was introduced by [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Kernberg, Otto, Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and "narcissistic personality disorder" first proposed by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut H The Psychoanalytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personality Disorders: Outline of a Systematic Approach, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Freudianism===
[[Sigmund Freud]] commented, regarding the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, "this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly concluded: "we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of [[Paranoia|paranoic]] disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edmund Bergler]] also considered megalomania to be normal in the child,&lt;ref&gt;Bergler, Edmund, "The Psychology of Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) pp. 176, 182&lt;/ref&gt; and for it to be reactivated in later life in [[gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Lindner, "The Psychodynamics of Gambling", in Halliday/Fuller eds., p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]] states that, for those who react in later life to narcissistic [[Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|hurt]] with [[denial]], a similar [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] to the megalomania of childhood is taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, Otto, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object relations===
Whereas Freud saw megalomania as an obstacle to [[psychoanalysis]], in the second half of the 20th century, [[object relations theory]], both in the United States and among British [[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]], set about revaluing megalomania as a [[defence mechanisms|defence mechanism]] that offered potential access for therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach built on [[Heinz Kohut]]'s view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal development, by contrast with [[Otto Kernberg|Kernberg]]'s consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological development distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Judith M., ''From Obstacle to Ally'' (2004) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
In popular culture, narcissistic personality disorder has been called megalomania.&lt;ref name=bd2011/&gt;&lt;ref name="Par2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|title=War Is Not Inevitable: On the Psychology of War and Aggression|last1=Parens|first1=Henri|date=2014|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739195291|location=|page=63|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908145308/https://books.google.com/books?id=8AsWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|archivedate=8 September 2017|deadurl=no|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on the Victorian Web argues that Rosamond Vincy, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871–72), is a full-blown narcissist as defined by the DSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/eliot/winnington.html|title=The Narcissism of Rosamond Vincy|last=Winnington|first=G.

In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman]]'s character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted: "[she] was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|last2=Schliewe|first2=Sanna|last3=Thomsen|first3=Rasmus R.|date=|year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|deadurl=no|journal=[[BMC Psychiatry]]|location=London|publisher=BioMed Central|volume=5|page=45|pages=|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|pmc=1325244|pmid=16336663|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219154746/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|archivedate=19 February 2015|via=}}

==Criticism==
A Norwegian study concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs rather than as a distinct diagnostic category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karterud|first=Sigmund|last2=Øien|first2=Maria|last3=Pedersen|first3=Geir|date=|title=Validity aspects of the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition'', narcissistic personality disorder construct|url=|journal=[[Comprehensive Psychiatry]]|publication-date=September–October 2011|volume=52|issue=5|pages=517–26|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.11.001|pmid=21193181|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alarcón and Sarabia, in examining past literature on the disorder, concluded that narcissistic personality disorder "shows [[nosological]] inconsistency and that its consideration as a trait domain with needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alarcón|first=Renato D.|last2=Sarabia|first2=Silvana|date=|title=Debates on the Narcissism Conundrum: Trait, Domain, Dimension, Type, or Disorder?|url=|journal=[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]|publication-date=January 2012|volume=200|issue=1|pages=16–25|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e31823e6795|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ngambay''' (also known as '''Sara''', '''Sara Ngambai''', '''Gamba''', '''Gambaye''', '''Gamblai''' and '''Ngambai''') is one of the major languages spoken by [[Sara people]] in southwestern [[Chad]], northeastern [[Cameroon]] and eastern [[Nigeria]], with about a million native speakers. Ngambay is the most widely spoken of the [[Sara languages]], and is used as a trade language between speakers of other dialects.

'''Pervomaisk''' ({{lang-uk|Первома́йск}}, {{lang|uk-Latn|Pervomajs'k}}) is a city in [[Mykolaiv Oblast]], [[Ukraine]] and the administrative center of the [[Pervomaisk Raion]]. Administratively, the city is incorporated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and does not belong to the raion. It is located on the [[Southern Bug]] river which bisects the city. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2015|66,733}} In 2001, population was 70,170.

==Etymology==
The name derives from the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''pervomaj'' (первомай) meaning "the first of May," ([[May Day]]), referring also to the city's formation on 1 May 1919 from the merger of three neighbouring places.

The name for one of the merged towns, Bohopil (or Bogopol),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/ukraine/pervomaysk-bogopol.html]&lt;/ref&gt; was derived from the name of a local river [[Southern Bug]] which in [[Polish language|Polish]] is named Boh.

==History==
The city was formed when three neighbouring settlements: the village of '''Holta''' (Голта) and the town of '''Bohopil''' (Богопіль) around a county city of '''Olviopol''' (Ольвіополь) were merged. The merger was adopted by the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee on June 6, 1919. These cities existed from 1773 and the first settlement in the area was mentioned as early as 1676.

In the 17th century Holta was part of [[Zaporizhian Sich]], Bohopil was the customs point of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Olviopol was part of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="UW19713Pervomaisk"&gt;[http://ukrainianweek.com/Society/85012 No Holds Barred], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (19 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In [[World War II]], Pervomaisk was occupied by the [[Axis Powers]] in 1941 and was divided between [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|German occupation authorities]] on the east bank (Bohopol and Olviopol) and the Romanian-occupied [[Transnistria (World War II)|region of Transnistria]] to the west (Holta).  Holta served as the center of the Golta ''[[judeţ]]'' (district) of Transnistria.  Pervomaisk had been more than 1/3 [[Jews|Jewish]] before the war but most were murdered during the occupation.

==Remarkable buildings and structures==
In Pervomaisk, there is at 48°4'0"N 30°51'29"E a 196 metres tall guyed TV mast, equipped with 6 crossbars running from the mast body to the guys.

Pervomaisk was the former location of the [[46th Rocket Division]] of the [[43rd Rocket Army]] of the Soviet [[Strategic Rocket Forces]], formed during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holm, [http://www.ww2.dk/new/rvsn/46md.htm 46th Missile Division]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the commanders of the division, appointed in 1991, was General Major Mikhail Filatov.&lt;ref&gt;Woff, Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, B39-16&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RT-23_Molodets|RT-23UTTKh]] [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] silos based at Pervomaisk were destroyed, partially with [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] programme funding, during the 1990s.

'''Pha̍k-fa-sṳ''' ({{zh|t=白話字}}) is an [[orthography]] similar to [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] and used to write [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], a Chinese language. It was invented by the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church in the 19th century. The Hakka New Testament published in 1924 is written in this system.

==Writing system==
Pha̍k-fa-sṳ uses a modified [[Latin alphabet]] (an additional [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] ṳ for the [[close central unrounded vowel]] /{{IPA|ɨ}}/) and some diacritics for tones. A single hyphen is added to indicate a compound.

==History==
Shortly after the missionaries of the [[Basel Missionary Society]], Reverend [[Theodore Hamberg]] and [[Rudolf Lechler]] arrived in [[China]] in 1847, Hamberg and his colleagues began compiling the Hakka to [[English language|English]] to Hakka to [[German language|German]] dictionaries. Lechler was initially allocated the evangelizing work amongst the [[Shantou]] population, but because of opposition from the local authorities there, the Shantou mission was abandoned and he joined Hamberg in the mission work with the Hakka in 1852. After Hamberg died unexpectedly in 1854, Lechler continued with the dictionary work together with fellow missionary colleagues for over fifty years. During that time, Reverend [[Charles Piton]] also made several revisions to the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcrc.org.tw/big5/?p=13 An Insight into the Composition of the Hakka-English Dictionary]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} (《客英大辭典》海陸成份初探) {{zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication of Romanized Hakka in Pha̍k-fa-sṳ was done by [[Donald MacIver]] (紀多納, 1852-1910) in 1905 at Shantou and was titled ''A Chinese-English dictionary : Hakka-dialect, as spoken in Kwang-tung province''. He noted that some of the content was based on the dictionaries compiled by the previous Basel missionaries. However, the latter had used the Lepsius romanization, which was different from Pha̍k-fa-sṳ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924023344587 A Hakka index to the Chinese-English dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; MacIver made the changes to the dictionary, but he realised that Hakka vocabulary written by the Basel missionaries belonged to the Hakka dialects of southwestern [[Guangdong Province]]: [[Haifeng County]], [[Lufeng County]], [[Jiexi County]] and [[Wuhua County]]. On the other hand, MacIver's Hakka vocabulary was extracted from the northeastern part of Guangdong Province such as Jiaying Prefecture (now [[Meizhou]]).

[[Image:Dead tree river.jpg|right|thumb|Terrestrial and aquatic phototrophs: plants grow on a fallen log floating in algae-rich water]]

'''Phototrophs''' (''[[Ancient Greek language|Gr]]'': φῶς, φωτός&lt;!-- Phos is an odd kszettle of fish, see Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek Lexicon --&gt; = light, τροϕή = nourishment) are the [[organism]]s that carry out photon capture to acquire energy.  They use the [[energy]] from [[light]] to carry out various cellular metabolic processes.  It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily [[photosynthetic]].  Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they [[Anabolism|anabolically]] convert [[carbon dioxide]] into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later [[Catabolism|catabolic]] processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats).  All phototrophs either use [[electron transport chain]]s or direct [[proton pump]]ing to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by [[ATP synthase]], to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. 
Phototrophs can be either [[autotroph]]s or [[heterotroph]]s. As their electron and hydrogen donors are inorganic compounds [Na2S2O3 (PSB) and H2S (GSB)] they can be also called as lithotrophs, and so, some photoautotrophs are also called photolithoautotrophs. Examples of phototroph organisms:  ''[[Rhodobacter capsulatus]]'', ''[[Chromatium]]'', ''[[Chlorobium]]'' etc.

==History==
Originally used with a different meaning, the term took its current definition after [[André Lwoff|Lwoff]] and collaborators (1946).&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, С. K. 1917. ''Illustriertes Handwörterbuch der Botanik.'' 2. Aufl., herausgeg. von K. Linsbauer. Leipzig: Engelmann, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/32951#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoautotroph==
Most of the well-recognized phototrophs are [[autotrophic]], also known as '''photoautotrophs''', and can [[carbon fixation|fix carbon]]. They can be contrasted with [[chemotroph]]s that obtain their energy by the [[oxidation]] of [[electron donor]]s in their environments. Photoautotrophs are capable of synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances using light as an energy source. Green plants and photosynthetic bacteria are photoautotrophs. Photoautotrophic organisms are sometimes referred to as '''holophytic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Facts on File dictionary of biology | last=Hine | first=Robert | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2005 | page=175 | isbn=978-0-8160-5648-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such organisms derive their energy for food synthesis from light and are capable of using carbon dioxide as their principal source of carbon.

Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms use [[chlorophyll]] for light-energy capture and oxidize water, [[Oxygen-evolving complex|"splitting"]] it into molecular oxygen.  In contrast, anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria have a substance called [[bacteriochlorophyll]] - which absorbs predominantly at non-optical wavelengths - for light-energy capture, live in aquatic environments, and will, using light, oxidize chemical substances such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] rather than water.

===Ecology===
In an [[ecology|ecological]] context, phototrophs are often the food source for neighboring heterotrophic life. In terrestrial environments, [[plant]]s are the predominant variety, while aquatic environments include a range of phototrophic organisms such as [[algae]] (e.g., [[kelp]]), other [[protist]]s (such as [[euglena]]), [[phytoplankton]], and [[bacteria]] (such as [[cyanobacteria]]). The depth to which sunlight or artificial light can penetrate into water, so that photosynthesis may occur, is known as the [[photic zone]].

Cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotic organisms which carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, occupy many environmental conditions, including fresh water, seas, [[soil]], and [[lichen]]. Cyanobacteria carry out plant-like photosynthesis because the [[chloroplast|organelle]] in plants that carries out photosynthesis is derived from an &lt;ref&gt;Hill, Malcolm S. “Production Possibility Frontiers in Phototroph:heterotroph Symbioses: Trade-Offs in Allocating Fixed Carbon Pools and the Challenges These Alternatives Present for Understanding the Acquisition of Intracellular Habitats.” ''Frontiers in Microbiology'' 5 (2014): 357. ''PMC''. Web. 11 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; endosymbiotic cyanobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;3. Johnson, Lewis, Morgan, Raff, Roberts, and Walter. "Energy Conversion: Mitochondria and Chloroplast." ''Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition''  By Alberts. 6th ed. New York: Garland Science, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2015. 774+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This bacterium can use water as a source of [[Electron transport chain|electrons]] in order to perform CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  [[Redox|reduction]] reactions. Evolutionarily, cyanobacteria's ability to survive in [[Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic]] conditions, which are considered toxic to most [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria, might have given the bacteria an adaptive advantage which could have allowed the cyanobacteria to populate more efficiently.

A ''photolithoautotroph'' is an [[autotrophic]] organism that uses light energy, and an [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[electron donor]] (e.g., H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] as its [[carbon]] source. Examples include plants.

==Photoheterotroph==
{{Main|Photoheterotroph}}

In contrast to photoautotrophs, '''photoheterotrophs''' are organisms that depend solely on light for their energy and principally on organic compounds for their carbon. Photoheterotrophs produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[photophosphorylation]] but use environmentally obtained [[organic compound]]s to build structures and other bio-molecules.&lt;ref name="campbell564"&gt;{{Cite book|

Poster stamps were revived in 2017 by The Portland Stamp Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sincerely Yours |magazine=O, the Oprah Magazine |location=New York |publisher="Hearst Communications" |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
The unofficial nature of poster stamps has led to debate about exactly what is and is not a poster stamp. One definition has been "labels without postage stamp values, not good for postal service; advertising labels or charity labels." &lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Douglas &amp; Mary. ''The Hodder Stamp Dictionary''. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1973, p.191. {{ISBN|0-340-17183-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1864 Shakespeare Poster Stamp.jpg|thumb|right|The 1864 ''Shakespeare Penny Memorial'' poster stamp.]]

== Origins ==
The first poster stamps were inspired by the invention of the [[postage stamp]]. A perforated label was produced in England in 1864 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and in Italy a label was produced in 1860 to celebrate Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily during the campaign to unify Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Mackay|Mackay, James]]. ''The Complete Guide to Stamps and Stamp Collecting''. London: Hermes House, 2005, p.62. {{ISBN|1-84477-726-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial interests soon realised the publicity potential of the stamps and they were quickly adopted for the promotion of every type of product and cause. Poster stamps were also widely used by both sides during World War One as political [[propaganda]]. Fascism in Italy ( 1922-1943), used poster stamps, and sometimes regular stamps, to increase the popularity of italian mass flights: Crociera Aviatoria del Mediterraneo Orientale 1929; Crociera Aerea Italia-Brasile 1930; Crociera Aerea del Decennale 1933.

== Scope ==
As late as the 1930s they were still being used to promote political and other causes. In 1937 [[Irene Harand]] published a series of anti-Nazi poster stamps portraying the contributions made by Jews to civilisation over the centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Peter. "Irene Harand and ''The Truth About Anti-Semitism.''" in ''The Cinderella Philatelist''. Vol.48, No.3, July 2008, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; and adhesive labels of all kinds that are not postage stamps continue to be produced today to promote particular causes or events.

== Revival ==
In 2017, two designers of [[Plazm (magazine)]] launched The Portland Stamp Company to revive the poster stamp tradition using vintage perforation equipment. Their revival stamps were featured in the monthly subscription service Mail More Love, pictured in Oprah magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sincerely Yours |magazine=O, the Oprah Magazine |location=New York |publisher="Hearst Communications" |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21144">'''Problematic integration theory''' is a [[Outline of communication|theory of communication]] that addresses the processes and dynamics of how people receive, evaluate, and respond to information and experiences. The premises of PI are based on the view that message processing, specifically the development of probabilistic and evaluative orientations (our perceptions of something's likelihood of occurring and its value, respectively), is a social and cultural construction. In situations where there is agreement between probabilistic orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's likelihood, i.e., how likely something is to occur) and evaluative orientation (a person's constructed belief about an object's value), integration is in harmony, i.e., not problematic. However, when there is disagreement between these orientations about an object (i.e., an event, thing, person, idea, outcome, etc.), then integration becomes problematic. This disharmony leads to conflict and discomfort, which can manifest itself as cognitive, communicative, affective, and/or motivational.

== History ==
Austin Babrow&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014234303/http://coms.ohiou.edu/austin-babrow Austin Babrow, Ph.D.], Ohio University (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced the theory of Problematic Integration (PI) in 1992.  Babrow brought together a diverse and interdisciplinary literature (from the field of communication and related disciplines, like psychology, sociology, and philosophy) to serve as building blocks for his new theory.  Among the theoretical underpinnings that support PI are:  [[uncertainty reduction theory]]; the theory of belief in a just world; analysis of decision-making; the theory of and motivation and self-esteem; and [[cognitive dissonance]]. However, despite integrating elements from these theories, PI has striking differences (e.g., unlike URT, PI does not assume that uncertainty is an undesirable situation, nor does it suggest that resolution of uncertainty is always necessary or desirable).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 456-476.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

Problematic Integration is a type of message-processing communication theory that relates to theories of decision making and persuasion.  Problematic Integration Theory (PI) proposes that: (1) people orient themselves to the world by forming both probabilistic and evaluative orientations; (2) that probability and evaluation are not independent from one another; (3) that probability and evaluation are socially based and socially constructed, and that probability and evaluation are integral to our daily experience; and, (4) that integration of these orientations can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;  Probabilistic orientation is an assessment of the likelihood of an event or outcome.  Evaluative orientation is an assessment of the favorability of an outcome. Often, assessments of probability and value are cooperative and easily integrated. However, as the theory's title implies, there are occasions when integration becomes problematic. PI proposes that integration becomes more difficult as:
# clarity of object probability decreases
# object value conflicts increase
# or, there is an increase in the divergence between object expectation and desire&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, problematic integration is what we experience when our probabilistic and evaluative orientations conflict with one another, causing instability and disharmony.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conflict arising from problematic integration may or may not be significant.  The more important a value and the more central an issue (or object, to use PI terminology) is to one's beliefs or cultural values, the more likely that problematic integration will cause greater discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of problematic integration theory===

Babrow identified four distinct manifestations, or forms, of problematic integration:
# Divergence
# Ambiguity
# Ambivalence
# Impossibility

The first of these integrative predicaments, divergence, arises when there is a discrepancy between what we believe to be true or to be likely to occur and what we want to be true (the desired outcome). Ambiguity arises when the probability or value of an object (i.e., situation, outcome, thing, etc.) is unclear or highly uncertain. Babrow explained, that “in ambiguous situations, neither the outcome, nor the probability of the outcome is known, though the latter has restrictions” (Babrow, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;112).  Uncertainty occurs when an unknown factor obscures or complicates the development of one's orientation (probability and evaluation) toward an outcome.   Ambiguity has also been described as uncertainty about what is unknown.  Ambivalence is borne from one of two conditions: (1) an individual is forced to choose between two similarly valued alternatives; or (2) an individual is forced to choose between mutually exclusive alternatives. The last form of PI, impossibility, occurs upon the realization or belief that an outcome is will not happen. Impossibility is recognized as different from a form of divergence, because only impossibility denotes a sense of certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, Communication Monographs, 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 285-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Responses to impossibility can range from a sense of futility, to one of increased motivation to deny the impossibility. All of these situations give rise to conflict.

===The role of communication in problematic integration theory===

Communication is both a source of, a medium, and a method for resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;  Communication is a source of problematic integration in that knowledge and evaluative orientations are the result of communication, probabilistic and evaluative orientations are based on and developed through message and [[meaning-making]] (forms of communication), and communication is itself "an object of thought" and is therefore  an object "of probabilistic and evaluative orientations."&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that a person experiencing problematic integration will seek new information or new sources of information to bolster or reinforce a desired probabilistic or evaluative orientation.  This could also be seen engaging in as a form of [[cognitive dissonance]].  Communication is seen as a medium of problematic integration because communication inherently involves or is based on probabilistic and evaluative orientations, or communication is about probability and value.  Communication is influenced by and formed from culture; thus, communication is a medium of PI, as and the formation of probabilistic and evaluative orientations derives from cultural frameworks.  Lastly, communication is a resource for PI as we try to resolve and manage conflict caused by problematic integration through communication (internal, interpersonal, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because communication may be a source, medium, and/or method for resolving problematic integration, it is possible for conflict to manifest as "extended chains" of problematic integration.  Such extended chains occur through forms, foci, and layers of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 461-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  By extended chains, it is meant that experiences of problematic integration and efforts to resolve problematic integration may lead to development of a new form of PI.  As conflict between probability and value develops around a focal point (or topic), it can lead to conflict regarding a new topic (e.g., stress and anxiety about earning an end-of-year bonus at work can lead to new worries about personal finances, sense of self-worth, and/or one's status and career prospects at work).  Problematic integration becomes shared (or chained) through layers of experience when people discuss and relate their struggles with others.  In this process of communicating our conflicts, others may share in our problematic integration through empathy and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Communication and Problematic Integration: Milan Kundera’s “Lost Letters” in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”, ''Communication Monographs'', 1995, Vol. 62, pp. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  Babrow proposed that communication becomes more important to resolve problematic integration as the conflict or integration becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique and analysis===

As mentioned above, Problematic Integration Theory is a type of communication theory that examines how we make meaning of information and experiences, and how we handle uncertainty.  PI differs from [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] and other axiomatic and predictive communication theories in a number of ways.  PI proposes that there are numerous and varied meanings of the term uncertainty.  Unlike URT, PI predicts that experiencing uncertainty does not automatically lead to a desire to reduce the uncertainty.  Further, PI proposes that: (1) uncertainty is not always "bad; (2) uncertainty has a single or narrow meaning; (3) reduction of uncertainty is not always possible; (4) any resolution of uncertainty is not necessarily final; and, (5) integrative dilemmas do not necessarily have an identifiable or singular cause.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 562-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration Theory (PI) falls under the socio-psychological and socio-cultural communication traditions. PI began with a focus on intra- and inter-personal contexts, but has been applicable in many contexts, including interpersonal, small group, and organizational; thus, it has a broad scope of application.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, Journal of Communication, September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI is considered an interpretive/hermeneutic approach of theory rather than positivistic/empirical (i.e., predictive) or critical.&lt;ref&gt;Babrow, Austin S.; “Uncertainty, Value, Communication, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related work: uncertainty management theory===

Babrow's theory shares some common ideas with Uncertainty Management Theory (UMT), which was developed by Dale Brashers (2007, A theory of communication and uncertainty management. In B. Whaley &amp; W. Samter (Eds.), Explaining communication theory (pp.&amp;nbsp;201–218). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum). For a comparison of the perspectives, see Bradac (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 463-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

The complexity of PI and the multiplicity of its manifestations makes it difficult to operationalize, measure, and apply.  However, this breadth of scope also indicates that it may have extremely wide-ranging applications and opportunities for research.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the concepts within PI are based on cultural definitions, PI is seen as being overly responsive to external conceptual influences; thus, making it potentially falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, James J.; “Theory Comparison: Uncertainty Reduction, Problematic Integration, Uncertainty Management, and Other Curious Constructs”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

PI has been used within the realm of [[Health Communication]] studies in order to assess methods of educating, and communicating with, patients facing a variety chronic or life-threatening conditions. In 2003, Babrow received the prestigious Woolbert Award for scholarship of exceptional originality and influence from the National Communication Association [http://www.natcom.org/nca/Template2.asp?sid=9] for his work with PI.

PI has been used extensively in analysis of the health care system, particularly in regard to communication between health care providers and patients.  The health-care system inherently involves communication between health-care providers (e.g., doctors, nurses, various therapists, dietitians, social workers, counselors, etc.), patients, and members of the patient's social and support network (e.g., family members, friends, members of support groups, etc.).  Because understanding and communicating diagnoses, prognoses, treatment plans, expectations, and more can be complicated and because this communication relies on the communication skills of the various people involved, health-care situations offer ample opportunity to examine problematic integration.  Research in this area has revealed that information is used to decrease and increase uncertainty, depending on the situation.  In some cases, patients may seek information to reduce stressful uncertainty.  However, in other cases, the care team and the patient may need to increase uncertainty in order to increase optimism and allow for re-evaluation of a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Brashers, Dale E., Daena J. Goldsmith, and Elaine Hsieh; “Information Seeking and Avoiding in Health Contexts”, ''Human Communication Research'', 2002, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  PI has been used to study communication involving various medical issues, including breast cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Michael Robert, Adrianne Kunkel, and Joann Keyton; “Problematic Integration Theory, Appraisal Theory, and the Bosom Buddies Breast Cancer Support Group”, Journal of Applied Communication Research, Ed. 36, pp. 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Leigh A., Austin S. Babrow, and Cynthia Stohl; “Social Support Messages and the Management of Uncertainty in the Experience of Breast Cancer: An Application of Problematic Integration Theory”, Communication Monographs, 1996, Vol. 63, pp. 189-207.&lt;/ref&gt; the treatment of diabetes in the elderly, end-of-life issues, and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi and Austin S. Babrow; “Problematic Integration of Uncertainty and Desire in Pregnancy”, Qualitative Health Research, 2007, Vol. 17, pp. 786-798.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias, Marianne Sassi; “Problematic Integration in Pregnancy and Childbirth: Contrasting Approaches to Uncertainty and Desire in Obstetric and Midwifery Care”, Health Communication, 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Problematic Integration has also been used to evaluate [[organizational communication]].  Organizations, comprising networks and hierarchies of individuals, by their very nature, create complex webs of various dynamic social and cultural relationships.  Moreover, most organizations do not exist for themselves, but for an external audience, client, or consumer; thereby, increasing the nature, types, and numbers of relationships.  Communication within these relationships will very likely give rise to instances of uncertainty.  In the context of such complex systems of communication, PI takes on a much different appearance than intrapersonal situations.  An organization's structure, system design, and strategy can create, maintain, or help reduce problematic integration.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 578-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of this study has been problematic integration arising from [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|internal bureaucracy or organizational rules or objectives]] and how this conflict involves matters of formal rationality (a quantitative calculation of an action or choice) or substantive rationality (a value judgment of consequences of an action or choice).&lt;ref&gt;McPhee, Robert D. and Pamela Zaug, “Organizational Theory, Organizational Communication, Organizational Knowledge, and Problematic Integration”, ''Journal of Communication'', September 2001, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 575-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In examining marketing strategies for tourism, PI has been used to suggest methods for decreasing uncertainty for potential customers and thereby increasing transactions from the on-line shoppers for the related retail businesses ("converting lookers to bookers").&lt;ref&gt;Han, Jee-Hee and Juline E. Mills, “The Use of Problematic Integration Theory to Assess Destination On-Line Promotion Activities: The Case of Australia.com in the United States Market”, ''Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing'', 2006, Vol. 20 (3/4), pp. 93-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, PI lends itself to application to a broad scope of issues.  A few other examples of areas of interest to which PI has been applied include:

* Family and relationships
* [[Narrative communication]]
* [[Mass media]] and [[media Studies]] (e.g., news reporting)
* Marketing and advertising

'''Proclamation № 1081''' was the document which contained [[Ordinance Power of the President of the Philippines#Proclamations|formal proclamation]] of [[martial law in the Philippines]] by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], as announced to the public on 23 September 1972.&lt;ref name="KaiFrancisco20160922"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146939-martial-law-explainer-victims-stories |title=Martial Law, the dark chapter in Philippine history |last=Francisco |first=Katerina |date=2016-09-22 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923155126/https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146939-martial-law-explainer-victims-stories |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=No |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteFall"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/featured/the-fall-of-the-dictatorship/ |title=The Fall of the Dictatorship |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903153904/http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/featured/the-fall-of-the-dictatorship/ |archive-date=2017-09-03 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proclamation marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one man rule which would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986.&lt;ref name="KaiFrancisco20160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteFall"/&gt; Even though the formal document proclaiming Martial Law - Proclamation No. 1081 - was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution in February 1986.&lt;ref name="KaiFrancisco20160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AbTan19810118"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/01/18/marcos-ends-martial-law-keeps-tight-grip/89533b86-8100-4713-9e77-6e4ebab6bacb/ |title=Marcos Ends Martial Law, Keeps Tight Grip |last=Tan |first=Ab |date=1981-01-18 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-09-09 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santos&amp;Pinlac20070901"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/ethics/back-to-the-past-a-timeline-of-press-freedom/|title=Back to the Past: A timeline of press freedom|last=|first=|date=Sep 1, 2007|website=[[CMFR]]|access-date=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==
Numerous explanations have been put forward as reasons for Marcos to declare Martial Law in September 1972, some of which were presented by the Marcos administration as official justifications, and some of which were dissenting perspectives put forward by either the mainstream political opposition or by analysts studying the political economy of the decision.&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dictatorship &amp; martial law : Philippine authoritarianism in 1972 |last=Brillantes |first=Alex B., Jr. |date=1987 |publisher=[[University of the Philippines Diliman]] [[UP_National_College_of_Public_Administration_and_Governance|School of Public Administration]] |isbn=9718567011 |location=Quezon City, Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official justifications ===
In his 1987 treatise, "''Dictatorship &amp; Martial Law: Philippine Authoritarianism in 1972''," [[University of the Philippines]] Public Administration Professor Alex Brillantes Jr. identifies three reasons expressed by the Marcos administration, saying that Martial Law&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"/&gt;:

#. was a response to various leftist and rightist plots against the Marcos administration;
#. was just the consequence of political decay after American-style democracy failed to take root in Philippine society; and
#. was a reflection of Filipino society's history of authoritarianism and supposed need for iron-fisted leadership.

The first two justifications were explicitly stated in Proclamation 1081, which cited two explicit justifications: "to save the republic" (from various plots); and "to reform society" (after the failure of American-style democracy).&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"/&gt;  The third rationalization arose from the administration's propaganda, which portrayed Ferdinand Marcos as a hypermasculine figure able to compel the obedience of supposedly "spoiled" filipinos.&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"/&gt;

====Incidents cited====
{{Unbalanced|section|date=September 2018}}
Based on interviews of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' with former officials of the Communist Party of the Philippines, it was revealed that "the (Communist) party leadership planned – and three operatives carried out – the ([[Plaza Miranda bombing|Plaza Miranda]]) attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution... (Communist Party) Chairman Sison had become convinced by early 1971 – less than three years after the party was founded – that it would take only a well-timed incident to spark a great upheaval leading to an early Communist victory. Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the former party officials said. Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had already agreed to provide." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EX-COMMUNISTS PARTY BEHIND MANILA BOMBING|url=http://washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/08/04/ex-communists-party-behind-manila-bombing/b987c165-4f26-4609-aeb5-cd05134c0cec/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissenting Perspectives ===
==== Dissenting Perspectives  from the Political mainstream ====
Opposition to Marcos' declaration of Martial Law ran the whole gamut of Philippine society - ranging from impoverished peasants whom the administration tried to chase out of their homes; to the Philippines' political old-guard, whom Marcos had tried to displace from power; to academics and economists who disagreed with the specifics of Marcos' Martial Law policies.  All of these, regardless of their social position or policy beliefs, subscribed to the interpretation that Marcos Declared Martial Law&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"/&gt;:

#. as a strategy to enable Ferdinand Marcos to stay in power past the two Presidential terms allowed him under Philippine Constitution of 1935
#. as a technique for covering up the ill-gotten wealth of Marcos, his family, and his cronies.

==== Dissenting Economic interpretations ====
In addition, some critics who ascribe an economic component to Marcos' motivations,&lt;ref name="Brillantes1987"/&gt; suggesting that Martial Law:

#. was an acquiescence to the global market system, which required tight control of sociopolitical systems so that the country's resources could be exploited efficiently;
#. was a product of the infighting among the families that formed the upper socioeconomic class of Philippine society; and
#. was a connivance between the state powers and the upperclass families to keep the members of the country's lower classes from becoming too powerful.

== Preparation of the document ==
While some historians believe Marcos' logistical and political preparations for proclaiming Martial Law began as early as 1965, when he took up the Defense Secretary portfolio for himself in an effort to curry the loyalty of the armed forces heirarchy, &lt;ref name="KasaysayanChapter9"&gt;Kasaysayan : the story of the Filipino people, Volume 9. (1998) Alex Magno, ed. Pleasantville, New York: Asia Publishing Company Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; the preparation for the actual document which became Proclamation 1081 began in December 1969, in the wake of [[Ferdinand Marcos presidential campaign, 1969|Marcos' very expensive 1969 presidential reelection bid]].  Marcos approached at least two different factions within his cabinet to study how the implementation of Martial Law should be structured in the proclamation.&lt;ref name="KasaysayanChapter9"/&gt;

Preparations for the proclamation

=== Melchor and Almonte study ===
Some time in December 1969, Marcos asked Executive Secretary Alejandro Melchor and Melchor's Aide-de-Camp at the time, Major Jose Almonte, to study the different ways Martial Law had been implemented throughout the world, and the repercussions tht might come from declaring it in the Philippines.  The study submitted by Melchor and Almonte said that ''“while Martial Law may accelerate development, in the end the Philippines would become a political archipelago, with debilitating, factionalized politics.''"&lt;ref name="EndlessJourney"/&gt;

In Almonte, who would eventually become head of the head of the [[National Intelligence Coordinating Agency]] under President Corazon Aquino and later National Security Advisor to President Fidel Ramos, recalled in a 2015 memoir that he felt “''the nation would be destroyed because, apart from the divisiveness it would cause, Martial Law would offer Marcos absolute power which would corrupt absolutely.''"&lt;ref name="EndlessJourney"/&gt;

=== Enrile study and draft of proclamation documents ===
Marcos, who kept up a strategy of keeping cabinet members from becoming to powerful by giving different factions different facts and redundant orders, also gave a similar task to Justice Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile that December - this time with a specific query about the powers the 1935 Constittution would grant the President would be acquire upon the declaration of Martial Law.  According to Enrile's 2012 memoir, Marcos emphasized that “''the study must be done discreetly and confidentially.''”&lt;ref name="EnrileMemoir"&gt;Juan Ponce Enrile (2012) Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir. Quezon City:ABS-CBN Publishing Inc.p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; With help from Efren Plana and Minerva Gonzaga Reyes, Enrile submitted the only copy of his confidential report to Marcos in January 1970.&lt;ref name="EnrileMemoir"/&gt;

A week after Enrile submitted his study, Marcos asked him to prepare the needed documents for implementing Martial Law in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="EnrileMemoir"/&gt;

== Signing of Proclamation No. 1081 ==
Several conflicting accounts exist regarding the exact date on which Marcos signed the physical Proclamation No. 1081 document.&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteFall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteDeclaration"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph:80/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ |title=Declaration of Martial Law |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708065018/http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/featured/declaration-of-martial-law/ |archive-date=2017-07-08 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differing accounts suggest that Marcos signed the document as early as September 17,1972, or as late as September 22, 1972.&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteDeclaration"/&gt;  

Whichever the case, the document was formally dated 21 September because of his superstitions and [[numerology|numerological]] beliefs concerning the number seven.&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteDeclaration"/&gt;  The Official Gazette of the republic of the Philippines, in a restrospective article on Marcos' proclamation of Martial Law, comments on the differences in the accounts: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Whether they conflict or not, all accounts indicate that Marcos’ obsession with numerology (particularly the number seven) necessitated that Proclamation No. 1081 be officially signed on a date that was divisible by seven. Thus, September 21, 1972 became the official date that Martial Law was established and the day that the Marcos dictatorship began. This also allowed Marcos to control history on his own terms.&lt;ref name="OfficialGazetteDeclaration"/&gt;"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Announcement of Martial Law==
By the morning of September 23, 1972, Martial Law forces had successfully implemented a media lockdown, with only outlets associated with Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto allowed to operate.  In the afternoon, Benedicto-owned television channel KBS-9 went back on air playing episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]] cartoon series, which was interrupted at 3:00 PM, when Press Secretary [[Francisco Tatad]] went on air to read Proclamation No. 1081, through which Marcos declared Martial Law.&lt;ref name="BooChanco"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2017/04/03/1683772/blame-messenger |title=Blame the messenger |last=Chanco |first=Boo |date=2017-04-03 |work=The [[Philippine Star]] |access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferdinand Marcos himself went on air at 7:15 that evening to formalize the announcement. On the following Morning, September 24, the headline of Benedicto's Daily Express announced "FM Declares Martial Law" - the only newspaper to come out in the immediate aftermath of Martial Law.&lt;ref name="KaiFrancisco20160922"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146939-martial-law-explainer-victims-stories |title=Martial Law, the dark chapter in Philippine history |last=Francisco |first=Katerina |date=2016-09-22 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923155126/https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/146939-martial-law-explainer-victims-stories |archive-date=2016-09-23 |dead-url=No |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation of Martial Law ==
Martial law was ratified by 90.77% of the voters during the controversial [[Philippine Martial Law referendum, 1973]].&lt;ref name="philippinesReadr"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philippines Reader: A history of Colonialism, Neocolonialism, Dictatorship and Resistance|last1=Schirmer|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Shalom|first2=Stephen Roskamm|date=1987|publisher=[[South End Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=Philippine+Martial+Law+referendum,+1973&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9890PojfBM&amp;sig=nKdTu_narLPcudAED5BNPm3RTlA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB5s7vzZnPAhVV8WMKHfxaAtoQ6AEISjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Philippine%20Martial%20Law%20referendum%2C%201973&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalEconomyOfAuthoritarianism"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|last=Celoza|first=Albert F.|date=1997|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp3U1oCNKlgC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Philippine+Martial+Law+referendum,+1973&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wOZZCnHzSf&amp;sig=zJqROi7w8LBpy4CGFXMmr5W-w-s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB5s7vzZnPAhVV8WMKHfxaAtoQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Philippine%20Martial%20Law%20referendum%2C%201973&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|Philippine constitutional plebiscite]], the [[Constitution of the Philippines#The 1935 Constitution|1935 Constitution]] was replaced with a [[Constitution of the Philippines#The 1973 Constitution|new one]] that changed the system of government from a presidential to a parliamentary one, with Marcos remaining in power as both [[head of state]] (with the title "President") and [[head of government]] (titled "[[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]]").{{cn|date=September 2017}} Under the new government, President Marcos formed his political coalition–the ''[[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]]'' (KBL; [[English in the Philippines|English]]: New Society Movement)–control the [[unicameral]] legislature he created, known as the ''[[Batasang Pambansa]]''.

In an effort to isolate the local communist movement, President Marcos went to China in 1975 to normalize diplomatic relations. In return for recognizing the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China, and that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] pledged to stop supporting the Philippine communist rebels.&lt;ref&gt;http://pascn.pids.gov.ph/files/Discussions%20Papers/1999/pascndp9916.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The government subsequently captured NPA leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] in 1976 and [[Jose Maria Sison]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Washington Post]] in an interview with former Philippine Communist Party Officials, revealed that, "they (local communist party officials) wound up languishing in China for 10 years as unwilling "guests" of the (Chinese) government, feuding bitterly among themselves and with the party leadership in the Philippines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EX-COMMUNISTS PARTY BEHIND MANILA BOMBING|url=http://washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/08/04/ex-communists-party-behind-manila-bombing/b987c165-4f26-4609-aeb5-cd05134c0cec/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal lifting ==
President Marcos formally lifted Martial Law on 17 January 1981, several weeks before the [[List of pastoral visits of Pope John Paul II outside Italy#1980s|first pastoral visit]] of [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] to the Philippines for the beatification of [[Lorenzo Ruiz]]. After the lifting of Martial Law, the CPP-NPA was able to return to urban areas and form relationships with legal opposition organizations, and became increasingly successful attacks against the government throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149&lt;/ref&gt;.

==General orders ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;General Order № 1 - The President proclaimed that he shall direct the entire government, including all its agencies and instrumentalities, and exercise all powers of his office including his role as the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;General Order № 2 – The President directed the [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Minister of National Defense]] to arrest or cause the arrest and take into his custody the individuals named in the attached list and to hold them until otherwise so ordered by the President or by his duly designated representative, as well as to arrest or cause the arrest and take into his custody and to hold them otherwise ordered released by him or by his duly authorized representative such persons who may have committed crimes described in the Order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The President further ordered that the Judiciary should continue to function in accordance with its present organization and personnel, and should try to decide in accordance with existing laws all criminal and civil cases, except certain cases enumerated in the Order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early life==

Samuel Delany{{efn|Delany's name is one of the most misspelled in science fiction, with over 60 different spellings in reviews. Bravard and Peplow (1984), pp. 69–75. His publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] even misspelled his name on the title page of his book ''Driftglass'', as did the organizers of [[Balticon]] in 1982 where Delany was guest of honor.}} was born on April 1, 1942, and raised in [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]]. His mother, Margaret Carey Boyd Delany (1916–1995), was a clerk in the [[New York Public Library]] system. His father, Samuel Ray Delany Sr. (1906–1960), ran the Levy &amp; Delany Funeral Home on 7th Avenue in Harlem, from 1938 until his death in 1960. The civil rights pioneers [[Sadie and Bessie Delany]] were his aunts. He used their adventures as the basis for Elsie and Corry in "Atlantis: Model 1924", the opening novella in his semi-autobiographical collection ''[[Atlantis: Three Tales]]''. His grandfather, [[Henry Beard Delany]], was the first black Bishop of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].

The family lived in the top two floors of a three-story private house between five- and six-story Harlem apartment buildings. Delany envied children with nicknames and took one for himself on the first day of summer camp, at about the age of 12, by answering "They mostly call me Chip" when asked his name.&lt;ref name=pohl/&gt; Decades later, [[Frederik Pohl]] called him "a person who is never addressed by his friends as Sam, Samuel or any other variant of the name his parents gave him."&lt;ref name=pohl&gt;{{cite web |author=Pohl, Frederik |title=Chip Delany |url=http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/11/chip-delany/ |work=The Way The Future Blogs |accessdate= November 20, 2010 |date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany attended the [[Dalton School]] and, for two months out of each summer for five years, from 1951 through 1956, attended Camp Woodland in Phoenicia, New York,&lt;ref&gt;Delany, The Motion of Light in Water, University of Minnesota Press, Minnesota, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Bronx High School of Science]], during which he was selected to attend [[Camp Rising Sun (New York)|Camp Rising Sun]], the Louis August Jonas Foundation's international summer scholarship program.

Delany and poet [[Marilyn Hacker]] met on their first day together in high school in September 1956, and were married five years later in August 1961, due to her pregnancy (which later miscarried). Their marriage (which alternatively encompassed periods of cohabitation and separation, experiments in [[polyamory]], and extramarital affairs with men and women conducted by both parties) endured for 14 years; in 1974, they had a daughter, Iva Hacker-Delany, who spent a decade working in theater in New York City and graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn Hacker|See Marilyn Hacker's entry.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=The New Ensemble Theatre Co.

[[File:Delany encyc.png|thumb|left|237px|At a reading at [[The Kitchen]] in June 2011]]

Delany has identified as gay since adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;Delany, Samuel R. "Coming/Out". In ''Shorter Views'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; though his complicated marriage with Hacker (who was aware of Delany's orientation and has identified as a lesbian since their divorce) has led some authors to classify him as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Emmanuel Sampath. ''Contemporary African American Novelists: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook''; Westport, Connecticut: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 1999; pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Delany's father from lung cancer in October, 1960 and his marriage in August 1961, he and Hacker settled in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood at 629 East 5th Street. Hacker's intervention (while employed as an assistant editor at [[Ace Books]]), helped Delany become a published science fiction author by the age of 20, though he actually finished writing that first novel (''[[The Jewels of Aptor]]'') while at 19, shortly after dropping out of the [[City College of New York]] after one semester.

== Career ==
He published nine well-regarded science fiction novels between 1962 and 1968, as well as two prize-winning short stories (collected in ''[[Driftglass]]'' [1971] and later in ''[[Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories]]'' [2002]). In 1966, with Hacker remaining in New York, Delany took an extended trip to Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Delany&amp;nbsp;– ''The Motion of Light in Water''.&lt;/ref&gt; writing ''[[The Einstein Intersection]]'' while in France, England, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.{{r|budrys196710}} These locales found their way into several pieces of his work at that time, including the novel ''[[Nova (novel)|Nova]]'' and the short stories "[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]" and "Dog in a Fisherman's Net".

After returning, Delany played and lived communally for six months on the [[Lower East Side]] with the Heavenly Breakfast, a [[folk-rock]] band, one of whose members, Bert Lee, was later a founding member of the [[Central Park Sheiks]]; a memoir of his experiences with the band and communal life was eventually published as ''[[Heavenly Breakfast]]'' (1979). Delany published his first eight novels with [[Ace Books]] from 1962 to 1967, culminating in ''Babel-17'' and ''The Einstein Intersection'', which were consecutively recognized as the year's best novel by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (Nebula Awards).&lt;ref name="isfdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFAwards" /&gt;  Calling him a genius and poet, [[Algis Budrys]] listed Delany with [[J. G. Ballard]], [[Brian W. Aldiss]], and [[Roger Zelazny]] as "an earthshaking new kind" of writer, and leaders of the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]].&lt;ref name="budrys196710"&gt;{{Cite magazine

Delany's first short story was published by Pohl in the February 1967 issue of ''[[Worlds of Tomorrow]]'', and he placed three more in other magazines that year.&lt;ref name="isfdb" /&gt; After four short stories (including the critically lauded "[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]") and ''Nova'' were published to wide acclaim (the latter by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], marking Delany's departure from Ace) in 1968 alone, an extended interregnum in publication commenced until the release of ''[[Dhalgren]]'' (1975), abated only by two short stories, two comic book scripts, and an erotic novel, ''[[The Tides of Lust]]'' (1973), reissued in 1994 under Delany's preferred title, ''Equinox''.

On New Year's Eve in 1968, Delany and Hacker moved to [[San Francisco]], and again to [[London]] in the interim, before Delany returned to New York in the summer of 1971 as a resident of the Albert Hotel in [[Greenwich Village]]; from December 1972 to December 1974, Delany and Hacker lived in [[Marylebone]], London. In 1972, Delany was a visiting writer at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for the Humanities. During this period, he began working with sexual themes in earnest and wrote two pornographic works, one of which (''[[Hogg (novel)|Hogg]]'') was unpublishable due to its transgressive content. Twenty years later, it found print.

Delany wrote two issues of the comic book ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/25423/ ''Wonder Woman'' #202 (September–October 1972)] and [http://www.comics.org/issue/25615/ ''Wonder Woman'' #203 (November–December 1972)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; during a controversial period in the publication's history when the lead character abandoned her superpowers and became a secret agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Delany, Samuel R. |title= Dhalgren |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375706684&amp;view=auqa |accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delany scripted issues #202 and #203 of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Wonder Woman, series 1, issues #199-#264, March 1972 – February 1980 |url=http://www.wonderland-site.com/html/comix/comics01-04.htm |work=www.wonderland-site.com |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delany was initially supposed to write a six-issue story arc that would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic, but the story arc was canceled after [[Gloria Steinem]] complained that Wonder Woman was no longer wearing her traditional costume, a change predating Delany's involvement. Scholar Ann Matsuuchi concluded that Steinem's feedback was "conveniently used as an excuse" by DC management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Matsuuchi |author-first=Ann |url=http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/colloquy/download/colloquy_issue_twenty-four_/matsuuchi.pdf |title=Wonder Woman Wears Pants: ''Wonder Woman'', Feminism and the 1972 'Women's Lib' Issue |journal=COLLOQUY |issue=24 |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany's eleventh and most popular novel, the million-plus-selling ''Dhalgren'', was published in [[1975 in literature|1975]] to both literary acclaim (from both inside and outside the science fiction community) and derision (mostly from within the community). Upon its publication, Delany returned to the United States at the behest of [[Leslie Fiedler]] to teach at the [[University at Buffalo]] as Butler Professor of English in the spring of 1975, preceding his return to New York City that summer. Though he wrote two more major science fiction novels (''[[Triton (novel)|Triton]]'' and ''[[Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand]]'') in the decade following ''Dhalgren'', Delany began to work in fantasy and science fiction criticism for several years. His main literary project through the late 1970s and 1980s was the [[Return to Nevèrÿon (series)|Return to Nevèrÿon series]], the overall title of the four volumes and also the title of the fourth and final book. Following the publication of the Return to Nevèrÿon series, Delany published one more fantasy novel. Released in 1993, ''[[They Fly at Çiron]]'' is a re-written and expanded version of an unpublished short story Delany wrote in 1962. This would be Delany's last novel in either the science fiction or fantasy genres for many years.

Delany became a professor in 1988. Following visiting fellowships at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] (1977), the [[University at Albany]] (1978) and [[Cornell University]] (1987), he spent 11 years as a professor of comparative literature at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], a year and a half as an English professor at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], then moved to the English Department of [[Temple University]] in 2001, where he taught until his retirement in 2015. He served as ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' Visiting Professor at the [[University of Chicago]] during the winter quarter of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/CritInq/posts/623226611043201 Samuel Delany will teach a seminar... – Critical Inquiry]. Facebook. Retrieved May 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with ''The Jewel-Hinged Jaw'' (1977), a collection of critical essays that applied then-nascent [[literary theory]] to science fiction studies, he published several books of criticism, interviews and essays. In the memoir ''[[Times Square Red, Times Square Blue]]'' (1999), Delany drew on personal experience to examine the relationship between the effort to redevelop [[Times Square]] and the public sex lives of working-class men in New York City.

He received the [[Bill Whitehead Award]] for Lifetime Achievement from [[Publishing Triangle]] in 1993.

In 2007, his novel ''Dark Reflections'' was a winner of the [[Stonewall Book Award]]. That same year Delany was the subject of a documentary film, ''The Polymath, or, The Life and Opinions of Samuel R. Delany, Gentleman'', directed by [[Fred Barney Taylor]]. The film debuted on April 25 at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. The following year, 2008, it tied for Jury Award for Best Documentary at the International Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. Also in 2007, Delany was the April "calendar boy" in the "Legends of the Village" calendar put out by Village Care of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=A legendary night for Village Care |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_186/alegendarynightfor.html |date=November 22–28, 2006 |work=www.thevillager.com |accessdate= March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Delany was one of the five judges (along with [[Andrei Codrescu]], [[Sabina Murray]], [[Joanna Scott]] and [[Carolyn See]]) for the [[National Book Awards]] fiction category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2010.html |date= November 17, 2010 |title=2010 National Book Awards web page |work=www.nationalbook.org |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722143226/http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2010.html#.WbbszsaQw-U |archivedate=July 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Caribbean Philosophical Association]] named Delany the recipient of its Nicolás Guillén Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="cpa-nga"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nicholas Guillen Award |url=http://www.caribbeanphilosophicalassociation.org/nichol-s-guill-n-award.html |website=www.caribbeanphilosophicalassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Delany entered a committed, nonexclusive relationship with Dennis Rickett, previously a homeless book vendor; their courtship is chronicled in the graphic memoir ''[[Bread and Wine: An Erotic Tale of New York]]'' (1999), a collaboration with the writer and artist Mia Wolff. After sixteen years, he retired from teaching at Temple University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=College of Liberal Arts – Archive | url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/event-type/creative-writing/|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany is an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Though I'm an atheist, I think Santa is a generous, large-hearted image that has lost a lot of its religious baggage. Besides, respecting other folks' religions is a good quality – at least in terms of their good intentions. It's among the primary American values; it's what our country was founded on. " – (December 8, 2009) "Bad Santa", ''Philadelphia City Paper''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Loz delany 2015.png|thumb|Delany at a reading in 2015.]]

Recurring themes in Delany's work include [[mythology]], [[memory]], [[language]], [[sexuality]], and [[perception]]. Class, position in society, and the ability to move from one social stratum to another are motifs that were touched on in his earlier work and became more significant in his later fiction and non-fiction, both. Many of Delany's later (mid-1980s and beyond) works have bodies of water (mostly oceans and rivers) as a common theme, as mentioned by Delany in ''The Polymath''. Though not a theme, coffee, more than any other beverage, is mentioned significantly and often in many of Delany's fictions.

Writing itself (both prose and poetry) is also a repeated theme: several of his characters&amp;nbsp;— Geo in ''The Jewels of Aptor'', Vol Nonik in ''[[The Fall of the Towers]]'', Rydra Wong in ''[[Babel-17]]'', Ni Ty Lee in ''[[Empire Star]]'', Katin Crawford in ''Nova'', the Kid, Ernest Newboy, and William in ''Dhalgren'', Arnold Hawley in ''[[Dark Reflections]]'', John Marr and Timothy Hasler in ''[[The Mad Man]]'', and Osudh in ''[[Phallos (novella)|Phallos]]''&amp;nbsp;– are writers or poets of some sort.

Delany also makes use of repeated imagery: several characters (Hogg, the Kid, and the sensory-syrynx player, the Mouse, in ''Nova''; Roger in "We .. move on a rigorous line") are known for wearing only one shoe; and nail biting along with rough, calloused (and sometimes veiny) hands are characteristics given to individuals in a number of his fictions. Names are sometimes reused: "Bellona" is the name of a city in both ''Dhalgren'' and ''Triton'', "Denny" is a character in both ''Dhalgren'' and ''Hogg'' (which were written almost concurrently despite being published two decades apart; and there is a Danny in "We ... move on a rigorous line"), and the name "Hawk" is used for five different characters in four separate stories&amp;nbsp;– ''Hogg'', the story "[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]" and the novella "[[The Einstein Intersection]]", and the short story "[[Cage of Brass]]", where a character called Pig also appears.

Jewels, reflection, and refraction&amp;nbsp;– not just the imagery but reflection and refraction of text and concepts&amp;nbsp;– are also strong themes and metaphors in Delany's work. Titles such as ''The Jewels of Aptor'', ''[[The Jewel-Hinged Jaw]]'', "Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones", ''Driftglass'', and ''Dark Reflections'', along with the optic chain of prisms, mirrors, and lenses worn by several characters in ''Dhalgren'', are a few examples of this; as in "We (...) move on a rigorous line" a ring is nearly obsessively described at every twist and turn of the plot. Reflection and refraction in narrative are explored in ''Dhalgren'' and take center stage in his Return to Nevèrÿon series.

Following the 1968 publication of ''Nova'', there was not only a large gap in Delany's published work (after releasing eight novels and a novella between 1962 and 1968, his published output virtually stopped until 1973), there was also a notable addition to the themes found in the stories published after that time. It was at this point that Delany began dealing with [[Sex and sexuality in speculative fiction|sexual themes]] to an extent rarely equaled in serious writing. ''Dhalgren'' and ''Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand'' include several sexually explicit passages, and several of his books such as ''[[Equinox (novel)|Equinox]] ''(originally published as ''[[The Tides of Lust]]'', a title that Delany does not endorse), ''[[The Mad Man]]'', ''[[Hogg (novel)|Hogg]]'' and, ''[[Phallos (novella)|Phallos]]'' can be considered pornography, a label Delany himself endorses.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Delany&amp;nbsp;– Shorter Views&amp;nbsp;– Chapter 13: "Pornography and Censorship"&lt;/ref&gt;

Novels such as ''Triton'' and the thousand-plus pages making up his four-volume Return to Nevèrÿon series explored in detail how sexuality and sexual attitudes relate to the socioeconomic underpinnings of a primitive&amp;nbsp;– or, in ''Triton'''s case, futuristic&amp;nbsp;– society.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;Fox, Robert Elliot. "The Politics of Desire in Delany's Triton and Tides of Lust." ''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', edited by Jeffrey W. Hunter, vol. 141, Gale, 2001. Literature Resource Center. Accessed 12 July 2018. Originally published in ''Ash of Stars: On the Writing of Samuel R. Delany'', edited by James Sallis, University Press of Mississippi, 1996, pp. 43-61.&lt;/ref&gt;
Even in works with no science fiction or fantasy content to speak of, such as ''Atlantis: Three Tales'', ''The Mad Man'', and ''Hogg'', Delany pursued these questions by creating vivid pictures of New York City, now in the [[Jazz Age]], now in the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, private schools in the 1950s, Greece and Europe in the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little Jr., Arthur L. "Delany, Samuel R. (1942– )." African American Writers, edited by Valerie Smith, 2nd ed., vol. 1, Charles Scribner's Sons, 2001, pp. 149-165.

"In the scorpion garden: 'Hogg.'." The Review of Contemporary Fiction, vol. 16, no. 3, 1996, p. 125+.

"[https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-samuel-delanys-dark-reflections/#! On Samuel R. Delany’s ‘Dark Reflections].'" ''Los Angeles Review of Books''. 09 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Mad Man'', ''Phallos'', and ''Dark Reflections'' are linked in minor ways. The beast mentioned at the beginning of ''The Mad Man'' graces the cover of ''Phallos''.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Darieck |title=Delany's Divinities |journal=American Literary History |date=13 September 2012 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=702–722 |doi=10.1093/alh/ajs045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany has also published several books of literary criticism, with an emphasis on issues in science fiction and other [[paraliterature|paraliterary]] [[genre]]s, [[comparative literature]], and [[queer studies]]. He has commented that he believes to omit the sexual practices that he portrays in his writing would limit the dialog children and adults can have about it themselves, and that this lack of knowledge can kill people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZyEnxhn0Fc&amp;t=203s Samuel R Delany and Mia Wolff discuss Bread and Wine at the Strand].

'''Sanjeev Khandekar''' is a reputed [[Marathi people|Marathi]] writer and visual artist based in [[Mumbai]].

==Biography==

He was born in 1958. Kavita (Granthali, 1990) a collection of his early poetry and Search Engine (Granthali, 2004). These collections have been followed by three volumes of poetry - All that I Wanna Do (Abhida Nantar, 2005), Mutatis Mutandis (2006) and Two Poems (2006). His two books, '1,2,3... Happy Galaxy' and collection of present poetry 'Smiles' (2007) was published by Abhida Nantar in 2007.

In 1982, he edited Sankalp:  A collection of essays by social activists in [[Maharashtra]]. It was awarded the Marathi Sahitya Parishad award. His second book, the novel Ashant Parva (Season of Unrest, 1992), concerns itself with the construction of a politically sensitive self in post-industrial India.

With his solo exhibition of watercolours, Rumour of the Truth (2003), held in Mumbai, [[Chennai]] and Delhi, Khandekar occasioned the arrival of his pictorial vocabulary. In 2004, his installation entitled, FLEX- The Fluid Less Sex, was on display at an International fashion show in [[New Delhi]]. The following year he exhibited two installations, "All That I Wanna Do" and "La Peau de Chagrin", at Museum Art Gallery and Pundole Art Gallery respectively. And though the exhibitions were held concurrently and addressed the plangent landscape of capitalism, Khandekar approached both the exhibitions fortified with two distinctive registers.

In mid-2006 Tits n Clits n Elephant Dick, his exhibition of paintings, sculptures and installations held at Jehangir Art Gallery, with contributions from Vaishali Narkar, became controversial when the Mumbai Police stopped its public viewing. The installation was an inquiry into the conflicting realities of market driven societies and their peculiar cultural logic.

He concluded the year 2006, with a solo exhibition of his painting and installations, What do I love when I love you, my God? At The Fourth Floor gallery in Mumbai. The works attempted to underline a link between shopping bulimia and religious fundamentalism, a last-ditch strategy for late capitalist, consumer societies.

In the year 2007,He had another solo exhibition,'Kegel Exercises' (Aswani Mudra) at Pundole Art Gallery, Mumbai .He displayed marble inlay works, inlaid with share market ticker tape and its abstract distortions. The show also included 'Encore' audio installation.

Same year, i.e. in 2007. He had one more major show titled as 'Acquire, Merge or Collaborate..' At Ashish Balram Nagpal Galleries, Mumbai; exhibition his paintings and a sculpture. He used scanned electron micrographs (SEM) images and share market ticker tape numbers to obtain a unique motif.

In addition to these exhibitions Khandekar has partaken of several group and Web-based exhibitions. Khandekar has also written articles on environmental issues in various dailies and magazines. From 1990-1995, he edited the magazine Sujan, for an NGO of the same name.

Khandekar has worked on several international projects in senior managerial capacities, for both large Indian and multinational corporations.

In [[mathematics]], '''Selberg's conjecture''', conjectured by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Atle Selberg|last=Selberg|year=1965|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;13}}, states that the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[Laplace operator]] on [[Maass wave form]]s of congruence subgroups are at least 1/4. Selberg showed that the eigenvalues are at least&amp;nbsp;3/16. 

The [[generalized Ramanujan conjecture]] for the [[general linear group]] implies Selberg's conjecture. More precisely, Selberg's conjecture is essentially the generalized Ramanujan conjecture for the group GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over the rationals at the infinite place, and says that the component at infinity of the corresponding representation is a principal series representation of GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') (rather than a complementary series representation). The generalized Ramanujan conjecture in turn follows from the [[Langlands functoriality conjecture]], and this has led to some progress on Selberg's conjecture.

{{About|the geographic history of the Latin script|the typographic and orthographic history of the Latin script|history of the Latin script|the history of the Latin language|history of Latin}}
This article discusses the geographic '''spread of the Latin script''' throughout history, from its archaic beginnings in [[Latium]] to the dominant [[writing system]] on [[Earth]] in [[modernity]].

The Latin letters' ancestors are found in the [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and ultimately [[Phoenician alphabet]]. As the [[Roman Empire]] expanded in [[late antiquity]], the Latin script and [[Latin|language]] spread along with its conquests, and remained in use in [[Italy]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and Western Europe after the [[Western Roman Empire]]'s disappearance. During the early and high [[Middle Ages]], the script was spread by [[Christianisation|Christian missionaries]] and rulers, replacing earlier writing systems on the [[British Isles]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe]].

In the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[first wave of European colonization|first wave of European colonisation]] saw the adoption of Latin alphabets primarily in the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]], whereas [[sub-Sahara Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] were Latinised in the period of [[New Imperialism]]. Realising that Latin was now the most widely used script on Earth, the [[Bolsheviks]] made efforts to develop and establish Latin alphabets for all languages in the lands they controlled in [[Eastern Europe]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[Central Asia]]. However, after the [[Soviet Union]]'s first three decades, these were gradually abandoned in the 1930s in favour of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. Some post-Soviet [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-majority states decided to reintroduce the Latin script in the 1990s after the 1928 example of [[Turkey]]. In the early 21st century, non-Latin writing systems were still only prevalent in most parts of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] and former Soviet regions, most countries in [[Indochina]], South and East Asia, [[Ethiopia]] and some [[Balkan]] countries in Europe.  

== Protohistory ==
[[File:Masiliana tablet.svg|thumb|The [[Marsiliana]] tablet (c. 700 BCE), containing the earliest known Etruscan [[abecedarium]].]]
The Latin script originated in [[Archaic period in classical antiquity|archaic antiquity]] in the [[Latium]] region in [[central Italy]]. It is generally held that the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], one of many [[Italic peoples|ancient Italic tribes]], adopted the western variant of the [[Greek alphabet]] in the 7th century BCE&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kamusella |first=Tomasz |date=2008 |title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418 |location=Houndmills |publisher=Springer |pages=418–419 |isbn=9780230583474 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Cumae]], a [[Magna Graecia|Greek colony]] in [[southern Italy]]&amp;nbsp;– making the early Latin alphabet one among several [[Old Italic alphabets]] emerging at the time. The early Latin script was heavily influenced by the then regionally dominant [[Etruscan civilization]];&lt;ref name="Etruscans"&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Etrusken. §2. Taal en schrift". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; the Latins ultimately adopted 22 of the original 26 Etruscan letters,&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kamusella |first=Tomasz |date=2008 |title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418 |location=Houndmills |publisher=Springer |pages=418–419 |isbn=9780230583474 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which derived from Western Greek as well.&lt;ref name="Etruscans"/&gt;

== Antiquity ==
Along with the Latin language, the Latin writing system spread first spread over the [[Italian Peninsula]] with the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], especially after 350 BCE. For example, the region of [[Umbria]] seems to have switched from its own script in the 2nd century BCE to Latin in the 1st.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Umbrië. §1. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; Next were the lands surrounding the Western [[Mediterranean Sea]]: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]], [[Numidia]], [[Hispania]], and [[Gallia Transalpina]]. This continued during the early period of expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] (c. 27 BCE – 117 CE) in regions such as [[Illyria]], [[Rhaetia]], [[Noricum]], [[Dacia]], [[Gaul]], [[Belgica]], western [[Germania]], and [[Britannia]]. The eastern half of the Empire, including [[Greece]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"/&gt; Despite the loss of the Latin-speaking Western provinces, the [[Byzantine Empire]] maintained Latin as its legal language, under 6th-century emperor [[Justinian I]] producing the vast [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] that would have a major impact on Western European legal history from c. 1100 to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Corpus Iuris Civilis".&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic peoples that invaded and gradually settled the Western Roman Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries, most notably the [[Franks]] (first as the [[Merovingian script]], later the [[Carolingian minuscule]]), adopted the Latin script and spread it further.

== Middle Ages ==
=== Latin Christianisation of Western, Central and Northern Europe ===
[[File:CarolingianMinuscule.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Carolingian minuscule]] from a 10th-century manuscript.]]
With the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet since the 5th century)&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"/&gt; or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runic alphabet]]s since the 8th century)&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"/&gt; or [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The Latin script was introduced to Scandinavia in the 9th century, first in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Kamusella418-9"/&gt; It reached Norway during the [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Norway|11th-century Christianisation]], but in two different forms: the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Insular script]] in Western Norway and the Carolingian minuscule in Eastern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Flom |first=George T. |date=1915 |title=On the earliest history of the Latin script in Eastern Norway |jstor=40914943 |journal=Publications of the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study |publisher=[[Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=92–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavic languages ===
The Latin script also came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]] such as [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]],&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Kroatië. §5. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; as the people who spoke them adopted [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] generally adopted [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. The [[Serbian language]] has come to use both scripts, whilst the Southeastern Slavic [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] languages have maintained Cyrillic only.

== Early modern period ==
As late as 1500, the Latin script was limited primarily to the languages spoken in [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], and [[Central Europe]], Iberia and Italy. The [[Orthodox Christian]] Slavs of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] mostly used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and the Greek alphabet was in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Arabic script]] was widespread within Islamdom, both among [[Arab]]s and non-Arab nations like the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and [[Turkic peoples]], as well as amongst [[Arab Christians]]. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of [[Brahmic family|Brahmic alphabets]] or the [[Chinese script]].

Since the 15th and especially 16th centuries, the Latin script has spread around the world, to the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]], and parts of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] (until about 1880 mostly limited to the coastal areas), and the Pacific with European colonisation, along with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] languages.

=== Americas ===
In an effort to Christianise and 'civilise' the [[Mayans]], the Roman Catholic bishop [[Diego de Landa]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán|Yucatan]] ordered the burning of most [[Maya codices]] in July 1562, and with it the near destruction of the [[Maya script|Mayan hieroglyphic script]]. He then rewrote the history of the Mayans in Spanish, and the Mayan language was romanised, leading to an enormous loss in culture.&lt;ref name="Andresen"/&gt;

Latin letters served as the basis for the forms of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] developed by [[Sequoyah]] in the late 1810s and early 1820s; however, the sound values are completely different.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Southeast Asia and Pacific ===
The Latin script was introduced for many [[Austronesian languages]], including the [[languages of the Philippines]] and the [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language]]s, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets.

During the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule on Formosa]] (1624–1662), the island currently known as [[Taiwan]], the [[Siraya language]] was given a [[Sinckan Manuscripts|Sinckan Latin alphabet]] by the Dutch, which lasted until the 19th century.

== 19th century ==
=== Africa ===
The [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881–1914), meaning the rapid occupation, colonisation and annexation of inland Africa by European powers, went hand in hand with the spread of literacy amongst native Africans, as the Latin script was introduced where there were other writing systems or none. Until the early 19th century, the [[Berbers|Berber peoples]] in North Africa had two systems: originally [[Tifinagh]], and, following the spread of Islam, the [[Arabic script]] as well.&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Larbi| first = Hsen| title = Which Script for Tamazight, Whose Choice is it ?| journal = Amazigh Voice (Taghect Tamazight)| volume = 12| issue = 2| year = 2003| publisher = Amazigh Cultural Association in America (ACAA)| location = New Jersey| url = http://www.tamazgha.fr/Which-Script-for-Tamazight-Whose-Choice-is-it,359.html| accessdate =17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; French colonists, particularly missionaries and army linguists, developed a [[Berber Latin alphabet]] to make communication easier, especially for the [[Kabyle people]] in [[French Algeria]]. Since no great body of Berber literature existed, and the colonisers greatly helped improve literacy rates, the romanisation received much support, more so after Algerian independence (1962) when the French-educated Kabyle intelligentsia began to stimulate the transition and especially since the establishment of a standard transcription for Kabylie in 1970. Similar French attempts to latinise the Arabic language met much more resistance, were unsuccessful and eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Souag |first=Lameen |year=2004 |title=Writing Berber Languages: a quick summary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050730075554/http://www.geocities.com/lameens/tifinagh/ |archivedate=2005-07-30 |publisher=L. Souag |accessdate=7 June 2017 |ref=harv |url=http://www.geocities.com/lameens/tifinagh/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===
As a [[Romance language]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] continued to be written in Latin script until the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Descriptio_Moldaviae#CAPUT_V_-_DE_LITTERIS_MOLDAVORUM |date=1714 |title=Descriptio_Moldaviae |publisher=La.wikisource.org |accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly influenced by [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] as the Greek [[Byzantine Empire]] declined and was gradually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] had begun promoting the Slavic [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. In the 19th century, the [[Romanians]] returned to the Latin alphabet under the influence of [[nationalism]]. The linguist [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] first proposed a simplified version of Cyrillic in 1829, but in 1838, he introduced a mixed alphabet containing 19 Cyrillic and 10 Latin letters, and an [i] and [o] that could be both. This 'transitional orthography' was widely used until the official adoption of a completely Latin Romanian alphabet in [[Wallachia]] (1860) and [[Moldavia]] (1863), that were gradually united since 1859 to become the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881. Romanian intellectuals in [[Transylvania]], then still part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and scholars in Wallachia-Moldavia agreed to cleanse the language from all non-Latin elements (Greek, Magyar, Slavic, and Ottoman), and to emulate French wherever needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kamusella |first=Tomasz |date=2008 |title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzkWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209 |location=Houndmills |publisher=Springer |page=209 |isbn=9780230583474 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian Empire ===
{{double image|right|Auksa altorius latin.jpg|140|Auksa altorius cirillics.jpg|135|The [[Lithuanian press ban]] in action: two issues of the same popular prayer book. The Latin left one was illegal, the right Cyrillic one was legal and paid for by the government.}}
Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (r. 1826–1855) of the [[Russian Empire]] introduced a policy of [[Russification]], including Cyrillisation. From the 1840s on, Russia considered introducing the Cyrillic script for spelling the [[Polish language]], with the first school books printed in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyrylica nad Wisłą|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/806286-Cyrylica-nad-Wisla.html|website=Rzeczpospolita|language=Polish|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial government's attempts failed, however: the Polish population put up a tough resistance, as it saw its language as expressed in its Latin alphabet as a source of national pride, and threatened to rebel if it were to be abolished.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt;

The initially successfully enacted [[Lithuanian press ban]] (1865–1904) outlawed the use of Latin script, whilst encouraging writing Lithuanian texts in Cyrillic. Resistance grew as time went on: [[Lithuanian book smugglers|Lithuanian books were smuggled]] into the country, mainly from [[Lithuania Minor]] in [[East Prussia]]. Although the Russian authorities tried to seize them, they could not stop the rapid increase in forbidden titles from crossing the border. The Lithuanian ban, lifted in 1904, is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement and embracing the Latin script, rather than discouraging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lithuania/History#toc37338 |title=Lithuania – History – Russian Rule |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam ===

A [[romanization]] of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was codified in the 17th century by the French [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] (1591–1660), based on works of the early 16th-century [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese missionaries]] Gaspar do Amaral and António Barbosa.&lt;ref name="Andresen"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Andresen |first1=Julie Tetel |last2=Carter |first2=Phillip M. |date=2016 |title=Languages in the World: How History, Culture, and Politics Shape Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uolxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=106 |isbn=9781118531280 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (''chữ quốc ngữ'' or "national script") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public, which had previously used [[Chu nom|Chinese-based characters]].

During the [[French Indochina|French protectorate]] (1883–1945), colonial rulers made an effort to educate all Vietnamese, and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the romanized script came to predominate written communication.&lt;ref name="Andresen"/&gt; To further the process, Vietnamese written with the alphabet was made obligatory for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French Résident Supérieur of the [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|protectorate of Tonkin]] in northern Vietnam.

== 20th century ==
=== Albanian ===
{{main|Albanian alphabet}}
[[Albanian language|Albanian]] used a [[Albanian alphabet|variety of writing systems]] since its first attestation in the 12th century, especially Latin (in the north), Greek (in the south), Ottoman and Arabic (favoured by many Muslims). Attempts at standardisation were made throughout the 19th century, since 1879 led by the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]], culminating in the 1908 [[Congress of Manastir]] when a single Latin script, Bashkimi, was chosen for the whole language.

=== Serbo-Croatian ===
[[File:Latinalphabet Former Yugoslavia 2008.png|thumb|350px|A map showing the expansion of the use of Latin script in areas of former [[Yugoslavia]], primarily amongst Croatians and Slovenes ([[Roman Catholic]]s), [[Bosniaks]] (Bosnian [[Muslim]]s) and Kosovars (Albanian Muslims). [[Cyrillic]] texts are dominant in areas primarily inhabited by Serbs, Montenegrins, and Macedonians ([[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians). This cultural boundary has existed since the dichotomy of the [[Greek East and Latin West]].]]
{{See also|Gaj's Latin alphabet}}
Croatian linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]] devised a uniform Latin alphabet for Croatian in 1835, while in 1818, Serbian linguist [[Vuk Karadžić]] had developed a [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In the first half of the 19th century, the [[Illyrian movement]] to unite all Southern Slavs (Yugoslavs) culturally, and perhaps also politically, was quite strong, and efforts were made to create a unified literary language that would set the standard for all Yugoslav dialects. The [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] (March 1850) between writers from Croatia, Serbia and one from Slovenia was the most significant attempt, where some basic rules were agreed upon. In the 1860s, Vuk's orthography gained acceptance in Serbia, while a [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] was founded in 1866 in [[Zagreb]] and the first 'Serbo-Croatian' grammar book by [[Pero Budmani]] was published in Croatia in 1867. In 1913, [[Jovan Skerlić]] proposed a compromise for a single writing system and dialect to create true language unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Robert D. |date=2004 |title=Language and Identity in the Balkans: Serbo-Croatian and Its Disintegration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lNjHgr3QioC&amp;pg=PA55 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=55 |isbn=9780191514555 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], political unity was realised in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], but an agreement on scriptural unity for its population was never reached. The post-war [[Titoist]] [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] made another attempt at achieving linguistic unity, but the 1954 [[Novi Sad Agreement]] only managed to get equality of Latin and Cyrillic, and an obligation for all citizens to learn both alphabets. With the return of ethnic nationalism in the 1980s, the two again became heavily associated with particular variants of the Serbo-Croatian language and thus with national identities. Exacerbated by the [[Yugoslav Wars]] that led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, nationalists on all sides resumed insisting Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian and Montenegrin were distinct languages in their own right, undermining the project of Serbo-Croatian linguistic unity.

The [[Bosnian language]] was originally primarily expressed in the Cyrillic-type ''[[Bosnian Cyrillic|Bosančica]]'' since the 11th century (originally alongside the older ''[[Glagolitic script|Glagoljica]]''), but it was gradually driven extinct in the 18th century after the Ottoman introduction of the [[Perso-Arabic script]]-type ''[[Arebica]]'' (15th–20th century).&lt;ref name="Čuvalo"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Čuvalo |first=Ante |date=2010 |title=The A to Z of Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfk4nP_fp04C&amp;pg=PA26 |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=26 |isbn=9780810876477 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, most Bosnians adopted the Croatian-derived ''[[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latinica]]'' or Latin script –originally introduced by the Catholic [[Franciscans]]&lt;ref name="Čuvalo"/&gt;– in the course of the 20th century, standardised in the 1990s.

=== Middle East and North Africa ===
{{See also|Berber Latin alphabet|Kurdish alphabets|Turkish Latin alphabet}}
[[File:Ataturk-September 20, 1928.jpg|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] introduced the Latin script in Turkey in 1928.]]
In 1928, as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s reforms, the new [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] adopted the [[Turkish Latin alphabet]] for the [[Turkish language]], replacing a modified Arabic alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Turkse talen. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s and 1940s, the majority of [[Kurds]] replaced the Arabic script with two Latin alphabets. Although the only official Kurdish government, the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] in northern [[Iraq]], uses an Arabic alphabet for public documents, the Latin Kurdish alphabet remains widely used throughout the region by the majority of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] speakers, especially in Turkey and Syria. 

During the late 20th century [[decolonisation]], [[Pan-Arabism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] expressed themselves in anti-Western tendencies, including hostility towards the Latin script. It was banned in some places such as Libya after [[Moammar Gaddafi]]'s [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|1969 coup]], in favour of exclusive Arabic script.

=== Soviet Union ===
{{main|Latinisation in the Soviet Union}}
Since at least 1700, Russian intellectuals have sought to Latinise the [[Russian language]] in their desire for close relations with the West.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Andresen |first1=Julie Tetel |last2=Carter |first2=Phillip M. |date=2016 |title=Languages in the World: How History, Culture, and Politics Shape Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uolxBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110 |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=110 |isbn=9781118531280 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bolsheviks]] had four goals: to break with [[Tsarism]], to spread [[socialism]] to the whole world, to isolate the Muslim inhabitants of the [[Soviet Union]] from the Arabic-Islamic world and religion, and eradicate [[illiteracy]] through simplification.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt; They concluded the Latin alphabet was the right tool to do so, and after seizing power during the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, they made plans to realise these ideals.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt;

Although progress was slow at first, in 1926 the Turkic-majority republics of the Soviet Union adopted the Latin script, giving a major boost to reformers in neighbouring Turkey.&lt;ref name="Zürcher-188"&gt;[[Erik-Jan Zürcher|Zürcher, Erik Jan]]. ''Turkey: a modern history'', p. 188. I.B.Tauris, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-85043-399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] adopted the new [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish Latin alphabet]] in 1928, this in turn encouraged the Soviet leaders to proceed.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt; The Commission to romanise the Russian alphabet completed its work in mid-January 1930. But on 25 January 1930, General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the stop of the romanisation of Russian.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt; The Latinisation of non-Slavic languages within the USSR continued until the late 1930s, however. Most of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking peoples of the Soviet Union, including [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani or Azeri]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] (1929–40&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;), [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and others, used the Latin-based [[Uniform Turkic alphabet]] in the 1930s; but, in the 1940s, all were replaced by Cyrillic.

===Post-Soviet states===
The Russian conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] in the 19th century split the Azerbaijani language community across two states, the other being [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]]. The Soviet Union promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/81_folder/81_articles/81_alphabet_changes1.html|title=Alphabet Changes in Azerbaijan in the 20th Century|website=[[Azerbaijan International]]|date=Spring 2000|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – from the [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] to Latin and then to the [[Cyrillic script]] – while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]], it did not become the official language of Azerbaijan until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/politics/249744.html Language Commission Suggested to Be Established in National Assembly].

=== Kazakhstan ===
[[File:Kazakhstan’s transition to the Latin script.webm|thumb|Kazakhstan’s transition to the Latin script was welcomed by linguists and expats ([[Kazakh TV]], November 2018).]]
Unlike its Turkic neighbours, Kazakhstan did not move towards Latinisation after obtaining statehood in 1991. This was motivated by pragmatic reasons: the government was wary to alienate the country's large Russian-speaking minority, and due to the economic crisis in the early 1990s, a transition was considered fiscally unfeasable at the time.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav090407.shtml |title=Kazakhstan: Moving Forward with Plan to Replace Cyrillic with Latin Alphabet |author=Paul Bartlett |work=[[EurasiaNet]] |publisher=[[Open Society Foundations]] |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] requested the Ministry of Education and Science to examine the experiences of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which had all switched to Latin letters in the 20th century. The ministry reported in the summer of 2007 that a six-step plan, based primarily on the Uzbekistan model, should be implemented over a 12-to-15-year period at the cost of about $300&amp;nbsp;million. Aside from integrating Kazakhstan into the global economy, officials have also argued it would help the development of a Kazakh national identity separate from Russia.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt; In 2007, Nazarbayev said the transformation of the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic to Latin should not be rushed, as he noted: "For 70 years, the Kazakhstanis read and wrote in Cyrillic. More than 100 nationalities live in our state. Thus we need stability and peace. We should be in no hurry in the issue of alphabet transformation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=158363 Kazakhstan should be in no hurry in Kazakh alphabet transformation to Latin: Nazarbayev, Kazinform, December 13, 2007]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916024719/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=158363 |date=16 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Kazakh government]] announced that the Latin script would replace Cyrillic as the writing system for the [[Kazakh language]] by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet – MCS RK]. Inform.kz (30 January 2015). Retrieved on 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Nazarbayev said that "By the end of 2017, after consultation with academics and representatives of the public, a single standard for the new [[Kazakh alphabet]] and script should be developed." Education specialists are to be trained to teach the new alphabet and provide textbooks beginning in 2018. The romanisation policy is intended to modernise Kazakhstan and increase international cooperation.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/kazakhstan-spells-out-plans-for-alphabet-swap/a-38407769 |title=Kazakhstan spells out plans for alphabet swap |work=Deutsche Welle |date=4 January 2017 |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bulgaria ====
{{See also|Romanization of Bulgarian}}
In 2001, Austrian slavistics professor Otto Kronsteiner recommended that Bulgaria adopt the Latin script in order to facilitate the country's accession to the [[European Union]]. This caused such a scandal that the [[Veliko Tarnovo University]] revoked the honorary degree it had previously awarded him (for supporting the Bulgarian viewpoint on the [[Macedonian language]]).&lt;ref name="Detrez"/&gt; For many [[Bulgaria]]ns, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007.&lt;ref name="Detrez"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Detrez |first=Raymond |date=2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hywaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=147–148 |isbn=9781442241800 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUCyrillic"&gt;With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the [[European Union]], following the Latin and Greek scripts. {{cite pressrelease|author1=Leonard Orban|title=Cyrillic, the third official alphabet of the EU, was created by a truly multilingual European|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-07-330_en.pdf|format=PDF|website=Europe.eu|accessdate=28 November 2018|date=24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in digital communication using computers and writing [[email]]s and [[SMS]], the Latin script has been proposed to replace the Cyrillic. A Bulgarian Latin alphabet, the so-called ''shlyokavitsa'', is already often employed for convenience for emails and SMS messages. Ciphers are used to denote Bulgarian sounds that cannot be represented with a single Latin character (for example, a "[[4]]" represents a "[[ч]]" because they look alike and the Bulgarian word for the cardinal number four, чѐтири ''čѐtiri'', starts with a "ч").&lt;ref name="Detrez"/&gt;

==== Kyrgyzstan ====
{{See also|Kyrgyz alphabets}}
Adopting the Latin script for the [[Kyrgyz language]] has been the subject of discussions in [[Kyrgyzstan]] since attaining independence in the 1990s. However, unlike in the other Turkic-dominated former Soviet republics in Central Asia, the issue did not become prominent until its great neighbour Kazakhstan in September 2015 and April 2017 confirmed its previous annoucements to Latinise the closely related [[Kazakh language]]. Before then, the largely Russian-speaking elite of the country saw no reason to, nor did it seek to endanger its good-standing political and economic relations with the Russian Federation. Amongst others, deputy Kanybek Imanaliyev advocated a shift to Latin for 'the development of contemporary technology, communication, education and science.' On the other hand, due to financial constraints, he proposed to postpone the transition to the 2030s or even 2040s. Because Russia is still a very important financial supporter of Kyrgyzstan, other experts agreed it would be unwise for Bishkek to make a move that would culturally alienate Moscow. President [[Almazbek Atambayev]] stated in October 2017 that the country would not Latinise any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goble |first=Paul |date=12 October 2017 |title=Moscow Bribes Bishkek to Stop Kyrgyzstan From Changing to Latin Alphabet |url=https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-bribes-bishkek-stop-kyrgyzstan-changing-latin-alphabet/ |journal=[[Eurasia Daily Monitor]] |volume=14 |issue=128 |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Montenegro ====
{{See also|Controversy over ethnic and linguistic identity in Montenegro|Montenegrin alphabet}}
There is ongoing discussion in [[Montenegro]] about how to call the [[Montenegrin language|"Montenegrin" language]], which is [[Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian|mutually intelligible with the other standardised versions]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]. These debates focus on the perceived linguistic differences between Montenegrin and related variants, but also on national and political identification. Montenegro practices [[digraphia]]: there are two official [[Montenegrin alphabet]]s, one Latin and one Cyrillic. In electoral campaigns after 2000, especially the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|2006 independence referendum]], Latin has come to symbolise closeness to Western countries, including Montenegro's historical ties to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], and independence from Serbia; on the other hand, Cyrillic is taken to signify unity with Serbia and closeness to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kolstø |first=Pål |date=2016 |title=Strategies of Symbolic Nation-building in South Eastern Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY7eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169 |publisher=Routledge |page=169 |isbn=9781317049357 |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In general, proponents of calling the language "Montenegrin" – including the government – tend to favour the Latin script, whereas supporters of "Serbian" prefer Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lowen |first=Mark |title=Montenegro embroiled in language row |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=19 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8520466.stm |accessdate=29 November 2018}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, an incident in which top students in primary and secondary schools for the first time since World War II received their "Luca" diplomas – named after [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Njegoš]]'s poem – printed in the Latin alphabet, sparked political controversy. The opposition [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]] (SNP) accused Education Minister [[Predrag Bošković]] of "persecuting Cyrillic" and discriminating against pupils who use this script. The SNP was unsuccessful in forcing the minister to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegrin-opposition-alleges-cyrillic-script-discrimination-06-13-2016 |title=Montenegro Minister Accused of Undermining Cyrillic |author=Dusica Tomovic |work=Balkan Insight |date=14 June 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Serbia ====
{{See also|Romanization of Serbian}}
Under the [[Constitution of Serbia]] of 2006, Cyrillic script is the only one in official use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav_odredbe.php?id=101 Article 10] of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia ([http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_1.asp English version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314172414/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_1.asp |date=14 March 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless the Latin script is widely used. In May 2017, Minister of Culture and Information {{ill|Vladan Vukosavljević (politician)|lt=Vladan Vukosavljević|sr|Владан Вукосављевић (министар)}} proposed several measures to better support the Cyrillic script, which was "in danger of falling into disuse". He said there wasn't any kind of conspiracy going on against the Cyrillic alphabet, but rather that the spirit of the times, historical circumstances and the decades-long process of globalisation had gradually made Latin the world's dominant script. "Especially young people in Serbia are now mostly turning to Latin characters because of the media, the Internet and the logos of world [[brand]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://informer.rs/vesti/politika/334105/vukosavljevic-cirilica-ugrozena-moramo-spasiti |title=VUKOSAVLJEVIĆ: Ćirilica je ugrožena, moramo je spasiti! |trans-title=VUKOSAVLJEVIĆ: Cyrillic is endangered, we've got to save her! |work=[[Informer (newspaper)|Informer]] |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=sr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the Ministry of Culture proposed a law to that effect, obliging government institutions to use Cyrillic under the threat of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], and setting up a Council for the Serbian Language to implement this suggested language policy. The ministry claimed that indifference towards which script to use was not “a culturally responsible position”, and complained that some people had come to “use the Latin script as a symbol of [their] openness and [[Europeanism|European affiliation]]”, arguing that Cyrillic was also one of the [[Languages of the European Union#Writing systems|European Union's official writing systems]]&lt;ref name="EUCyrillic"/&gt; and that "the EU is a [[Motto of the European Union|community of peoples with their peculiarities]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-proposes-law-changes-to-halt-cyrillic-s-decline-08-01-2018 |title=Serbia Proposes Law Changes to Halt Cyrillic’s Decline |author=Maja Zivanovic |work=Balkan Insight |date=2 August 2018 |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tatarstan (Russia) ====
{{See also|Tatar alphabet}}
In 1999, the Russian [[Tatarstan|Republic of Tatarstan]] proposed to convert the Turkic [[Tatar language]] to Latin script in order to bring it into the modern world of the [[Internet]]. There was opposition from both inside and outside Tatarstan, with Tatars arguing it would threaten their national identity and to sever their ties to the past. The Russian [[State Duma]] rejected the proposal. President [[Vladimir Putin]] said that a Tatar move from Cyrillic to Latin would 'threaten the unity of the [[Russian Federation]]'. In 2002, Putin therefore enacted a law that made the use of Cyrillic mandatory for all languages in all autonomous republics of Russia.&lt;ref name="Andresen110"/&gt;

==== Ukraine ====
{{See also|Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian Latin alphabet}}
In March 2018, Foreign Minister of Ukraine [[Pavlo Klimkin]] called for a discussion on the introduction of the Latin alphabet in parallel usage with the traditional Cyrillic one in Ukraine. He did so in response to the suggestion of Polish historian Ziemowit Szczerek. Ukraine's parliamentary committee on science and education responded, with first deputy chair Oleksandr Spivakovsky saying that today in Ukraine there are other, more important issues to work on than a transition to the Latin script. Similarly, philology professor Oleksandr Ponomariv was skeptical whether a full transition to Latin would benefit Ukraine, but did not rule out the parallel use of two alphabets. He pointed to the fact that the [[Serbian language]] is also expressed in both a Cyrillic and a Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.unian.info/society/10058741-klimkin-welcomes-discussion-on-switching-to-latin-alphabet-in-ukraine.html |title=Klimkin welcomes discussion on switching to Latin alphabet in Ukraine |author= |work=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] |date=27 March 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Manuscript''''' is a significant record of the [[Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese language|Indo-Portuguese]] [[creole language|creole]], as spoken in the 19th century among the [[Burgher people|Burgher]] and [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people|Kaffir]] communities. It a precious source for [[linguistics|linguistic]], [[literature|literary]], [[anthropology|anthropological]], and [[folklore|folkloric]] studies.

The manuscript was collected by [[Hugh Nevill]] in the period 1865–1897, and is now at the [[British Library]].

The manuscript contains 1,049 quatrains, divided into three sections:
* ''Portuguese Song Batticaloa'' (Burgher)
* ''Songs of the Portuguese Kaffrinha'' (Kaffir)
* ''The Story of Orson and Valentine''

The story of Orson and Valentine was very popular in Europe. Variants of the story are found in 5th century [[Pali language|Pali]] literature, and it is also an early play of [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] theatre (''Balasanta Nadagama'').

The manuscript is written using a mix of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] [[orthography]].

'''Stadium anthems''' or '''sports anthems''' or '''arena anthems''' are a musical genre identifying songs that are played over the [[public address]] systems at stadiums and arenas during breaks in the action to rally the fans.  Unlike college [[fight song]]s, most stadium anthems were not written primarily for use at sports events, though [[Compilation album|compilation]]s such as ''ESPN Presents Stadium Anthems'' and the [[Jock series|''"Jock"'' series]] occasionally feature [[remix]]ed versions of these songs designed to [[segue]] together or to accentuate the rhythm or other elements of the songs. Some [[Association football|football]] events have their own anthems, but they are not played during breaks, but they are played as entrance music. The most notable anthems are the [[FIFA Anthem]] and the [[UEFA Champions League Anthem]].{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Stadium anthems are characterized by a catchy uptempo rhythm and a repeated vocal call-response catchphrase, often a statement of pride or arrogance (such as "[[We Will Rock You]]", "[[We Are the Champions]]" and "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1365179/We-STILL-rock-Re-releases-chart-Queens-rise-power.html We STILL rock you: Re-releases chart Queen's rise to power] Daily Mail. Retrieved July 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/song/we-are-the-champions-t2415717 We Are the Champions] Allmusic. Retrieved July 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stadium anthems are drawn from popular [[rock and roll]], dance or [[hip hop music|rap]] hits.  At [[college football]] games, the schools' [[marching band]]s often add stadium anthems to their repertoires.  In [[baseball]], many stadium anthems are used as entrance music for various ballplayers.  For example, [[AC/DC]]'s "[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]" was the entrance music for [[Trevor Hoffman]] and [[Metallica]]'s "[[Enter Sandman]]" filled the same role for [[Mariano Rivera]].

Some stadium anthems are popular in a particular region, or with a specific team because of a reference in the song's lyrics. "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]" is the club anthem of [[Liverpool Football Club]]. "Just idag är jag stark" by [[Kenta (musician)|Kenta]] is the club anthem of [[Hammarby Fotboll]]. The [[Dallas Cowboys]] made heavy use of "[[Should've Been a Cowboy]]" by [[Toby Keith]] in the 1990s, while sports teams in [[Alabama]] often use "[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]" by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]].  In a rare example of a team actually being mentioned in a song's lyrics, the [[University of Alabama]] marching band often plays "[[Deacon Blues]]" by [[Steely Dan]] due to the school being referred to as one of ''"the winners in the world"'', even though the reference was intended as [[sarcasm|sarcastic]].

'''Thanadelthur''' "Thanadeltth'er" (c. 1697 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1717) was a woman of the [[Chipewyan]] Dënesųłı̨ne nation who served as a guide and interpreter for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. She was instrumental in forging a peace agreement between the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyan) and the [[Cree]] people.

== Life ==
Thanadelthur is thought to have been born during 1697. In early 1713,  a party of Dënesųłı̨ne [[Chipewyan]]s were attacked by [[Cree]]s and, among at least three women, Thanadelthur was captured. After spending the winter with their Cree captors, Thanadelthur and another woman escaped and attempted to rejoin their people. Cold and hunger prevented them from doing so, however, and the two endured a year of hardship until Thanadelthur's travelling companion died. Five days later Thanadelthur was discovered by goose hunters from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].

She reached the safety of [[York Factory, Manitoba]] on 24 November 1714. At this time, [[James Knight (explorer)|James Knight]], a director of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], was seeking a 
interpreter to help convince the Cree to allow other northern Indians to reach bay side trading posts in order to trade furs with his company. The Cree now were armed with firearms that they had obtained from Europeans, objected to the attempts to invade their tribal territory, and posed a significant hindrance to the lucrative trade the company wanted to conduct.

In 1715, Knight enlisted the aid of Thanadelthur to forge a peace agreement between the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyan) and the Cree. On June 27 of that year, Thanadelthur, along with one hundred and fifty Cree and one Englishman, William Stuart, embarked on the mission to make peace between the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyans) and the Cree.&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;{{cite

Thanadelthur was given many gif by Knight to present to her people. After much persuasion, the two groups agreed to make peace and Knight was overjoyed.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/people/women/thanadelthur |title=Our History: People: Women: Thanadelthur |work=HBC Heritage |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sylvia&gt;{{cite book |title=Many tender ties: women in fur-trade society, 1670-1870 |last=Van Kirk |first=Sylvia |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1983 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman |isbn=0-8061-1847-4 |page=68 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBAp4KhDrdUC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=thanadelthur&amp;ei=PbVdS7-sC4HClQSxmfSYDQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=thanadelthur&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Knight intended to provide safe passage for Thanadelthur and the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyans) so that they could return to their home country in 1716. A harsh winter and an enduring fear of bands of Cree who had not been parties to the peace agreement prevented this, however, and caused him to allow the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyans) to spend the winter at the company factory.

A promised trading post in the Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyan) lands had not been built and Thanadelthur's next mission from Knight was to return to her home country and assure her people that the post eventually would be built. Before that could be accomplished, however, she died of a fever on February 5, 1717. Knight said of her: “She was one of a very high Spirit and of the Firmest Resolution that every I see in any Body in my Days and of great Courage.”&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Dënesųłı̨ne (Chipewyans) are a national group that is a member of a much larger [[ethnography|ethnographic]] na-dene group whose [[culture]] is identified as the [[Dene]], by [[anthropologists]]. The legacy of Thanadelthur has survived in the [[history|oral traditions]] of the Dene people and in the records of the Hudson's Bay Company. This later recognition and inclusion in historical records created by the trading company is a rare occurrence for a native person, even if she remained unnamed in documents: when her travels were recorded, she was identified repeatedly as the 'Slave Woman'. Her name has survived to be included in modern histories by means of records retained by the native tribes. In comparıson, her story ıs of legends ın the Denesųłı̨ne language. Reference to thıs says, she was our grandmother who brought the Cree and Dënesųłı̨ne together ın peace.

The lasting peace agreement honed by Thanadelthur paved the way for expansion of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] farther north and led to further integration of the arriving Europeans into the tribes of the native Indians.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbc/&gt;

In 2000, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized Thanadelthur as a [[Persons of National Historic Significance|national historic person]] of Canada.&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{DFHD|1897|Thanadelthur National Historic Person|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=100canadians&gt;{{cite book |last=Forster |first=Merna |chapter=Thanadelthur: A Priceless Prize or War |title=100 Canadian Heroines: Famous and Forgotten Faces |year=2004 |publisher=Dundurn Press |location=Toronto |isbn=1-55002-514-7 |pages=254–256 |url={{google books|ZqeZBw6nzjgC|page=254|plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Popular Media==

Thanadelthur is portrayed as a leading character in the [[James Archibald Houston]]'s novel ''Running West'', along with William Stewart and James Knight. The novel traces her life from the time she is captured and enslaved by Cree Indians, through the journey from York Factory to the land of the Dene, and their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houston |first=James Archibald |title=Running West |date=1989 |url= |publisher=Crown |location= |isbn=978-0-5175-7732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sport, a '''whitewash''' is a game or series in which the losing person or team fails to score. A whitewash may be in a single game where the loser fails to score any points or goals, or in a series where the loser fails to win a game.  In [[North American English|North America]] the two are differentiated, with the former called a [[shutout]] and the latter a '''sweep'''.

It is not typically used for games such as [[soccer|football]] where a failure to score is very common; the winning team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] is said to keep a [[clean sheet]] if they do not concede a goal.

==Usage by sport==
===Cricket===
In [[cricket]], a whitewash is when a team wins all the matches played in a series of at least 3 matches.

Examples include;

* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920–21|1920-21 Ashes series]].
* [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]]' consecutive 5–0 defeats of [[England cricket team|England]] in [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1984|1984]] and [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1985-86|1985-86]]. These two [[Wisden Trophy]] results are also commonly labelled '''blackwashes''' because of the dark skin of the West Indies players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/jamaica/sports1.shtml |title=Blackwash |work=I love Jamaica |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 2000–01 to win the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 2000–01|Frank Worrell Trophy]]
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[2006–07 Ashes series]].
* [[England cricket team|England]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Indian cricket team|India]] to win the [[Pataudi Trophy]] during India's tour of England in 2011.
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Indian cricket team|India]] to win the 2011–12 [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]].
* [[Indian cricket team|India]]'s 4–0 defeat of [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] to win the 2012–13 [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]].
* [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]'s 5–0 defeat of [[England cricket team|England]] to win the [[2013–14 Ashes series]].

===Rugby union===
The term whitewash is also used in [[rugby union]] when one team loses every match in a particular series. The team that comes last in the [[Six Nations Championship]] has the ignominy of being awarded the [[Wooden spoon (award)#Rugby union|wooden spoon]], even if they have not suffered a complete whitewash.

===Tennis===
In [[ATP (tennis)|ATP]] and [[WTA (tennis)|WTA]] tennis, the term ''whitewash'' is used when a player fails to win a game in a match (6–0, 6–0, 6–0; or 6–0, 6–0), also called a triple- or double-bagel respectively. Double bagels are more common.

The '''Wilks Coefficient''' or '''Wilks Formula''' is a [[Coefficient | coefficient]] that can be used to measure the strength of a [[powerlifter]] against other powerlifters despite the different weights of the lifters. Robert Wilks, CEO of [[Powerlifting Australia]], is the author of the formula.

==Equation==
The following equation is used to calculate the Wilks Coefficient. The total weight lifted (in kg) is multiplied by the Coefficient to find the standard amount lifted normalised across all body weights.

&lt;math&gt;\textit{Coeff} = \frac{500}{a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + fx^5}&lt;/math&gt;

x is the body weight of the lifter in kilograms

Values for ''men'' are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
a=-216.0475144&lt;br /&gt;
b=16.2606339&lt;br /&gt;
c=-0.002388645&lt;br /&gt;
d=-0.00113732&lt;br /&gt;
e=7.01863E-06&lt;br /&gt;
f=-1.291E-08
&lt;/code&gt;

Values for ''women'' are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
a=594.31747775582&lt;br /&gt;
b=-27.23842536447&lt;br /&gt;
c=0.82112226871&lt;br /&gt;
d=-0.00930733913&lt;br /&gt;
e=4.731582E-05&lt;br /&gt;
f=-9.054E-08
&lt;/code&gt;

==Validity==
One journal article has been written on the topic of Wilks formula validation.&lt;ref name=pmid10613442&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00005768-199912000-00027 |pmid=10613442 |title=Validation of the Wilks powerlifting formula |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1869–75 |year=1999 |last1=Vanderburgh |first1=Paul M |last2=Batterham |first2=Alan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the men's and women's world record holders and the top two performers for each event in the IPF's 1996 and 1997 World Championships (a total of 30 men and 27 women for each lift), it concluded:

* There is no bias for men's or women's bench press and total.
* There is a favorable bias toward intermediate weight class lifters in the women's squat with no bias for men's squat.
* There is a linear unfavorable bias toward heavier men and women in the deadlift.

==Example==
The main function of the Wilks formula is involved in [[Powerlifting]] contests. It is used to identify the best lifters across the different body-weight categories and can also be used to compare male and female lifters as there are formulas for both sexes. First, second and third places on the winner’s podium within their own age, bodyweight and gender classes are awarded to the competitors who lift the most weight respectively. Where two lifters in a class achieve the same combined total lifted weight, the lighter lifter is determined the winner.

The Wilks formula comes into play when comparing and determining overall champions across the different categories. The formula can also be used in team and handicap competitions where the team includes lifters of significantly varying bodyweights. The Wilks formula, like its predecessors (the O'Carroll&lt;ref&gt;O'Carroll. http://usawa.com/tag/ocarroll-formula/&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwartz &lt;ref&gt;Schwartz. http://www-users.med.cornell.edu/~spon/picu/calc/crclsch2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; formulas), was set up to address the imbalances whereby lighter lifters tend to have a greater [[power-to-weight ratio | Power-to-weight ratio]], with lighter lifters tending to lift more weight in relation to their own body-weight. This occurs for a number of reasons relating to simple physics, the nature of the makeup and limitations of the human skeletal and muscular system as well as the shorter leverages of smaller people.&lt;ref&gt;This phenomenon can be seen by looking at the current men's senior world powerlifting records. http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/Records.44.0.html&lt;/ref&gt; Note the totals section and that lighter lifters below 100&amp;nbsp;kg body-weight achieve totals in excess of ten times bodyweight whereas heavier lifters do not. The Wilks system is primarily a handicapping process that provides an adjusted statistical method to compare all lifters of varying classes and groups on an equal standing and makes allowances for the disparities.

According to this setup, a male athlete weighing 320 pounds and lifting a total of 1400 pounds would have a normalised lift weight of 353.0, and a lifter weighing 200 pounds and lifting a total of 1000 pounds would have a normalised lift weight of 288.4. Thus the 320-pound lifter would win this competition. Notably, the lighter lifter is actually stronger for his body-weight, with a total of 5 times his own weight, while the heavier lifter could only manage 4.375 times his own bodyweight. In this way, the ''Wilks Coefficient'' places a greater emphasis on absolute strength, rather than ranking lifters solely based on the relative strength of the lifter compared to body-weight. This creates an even playing field between light and heavyweight lifters—the lighter lifters tend to have a higher relative strength level in comparison to the heavyweight lifters, who tend to have a greater amount of absolute strength.

==Alternatives==
While Wilks coefficient is used in IPF, other federations use other coefficients or they even made one of their own like NASA. Alternatives are Glossbrenner coefficient (WPC), Reshel coefficient (GPC, GPA, WUAP, IRP), Outstanding Lifter (OL) or NASA coefficient (NASA), Schwartz/Malone coefficient and Siff coefficient.

While all coefficients take into account gender and body weight difference there are some that also take into account age difference. For cadet and junior age group Foster coefficient is used and for master age group (40yo and above) McCulloch or Reshel coefficient.
