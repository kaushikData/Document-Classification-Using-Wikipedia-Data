'''Astronomical ceiling decoration''' in its earliest form can be traced to the Tomb of [[Senenmut]]
(Theban tomb no. 353), located at the site of [[Deir el-Bahri]], Egypt. The tomb and the ceiling decorations date back to the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]] (ca. 1473 B.C.).

==Discovery==
The tomb of [[Senemut]] was discovered during the 1925-1927 excavations directed by [[Herbert Winlock]] for the Egyptian Expedition
of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Isis, Vol. 14, No. 2  (Oct., 1930), pp. 301-325&lt;/ref&gt;

The unearthing of the 10x12&amp;nbsp;ft. chamber yielded the two panels of what is now referred to as the Egyptian Celestial Diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 34,  (1997), pp. 143-161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial Diagram==
The [[wikt:Special:Search/celestial|Celestial]] Diagram consisted of a northern and a southern panel which depicted circumpolar constellations in the form of discs; each divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period, lunar cycles, and sacred deities of Egypt. Of the constellations present on the diagram, the only certainly identifiable was Meskhetyu with the [[Big Dipper]] because of the difficulty that arises when an attempt is made to match modern day constellations with the depictions made thousands of years ago by the ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Clagett, Marshall 1995"&gt;Clagett, Marshall. Ancient Egyptian Science. Vol. 2. Philadelphia: American Philos. Soc., 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some of the main figures and stars seen in the diagram are [[Sirius]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Ursa Major]], [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] (may be depicted as hippopotamus with crocodile on its back),
*The four circles on the top right refer to the four months of [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] (inundation) between July and October
*The two circles at the top left and the two below them refer to the season of [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]] (planting season) between November and February
* The four circles on the right refer to the season of [[Season of the Harvest|Shomu]] (harvesting season) between March and June

The map on the southern panel could well reflect a specific conjunction of planets in 1534 BCE around the longitude of Sirius. The four planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Venus are relatively easily recognizable. The planet Mars is not included in the actual grouping and at first sight seems to be missing in the map. However, one explanation is that Mars is represented in the Senenmut map as an empty boat in the west. This may refer to the fact that Mars was retrograde and was not with the other planets (indeed, being in the west in the 1534 BCE conjunction). The reason for the boat being empty is perhaps in this backward movement (a well known phenomenon to the Egyptians) the position of Mars was not considered to be ”concrete”.&lt;ref name="Novakovic, Bojan 2008"&gt;Novakovic, Bojan. Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade, vol. 85, p. 19-23. http://publications.aob.rs/85/pdf/019-023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation for the missing Mars is proposed by Belmonte,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
″...the astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut is a gigantic copy of a papyrus draft of a celestial diagram that would have existed and used to be represented in [[water clock|clepsydrae]] (water clocks, as that of Karnak). Because of the lack of space, when moving the design from a conical to a flat surface, part of the decoration was lost.″&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Belmonte, and M. Shaltout, [https://www.academia.edu/4993866/The_astronomical_ceiling_of_senenmut_a_dream_of_mystery_and_imagination ''The astronomical ceiling of Senenmut: a dream of mystery and imagination''], in ″Lights and shadows in cultural astronomy″ : proceedings of the SEAC 2005: Isili, Sardinia, 28 June to 3 July, edited by Mauro Peppino Zedda and Juan Antonio Belmonte. Published by Associazione Archeofila Sarda, Isili, Italy, 2007., 145-154.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Senenmout-constellations.jpg|thumb|Constellations on the astronomical ceiling of [[Senemut]] Tomb]]
Although the tomb had been unfinished and had sustained damage throughout the centuries, the ceiling yielded new information about astronomy, chronology, mythology, and religion in Egypt because of the incorporation of all these elements as a means of connecting the divine to the mortal world.

[[Egyptian astronomy]] consisted of the identification of the heavenly bodies in the sky and their connection with the deities that were believed to play a role in religious mythology and practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 12, Part 1 (Nov. 1923), pp. 283-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical ceilings bore significant symbolism for the Egyptians as they combined divine religion with more earthly aspects of daily life such as agriculture and labor. The detailed depiction of astronomy and deities illustrates the Egyptians desire to understand the heavens and the attempt to apply that understanding to the gods that they believed influenced all aspects of life.

The assimilation of these elements insured that the Egyptian calendar would differ from the ancient calendars of the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Babylonians]]. Otto Neugebauer suggests that the complexity of Egyptian calendars:
:"represents the peaceful coexistence of different methods of defining time moments and time intervals in different ways on different occasions."&lt;ref&gt;Current Anthropology Vol. 14, No. 4 (Oct. 1973), pp. 389-449&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of astronomical calendars was not limited to ceiling tombs as they appeared on coffin boards, water boards, temples, and various other surfaces and objects.&lt;ref name="Clagett, Marshall 1995"/&gt;

'''Blason populaire''' is an umbrella [[genre]] in the field of [[folkloristics]] used to designate any item of any genre which makes use of [[stereotype]]s, usually, but not always, negative stereotypes, of a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lindahl, John McNamara, John Lindow, eds. Medieval Folklore: A Guide to Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;"These stereotypes are manifested in a wide array of folkloric genres, including proverbs, other traditional sayings, nicknames, jokes, songs, rhymes, and football chants. All share a common function in that they are invoked to highlight positive aspects of the in-group by explicit auto-stereotyping or, alternatively, to identify the negative characteristics of out-groups. The explicit positive stereotyping of an in-group may often implicitly suggest negative characteristics of a rival out-group."&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. 'The Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material'. ''Folklore'' 124, 2 (2013): 157-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''blasons populaires''  nations are homogeneous and have national characteristics.

Items such as [[joke#ethnic jokes|ethnic jokes]] or [[joke#blonde jokes|blonde jokes]] are very common examples of blason populaire.

== ''Blasons Populaires'' in Irish Proverbial Material ==

The Irish proverbial material is almost devoid of any national blasons populaires, with the possible exception of the multi-group international comparison. These comparisons are often manifested in epigrammatic form in European languages, with the most salient and representative stereotypical trait being attributed to the nations involved (what Billig (1995) refers to as ‘banal nationalism’). Enumerative structures, usually tri- or quadripartite formulas, are the favoured apparatus. The syntactic and semantic juxtaposition of negative traits for comparative purposes is then counter-balanced by the positive representation of one nation, usually in final position, most commonly the in-group that invokes the comparison. Below is a nineteenth-century German example (Reinsberg-Düringsfeld 1863, 5) in which there is no apparent in-group.

::''Die Italiener fluchen, Die Franzosen schreien, Die Engländer essen, Die Spanier trotzen, Und die Deutschen betrinken sich.''	
:::( The Italians curse, the French scream, the English eat, the Spanish defy, and the Germans get drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. An Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material’. Folklore 125  (2013): 1&lt;/ref&gt; )

==''Blasons populaires'' in Wallonia and Luxembourg &lt;ref&gt;http://belgique-sud-surnoms-des-habitants.skynetblogs.be/&lt;/ref&gt;==

In [[Wallonia]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Luxembourg]], the concept of "blason populaire" refers to a [[demonym]]-like [[nickname]] of the inhabitants of a village or a city.

''Blasons populaire'' come from the traditional languages ([[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Luxembourgish]]). They are never translated in French, as opposed to the [[demonym]]s which exist in [[French language|French]] and in Walloon, often in two different constructions.

Some, which have lost their pejorative meaning, are now used to name restaurants, theater groups, communal houses, etc. They are also used in [[pseudonym]]s of writers in Walloon.

==''Blasons populaires'' in Picardie and Nord-Pas-de-Calais==

The inhabitants of all villages or cities in these regions have a ''blason populaire'' (in [[Picard language]]: ''surpitchet'').&lt;ref&gt;(in French):  André Accart, ''Les sobriquets des habitants du Pas-de-Calais'', 456  pages, ( 2006 ) {{ISBN|2-915800-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the town of [[Amiens]] the blason is ''chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien'' ('the Eaters of Walnuts of Amiens').  In 1597, Spanish soldiers mounted [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|a surprise attack]]. They were disguised as peasants and put walnuts at the doors of the town. The inhabitants were famished and opened the doors, following which the Spanish soldiers entered the city; with deadly consequences for the inhabitants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24579">'''Bottled water bans''' have been proposed and enacted in several municipalities and campuses around the world, over such concerns as resource wastage, transportation emissions, plastic litter, and damage to affected aquifers.

The small town of [[Bundanoon, New South Wales]] (Australia) enacted such a ban in 2009 and was the first town to do so anywhere.&lt;ref name="usnews.nbcnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/07/13710037-concord-mass-the-first-us-city-to-ban-sale-of-plastic-water-bottles?lite |title=Concord, Mass., the first US city to ban sale of plastic water bottles - U.S. News |publisher=Usnews.nbcnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in Burlington became the first public college to enact such a ban. As of late 2016, 82 high schools, colleges and universities across the world have implemented bottled water bans on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.banthebottle.net/map-of-campaigns/|title=Map of Campaigns {{!}} Ban the Bottle|website=www.banthebottle.net|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities have also banned bottled water from their facilities, such as the city of [[San Francisco]], 
[[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco bans sale of plastic water bottles on city property|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/san-francisco-bans-sale-plastic-water-bottles-climate-change|accessdate=8 August 2014|publisher=MSNBC|date=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
The use of [[plastics]] continues to rise in our daily lives due to its convenience and cheap price. But the cost that is not obvious to many is the [[environmental impact|environmental]] and health impacts they are leaving behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Emily J.|last2=Halden|first2=Rolf U.|date=2013-01-01|title=Plastics and Environmental Health: The Road Ahead|journal=Reviews on environmental health|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1515/reveh-2012-0030|issn=0048-7554|pmc=3791860|pmid=23337043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastics are made from [[fossil fuel]]s. The use of these leaves a large [[ecological footprint]] on the environment, not to mention that this plastics do not break down easily, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/news/dangers-of-plastic|title=The environmental toll of plastics  — Environmental Health News|website=www.environmentalhealthnews.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, a discarded plastic bottle takes 450 years to decompose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/coastal/trash/documents/marine_debris.pdf | title=Approximate Time it Takes for Garbage to Decompose in the Environment | publisher=NH Department of Environmental Services | accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overuse of plastics results in a dumping of plastics into the oceans at a rate of 8 million tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/02/150212-ocean-debris-plastic-garbage-patches-science/|title=New Study Shows Plastic in Oceans Is on the Rise|date=2015-02-13|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilling up of plastics around the world continues to build up and now will facing issues like the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. Scientists now have estimated that at the rate will continue to dump plastics into our oceans, by 2050 there will have more plastic than fish in our oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/01/20/by-2050-there-will-be-more-plastic-than-fish-in-the-worlds-oceans-study-says/|title=By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the world’s oceans, study says|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional to environmental impacts, plastics are known to leave behind chemicals detrimental to human health such as the [[neurotoxin]] [[Bisphenol A]] (also known as BPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/pollution-environment/plastics-environmental-health-literature-review|title=Plastics, human health and environmental impacts: The road ahead - Journalist's Resource|date=2014-10-09|newspaper=Journalist's Resource|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chemicals in plastics have even been linked to [[carcinogen|cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecologycenter.org/factsheets/adverse-health-effects-of-plastics/|title=Adverse Health Effects of Plastics {{!}} Ecology Center|website=ecologycenter.org|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons some governments are interested in banning the use of [[single-use]] [[plastic bottle|plastic]] [[water bottle]]s in their regions to lower these impacts on the environment and promote sustainability within their boundaries.

== Sub-national bans by country ==
=== Australia ===
In 2009, the New South Wales town of [[Bundanoon]] voted to become the first town in the world to outlaw bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/09/2620882.htm|title=Banning the bottle puts Bundy on the map|date=9 July 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its citizens voluntarily chose to ban bottled water in response to a bottling company's desire to sell water from the town's local aquifer,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/world/asia/16iht-water.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=bundanoon&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Small Australian Town Stands Up for the Tap | first=Meraiah | last=Foley | date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDC133FF934A25754C0A96F9C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=BUNDANOON JOURNAL; Ban on Bottled Water, Apparently a First, Puts a Small Town on a Big Stage | first=Meraiah | last=Foley | date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting the selling or dispensing of bottled water within the town precinct.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.bundyontap.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Bundanoon's twelve stores and cafe's as well as events in the town, have removed bottled water from their stock. The town now offers public drinking fountains and filtered water dispensers where people can fill up reusable water bottles and canteens. The reusable empty bottles are sold in place of full bottles in the local stores. The town's ban received media attention from major news outlets.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/09/australian-bottled-water-ban|title=Australian town bans bottled water|last=|first=|date=2009-07-09|work=|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to ban bottled water was partly due to opposition to a proposed water extraction plant, and partly to concern related to the environmental and health impacts.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Canada===
Many Canadian municipalities have passed bans on municipal properties including: [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]]; [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.burlingtongreen.org/resources/eco-topics/water/say-no-to-bottled-water | title=Say NO to Bottled Water | publisher=BurlingtonGreen | date=2010 | accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]], [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], [[Oshawa]], [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], [[St. Catharines]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Vancouver]]. These were followed in December 2008, by [[Toronto]], Canada's most populous city. The [[Toronto City Council]] approved a water bottle ban to take effect in January 2012. The ban, which affects most of Toronto's parks and park facilities, prohibits the sale and distribution of water bottles in all Civic Centres, City facilities and parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto's Water Bottle Ban|url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=6740dada600f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=9e5adada600f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD|publisher=City of Toronto|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2011, New Haven passed a municipal spending ban including bulk bottled water dispensers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacMillan|first1=Thomas|title=Bottled Water Is Back|url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/bottled_water_is_back/#c144016|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=New Haven Independent|date=Dec 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Town Meeting of May, 2015, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] passed a by-law prohibiting the spending of Town funds on water in single-use plastic bottles in offices. It will be considering further restrictions based on San Francisco's ordinance. The Town also instituted a requirement that restaurants serve tap water on request including take-out orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ishkanian|first1=Ellen|title=Brookline votes to require restaurants to offer tap water|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/west/2015/05/29/brookline-votes-require-restaurants-offer-tap-water/qyiqTvseJmbyR4UAZ1gHnO/story.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=The Boston Globe|date=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom released an executive directive to phase out the usage of water bottles in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="San Fran's Bottled Water Ban"|journal=Environmental Magazine|volume=|last1=Query|first1=Shawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive for San Francisco had strict consequences.

To maintain easy access to water for its citizens, the City of San Francisco plans on implementing a [http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=447 Drink Tap Program] which will install outdoor water bottle refilling stations to ensure the public stays hydrated.

==== Concord, Massachusetts ====
Legislation banning the sale of single-serving plastic water bottles passed in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] on April 26, 2012, making Concord the first village in the nation to ban single-serving plastic bottles.  The passage was largely due to the efforts of 84-year-old Jean Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/metro-west/12007312836285/concord-approves-bottle-ban-by-narrow-vote/ |title=Concord approves bottle ban by narrow vote - Boston News, New England News, WHDH-TV 7NEWS WHDH.COM |publisher=.whdh.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330214005/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/metro-west/12007312836285/concord-approves-bottle-ban-by-narrow-vote/ |archivedate=2013-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban took effect on January 1, 2013. Two previous attempts to ban bottled water in the town had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/04/massachusett-town-bans-plastic-water-bottles/ |title=Massachusetts Town Bans Plastic Water Bottles &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Newsfeed.time.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottles, which have the number 1 and/or PETE with the recycling symbol on the bottle are no longer allowed to be sold if they are less than or equal to 1 liter (34 ounces) and contain water which is non-sparkling and non-flavored.  The sale of water in bottles made of other [[List of synthetic polymers|types of plastic]] is allowed. Bottles of flavored water, regardless of size, may be sold. The sale of cases of small (&lt;1 liter) bottles of water is prohibited. Bottled water less than or equal to 1 liter in volume may not be sold in vending machines. Bottled water less than or equal to 1 liter in volume may not be sold at civic events including but not limited to sports events, road races, festivals, theater performances and catered events. Water may be offered for free to patrons in any form.&lt;ref name="concordma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordma.gov/pages/ConcordMA_TownClerk/FAQ%20Water%20Bottle%20Bylaw.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325130243/http://www.concordma.gov/pages/ConcordMA_TownClerk/FAQ%20Water%20Bottle%20Bylaw.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 the Health Division of the Town Manager’s Office of the Town of Concord began inspections of retail stores, restaurants, and other venues that sell bottled beverages. The Health Division is tasked with ensuring compliance with the bylaw against bottled water sales under 1 liter. If bottled water less than 1 liter is being sold, a written warning is issued. Within one week a re-inspection will occur; if this is failed, a $25 fine is issued as a non-criminal citation. On the third and subsequent inspections, a non-criminal citation with a fine of $50 is issued if bottled water continues to be sold in violation of the bylaw.&lt;ref name="concordma" /&gt;

There is controversy over this act. The [[International Bottled Water Association]] issued a press release stating that: “This ban deprives residents of the option to choose their choice of beverage and visitors, who come to this birthplace of American independence, a basic freedom gifted to them by the actions in this town more than 200 years ago.  It will also deprive the town of needed tax revenue and harm local businesses that rely on bottled water sales.”&lt;ref name="IBWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottledwater.org/ibwa-statement-regarding-massachusetts-attorney-general-upholding-town-concord%E2%80%99s-ban-sale-bottled |title=Concord, Massachusetts Becomes First American City to Ban Plastic Water Bottles - ICTMN.com  |date=September 5, 2012  |accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IBWA reinforced this statement in response to the proposed ban on bottled water in the city of San Francisco. It added that restricting access to bottled water will lead consumers to opt for unhealthier bottled options that may involve, “more packaging, more additives (e.g., sugar, caffeine), and greater environmental impacts than bottled water.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bottledwater.org/proposed-bottled-water-ban-not-best-interest-san-franciscans|title=Proposed Bottled Water Ban Not in the Best Interest of San Franciscans  {{!}} IBWA {{!}} Bottled Water|website=www.bottledwater.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some businesses oppose the ban, saying it restricts freedom of choice and will simply drive bottled water sales out of town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/01/01/mass-town-plastic-bottle-ban-effect/0pF9lZwXphfZaMAkyqKU1K/story.html |title=Mass. town's plastic bottle ban in effect |publisher=Boston.com |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other towns near Concord have explored similar bans. Some residents of the Town of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]] brought one to its Spring [[Town Meeting]] of 2013, but it was defeated in a voice vote.

A high-school student proposed a ban by-law at the Fall 2014 Town Meeting in [[Framingham]], where it was defeated by a vote of 60 to 40.&lt;ref name="mwdn"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Daily News Staff|title=Framingham Town Meeting rejects water bottle ban|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/article/20141022/News/141028424|accessdate=10 December 2014|work=Metro West Daily News|issue=Oct. 22, 2014|publisher=Gatehouse Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those opposing the ban in both communities was the supermarket chain [[Stop &amp; Shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brock|first1=Parker|title=Arlington Town Meeting defeats bottle ban, softens leaf blower restrictions|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/04/27/arlington-town-meeting-defeats-bottle-ban-softens-leaf-blower-restrictions/T87rOyDWSAXTqTdSeLnIfI/story.html|accessdate=21 August 2014|work=The Boston Globe|date=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Framingham also has a [[Poland Spring]] bottling plant, and its owner [[Nestlé Waters North America]] opposed the ban as well.&lt;ref name="mwdn"/&gt;

Two towns that border Concord have passed bottled water bans similar to Concord's by-law: Sudbury on May 2, 2017; and Lincoln in March, 2018.

===India===
In 2015, the state of Bihar has banned the usage of plastic water bottles in governmental meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/bihar-bans-plastic-packaged-water-bottles-48475|title=Bihar bans plastic packaged water bottles|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the state of Sikkim restricted the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) along with styrofoam products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sikenvis.nic.in/ViewGeneralLatestNews.aspx?Id=4964&amp;Year=2016|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] scheme, the [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] asked all central governmental departments to avoid the usage of plastic bottles to provide drinking water during governmental meetings, and instead to providing drinking water in a way that does not produce [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://himachal.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/17_l892s/Circular_WATER%20BOTTLED-21798821.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbsslup.in/assets/uploads/clinks/circular160607_-2.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoiding the use of bottled water during meetings, conferences, workshops, etc. |url=http://aghp.cag.gov.in/pag/sites/pag/files/Avoiding%20use%20of%20bottled%20water%20during%20meetings,%20conferences%20etc..pdf|publisher= Government of India, Indian Audis and Accounts Department | accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government of Maharashtra banned all single-use plastic beverage bottles in March 2018. Single-use is defined there as under one-half liter. Larger sizes have a refundable fee applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-mahrashtra-extends-plastic-ban-to-sale-and-manufacture-of-pet-bottles/articleshow/63446507.cms|title=Mumbai: Maharashtra extends plastic ban to sale and manufacture of PET bottles - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== University bans ==
Despite being the first American public university to enact a ban on bottled water in 2013, the University of Vermont has not yet experienced much positive effect from the implemented ban. University professor Rachel Johnson has seen, “total number of bottles on campus increase.” In conjunction with the ban, UVM integrated a number of filtered water stations across campus. However, the consumption of other bottled beverages such as soda and juices has become more prevalent. The university continues its efforts by, “doubling the number of water stations on campus and stocking them with biodegradable cups.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/plastic-water-bottle-ban-leads-to-unexpected-results/|title=Plastic water bottle ban leads to unexpected results|date=2015-10-16|newspaper=Grist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the University of Vermont, overall bottled beverage sales have decreased by more than a third over the past seven years at Washington University in St. Louis. Since eliminating the sales of bottled water on campus, the university has also seen a decrease in soda fountain sales, which leads observers to believe that water is not necessarily being replaced by sugary beverage alternatives. The assistant vice chancellor for sustainability largely attributes the university’s success to its bottled water ban, as well as its accompanying efforts to retrofit old water fountains, add new water stations on campus, and celebrate the student body’s growing interest in sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://source.wustl.edu/2016/04/water-bottle-ban-success-bottled-beverage-sales-plummeted/|title=Water bottle ban a success; bottled beverage sales have plummeted {{!}} The Source {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|date=2016-04-20|newspaper=The Source|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Alternatives to plastic bottles ==
Some alternatives to [[plastic bottle]]s are already available and many more are to be designed. For example, a simple solution to this is to use a reusable bottle and fill it up at stations, water fountains, or food establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenlivingonline.com/article/get-rid-plastic-water-bottles|title=Get rid of plastic water bottles {{!}} Food {{!}} Green Living|website=www.greenlivingonline.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, other products exist that provide the single use water alternative in a container with a less ecological impact. Examples of this are Green Sheep Water, which uses a 100% recyclable aluminum bottle and gets recycled more often than any other packaging&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greensheepwater.com|title=Green Sheep Water {{!}} Home|website=www.greensheepwater.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Boxed Water" which is sold in a single use carton and is transported more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxedwaterisbetter.com|title=Boxed Water {{!}} Home|website=www.boxedwaterisbetter.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future looks promising as some signs of better alternatives to plastics are emerging. A group of students has managed to created a biodegradable plastic bottle from algae and other natural materials. The implementation and use of a product like this could take a big cut in the use of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nextshark.com/ari-jonsson-biodegradable-water-bottle/|title=Design Student Invents Genius Biodegradable Alternative to Plastic Water Bottles|website=nextshark.com|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6593">'''Charles Budderick "Buddy" Cole''' is a [[fictional character]] created and portrayed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[actor]]-[[comedian]] [[Scott Thompson (comedian)|Scott Thompson]]. He is an [[effeminacy|effeminate]], [[homosexuality|gay]] [[socialite]],&lt;ref name=boyculture&gt;Shirley R. Steinberg, Michael Kehler and Lindsay Cornish, ''Boy Culture: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1''. [[ABC-CLIO]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35081-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; made famous on ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'', a popular [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[sketch comedy]] series and troupe of the same name. The character also had a recurring role in ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.&lt;ref name=colbert&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/buddy-cole-russia-anti-gay_n_4767587.html?ir=Entertainment "Buddy Cole Learns About Russia's Anti-Gay Laws, Prepares To Visit Sochi For 'The Colbert Report'"]. ''[[Huffington Post]]'', February 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality ==
Buddy has a penchant for going on long, comedic rants about his personal life and the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name=boyculture /&gt; He also frequently drops celebrity names, insinuating that he has many close friendships with the rich and famous. A series of ''The Kids in the Hall'' sketches portrayed his deeply personal relationship with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (also played by Thompson).

During the second season of ''The Kids in the Hall'', Buddy began to star in more action-packed sketches. In the first such appearance, he becomes the substitute coach of a [[lesbian]] softball team. From there on, his adventures became more outrageous and surreal, from accidentally murdering a [[drag queen]] (while on a bad [[acid trip]]) to purchasing his very own male slave in the 1950s. Still, for the most part, Buddy delivers monologues from his [[gay bar]], ''Buddy's'', which he purchased with money saved during a brief stint of not smoking cigarettes.

In the series' final episode, he is one in a handful of characters to get something of a resolution: Having lost his bar in a game of strip poker (he refused to remove his shirt having just put on ten pounds), he burns it down in order to win back his old boyfriend - "a [[firefighter]] from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]". Also in the last sketch is a childhood photo of [[Kurt Cobain]] (an acquaintance of Thompson's), sitting on the bar as it burns down.

Thompson has described Buddy as a "[[Butch and femme|butch]] queen" and an "alpha [[faggot (slang)|fag]]", pointing out that while extremely effeminate, Buddy is also very forceful and strong willed. Thompson, who is openly gay, has always directly confronted charges that Buddy is a [[homophobia|homophobic]] stereotype. "The whole idea of Buddy Cole being considered a terrible stereotype and a terrible throwback is, I think, just tragic," he told ''[[Orlando Weekly]]'' in 2000. "I mean, most gay men are more Buddy than Sly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Manes |first=Billy |date=11 April 2000 |title=Hall Monitor |url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/hall-monitor/Content?oid=2262750 |newspaper=Orlando Weekly |access-date=7 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Chalet 2000" episode of ''The Kids in the Hall'', a full-length adventure starring Buddy and friends, Buddy is the nephew of comedian [[Rip Taylor]].

== 1995–present ==
Following the conclusion of the television series in 1995, Buddy Cole made regular appearances in Scott Thompson's one-man stage show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/peninsula/ci_18896965 "Two 'Kids in the Hall' take a shot at stand-up"]. ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, Buddy has been one of many characters revived for The Kids in the Hall reunion tours. He did not, however, appear in ''[[The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town]]''.

In 1998, Thompson co-authored the book ''Buddy Babylon: The Autobiography of Buddy Cole'' with [[Paul Bellini]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2011/03/scott_thompson_goes_straight_with_new_comic/ "Scott Thompson Goes Straight With New Comic"]. ''[[Torontoist]]'', March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006, [[Breakthrough Entertainment]], the producers of the series ''[[Atomic Betty]]'' and ''[[Paradise Falls]]'', announced that an [[animation|animated]] comedy series based on the character was in development.&lt;ref name=breakthrough&gt;[http://www.c21media.net/breakthrough-for-gay-sitcom-toon/ "Breakthrough for gay sitcom toon"]. C21 Media, April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Buddy's'' was expected to air on [[CBC Television]] and the [[United States|American]] LGBT channel [[Here!]].&lt;ref name=breakthrough /&gt; However, in a February 1, 2007 interview on ''[[Tom Green Live]]'', Thompson announced that the series was no longer in development. No reason for the dissolution of the show was given, but Thompson did say that Buddy Cole now had his own [[blog]] instead, written and updated by Thompson himself.

On January 13, 2008, Thompson posted a video blog as Cole. However, it was also his last; as announced in the video (titled "Adieu to EWE"), Cole simply didn't have enough time to blog.

On February 10, 2014, Thompson began a stint on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' as Buddy Cole, Colbert's longtime producer and former theater camp colleague and the program's correspondent to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]. His coverage focused on Russia's anti-gay laws, including interviewing openly gay Ambassador [[Daniel Baer]] of [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].&lt;ref name=colbert/&gt;

In 2018, Thompson toured the stage show ''Après Le Déluge: The Buddy Cole Monologues'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/wednesday-may-23-2018-scott-thompson-yukon-blonde-and-more-1.4673091/kids-in-the-hall-s-scott-thompson-on-reprising-his-role-as-buddy-cole-1.4673101 "Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson on reprising his role as Buddy Cole"]. ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', May 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and released a new reprint of ''Buddy Babylon''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/03/31/scott-thompson-on-buddy-cole-and-the-plight-of-the-queer-comic/ "Scott Thompson on Buddy Cole and the Plight of the Queer Comic"].

The {{nihongo|'''''Butsuzōzui'''''|仏像図彙|}} ("Illustrated Compendium of Buddhist Images") is a collection of [[Buddhist iconography|Buddhist iconographic]] sketches. Originally published in 1690, it comprises more than 800 sketches, inspired by the Chinese style of paintings called Paihuo, with the Buddhist icons divided into five parts and further categorized.  In [[Edo period|Edo-period]] Japan the Butsuzōzui compendium was the most widely distributed source for information on [[Buddhism_in_Japan|Buddhist]] and [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|Shinbutsu]] deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fowler|first1=Sherry|title=Japan-Studies.org/Butsuzōzui.html|url=http://www.japan-studies.org/Butsuz%C5%8Dzui.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chinese History: A New Manual''''' ({{zh|t=中國歷史新手册|p=Zhōngguó lìshǐ xīn shǒucè}}), written by [[Endymion Wilkinson]], is an encyclopedic guide to [[Sinology]] and [[Chinese history]]. The New Manual lists and describes published, excavated, artifactual, and archival sources from pre-history to the twenty-first century, as well as selected up-to-date scholarship in Chinese, Japanese, and Western languages. Detailed annotations evaluate reference and research tools and outline the 25 ancillary disciplines required for the study of Chinese history. Introductions to each of the 76 chapters and interspersed short essays give encyclopedic and often witty summaries of major topics for specialists and general readers, as well as directives on the uses of history and avoidance of error in thought and analysis. The ''New Manual'' received the [[Prix Stanislas Julien]] for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanislas Julien prize has been awarded annually by the French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (founded Paris, 1663) in recognition of outstanding scholarship on Asian culture. In all 120 people and two institutions have received the prize since it was inaugurated in 1875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its first appearance in a preliminary version in 1973, Wilkinson’s manual has been continuously in print (selling on average 700 copies a year). During this time it has grown from 70,000 words to its current size of 1,302 pages and over 1.6 million words (the equivalent of twelve monographs of 400 pages apiece).

The author has kept it up to date by issuing numerous revised editions, each enlarging its scope. But perhaps a more fundamental reason for its continued success (to judge from readers’ comments on Amazon.com) is that the manual has established itself as more than an exercise in ''[[Quellenkritik]]'' (source criticism) by posing original questions and summarizing issues.

==Background==
In an interview with Carla Nappi, an historian of China at the [[University of British Columbia]], Wilkinson discussed his experience in the field and the book's background. He became interested in China as an undergraduate at [[Cambridge University]] in the early 1960s, then spent two years teaching English in [[Beijing]] up to the outbreak of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He earned a PhD from [[Princeton University]] with a dissertation on late [[Qing dynasty]] markets and prices, but when he began teaching he still felt unprepared. He did not know, he recalled,  what to tell his graduate students about the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] or [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] dynasties, about which he felt his knowledge would hardly "fill an eye bath." On a research fellowship at [[Harvard University]], Wilkinson mentioned to [[John Fairbank]], a senior Harvard scholar, that he was gathering notes on Chinese history. Fairbank offered to publish them, and the 1973 ''Research Guide'' appeared in due course.&lt;ref name="Nappi" &gt;Carla Nappi, [http://newbooksineastasianstudies.com/2013/03/08/endymion-wilkinson-chinese-history-a-new-manual-harvard-university-asia-center-2012/ New Books in East Asian Studies] University of British Columbia, March 8, 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkinson served in Beijing as the [[European Union]] Ambassador to China from 1994 to 2001, and in his spare moments turned the 1973 ''Research Guide'' into the first and second editions of the manual. After he retired from the EU in 2001, Harvard invited him to teach Chinese history, including a graduate seminar on sinological methods. From then on he worked on the ''New Manual'', commuting between Harvard and Peking University (where he was a visiting professor). In this way he was able to make full use of the [[Harvard-Yenching Library]] as well as all the scholarly resources that Beijing has to offer.&lt;ref name="Nappi" /&gt;

The preliminary version of the manual (1973) was published by Harvard's East Asia Research Center. From 1998 until 2015 all editions were published by the [[Harvard University Asia Center]] for the [[Harvard-Yenching Institute]] and distributed by [[Harvard University Press]]. The fourth edition was also published in Chinese and sold 11,500 copies in the first year (2016-2017). Starting with the Fifth edition (2018), Wilkinson decided as an experiment in lowering the sales price of the English edition to publish it himself and distribute it exclusively on Amazon. The fifth edition was also published digitally (on the [[Pleco Software|
Pleco platform]], in November 2017).

==The Fifth edition (2018)==
[[File:Front cover of book, Chinese history, A new manual, 5th edition.png|thumb|left|100px|2018]]

The author explains in the Preface the principal aims of the Fifth edition as being to introduce:

1. The different types of transmitted, excavated, archival, artifactual, and ecofactual primary sources from prehistory to 1949 (and in some cases to the present). Accordingly, it examines the context in which these sources were produced, preserved, and received, as well as the problems of research and interpretation associated with them;

2. The ancillary disciplines required for the study of Chinese history from prehistory to 1949 (and in many cases up to the present), including archeology, astronomy, bibliography, chronology and calendrics, [[codicology]], diplomatics, [[epigraphy]], genealogy, historical geography, historical linguistics, numismatics, [[onomastics]], paleography, [[prosopography]], [[sigillography]], statistics, textual criticism, topography, transcription, translation strategies, and special branches of study such as oracle-bone script, bamboo and silk books, [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang]], Qingshuijiang, and Huizhou documents or the Ming-Qing archives;

3. The key secondary sources on questions of current focus and controversy in Chinese historical studies;

4. The latest electronic resources to disseminate, sort, and analyze Chinese historical data.

In addition to the four principal aims, the Fifth edition also has five subsidiary objectives (5–9), the ninth of which has not featured in previously editions:

5. To provide a sense of change over time and therefore to avoid anachronistic, ahistorical interpretations of China’s past. This is easily done because the scope of the ''New Manual'' is the whole sweep of Chinese recorded history, in the course of which long-term changes are readily apparent.

6. To supply readers who are familiar with one period a springboard into others with which they are less familiar.

7. To profile the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese historiographical traditions because (i) of the central role that the writing of history played (and continues to play) in Chinese politics and culture and (ii) to a greater extent than is commonly realized, historians rely on works produced in the old historiographical traditions, even though they may ask different questions and use different conceptual frameworks.

8. To provide English translations of key Chinese terms.

9. To illustrate the instinct of Chinese publishers to censor anything they think might contradict the official Party line on Chinese history. This is achieved by underlining in green some 30 or so examples of censorship in the Chinese translation of the manual published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese-language edition was published by Peking University Press in a boxed set of three volumes under the title ''Zhōngguó lìshǐ yánjiū shǒucè'' 中國歷史研究手册 and widely reviewed, for example by Shàn Yǐngwén 单颖文 who wrote a long profile of the author and the book in ''Wenhui Xueren'' 文汇学人 (''Wenhuibao'' 文汇报), Shanghai, 2017/3/10, pp. 2-8；http://wenhui.news365.com.cn/html/2017-03/10/content_532662.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the censored passages (and no attempt was made to show them all) are in one of four categories: (i) anything that might indicate that top CCP leaders are less than infallibly correct at all times. For example, in a discussion of political slogans Wilkinson mentions that during a meeting with [[Li Xiannian]] in 1979, the Vice Premier underlined the importance of the [[Four Modernizations]] but was unable to recall more than the first three (page 302). The paragraphs recounting this episode have been erased. Equally unacceptable to the censor were comparisons of CCP-era practices with rituals and procedures characteristic of imperial China. For example, in a discussion of flattering imperial honorific titles (''zunhao'' 尊號) bestowed upon China’s emperors during their lifetimes, the author remarked that “''zunhao''” (in scare quotes) reappeared with the personality cult of Mao Zedong at the start of the Cultural Revolution (his was 20 characters long: 伟大的导师, 伟大的领袖, 伟大的统帅, 伟大的舵手(Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Commander, Great Helmsman). The paragraph was scrubbed (page 288); (2) anything touching border issues even if this meant deleting a passage from a historical source that contradicts the current CCP line while retaining a passage from the same source that supports it (page 203). Even the author's correct observation that the ''[[History of Ming|History of the Ming]]'' (1745), the official history of the dynasty, places Taiwan in the section reserved for foreign countries was deleted (page 953); (3) anything showing Chinese people making fun of propaganda slogans (page 302); (4) any statistical estimate that differs from official statistics on sensitive issues was simply suppressed. For example, the number of people who died of starvation during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] (page 542).{{sfnb|Wilkinson|2018|p= xv-xvi}}

===Content &amp; Structure===
The Fifth edition updates, expands, and corrects the fourth edition (2015). Some 12,000 primary and secondary sources, reference works, journals, book chapters, journal articles, and 246 databases are introduced in the course of the discussion (compared to 9,800 in the fourth edition; 8,800 in the third edition; 4,000 in the second edition (2000); and 2,900 in the first edition (1998). Of the 12,000 resources roughly one-third are primary sources (almost all Chinese) and two-thirds secondary sources (mainly monographs in Chinese and English, about equally divided between the two, and over 800 works in Japanese and other languages). Roughly 1,500 scholarly articles and book chapters are cited (mostly in English but also in Chinese, Japanese and other languages). A few hundred book reviews that make a substantial contribution are noted.{{sfnb|Wilkinson|2018|p= xv}}

Even while updating the content and presentation of the Fifth edition Wilkinson thought it wise to facilitate navigation (for readers of previous editions) by maintaining the basic structure of the manual which as before comprises 14 book-length parts subdivided into a total of 76 chapters. In other words, it is a case of new wine in old bottles. Books 1–9 present the sources by subject: (1) Language; (2) People; (3) Geography and the Environment; (4) Governing and Educating; (5) Ideas and Beliefs, Literature, and the Fine Arts; (6) Agriculture, Food, and Drink; (7) Technology and Science; (8) Trade; and (9) Historiography. Books 10–12 present pre-history and the sources chronologically by dynasty or group of dynasties (sources for the first half of the twentieth century are in book 13). Book 14 is on the history of the book in China and historical bibliography.{{sfnb|Wilkinson|2018|p= xvi}}

===Boxes &amp; Tables===
The main text of the manual is interspersed with 125 boxes (each providing further details on specific topics) and 152 tables (mainly consisting of lists or statistical data). Boxed topics range from ''guanhua'' jokes to the influence of images of the Buddha on the depiction of Confucius; from the board game ''Struggling to advance in officialdom'' to the speed of Chinese armies and fleets; from the connections between height and power to marching in step; from tomes in tombs to tomb robbers; from why women would have spoken with much thicker dialect accents than their brothers, to an analysis of duplicate biographies in the ''Histories.'' One series of boxes takes on the origins, history, and nature of [[Chinese characters]]. Another series gives a rundown on social history, such as coming of age and age at death. The tables include obvious data such as the dynasties of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam or the contents of major sources or reference works but also less obvious subjects from statistical analyses of the gender breakdown in the first four ''Histories'' or the amount of repetition in the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' to tables of extremely large and extremely small numbers; from ancient zodiacs to phases of the moon; from nautical units of measure to details of promulgated and actual weights and measures in different periods; from changes in book classification schemes (Han dynasty to the present) to changes in personal naming systems from the Zhou dynasty to the present; from the lexical influence of textiles to the size of steppe armies.

===Changes in Typography===
Overall the changes to the Fifth edition were so extensive (amounting to 130 pages of new material) that the manual had to be redesigned. The decision was made easier because one of the criticisms (especially from older readers) was that the light-weight typefaces used in previous English editions were difficult to read. Accordingly, three changes were made to the design of the Fifth edition: (1) light-weight fonts have been replaced with regular-weight fonts; (2) the main text is distinguished from bibliographic entries by using a serif font for the former and a non-serif for the latter; and (3) highlighting has been introduced: for example, boxes, are shaded in legal-pad yellow; tables in pale blue; and examples of passages censored in the Chinese translation of the manual are underlined in green.

===Reception===

'''Fifth edition:''' "Updated throughout with more than 100 pages of new material and reset in easily readable fonts, the Fifth Edition of Wilkinson’s Manual is the indispensable guide for Sinologists of all stripes. A monumental achievement!" Victor H. Mair (Professor of Chinese Language and Literature, University of Pennsylvania) quoted on the back cover of the Fifth edition (2018).

"A magnificent achievement; the most valuable English-language reference book on China anywhere." Richard H. Smith (Professor Emeritus of History, Rice University) quoted on the back cover of the Fifth edition (2018)

'''Fourth edition:''' "For any student of China (and at every level), ''Chinese History: A New Manual'' is not only a masterful scholarly endeavor, it is also (happily) a real page turner indeed, with captivating insights on every page."&lt;ref name="Croddy" &gt;Eric Croddy, [https://www.amazon.com/Chinese-History-Harvard-Yenching-Institute-Monograph/dp/0674088468/ref=asap_bc?] Amazon.com access date = August 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third edition:''' Professor Nappi judged the ''New Manual'' (2012), “in every way, absolutely indispensable to work in Chinese history”&lt;ref name="Nappi" /&gt; and journalist and China scholar, [[Jonathan Mirsky]] reviewing it in the [[New York Review of Books]] judged it to be "A mighty book...magnificent."{{sfnb|Mirsky|2013}}

In [[natural theology]] and [[philosophy]], a '''cosmological argument''' is an [[argument]] in which the existence of a unique being, generally seen as some kind of [[god]], is [[deductive reasoning|deduced]] or [[inductive reasoning|inferred]] from facts or alleged facts concerning causation, change, motion, contingency, or finitude in respect of the [[universe]] as a whole or processes within it.&lt;ref name=reichenbach&gt;{{cite web |last=Reichenbach |first=Bruce |title=Cosmological Argument |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2006 Edition, Edward N.

Whichever term is employed, there are three basic variants of the argument, each with subtle yet important distinctions: the arguments from [[Causality|''in causa'' (causality)]], [[Essence|''in esse'' (essentiality)]], and [[Becoming (philosophy)|''in fieri'' (becoming)]].

The basic premises of all of these are the concept of [[causality]]. The conclusion of these arguments is [[first cause]], subsequently deemed to be [[God]]. The history of this argument goes back to [[Aristotle]] or earlier, was developed in [[Neoplatonism]] and [[early Christianity]] and later in medieval [[Islamic theology]] during the 9th to 12th centuries, and re-introduced to medieval Christian theology in the 13th century by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The cosmological argument is closely related to the [[principle of sufficient reason]] as addressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Samuel Clarke]], itself a modern exposition of the claim that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]" attributed to [[Parmenides]].

[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed first cause arguments.]]

[[Plato]] (c. 427–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (c. 384–322 BC) both posited first cause arguments, though each had certain notable caveats.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, WL., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qbFKAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=plato+cosmological+argument&amp;q=%22chapter+1%22+natural#v=snippet&amp;q=%22chapter%201%22%20natural&amp;f=false ''The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz''], Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2001, pp. 1-5, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Laws]]'' (Book X), Plato posited that all movement in the world and the [[Cosmos]] was "imparted motion". This required a "self-originated motion" to set it in motion and to maintain it. In ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato posited a "demiurge" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the Cosmos.

Aristotle argued ''against'' the idea of a first cause, often confused with the idea of a "[[Primum movens|prime mover]]" or "[[unmoved mover]]" ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον κινοῦν ἀκίνητον}} or ''primus motor'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' VIII, 4–6; ''Metaphysics'' XII, 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argued in ''favor'' of the idea of several unmoved movers, one powering each [[celestial sphere]], which he believed lived beyond the sphere of the fixed stars, and explained why motion in the universe (which he believed was eternal) had continued for an infinite period of time. Aristotle argued the [[atomism|atomist's]] assertion of a non-eternal universe would require a [[first uncaused cause]] — in his terminology, an [[four causes|efficient]] first cause — an idea he considered a non-sensical flaw in the reasoning of the atomists.

Like Plato, Aristotle believed in an eternal [[cosmos]] with no beginning and no end (which in turn follows [[Parmenides]]' famous statement that "[[nothing comes from nothing]]"). In what he called "first philosophy" or metaphysics, Aristotle ''did'' intend a theological correspondence between the prime mover and deity (presumably [[Zeus]]); functionally, however, he provided an explanation for the apparent motion of the "[[fixed stars]]" (now understood as the daily rotation of the Earth). According to his theses, immaterial unmoved movers are eternal unchangeable beings that constantly think about thinking, but being immaterial, they're incapable of interacting with the cosmos and have no knowledge of what transpires therein. From an "aspiration or desire",&lt;ref&gt;"Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God", in ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967), Vol. 2, p233 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[celestial spheres]], ''imitate'' that purely intellectual activity as best they can, by [[uniform circular motion]]. The unmoved movers ''inspiring'' the [[classical planets|planetary]] spheres are no different in kind from the prime mover, they merely suffer a dependency of relation to the prime mover. Correspondingly, the motions of the planets are subordinate to the motion inspired by the prime mover in the sphere of fixed stars. Aristotle's natural theology admitted no creation or capriciousness from the immortal [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], but maintained a defense against dangerous charges of impiety.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Plotinus]], a third-century Platonist, taught that the One transcendent absolute caused the universe to exist simply as a consequence of its existence (''creatio ex deo''). His disciple Proclus stated "The One is God".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Centuries later, the [[Islamic]] [[philosopher]] [[Avicenna]] (c. 980–1037) inquired into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence could not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves could not originate and interact with the movement of the Universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Thus, he reasoned that existence must be due to an [[Causality|agent cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must coexist with its effect and be an existing thing.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Duncan writes that "it was first formulated by a Greek-speaking Syriac Christian neo-Platonist, [[John Philoponus]]," who claims to find a contradiction between the Greek pagan insistence on the eternity of the world and the Aristotelian rejection of the existence of any actual infinite." Referring to the argument as the "'[[Kalam]]' cosmological argument", Duncan asserts that it "received its fullest articulation at the hands of [medieval] Muslim and Jewish exponents of ''Kalam'' ("the use of reason by believers to justify the basic metaphysical presuppositions of the faith)."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, S., ''Analytic philosophy of religion: its history since 1955'', Humanities-Ebooks, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225–1274) adapted and enhanced the argument he found in his reading of Aristotle and Avicenna to form one of the most influential versions of the cosmological argument.&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott David Foutz, [http://www.quodlibet.net/aqu5ways.shtml An Examination of Thomas Aquinas' Cosmological Arguments as found in the Five Ways], ''Quodlibet Online Journal of Christian Theology and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of First Cause was the idea that the Universe must be caused by something that is itself uncaused, which he claimed is that which we call God:    "The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/FP/FP002.html#FPQ2A3THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|author=|date=|website=www.dhspriory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 {{dubious|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--this is just a repetition of Aristotle's concept. Aquinas was more specific and more subtle than that.--&gt; Importantly, Aquinas' Five Ways, given the second question of his Summa Theologica, are not the entirety of Aquinas' demonstration that the Christian God exists. The Five Ways form only the beginning of Aquinas' Treatise on the Divine Nature.

== Versions of the argument ==

=== Argument from contingency ===

In the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] era, [[Aquinas]] formulated the "argument from [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]", following [[Aristotle]] in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists.{{dubious|date=May 2017}}&lt;!-- Aristotle did not believe in a first cause; is this a misreading? --&gt; Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably ''not'' exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause – not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by [[INUS|necessity]] (something that ''must'' exist in order for anything else to exist).&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I :'' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an [[Primum movens|uncaused cause]],&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas was an ardent student of Aristotle's works, a significant number of which had only recently been translated into Latin by [[William of Moerbeke]] .&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas further said: "...and this we understand to be God."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologiae, I : '' 2,3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas's argument from contingency allows for the possibility of a Universe that has no beginning in time. It is a form of argument from universal [[Causality|causation]]. Aquinas observed that, in nature, there were things with contingent existences. Since it is possible for such things not to exist, there must be some time at which these things did not in fact exist. Thus, according to Aquinas, there must have been a time when nothing existed. If this is so, there would exist nothing that could bring anything into existence. Contingent beings, therefore, are insufficient to account for the existence of contingent beings: there must exist a ''[[INUS|necessary]]'' being whose non-existence is an impossibility, and from which the existence of all contingent beings is derived.

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument with his [[principle of sufficient reason]] in 1714. "There can be found no fact that is true or existent, or any true proposition," he wrote, "without there being a sufficient reason for its being so and not otherwise, although we cannot know these reasons in most cases." He formulated the cosmological argument succinctly: "Why is there something rather than nothing?  The sufficient reason [...] is found in a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Monadologie'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press. [http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/leibmon.pdf Jonathan Bennett's translation.] [http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/classics/leibniz/monad.htm Latta's translation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's contingency argument was summarised by [[William Lane Craig]], as follows:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cKSRVojRE&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence.
:2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.
:3. The universe exists.
:4. The universe has an explanation of its existence.
:5. Therefore, the explanation of the universe's existence is God.

Craig states that the only disputable statements are 1. and 2. He defended 1. from the question of 'What caused God?' by saying that God cannot be caused by anything, as that would imply that there is something greater than him, which is logically contradictory. He also denied that the universe was an exception to the rule, claiming that such a proposition [[begs the question|begging the question]]. He states &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpz7NaUDJU4&lt;/ref&gt; that saying 2. is wrong contradicts modern science, and that, far from not being specific to the God of Christianity, it actually leads to evidence specifically linking to a being outside of space and time, as well as one that is omnipotent and omniscient.

=== ''In esse'' and ''in fieri'' ===

The difference between the arguments from causation ''[[Becoming (philosophy)|in fieri]]'' and ''[[Essence|in esse]]'' is a fairly important one. ''In fieri'' is generally translated as "becoming", while ''in esse'' is generally translated as "in essence". ''In fieri'', the process of becoming, is similar to building a house. Once it is built, the builder walks away, and it stands on its own accord; compare the [[watchmaker analogy]]. (It may require occasional maintenance, but that is beyond the scope of the first cause argument.)

''In esse'' (essence) is more akin to the light from a candle or the liquid in a vessel. George Hayward Joyce, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], explained that "...where the light of the candle is dependent on the candle's continued existence, not only does a candle produce light in a room in the first instance, but its continued presence is necessary if the illumination is to continue. If it is removed, the light ceases. Again, a liquid receives its shape from the vessel in which it is contained; but were the pressure of the containing sides withdrawn, it would not retain its form for an instant." This form of the argument is far more difficult to separate from a purely first cause argument than is the example of the house's maintenance above, because here the First Cause is insufficient without the candle's or vessel's continued existence.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, George Hayward (1922) ''Principles of Natural Theology''. NY: Longmans Green.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]' argument is ''in fieri'', while [[Aquinas]]' argument is both ''in fieri'' and ''in esse''. This distinction is an excellent example of the difference between a [[deistic]] view (Leibniz) and a [[theistic]] view (Aquinas). As a general trend, the modern slants on the cosmological argument, including the [[Kalam cosmological argument|Kalam argument]], tend to lean very strongly towards an ''in fieri'' argument.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The philosopher [[Robert Koons]] has stated a new variant on the cosmological argument. He says that to deny causation is to deny all empirical ideas- for example, if we know our own hand, we know it because of the chain of causes including light being reflected upon one's eyes, stimulating the retina and sending a message through the optic nerve into your brain. He summarised the purpose of the argument as 'that if you don’t buy into theistic metaphysics, you’re undermining empirical science. The two grew up together historically and are culturally and philosophically inter-dependent… If you say I just don’t buy this causality principle – that’s going to be a big big problem for empirical science.' This ''in fieri'' version of the argument therefore does not intend to prove God, but only to disprove objections involving science, and the idea that contemporary knowledge disproves the cosmological argument. &lt;ref&gt;https://crossexamined.org/new-proofs-gods-existence/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kalām cosmological argument ===
{{Main|Kalam cosmological argument}}
William Lane Craig gives this argument in the following general form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William L. |title=The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe |work=Truth Journal |publisher=Leaderu.com |accessdate=22 June 2008 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/truth/3truth11.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
# The Universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

Craig explains, by nature of the event (the Universe coming into existence), attributes unique to (the concept of) God must also be attributed to the cause of this event, including but not limited to: omnipotence, Creator, being eternal and absolute self-sufficiency. Since these attributes are unique to God, anything with these attributes must be God. Something does have these attributes: the cause; hence, the cause is God, the cause exists; hence, God exists.

Craig defends the second premise, that the Universe had a beginning starting with [[Al-Ghazali]]'s proof  that an [[actual infinite]] is impossible. However, If the universe never had a beginning then there indeed '''would''' be an actual infinite, an infinite amount of cause and effect events. Hence, the Universe had a beginning.
&lt;!--
# the form advocated by Aquinas based on the impossibility of the "essential" ordering of an infinite regress; Aquinas argues that  only an "incidental" ordering among causes, but not an "essential" ordering, can reach back forever.
# the argument that an infinite regress is impossible because an [[actual infinite]] is impossible; this form is called the [[kalam cosmological argument]] by Craig, as he traces its first formulation to [[Al-Ghazali]].
# the argument from the [[principle of sufficient reason]], presented by Leibniz and Clarke.

A version of the cosmological argument could be stated as follows:

# Every finite and [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] being has a cause.
# A [[Causality|causal]] loop cannot exist.
# A causal chain cannot be of infinite length.
# Therefore, a First Cause (or something that is not an effect) must exist.
--&gt;

===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===

[[Duns Scotus]], the influential Medieval Christian theologian, created a metaphysical argument for the existence of God. Though it was inspired by Aquinas' argument from motion, he, like other philosophers and theologians, believed that his statement for God's existence could be considered separate to Aquinas'. His explanation for God's existence is long, and can be summarised as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B&lt;/ref&gt;
#Something can be produced.
#It is produced by itself, something or another.
#Not by nothing, because nothing causes nothing.
#Not by itself, because an effect never causes itself.
#Therefore, by another ''A''.
#If A is first then we have reached the conclusion.
#If A is not first, then we return to 2).
#From 3) and 4), we produce another- ''B''. The ascending series is either infinite or finite.
#An infinite series is not possible.
#Therefore, God exists.

Scotus deals immediately with two objections he can see: first, that there cannot be a first, and second, that the argument falls apart when 1) is questioned. He states that [[infinite regress]] is impossible, because it provokes unanswerable questions, like, in modern English, 'What is infinity minus infinity?' The second he states can be answered if the question is rephrased using [[modal logic]], meaning that the first statement is instead 'It is possible that something can be produced.'

== Objections and counterarguments ==
{{see also|Münchhausen trilemma}}

=== What caused the First Cause? ===
{{The Works of Aristotle}}
One objection to the argument is that it leaves open the question of why the First Cause is unique in that it does not require any causes. Proponents argue that the First Cause is exempt from having a cause, while opponents argue that this is [[special pleading]] or otherwise untrue.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Critics often press that arguing for the First Cause's exemption raises the question of why the First Cause is indeed exempt,&lt;ref name=cline&gt;{{cite web |last=Cline |first= Austin |title=Cosmological Argument: Does the Universe Require a First Cause? {{pipe}} Agnosticism/Atheism |publisher=About.com |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas defenders maintain that this question has been answered by the various arguments, emphasizing that none of its major forms rests on the premise that everything has a cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=07bHgxbG6A4C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=curious+blind+spot+in+the+anglo+cause+everything&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m3aujzj-la&amp;sig=aYqS9OJfoATKgcskZ3NLi7BAvx0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H9InVPvmJYvKaLPAguAO&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=curious%20blind%20spot%20in%20the%20anglo%20cause%20everything&amp;f=false Clarke, WN., "A Curious Blind Spot in the Anglo-American Tradition of Antitheistic Argument", in ''The Creative Retrieval of Saint Thomas Aquinas: Essays in Thomistic Philosophy, New and Old'', Fordham Univ Press, 2009, Ch. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Lane Craig]], who famously uses the [[Kalam cosmological argument]], argues that, as the infinite is impossible, whichever perspective the viewer takes, there must always have been one unmoved thing to begin the universe. He uses [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and the question 'What is infinity minus infinity?' to illustrate the idea that the infinite is metaphysically, mathematically, and even conceptually, impossible. Other reasons include the fact that it is impossible to count down from infinity, and that, had the universe existed for an infinite amount of time, every possible event, including the final end of the universe, would already have occurred. He therefore states his argument in three points- firstly, everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence; secondly, the universe began to exist; so, thirdly, therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence. &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#4.3&lt;/ref&gt; A response to this argument would be that the cause of the universe's existence (God) would need a cause for its existence, which, in turn, could be responded to as being logically inconsistent with the evidence already presented- even if God did have a cause, there would still necessarily be a cause which began everything, owing to the impossibility of the infinite stated by Craig.

Secondly, it is argued that the premise of [[causality]] has been arrived at via ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' ([[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) reasoning, which is dependent on experience. [[David Hume]] highlighted this [[problem of induction]] and argued that [[Causality|causal relations]] were not true ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. However, as to whether inductive or deductive reasoning is more valuable still remains a matter of debate, with the general conclusion being that neither is prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/dedind.php |title=Deduction &amp; Induction |publisher=Socialresearchmethods.net |date=2006-10-20 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the argument tend to argue that it is unwise to draw conclusions from an extrapolation of causality beyond experience.&lt;ref name=reichenbach/&gt; Andrew Loke replies that, according to the [[Kalam Cosmological Argument]], only things which begin to exist require a cause. On the other hand, something that is without beginning has always existed and therefore does not require a cause. The Cosmological Argument shows that there cannot be an actual infinite regress of causes, therefore there must be an uncaused First Cause that is beginningless and does not require a cause. &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, God and Ultimate Origins (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), p. 189; Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not evidence for a theist God ===
The basic cosmological argument merely establishes that a First Cause exists, not that it has the attributes of a [[theistic]] god, such as [[omniscience]], [[omnipotence]], and [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cosmological Argument for the Existence of God |author=Austin Cline |publisher= About, Inc. |date=27 July 2015 |accessdate=3 August 2016 |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/argumentsforgod/a/cosmological.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the argument is often expanded to show that at least some of these attributes are necessarily true, for instance in the modern Kalam argument given above.&lt;ref name=reichenbach /&gt;

=== Existence of causal loops ===
A causal loop is a form of [[predestination paradox]] arising where traveling backwards in time is deemed a possibility. A sufficiently powerful entity in such a world would have the capacity to travel backwards in time to a point before its own existence, and to then create itself, thereby initiating everything which [[Logical consequence|follows from]] it.

The usual reason which is given to refute the possibility of a causal loop is it requires that the loop as a whole be its own cause. [[Richard Hanley]] argues that causal loops are not logically, physically, or epistemically impossible: "[In timed systems,] the only possibly objectionable feature that all causal loops share is that coincidence is required to explain them."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hanley, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v436qxx802383534 No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics and Fiction], ''Synthese''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Andrew Loke argues that causal loop of the type that is supposed to avoid a First Cause suffers from the problem of vicious circularity and thus it would not work.  &lt;ref&gt; Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existence of infinite causal chains ===
[[David Hume]] and later [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] have invoked a similar principle in their criticisms of the cosmological argument. Rowe has called the principle the Hume-Edwards principle:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander R. Pruss, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q134n458307w0125 The Hume-Edwards Principle and the Cosmological Argument], ''International Journal for Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|If the existence of every member of a set is explained, the existence of that set is thereby explained.}}

Nevertheless, David White argues that the notion of an [[infinite regress|infinite causal regress]] providing a proper explanation is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Demea states that even if the succession of causes is infinite, the whole chain still requires a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Brian|title=Another problem about Part IX of Hume's Dialogues|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r5x5g687h06571w6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain this, suppose there exists a causal chain of infinite contingent beings. If one asks the question, "Why are there any contingent beings at all?", it won’t help to be told that "There are contingent beings because other contingent beings caused them."  That answer would just presuppose additional contingent beings. An adequate explanation of why some contingent beings exist would invoke a different sort of being, a necessary being that is ''not'' contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response might suppose each individual is contingent but the infinite chain as a whole is not; or the whole infinite causal chain to be its own cause.

Severinsen argues that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Severinsen|first=Morten|title=Principles Behind Definitions of Diseases – a Criticism of the Principle of Disease Mechanism and the Development of a Pragmatic Alternative|journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm2t476u01543017|quote=This implies that there is an "infinite" and complex causal structure behind each disease, and that the disease mechanism would have to encompass the whole structure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tried to introduce an argument “without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=David E.|title=An argument for God's existence|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4t816n217704nxv|quote=My intention is to show that a cosmological argument for God's existence (not that of a first cause simpliciter) can be constructed without appeal to the principle of sufficient reason and without denying the possibility of an infinite causal regress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other arguments have been offered to demonstrate that an actual infinite regress cannot exist, viz. the argument for the impossibility of concrete actual infinities, the argument for the impossibility of traversing an actual infinite, the argument from the lack of capacity to begin to exist, and various arguments from paradoxes. &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Loke, ''God and Ultimate Origins'' (Cham: Springer Nature, 2017), chapters 2 and 3; Waters,   Ben.   2013.

Some cosmologists and physicists argue that a challenge to the cosmological argument is the nature of time: "One finds that time just disappears from the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folger|first=Tim|title=Time may not exist|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/in-no-time/|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Carlo Rovelli]]). The [[Big Bang theory]] states that it is the point in which all [[dimension]]s came into existence, the start of both [[space]] and [[time]].&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;(J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and Beatrice M. Tinsley, "Will the Universe Expand Forever?" Scientific American [March 1976], p. 65)&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the question "What was there before the Universe?" makes no sense; the concept of "before" becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; This has been put forward by J. Richard Gott III, James E. Gunn, David N. Schramm, and [[Beatrice Tinsley]], who said that asking what occurred before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt; However, some cosmologists and physicists do attempt to investigate causes for the Big Bang, using such scenarios as the collision of [[Membrane (M-Theory)|membrane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Robert R. |title=Brane-Storm {{pipe}} Challenges Part of Big Bang Theory |publisher=Space.com |date=April 18, 2001 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511144628/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/bigbang_alternative_010413-3.html |archivedate=11 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] states that classical philosophers' arguments for the existence of God do not care about the Big Bang or whether the universe had a beginning. The question is not about what got things started or how long they have been going, but rather what keeps them going.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, The Last Superstition, St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the above objections can be dispelled by separating the Cosmological Argument from the A-Theory of Time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benjamin Victor Waters |date=9 July 2015 |title=Toward a new kalām cosmological argument |work=Cogent Arts and Humanities |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311983.2015.1062461 |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently discussing God as a ''timeless'' (rather than "before" in a linear sense) cause of the Big Bang. There is also a Big Bang Argument, which is a variation of the Cosmological Argument using the Big Bang Theory to validate the premise that the Universe had a beginning.&lt;ref&gt;An article mentioning the existence of such an argument, but not necessarily endorsing it: http://strangenotions.com/why-we-should-be-cautious-using-the-big-bang-argument.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cultural Medallion''' is a [[Singapore]] cultural award conferred to those who have achieved artistic excellence in [[dance]], [[theatre]], [[Literature of Singapore|literature]], [[Music of Singapore|music]], [[photography]], [[art]] and [[Cinema of Singapore|film]]. It is widely recognized as Singapore's pinnacle arts award.

It was instituted in March 1979 as an initiative of the late [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]] who was the then Minister for Culture. It is administered by the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]].

On 20 October 2006, [[Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts]] [[Dr Lee Boon Yang]] announced that Cultural Medallion recipients are eligible for a project grant of up to S$80,000 each, up from S$50,000. The increase would enable recipients to create major new works.&lt;ref name="Clara"&gt;Clara Chow, "SSO co-leader, versatile artist get highest award for the arts", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It was previously conferred by the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (the modern equivalent of the Minister for Culture). However, in 2006, the status of the award was further elevated by being conferred by the President of Singapore.

From 2013, in an effort to recognise multi-disciplinary artists, it was announced that recipients of the Cultural Medallion and Young Artist Award will no longer be categorised according to art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Medallion &amp; Young Artist Award Winners|url=https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|website=National Arts Council|publisher=National Arts Council|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903112331/https://www.nac.gov.sg/docs/cmyaa/past-recipients_2014.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]], '''declension''' is the changing of the form of a [[word]], generally to express its syntactic function in the sentence, by way of some [[inflection]]. 

Declension occurs in many of the world's languages. Among modern languages, declension is an important aspect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], many [[Amerindian]] languages such as [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Slavic languages]] such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], some [[Germanic languages]] such as [[High German]], and some others. In the ancient world, languages that were highly declined included [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]]. [[Old English]] was a moderately inflected language, as befits its [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and especially its [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] linguistic ancestry, but its declensions greatly simplified as it evolved into [[Modern English]].

&lt;!-- this part needs rewrite --&gt;Declensions may apply to [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s, and [[article (grammar)|articles]] to indicate [[grammatical number|number]] (at least singular and plural), [[grammatical case|case]] ([[nominative case|nominative or subjective]], [[genitive case|genitive or possessive]], etc.), and/or [[grammatical gender|gender]]. A declension is also a group of nouns that follow a particular pattern of inflection.

In the professional jargon specific to the language sciences, the term "declension" is sometimes used in a humorous way, to indicate where the meaning of an expression is off from the standard form; for example, comedy which is not funny could be said to have "humor declension".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Modern English==
{{further|Old English grammar#Nouns}}
In [[Modern English]], the system of declensions is very simple compared to some other languages, so much so that the term ''declension'' is rarely applied to English in practice. Most nouns in English have distinct singular and plural forms and have distinct plain and [[possessive]] forms. Plurality is most commonly shown by the [[clitic]] ''-s'' (or ''-es''), whereas possession is always shown by the [[clitic]] ''-'s'' (or by just the apostrophe for most plural forms ending in ''s'') attached to the noun. Consider, for example, the forms of the noun ''girl'':

{|class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:left"
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Plain'''
 | girl
 | girls
|-
 | '''Possessive'''
 | girl's
 | girls'
|}

Most speakers pronounce all of the forms other than the singular plain form (''girl'') exactly the same (though the elided possessive-indicating ''s'' of the plural possessive may be realised as [z] in some speakers' pronunciations, being separated from the plural-indicating ''s'' normally by a central vowel such as [ɨ̞]). By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:

{|class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:left"
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Plain'''
 | man
 | men
|-
 | '''Possessive'''
 | man's
 | men's
|}

In that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.

There can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun ''Britain'' has the associated descriptive adjective ''British'' and the demonym ''Briton''. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.

Pronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:

{|class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:left"
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Subjective'''
 | I
 | we
|-
 | '''Objective'''
 | me
 | us
|-
 | '''Dependent possessive'''
 | my
 | our
|-
 | '''Independent possessive'''
 | mine
 | ours
|}

Whereas nouns do not distinguish between the [[nominative case|subjective (nominative)]] and [[oblique case| objective (oblique)]] cases, some pronouns do; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a [[verb]] or [[preposition]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Consider the difference between ''he'' (subjective) and ''him'' (objective), as in "He saw it" and "It saw him"; similarly, consider ''[[Who (pronoun)|who]]'', which is subjective, and the objective ''whom'' (although it is increasingly common to use ''who'' for both).

The one situation where gender is still clearly part of the English language is in the pronouns for the third person singular. Consider the following:

{|class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:left"
 ! 
 ! Masculine
 ! Feminine
 ! Neuter&lt;br&gt;(non-person)
 ! Neuter&lt;br&gt;(person)
|-
 | '''Subjective'''
 | he
 | she
 | it
 | they
|-
 | '''Objective'''
 | him
 | her
 | it
 | them
|-
 | '''Dependent possessive'''
 | his
 | her
 | its
 | their
|-
 | '''Independent possessive'''
 | his
 | hers
 | its
 | theirs
|}

The distinguishing of neuter for persons and non-persons is somewhat peculiar to English. This has existed since the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Butterfield p814"&gt;{{Cite book|page=814|last1=Fowler |first1=H.W.|editor1-last=Butterfield |editor1-first=Jeremy|title= Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston |last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey K. |authorlink2= Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8 |page=494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the so-called ''singular they'' is often restricted to specific contexts, depending on the dialect or the speaker. It is most typically used to refer to a single person of unknown gender (e.g., "someone left their jacket behind"). Its use has expanded in recent years due to increasing social recognition of persons who do not identify themselves as male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=
The singular, gender-neutral ‘they’ added to the Associated Press Stylebook | author=Andrews, Travis M. | date=March 28, 2017 | newspaper=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/28/the-singular-gender-neutral-they-added-to-the-associated-press-stylebook/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the ''singular they'' still uses plural verb forms, reflecting its origins.

For nouns, in general, gender is not declined in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. ''alumnus'' (masculine singular) and ''alumna'' (feminine singular). Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: ''Andrew'' and ''Andrea'', ''Paul'' and ''Paula'', etc. Additionally, suffixes such as ''-ess'', ''-ette'', and ''-er'' are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.

Most adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline (e.g., "I'll take the reds", meaning "I'll take the red ones" or as shorthand for "I'll take the red wines"). Also, the demonstrative determiners ''this'' and ''that'' are declined for number, as ''these'' and ''those''. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: ''blond'' (male) and ''blonde'' (female). Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The [[English articles|article]] is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words ''that'' and possibly ''[[she]]'' correspond to forms of the predecessor of ''the'' (''sē'' m., ''þæt'' n., ''sēo'' f.) as it was declined in Old English.

==Latin==

{{main|Latin declension}}

An example of a [[Latin]] noun declension is given below, using the word ''homo'' (''man'', ''human''), which belongs to [[wikt:Appendix:Latin third declension|Latin's third declension]].

*{{lang|la|homo}} ([[nominative case|nominative]] and vocative singular) "[the] man" [as a subject] (e.g., {{lang|la|homo ibi stat}}, the man is standing there)
*{{lang|la|hominem}} ([[accusative case|accusative]] singular) "[the] man" [as a direct object] (e.g., {{lang|la|ad hominem}}, toward the man, in the sense of argument directed personally; {{lang|la|hominem vidi}}, I saw the man)
*{{lang|la|hominis}} ([[genitive case|genitive]] singular) "of [the] man" [as a possessor] (e.g., {{lang|la|nomen hominis est Claudius}}, the man's name is Claudius)
*{{lang|la|hominī}} ([[dative case|dative]] singular) "to or for [the] man" [as an indirect object] (e.g., {{lang|la|homini donum dedi}}, I gave a present to the man; {{lang|la|homo homini lupus est}}, Man is a wolf to man)
*{{lang|la|homine}} ([[ablative case|ablative]] singular) "[the] man" (mainly used following many prepositions, and in the [[ablative absolute]] construction, or to mean "by", "with" or "from" without a preposition) (e.g. {{lang|la|sum altior homine}}, I am taller than the man)
*''homines'', nominative, vocative and accusative plural
*''hominum'', genitive plural
*''hominibus'', dative and ablative plural

There are two further noun cases in Latin, the [[vocative]] and the [[locative]]:
* The vocative case indicates that a person or thing is being addressed (e.g. ''O Tite, cur ancillam pugnas?'', O Titus, why do you fight the slave girl?)
* The locative case is used for specific spatial relationships. It indicates that a locative-case noun is the location of another noun or a verb (e.g., ''Romulus regnat Romae'', Romulus rules in Rome). It is a feature only of certain place-names, especially of cities and towns (e.g. Roma, Tarquinii, Carthago), small islands (e.g. Samos), and the nouns {{lang|la|rūs}}, {{lang|la|humus}}, and {{lang|la|domus}} ('''in''' the country, '''in''' the earth, '''at''' home). The locative case is rare in classic Latin, and it is mostly absorbed in the ablative case. An important feature of the locative-case nouns is that they are not accompanied by a preposition (as the example illustrates).

Many European languages of Indo-European origin have a set of cases which are similar to those of Latin. For example German and other Germanic languages like Icelandic have similar cases but omit the vocative and ablative; classical Greek omitted the ablative and modern Greek also omits the dative; some Slavic languages also have the instrumental case.

Most of these languages have several declensions, i.e. classes of words with different schemes for determining the case endings. Furthermore, it is notable that in all these languages and declensions it is the exception rather than the rule for there to be a one-to-one correspondence between cases and endings, so that often one has to deduce from the context which case is meant.

==Sanskrit==
{{main|Sanskrit nouns}}
Sanskrit, another Indo-European language, has eight cases: [[nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], [[locative case|locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clackson]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDjNp6wODoC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Indo-European linguistics: an introduction''], p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Some do not count vocative as a separate case, despite it having a distinctive ending in the singular, but consider it as a different use of the nominative.&lt;ref&gt;Amba Kulkarni and Peter Scharf (eds), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t2f1hneiV08C&amp;pg=PA68 Sanskrit Computational Linguistics: First and Second International Symposia Rocquencourt, France, October 29-31, 2007 and Providence, RI, USA, May 15-17, 2008, Revised Selected Papers]'', Volume 5402 of Lecture notes in artificial intelligence, Springer, 2009, {{ISBN|3-642-00154-8}}, pp. 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] grammatical cases have been analyzed extensively. The grammarian [[Pāṇini]] identified seven semantic [[Thematic relation|roles]] or ''karaka'', which correspond closely to the eight cases:&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Cornelis Verhagen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vmaX_JQzc4C&amp;pg=PA281 Handbook of oriental studies: India. A history of Sanskrit grammatical literature in Tibet, Volume 2]'', BRILL, 2001, {{ISBN|90-04-11882-9}}, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
* agent (''kartṛ'', related to the nominative)
* patient (''karman'', related to the accusative)
* means (''karaṇa'', related to the instrumental)
* recipient (''sampradāna'', related to the dative)
* source (''apādāna'', related to the ablative)
* locus (''adhikaraṇa'', related to the locative)
* address (''sambodhana'', related to the vocative)
For example, consider the following sentence:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
| style="padding-right: 1em;" | vṛkṣ-āt
| style="padding-right: 1em;" | parṇ-aṁ
| style="padding-right: 1em;" | bhūm-au
| patati
|-
|from the tree || a leaf || to the ground || falls
|}"a leaf falls from the tree to the ground"

Here ''leaf'' is the agent, ''tree'' is the source, and ''ground'' is the locus. The endings ''-aṁ'', ''-at'', ''-āu'' mark the cases associated with these meanings.

'''Diaspora studies''' is an academic field established in the late 20th century to study dispersed [[ethnicity|ethnic]] populations, which are often termed [[diaspora peoples]]. The usage of the term [[diaspora]] carries the [[connotation]] of forced resettlement, due to expulsion, coercion, slavery, [[racism]], or war, especially [[nationalism|nationalist]] conflicts. 

==Academic institutes==
* The International Institute for Diasporic and Transcultural Studies (IIDTS) — a transnational institute incorporating [[Jean Moulin University]] ([[Lyon]]s, France), the [[University of Cyprus]], [[Sun Yat-sen University]] ([[Guangzhou]], China) and [[Liverpool Hope University]] (UK) — is a dedicated research network operating in a transdisciplinary logic and focused on cultural representation (and auto-representation) of diasporic communities throughout the world. The institute sponsors the trilingual publication ''Transtext(e)s-Transcultures: A Journal of Global Cultural Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtexts.net ''Transtext(e)s-Transcultures website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikt}}
An '''eolith''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "''eos''", dawn, and "''lithos''", stone) is a chipped [[flint]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]].  Eoliths were once thought to have been artifacts, the earliest [[stone tool]]s, but are now believed to be [[geofact]]s (stone fragments produced by fully natural [[Geology|geological]] processes such as [[glaciation]]).

The first eoliths were collected in [[Kent]] by Benjamin Harrison, an amateur [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], in 1885 (though the name "eolith" wasn't coined until 1892, by J. Allen Browne).  Harrison's discoveries were published by Sir [[Joseph Prestwich]] in 1891, and eoliths were generally accepted to have been crudely made tools, dating from the [[Pliocene]].  Further discoveries of eoliths in the early 20th century &amp;ndash; in [[East Anglia]] by J. Reid Moir and in continental [[Europe]] by Aimé Louis Rutot and H. Klaatsch &amp;ndash; were taken to be evidence of human habitation of those areas before the oldest known [[fossil]]s.  Indeed, the [[England|English]] finds helped to secure acceptance of the hoax remains of [[Piltdown man]].

Because eoliths were so crude, concern began to be raised that they were indistinguishable from the natural processes of [[erosion]]. [[Marcellin Boule]], a [[France|French]] archaeologist, published an argument against the artifactual status of eoliths in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;Boule, M. (1905) - « L'origine des éolithes », ''L'Anthropologie'', t. XVI, pp. 257-267.&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuel Hazzledine Warren provided confirmation of Boule's view after carrying out experiments on flints.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, S.H. (1905) - « On the origin of "Eolithic" flints by naturals causes, especially by the foundering of drifts », ''Journal of the Royal Antrhopological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', t. 35, pp. 337-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the debate continued for about three decades, more and more evidence was discovered that suggested a purely natural origin for eoliths. This, together with the discovery of genuine early [[Lower Pleistocene]] [[Oldowan]] tools in [[East Africa]], made support for the artifact theory difficult to sustain.

'''''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[American Humanist Association]]. It is published twice annually and [[Editor-in-chief|edited]] by [[Marian Hillar]]. It covers the [[philosophy]] of [[humanism]].&lt;ref name=IOE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essaysinhumanism.org/about.html |title=About Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1992 "Humanists of Houston", a chapter of the [[American Humanist Association]], decided at the initiative of Marian Hillar and Robert Finch to publish lectures and seminars that were presented by notable speakers at the meetings of the group, doing so under the general title ''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism''. With time the scope of the publication was enlarged to include solicited and unsolicited papers from others. In 2005, the American Humanist Association adopted ''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism'' as its official journal.&lt;ref name=IOE/&gt;

'''''Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy''''' ({{lang-de|Faust. Der Tragödie zweiter Teil in fünf Akten.}}), is the second part of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. It was published in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Because of its complexity in form and content, it is usually not read in German schools, although the first part commonly is.

Only part of Faust I is directly related to the legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Johann Faust]], which dates to at latest the beginning of the 16th century (thus preceding [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s [[Doctor Faustus (play)|play]]). The "Gretchen" subplot, although now the most widely known episode of the Faust legend, was of Goethe's own invention. In Faust II, the legend  (at least in a version of the 18th century, which came to Goethe's attention) already contained Faust's marriage with Helen and an encounter with an Emperor. But certainly Goethe deals with the legendary material very freely in both parts.

==Acts==

===Act I===

* ''Graceful area. Faust, bedded on flowery turf, weary, restless, seeking sleep. Dusk. Ghost circle, floating moves, graceful little figures.''

The first act opens with an appeal by Ariel to forgive Faust and ease the cares of his suffering.

* ''Hall of the Throne. State Council in anticipation of the emperor. Trumpets. Servants of all kinds, beautifully dressed, step forward. The emperor ascends the throne, to his right the astrologer.''

The first act sees Mephistopheles (playing the role of a fool) saving the imperial finances of the Emperor – and so the [[Holy Roman Empire]] – by introducing the use of [[paper money]] instead of gold to encourage spending (and economic recovery).

* ''Spacious room with side chambers, decorated and dressed up for the masquerade.''

This is by far the most extensive section of the first act, describing the Florentine carnival from the perspective of Goethe, above all based on [[Antonio Francesco Grazzini]]'s ''[[Tutti i Trifoni]]'' (1559) – a collection of contemporary "songs and hard lifts". A parade of Florentine notables, including Dante and [[Gianni Schicchi]], pass by.

* ''Lustgarten, morning sun. Faust, Mephistopheles, decent, not remarkable, according to custom, dressed, and both knees exposed.''

The "Emperor of Thumb" (to use a devilish term of Mephistopheles) describes how much he enjoyed the recent celebrations, and wants more "dergleichen Scherze" (5988). The Emperor appears and blesses the newly introduced paper money from Mephisto, which is adorned with pictures of [[Simon Magus]]. The Emperor begins to understand its meaning and to squander it, as do his advisors. Goethe here satirizes the introduction of paper money during the [[French Revolution]], with various advisors possibly representing [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]] and other figures.

* ''Dark gallery. Faust. Mephistopheles.''

Faust enters the "realm of the mothers" – variously described as the depths of the psyche or the womb – in order to bring back the "ideal form" of beauty for the Emperor's delight. In this case, the ideal forms are [[Helen of Troy]] and her lover [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Faust summons their spirits from [[Hades]], but the emperor and the male members of his court criticize Paris's appearance, while the women of the court criticize Helen's appearance. Faust falls in love with Helen. In a fit of jealously toward Paris, who is now abducting Helen, Faust destroys the illusion and the act ends in darkness and tumult.

===Act II===
Mephistopheles transports the unconscious Faust into his old study. Mephistopheles, donning Faust's robe once again, resumes his conversation with the freshman, who is now a cynical baccalaurus. The [[Homunculus]], an artificial human being created by Wagner, Faust's former famulus, by means of an alchemical process, leads Faust and [[Mephistopheles]] to the "Classical [[Walpurgisnacht]]", where they encounter gods and monsters from Greek [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. Faust, still searching for Helen, is led by the sybil [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]] into the Underworld. Mephistopheles, meanwhile, meets the Phorkyads or Phorcydes (another name for the [[Graeae]]) three hideous hags who share one tooth and one eye between them, and he disguises himself as one of them. Guided by the sea-god [[Proteus]], the Homunculus is initiated into the process of becoming fully human.

===Act III===
The third act begins with Helen's arrival at the palace of [[Menelaus]] in Sparta, accompanied by women, who, as in [[Classical drama]], constitute the chorus. The hideous Phorkyas appears at the hearth, and warns Helen that Menelaus means to sacrifice her and her attendants. Distraught at this new knowledge, Helen implores Phorkyas to save them. Phorkyas transports Helen and the chorus to Faust's fortress, where Helen and Faust declare their love for each other. After defeating Menelaus' army, Faust proclaims the pastoral beauty of the [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] countryside.

The scene changes in time and space: a range of rocky caverns, with a shadowy grove extending to the foot of the rocks. Phorkyas, now Faust and Helen's attendant, explains to the newly-woken chorus that during the past interval Faust and Helen have had a spirited son named Euphorion, who charms all with his beauty and gift for music. The wild Euphorion, becoming increasingly bold in his flight, falls to his death (in allusion to [[Icarus]]), whereupon the sorrowful Helen disappears in a mist to Hades  (in allusion to the legend of [[Orpheus]]). The chorus of women, undesirous of joining their mistress in the Underworld, revert to nature, which they extol in songs of praise. As the act ends, Phorkyas is revealed to be Mephistopheles in disguise.

===Act IV===
In the fourth act, Faust returns to the Emperor, who is at war with a rival Emperor. With the help of Mephistopheles' ordered ranks of Daemons they achieve victory.

===Act V===
An indefinite interval of time has passed since the end of the previous act, and Faust is now an old but powerful man favored by the king. Using dikes and dams to push back the sea, Faust has built a castle on the reclaimed land. Upon seeing the hut of an old peasant couple ([[Baucis and Philemon]]) and a nearby chapel, Faust becomes irritated that these two structures do not belong to him, and orders to have them removed. Mephistopheles overinterprets Faust's orders by murdering the old couple. The personification of Care breathes upon Faust's eyes, and he becomes blind. Upon disclosing his plans to better the lives of his subjects, motivated perhaps out of guilt, he recognizes the moment of sheer bliss which he would seek to prolong and drops dead. Mephistopheles believes Faust has lost his wager and tries to claim his soul. Angels suddenly appear, dropping rose-petals on the demons, who flee from the burning petals. Mephistopheles, however, stands his ground, and, under the aphrodisiac influence of the roses, lusts after the angels, who meanwhile make off with Faust's soul.

The scene abruptly changes to a wilderness inhabited by holy [[anchorite]]s: "Mountain-gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert". ''Pater Profundus'' discloses the parable of nature, which is a harbinger of divine love. The angels bearing Faust's soul appear in heaven. After the enraptured Doctor Marianus extols the [[eternal feminine|Eternal Feminine]], the virgin Mary, ''Mater Gloriosa'', appears from on high. Three biblical holy women, ''Magna Peccatrix'' (the Great Sinneress, Luke 7:36), ''Mulier Samaritana'' (the Samaritan woman, John 4), and ''Maria Aegyptiaca'' (''Acta Sanctorum''), plead for Faust's soul, while ''Una Paenitentium'' (previously Gretchen), also pleading for grace, offers to lead the reborn Faust into the higher spheres of heaven. ''Mater Gloriosa'' grants her wish.

The ''Chorus Mysticus'' ends the drama:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;All that must disappear
Is but a parable;
What lay beyond us, here
All is made visible;
Here deeds have understood
Words they were darkened by;
Eternal Womanhood

== United States ==
Though grazing rights have never been codified in [[United States]] law, the concept of such rights descends from the English concept of the commons, a piece of land over which people, often neighboring landowners, could exercise one of a number of traditional rights, including livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, K.R. 2002. Public Lands and Political Meaning: Ranchers, the Government, and the Property Between Them. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, the traditional practice of grazing open rangeland in the United States was rarely disputed because of the sheer amount of unsettled open land. However, as the population of the western United States increased in the mid-to-late 19th century, range wars often erupted over the ranchers' perceived rights to graze their cattle as western rangelands deteriorated with overuse.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischner, T. L. 2009. Livestock grazing and wildlife conservation in the American West: historical, policy and conservation biology perspectives. Wild Rangelands: Conserving Wildlife While Maintaining Livestock in Semi-Arid Ecosystems (eds J. T. du Toit, R. Kock and J. C. Deutsch). Chidester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, p. 235-265. pdoi: 10.1002/9781444317091.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the [[Taylor Grazing Act]] formally set out the federal government's powers and policy on grazing federal lands in the [[western United States]] by establishing the Division of Grazing and procedures for issuing permits to graze federal lands for a fixed period of time. The Division of Grazing was renamed the US Grazing Service in 1939 and then merged in 1946 with the General Land Office to become the [[Bureau of Land Management]], which along with the [[United States Forest Service]] oversees public lands grazing in 16 western states today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/grazing.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, grazing was never established as a legal right in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Donahue D. 2005. Western grazing: the capture of grass, ground, and government. Environmental Law 35:721-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Taylor Grazing Act authorized only the permitted use of lands designated as available for livestock grazing while specifying that grazing permits "convey no right, title, or interest" to such lands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 4130.2 (c) Retrieved from http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=65dfe1cec94944c989e83b4eb39cd3ba;rgn=div5;view=text;node=43%3A2.1.1.4.92;idno=43;cc=ecfr#PartTop&lt;/ref&gt; Although the regulations stipulated by the Taylor Grazing Act apply only to grazing on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Chief of the Forest Service is authorized to permit or suspend grazing on Forest Service administered property, and many Forest Service grazing regulations resemble those of the Taylor Grazing Act.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 36 § 222.1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dalmatia ==
In [[Dalmatia]], [[judgment]]s about grazing rights are a fundamental part of the [[jurisprudence]]. The oldest court verdict in Dalmatia in a court case about grazing rights dates from the 14th century. It is a [[usufruct]] of [[property]], which belongs to someone else, or it is a use of a property. Use of someone else's  property requires a [[contract]] (written or not) about the usufruct. The court may declare parts of the contract as unlawful.

If there is no contract, [[common law]] (also called [[case law]]) comes to apply. The decisions on who was allowed to judge on grazing rights cases were different in the [[Middle Ages]], which reasoned in [[tradition]] and in the natural resources in each area, such as water, meadows, lawns and others. Some [[peasant]]s wrote their own [[statute]], like [[Poljica republic]] in 1440. Also, some [[duke]]s wrote together with some peasants their own statute, like [[Law codex of Vinodol]] from 1288.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Országos Levéltár&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iñaq Uyu''' ([[Aymara language|Aymara]], ''iñaqa'' a woman of noble [[caste]] of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]]s, ''uyu'' [[pen (enclosure)]], yard, cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pen of the ''iñaqa'', the woman of the noble caste of the Incas", other spellings ''Iñac Uyu, Iñac Uyo, Iñakuyu, Iñak Uyu, Iñak Uyo''), also called '''Aklla Wasi'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Posnansky]], Inakuyu (Ajllahuasi) (Isla de Coati.)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''aklla'' chosen, selected, virgins of the sun, ''wasi'' house,&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; "house of the virgins of the sun"), is an archaeological site in [[Bolivia]] situated on the [[Isla de la Luna]], an island of Lake [[Lake Titicaca|Titicaca]]. It is located in the [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz Department]], [[Manco Kapac Province]], [[Copacabana Municipality, La Paz|Copacabana Municipality]] In Incan society, the societal structure was very rigid. Often those of belonging to the royal class structure did not mix with the lower classes. 

Iñaq Uyu dates back to around 1000 C.E. to 1500 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourancientworld.com/Settlement.aspx?id=647&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other archaeological sites, [[Chinkana]] and [[Pillkukayna]], Iñaq Uyu is located on an island of [[Lake Titicaca]]; however, Iñaq Uyu is situated on the [[Isla de la Luna]], rather than the larger [[Isla Del Sol]] where [[Chinkana]] and [[Pillkukayna]] are situated. The name, Iñaq Uyu, has a linguistic origin that speculates that the cemetery was probably used as a burial site for the [[Inca]]n women of noble and aristocratic hierarchy. Iñaq Uyu’s name roughly translates to “house of the virgins of the sun".&lt;ref&gt;Iñaq Uyu&lt;/ref&gt; This name may have been given because Iñaq Uyu is situated on the [[Isla de la Luna]] and away from the [[Isla Del Sol]]. Because Iñaq Uyu is away from the [[Isla Del Sol]], it can be considered as a “virgin of the sun.”.&lt;ref&gt;Iñaq Uyu&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jantar Mantar''' is an [[equinox|equinoctial]] [[sundial]], consisting of a gigantic triangular [[gnomon]] with the [[hypotenuse]] parallel to the [[Earth]]'s axis.  On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the plane of the [[equator]].  The instrument is intended to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and [[declination]] of the [[Sun]] and the other [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]].

There are five Jantar Mantars in [[India]], of which [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|the largest]] is in [[Jaipur]] which features many instruments along with the world's largest stone sundial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smithsonian|title=Timelines of Science|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1465414342|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vrihat Samrat yantra is a sundial that can give the local time to an accuracy of 2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=10&amp;name=Jantar%20Mantar%20Jaipur|title = Jantar Mantar Jaipur|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit kumar pareek and Agam kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

==History==
In the early 18th century, [[Maharaja]] [[Jai Singh II]] of [[Jaipur]] constructed five Jantar Mantars in total, in [[Jantar Mantar, New Delhi|New Delhi]], [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jaipur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Jantar Mantar, Varanasi|Varanasi]]; they were completed between 1724 and 1735.

The jantars have like Samrat Yantra, Jai Prakash, Ram Yantra and Niyati Chakra; each of which are used to for various astronomical calculations. The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the [[sun]], [[moon]] and [[planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Sankalp India Foundation. ''[http://sankalpindia.net/drupal/?q=jantart-mantar-get-lost-space Jantart Mantar: Get lost in space!]'' (2008-07-22).&lt;/ref&gt;

List Of Instruments:

* Samrat Yantra
* Jai Prakash Yantra
* Disha Yantra
* Rama Yantra
* Chakra Yantra
* Rashiwalay Yantra
* Dingash Yantra
* Utaansh Yantra

==Name==
The name "Jantar Mantar" is at least 200 years old, finding a mention in an account from 1803.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; However, the archives of Jaipur State, such as accounts from 1735 and 1737–1738, do not use this as ''Jantra'', which in the spoken language is corrupted to ''Jantar''.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; The word ''Jantra'' is derived from ''[[yantra]]'', instrument, while the suffix ''Mantar'' is derived from mantrana meaning consult or calculate.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; The words ''jantar'' and ''mantar'' (or ''yantra'' and ''mantra'') mean calculation instrument.

'''João Pessoa''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒʊˈɐ̃w peˈsoɐ|br}})&lt;ref&gt;The [[European Portuguese]] pronunciation is {{IPA-pt|ʒwɐ̃w pɨˈso.ɐ|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the capital of the state of [[Paraíba]] in Brazil. It was founded in 1585 and it is also known as ''the city where the sun rises first'', because it is the easternmost city in the Americas at 34° 47′ 38″ W, 7° 9′ 28″ S. Its easternmost point is known as [[Ponta do Seixas]]. The city is often referred as "the second greenest in the world", with more than {{convert|7|km2|sqmi}} of forested land, second only to Paris, France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cob.org.br/olimpiadasescolares_fase2/edicao2008/cidade.asp|title=Onde o Sol brilha primeiro|publisher=Câmara Municipal de João Pessoa|accessdate=March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408083629/http://www.cob.org.br/olimpiadasescolares_fase2/edicao2008/cidade.asp|archivedate=April 8, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though such claim seems to be just a publicity stunt from the then mayor during [[Earth Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=https://g1.globo.com/pb/paraiba/noticia/cidade-mais-verde-extremo-oriental-saiba-o-que-e-verdade-sobre-joao-pessoa.ghtml|title=Cidade mais verde?

It is the state's largest city, with an estimated population of 801,718 of inhabitants.&lt;ref name="IBGE/2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cod.ibge.gov.br/B4GJ|title=Paraíba " João Pessoa|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=July 1, 2016|publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[metropolitan area]] comprises eight other satellite cities (Bayeux, Cabedelo, [[Conde, Paraíba|Conde]], [[Lucena, Brazil|Lucena]], [[Santa Rita, Paraíba|Santa Rita]], and others), totalling 1,223,000 of inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The complex, inaugurated in 2008, was created by Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and is one of his last projects.

The capital of Paraíba received in 2017 the title of [[creative city]] by [[UNESCO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joaopessoa.pb.gov.br/titulo-de-cidade-criativa-da-unesco-coloca-joao-pessoa-na-rota-turistica-mundial-atraves-da-arte-popular/|title=Unesco Creative City title puts João Pessoa on the world tourist route through folk art|accessdate=August 29, 2018|date=November 3, 2017|publisher=City Hall of João Pessoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing João Pessoa, as "'''Brazilian city of [[handicrafts]]'''". Besides the capital of Paraíba, just another city in Latin America, it has the same title, with the same category, which is [[Chordeleg]], in [[Ecuador]]. The recognition of the capital João Pessoa, places it on the Brazilian tourist route for the richness of its [[handicrafts|popular art]]. This recognition had great contribution and influence, due to the mermaids project of Penha;&lt;ref name="Unesco Creative City title puts João Pessoa on the world tourist route through folk art"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turismo.joaopessoa.pb.gov.br/o-que-fazer/pontos-turisticos/artesanato/sereias-da-penha/|title=Mermaids from Penha|accessdate=August 29, 2018|publisher=Secretary of Tourism of the Municipality of João Pessoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; where women artisans perform the manual work, dialoguing with the design, fashion, creative economy, highlighting the art with fish scales in copper wires.

==History==
João Pessoa is the third oldest city in Brazil.&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/joao-pessoa|title=Introducing João Pessoa|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously named Frederikstadt by the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch]] and Parahyba by the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese]], the city was renamed for a governor of Paraíba state [[João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque]] after his assassination in 1930.

The Aceh Provincial Library (BPD) was inundated with three meters of water. Twenty three staff members were killed, including the library's director, Bachtiar Azis, who is listed as missing along with his family. In addition to loss of life, the BPD suffered physical damage and a near total loss of its collection. Concrete and steel fences surrounding the two-story building were mostly destroyed, however, the building itself remained standing. All library materials housed on the first floor were swept away by the waves and the floor was covered in 30&amp;nbsp;cm.-thick mud. These lost materials comprise most of its children, young adult and adult collections. The water did not reach the second floor, but looting resulted in the loss of most materials and equipment. A collection of books received under legal deposit and housed on the second floor was left undisturbed and survived the disaster and looting intact.&lt;ref name="ALA | Tsunami-Report from Indonesia"&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/iro/iroactivities/tsunamiindonesianreport.cfm ALA | Tsunami-Report from Indonesia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] ( {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64Dce1FRO?url=http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/iro/iroactivities/tsunamiindonesianreport.cfm |date=December 26, 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these losses, the BPD reopened to the public in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Amelia.

Of Aceh's eight [[public library|public libraries]], two were completely destroyed. These libraries were located in the hard-hit cities of [[Meulaboh]] and [[Sigli]].&lt;ref name="Baba, Zawiyah 2005 PPM"&gt;Baba, Zawiyah, Hasbullah Atan, Rohani Rustam, and Abdul Hamid Abdul Rahman.

Mobile library units, or ''perpustakaan keliling'', are used to serve rural areas of Aceh. Days before the earthquake and tsunami, the BPD had received two newly built mobile library units from the [[National Library of Indonesia]]. Both of these were destroyed along with the rest of the mobile libraries parked on the BPD's carport. In July 2005, the National Library donated two replacement mobile units, however the new BPD director noted that further units were needed to adequately serve outlying regions of the province.&lt;ref name="ALA | Tsunami-Report from Indonesia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baba, Zawiyah 2005 PPM"/&gt;

The [[Aceh Documentation and Information Center]], known for its collection of rare books and manuscripts chronicling the heritage of Aceh, was completely destroyed. Only half of the building remained standing, and the entire collection was swept away. A team from the [[National Library of Indonesia]] visiting in January 2005 was able to salvage only three books and one sheet of the genealogy of the [[Muslim]] kings of Aceh. These were taken to [[Jakarta]] for restoration.&lt;ref name="ALA | Tsunami-Report from Indonesia"/&gt;

{{Linguistic_typology topics}}

'''Linguistic typology''' is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies and classifies languages according to their structural and functional features. Its aim is to describe and explain the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its subdisciplines include, but are not limited to: qualitative typology, which deals with the issue of comparing languages and within-language variance; quantitative typology, which deals with the distribution of structural patterns in the world’s languages; theoretical typology, which explains these distributions; syntactic typology, which deals with word order, word form, and word choice; and lexical typology, which deals with language vocabulary.

==Qualitative typology==
Qualitative typology develops cross-linguistically viable notions or types that provide a framework for the description and comparison of individual languages. A few examples appear below.

===Typological systems===
====Subject–verb–object positioning====
{{main|Word order}}
One set of types reflects the basic order of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[verb]], and [[direct object]] in sentences:

* [[Object–subject–verb]]
* [[Object–verb–subject]]
* [[Subject–verb–object]]
* [[Subject–object–verb]]
* [[Verb–subject–object]]
* [[Verb–object–subject]]

These labels usually appear abbreviated as "SVO" and so forth, and may be called "typologies" of the languages to which they apply.  The most commonly attested word orders are SOV and SVO while the least common orders are those that are object initial with OVS being the least common with only four attested instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gell-Mann |first=Murray |last2=Ruhlen |first2=Merritt |date=2011-10-18 |title=The origin and evolution of word order |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=42 |pages=17290–17295 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1113716108 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=3198322 |pmid=21987807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, linguists began to question the relevance of geographical distribution of different values for various features of linguistic structure. They may have wanted to discover whether a particular grammatical structure found in one language is likewise found in another language in the same geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard, et al. “Chapter Introduction.” WALS Online - Chapter Introduction, The World Atlas of Language Structures Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some languages split verbs into an auxiliary and an infinitive or participle, and put the subject and/or object between them. For instance, German ({{lang|de|Ich '''habe''' einen Fuchs im Wald '''gesehen'''}} - *"I have a fox in-the woods seen"), Dutch ({{lang|nl|Hans '''vermoedde''' dat Jan Marie '''zag leren zwemmen'''}} - *"Hans suspected that Jan Marie saw teach swim") and Welsh ({{lang|cy|'''Mae'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;r gwirio sillafu wedi'i '''gwblhau'''}} - *"Is the checking spelling after its to complete"). In this case, linguists base the typology on the non-analytic tenses (i.e. those sentences in which the verb is not split) or on the position of the auxiliary. German is thus SVO in main clauses and Welsh is VSO (and preposition phrases would go after the infinitive).

Many typologists{{Who|date=March 2017}} classify both German and Dutch as [[V2 word order|V2]] languages, as the verb invariantly occurs as the second element of a full clause.

Some languages allow varying degrees of freedom in their constituent order, posing a problem for their classification within the subject–verb–object schema. Languages with bound case markings for nouns, for example, tend to have more flexible word orders than languages where case is defined by position within a sentence or presence of a preposition.{{Example needed |date=May 2018}} To define a basic constituent order type in this case, one generally looks at frequency of different types in declarative affirmative main clauses in pragmatically neutral contexts, preferably with only old referents. Thus, for instance, Russian is widely considered an SVO language, as this is the most frequent constituent order under such conditions—all sorts of variations are possible, though, and occur in texts. In many inflected languages, such as Russian, Latin, and Greek, departures from the default word-orders are permissible but usually imply a shift in focus, an emphasis on the final element, or some special context. In the poetry of these languages, the word order may also shift freely to meet metrical demands. Additionally, freedom of word order may vary within the same language—for example, formal, literary, or archaizing varieties may have different, stricter, or more lenient constituent-order structures than an informal spoken variety of the same language.

On the other hand, when there is no clear preference under the described conditions, the language is considered to have "flexible constituent order" (a type unto itself).

An additional problem is that in languages without living speech communities, such as [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Old Church Slavonic]], linguists have only written evidence, perhaps written in a poetic, formalizing, or archaic style that mischaracterizes the actual daily use of the language. The daily spoken language of [[Sophocles]] or [[Cicero]] might have exhibited a different or much more regular syntax than their written legacy indicates.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Morphosyntactic alignment====
{{main|Morphosyntactic alignment}}
Another common classification distinguishes [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] alignment patterns and [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] ones. In a language with [[noun case|cases]], the classification depends on whether the subject (S) of an intransitive verb has the same case as the agent (A) or the patient (P) of a transitive verb. If a language has no cases, but the word order is AVP or PVA, then a classification may reflect whether the subject of an intransitive verb appears on the same side as the agent or the patient of the transitive verb. Bickel (2011) has argued that alignment should be seen as a construction-specific property rather than a language-specific property.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~bickel/research/papers/manifesto.pdf|title=What is typology? - a short note|last=Bickel|first=B.|date=|website=www.uni-leipzig.de|language=de|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages show mixed accusative and ergative behaviour (for example: ergative morphology marking the verb arguments, on top of an accusative syntax). Other languages (called "[[active language]]s") have two types of intransitive verbs&amp;mdash;some of them ("active verbs") join the subject in the same case as the agent of a transitive verb, and the rest ("stative verbs") join the subject in the same case as the patient{{Example needed|date=May 2018}}. Yet other languages behave ergatively only in some contexts (this "[[split ergativity]]" is often based on the grammatical person of the arguments or on the tense/aspect of the verb). For example, only some verbs in [[Georgian language|Georgian]] behave this way, and, as a rule, only while using the [[perfective]] (aorist).

====Phonological systems====
{{main|Phonology}}
Linguistic typology also seeks to identify patterns in the structure and distribution of sound systems among the world's languages. This is accomplished by surveying and analyzing the relative frequencies of different phonological properties. These relative frequencies might, for example, be used to determine why contrastive voicing commonly occurs with plosives, as in English ''neat'' and ''need'', but occurs much more rarely among fricatives, such as the English ''niece'' and ''knees''. According to a worldwide sample of 637 languages,&lt;ref name="Song, 2011"&gt;Song, J.J. (ed.) (2011). The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Typology. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-928125-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 62% have the voicing contrast in stops but only 35% have this in fricatives. In the vast majority of those cases, the absence of voicing contrast occurs because there is a lack of voiced fricatives and because all languages have some form of plosive, but there are languages with no fricatives. Below is a chart showing the breakdown of voicing properties among languages in the aforementioned sample.

Languages worldwide also vary in the number of sounds they use. These languages can go from very small phonemic inventories ([[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] with six consonants and five vowels) to very large inventories ([[Taa language|!Xóõ]] with 128 consonants and 28 vowels). An interesting phonological observation found with this data is that the larger a consonant inventory a language has, the more likely it is to contain a sound from a defined set of complex consonants (clicks, glottalized consonants, doubly articulated labial-velar stops, lateral fricatives and affricates, uvular and pharyngeal consonants, and dental or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives). Of this list, only about 26% of languages in a survey&lt;ref name="Song, 2011"/&gt; of over 600 with small inventories (less than 19 consonants) contain a member of this set, while 51% of average languages (19-25) contain at least one member and 69% of large consonant inventories (greater than 25 consonants) contain a member of this set. It is then seen that complex consonants are in proportion to the size of the inventory.

Vowels contain a more modest number of phonemes, with the average being 5-6, which 51% of the languages in the survey have. About a third of the languages have larger than average vowel inventories. Most interesting though is the lack of relationship between consonant inventory size and vowel inventory size. Below is a chart showing this lack of predictability between consonant and vowel inventory sizes in relation to each other.

==Quantitative typology==
Quantitative typology deals with the distribution and co-occurrence of structural patterns in the languages of the world. Major types of non-chance distribution include:

* preferences (for instance, absolute and implicational [[linguistic universal|universals]], semantic maps, and [[implicational hierarchy|hierarchies]])
* correlations (for instance, areal patterns, such as with a [[Sprachbund]])

Linguistic universals are patterns that can be seen cross linguistically. Universals can either be absolute, meaning that every documented language exhibits this characteristic, or statistical, meaning that this characteristic is seen in most languages or is probable in most languages. Universals, both absolute and statistical can be unrestricted, meaning that they apply to most or all languages without any additional conditions. Conversely, both absolute and statistical universals can be restricted or implicational, meaning that a characteristic will be true on the condition of something else (if Y characteristic is true, then X characteristic is true).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Edith|title=Introducing Language Typology|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, London|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">The '''list of hoards in the Isle of Man''' comprises significant [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[hoard]]s of coins, jewellery, precious and scrap metal objects and other valuable items discovered in the [[Isle of Man]]. It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, [[Foundry|founder's]] hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of [[votive offering]]s which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes [[grave goods]] and single items found in isolation. The list is subdivided into sections according to archaeological and historical periods.

==Viking hoards==
From the 9th to the 13th centuries the Isle of Man was part of the [[Viking]]-ruled [[Kingdom of the Isles]], and several significant hoards from this period have been found on the Isle of Man.  Viking hoards generally comprise a mixture of silver coins, silver jewellery and [[hacksilver]] that has been taken in loot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10515">[[File:Mary Brodrick Egyptologist.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Mary Brodrick]]
Dr. '''Mary (May) Brodrick''' [[F.R.G.S.]] (1858 – 13 July 1933) was a British [[archaeologist]] and [[Egyptologist]] who was one of the first female excavators in Egypt. She persisted in her studies despite the initial opposition of her tutors and fellow students and achieved distinction in her field. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described her in 1906 as "perhaps the greatest lady Egyptologist of the day".&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 26 November 1906. Quoted in Janssen.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Brodrick was born at 18 Navarino Terrace,&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48602 Brodrick, Mary (1858–1933).] David Gill, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 February 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dalston]], Middlesex (now London), on 5 April 1858,&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; the eldest daughter of Thomas and Mary Brodrick. Thomas Brodrick was a solicitor and the [[United Kingdom Census 1861|1861 census]] shows the family living within the Liberty of the Close, in the grounds of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], Wiltshire. Mary Brodrick had sisters Edith and Ethel.&lt;ref&gt;"1861 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census Transcription". ''findmypast''. Retrieved 14 January 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brother, Thomas, born around 1862, died in South Africa in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;"Deaths", ''The Times'', 16 July 1888, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodrick was the first woman to study Egyptology under [[Gaston Maspero]] at the [[Sorbonne]], and Hebrew and Semitic archaeology under [[Ernest Renan]] at the [[Collège de France]]. Neither had been encouraging at first. Maspero had objected, "But we do not take little girls here", and Renan had vowed "I have never taught a woman in my life, and I never will".&lt;ref name=Jan&gt;Janssen, Rosaling &amp; Jac. (1999) "Excavating in the Petrie Museum" in A. Leahy &amp; J. Tait (Eds.) ''Studies on Ancient Egypt in Honour of H.S. Smith''. London: [[Egypt Exploration Society]], pp. 151&amp;ndash;156. {{ISBN|0856981516}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Brodrick insisted on attending, Maspero took the matter up with the Sorbonne council who found nothing in the rules to prevent a woman attending. According to Brodrick, Maspero warned her that she would "probably have a very bad time" and indeed when she first attended she found the students to be rough, rude, and smelly. On one occasion they poured ink down her back. Brodrick simply laughed their tricks off and eventually became great friends with them.&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt;

==Career==
Back in England, Brodrick entered [[College Hall, London]] in 1888 where she studied at [[University College London]] under [[Reginald Stuart Poole|Stuart Poole]] (co-founder with Amelia Edwards of the [[Egypt Exploration Society]]) and [[Peter le Page Renouf]]. She did not enter for a [[University of London]] degree due to her prior studies.&lt;ref name=Times220733&gt;"Dr. Mary Brodrick." by "A correspondent", ''The Times'', 22 July 1933, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of the Committee of Philology and Literary Archaeology of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago 1893 and did work in America for the Egyptian Exploration Fund. She was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1893 by the [[College of the Sisters of Bethany]], University of Kansas, the same institution that had also awarded a PhD to [[Amelia Edwards]].&lt;ref name=Times220733 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"University Jottings", ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', No. 1110, 12 August 1893, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; She lectured at the [[British Museum]] and studied Egyptology under [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1893&amp;ndash;94 and 1894&amp;ndash;95.&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt; She held the Pfeiffer Fellowship of College Hall from 1894–96. In 1896, she was elected a life member of the [[Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris, and a life member of College Hall, London.&lt;ref name=Times220733 /&gt;

From the mid 1890s, Brodrick spent most of her time outside England. She travelled to Italy, Greece and Egypt. She worked under Maspero&lt;ref name=Times220733 /&gt; in Egypt from 1897 to 1908&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt; and was one of the first female excavators in that country.&lt;ref name="Willems"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willems, Harco|title=The Coffin of Heqata: (Cairo JdE 36418) : a Case Study of Egyptian Funerary Culture of the Early Middle Kingdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMiG2dGPpYC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=Peeters|location=Leuven|isbn=978-90-6831-769-5|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt she had her head shaved for reason of hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;"London Notes and Comment", ''[[The Yorkshire Post]]'', 16 November 1934, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodrick became part of the British establishment in Egypt and knew [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]] and [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]. She took a signed portrait of Queen Victoria to a Bedouin sheikh who had been of assistance to the British. In 1913-14, she "took the salute" at Khartoum during the [[General Gordon|Gordon Memorial Service]].&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt;

In 1913, Brodrick was appointed a Lady of Grace of the [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;"Order Of St. John Of Jerusalem", ''[[The Times]]'', 5 March 1913, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected a member (later fellow) of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;"Meetings: Royal Geographical Society: Session 1916-1917", ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 49, No. 2 (February 1917), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mary Brodrick Prize for Geography was given by [[University College London|University College]], London.&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt;

== Writing ==
Brodrick edited a new edition of [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch|Heinrich Brugsch-Bey]]'s ''Egypt under the Pharaohs'' in 1891, and in 1892 translated and edited [[Auguste Mariette]]'s ''Aperçu de l'histoire ancienne d'Egypte'' which was published by Scribner's in New York, 1892, as ''Outlines of Ancient Egyptian History''.

She took on the editorship of the 9th and 10th editions of [[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers|Murray's]] travel handbooks for Egypt (1896 and 1900)&lt;ref&gt;[http://grandhotelsegypt.com/?p=290 "Never hurry a Murray".] ''Egypt in the Golden Age of Travel'', 17 March 2012. Retrieved 28 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and also edited Murray's Syria and Palestine volume.

A selection of her papers and lectures on Egypt, edited by Eversley Robinson, were published posthumously in 1937.

== Death ==
Brodrick died on 13 July 1933 in [[Hindhead]], Surrey.&lt;ref name=Times1933&gt;"Deaths", ''The Times'', 15 July 1933, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral was at St. Alban's Church in that town. As far as is known, Brodrick never married and left no descendants. Years in Egypt had taken their toll and she was not in robust health in her later years. In the year of her death she gave two addresses to College Hall, titled "Retrospect and Prospect" and "Farewell and All Hail".&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt;

Brodrick left a net estate of £46168. She gave £500 to her friend [[Thyra Alleyne]], principal of College Hall, and the same amount to Lucie Dobson, bursar of the hall.

'''Mobile phone tracking''' is the ascertaining of the position or location of a [[mobile phone]], whether stationary or moving. Localization may occur either via [[multilateration]] of radio signals between (several) [[cell tower]]s of the [[cellular network|network]] and the phone, or simply via [[GPS]]. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the [[roaming]] signal to contact the next nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an active call. The [[GSM|Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM) is based on the phone's [[signal strength]] to nearby antenna masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by any mobile phone: Tracking SIM and handset | work=BBC News | date=2005-08-03 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile positioning may include [[location-based service]]s that disclose the actual coordinates of a mobile phone, which is a technology used by [[telecommunication]] companies to [[approximate]] the location of a mobile phone, and thereby also its user.&lt;ref name=swang2008&gt;[http://to.swang.googlepages.com/ICC2008LBSforMobilessimplifiedR2.pdf "Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards“], Shu Wang, Jungwon Min and Byung K. Yi, [http://www.ieee-icc.org/ IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC) 2008], Beijing, China&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The technology of locating is based on measuring power levels and [[antenna pattern]]s and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates [[wireless]]ly with one of the closest [[base station]]s, so knowledge of the location of the base station implies the cell phone is nearby.

Advanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by [[interpolating]] signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in [[urban area]]s where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Rural]] and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.

[[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] localization uses [[multilateration]] to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, or dedicated trackers, usually with the intent to locate the user.&lt;ref name=swang2008 /&gt;

The location of a mobile phone can be determined in a number of ways:

===Network-based===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using the service provider's network infrastructure. The advantage of network-based techniques, from a service provider's point of view, is that they can be implemented non-intrusively without affecting handsets. Network-based techniques were developed many years prior to the widespread availability of GPS on handsets. (See {{cite patent |country=US |number=5519760 |gdate=21 May 1996}} for one of the first works relating to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/1-5200-RD24-Mobile-positioning-using-wireless-networks.pdf Mobile Positioning Using Wireless Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The accuracy of network-based techniques varies, with cell identification as the least accurate and [[triangulation]] as moderately accurate, and newer "advanced forward link [[trilateration]]" timing methods as the most accurate. The accuracy of network-based techniques is both dependent on the concentration of cell base stations, with urban environments achieving the highest possible accuracy because of the higher number of [[cell tower]]s, and the implementation of the most current timing methods.

One of the key challenges of network-based techniques is the requirement to work closely with the service provider, as it entails the installation of hardware and software within the operator's infrastructure. Frequently the compulsion associated with a legislative framework, such as [[Enhanced 9-1-1]], is required before a service provider will deploy a solution.

===Handset-based===
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using [[client software]] installed on the handset.&lt;ref&gt;Handset-based mobile phone tracking app example 1: [http://www.crystalball.tv/mobile-phone-tracking/ MobileTrack]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique determines the location of the handset by putting its location by cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with [[GPS]] then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier.

Another approach is to use a fingerprinting-based technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2012-01-01|title=CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6062428|journal=IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|volume=61|issue=1|pages=286–296|doi=10.1109/TVT.2011.2173771|issn=0018-9545|arxiv=1110.3425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2010-12-01|title=CellSense: A Probabilistic RSSI-Based GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5683779|journal=2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683779|arxiv=1004.3178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2011-06-01|title=A Hidden Markov Model for Localization Using Low-End GSM Cell Phones|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5962993|journal=2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/icc.2011.5962993|arxiv=1010.3411}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the "signature" of the home and neighboring cells signal strengths at different points in the area of interest is recorded by [[wardriving|war-driving]] and matched in real-time to determine the handset location. This is usually performed independent from the carrier.

The key disadvantage of handset-based techniques, from service provider's point of view, is the necessity of installing software on the handset. It requires the active cooperation of the mobile subscriber as well as software that must be able to handle the different [[operating system]]s of the handsets. Typically, [[smartphone]]s, such as one based on [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Windows Phone]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[iOS]], or [[Android (operating system)|Android]], would be able to run such software, e.g. Google Maps.

One proposed work-around is the installation of [[embedded system|embedded]] hardware or software on the handset by the manufacturers, e.g., [[Enhanced Observed Time Difference]] (E-OTD). This avenue has not made significant headway, due to the difficulty of convincing different manufacturers to cooperate on a common mechanism and to address the cost issue. Another difficulty would be to address the issue of foreign handsets that are roaming in the network.

===SIM-based===
Using the [[subscriber identity module]] (SIM) in [[GSM]] and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) handsets, it is possible to obtain raw radio measurements from the handset.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI TS 102 223 V9.1.0 SIM standard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.co.nz/article/484018/vodafone_local_zone_-_landline_your_mobile|title= Vodafone Local Zone|work= PC World|author=Ted Gibbons|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available measurements include the serving [[Cell ID]], round-trip time, and signal strength. The type of information obtained via the SIM can differ from that which is available from the handset. For example, it may not be possible to obtain any raw measurements from the handset directly, yet still obtain measurements via the SIM.

===Wi-Fi===
[[Crowdsourcing|Crowdsourced]] Wi-Fi data can also be used to identify a handset's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A on Location Data|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html|work=apple.com|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor performance of the GPS-based methods in indoor environment and the increasing popularity of Wi-Fi have encouraged companies to design new and feasible methods to carry out Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title=Improving WLAN-Based Indoor Mobile Positioning Using Sparsity
 | journal=Asilomar Conference on Signal Processing 2012|url=http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fowler/Improving%20WLAN-Based%20Indoor%20Mobile%20Positioning%20Using%20Sparsity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[smartphone]]s combine [[satellite navigation|Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS), such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]], with [[Wi-Fi positioning system]]s.

=== Hybrid ===
[[Hybrid positioning system]]s use a combination of network-based and handset-based technologies for location determination. One example would be some modes of [[Assisted GPS]], which can both use [[GPS]] and network information to compute the location. Both types of data are thus used by the telephone to make the location more accurate (i.e., A-GPS). Alternatively tracking with both systems can also occur by having the phone attain its GPS-location directly from the [[satellite]]s, and then having the information sent via the network to the person that is trying to locate the telephone. Such systems include [[Google Maps]], as well as, [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]'s [[OTDOA]] and [[E-CellID]].

There are also hybrid positioning systems which combine several different location approaches to position mobile devices by [[Wi-Fi]], [[WiMAX]], GSM, LTE, [[IP address]]es, and network environment data.

== Operational purpose ==
In order to route calls to a phone, the [[cell site|cell towers]] listen for a signal sent from the phone and negotiate which tower is best able to communicate with the phone. As the phone changes location, the antenna towers monitor the signal, and the phone is "roamed" to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple antenna towers, a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and [[phase discrimination]].

Newer phones may also allow the tracking of the phone even when turned on and not active in a telephone call. This results from the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bearer interest ==
A phone's location can be uploaded to a common website where one's friends and family can view one's last reported position. Newer phones may have built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]] which could be used in a similar fashion, but with much higher accuracy. This is controversial, because data on a common website means people who are not "friends and family" may be able to view the information.

== Privacy ==
Locating or positioning touches upon delicate [[privacy]] issues, since it enables someone to check where a person is without the person's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waxman |first1=Seth |title=Brief for technology companies as amici curiae in support of neither party |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-402-ac-technology-companies.pdf |website=scotusblog |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning.&lt;br/&gt;

He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of [[Germany]]'s [[data retention]] at the time, saying, "This is six months of my life [...] You can see where I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing." He partnered up with [[Die Zeit|ZEIT Online]] and made his information publicly available in an [http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-vorratsdaten interactive map] which allows users to watch his entire movements during that time in fast-forward. Spitz concluded that technology consumers are the key to challenging privacy norms in today's society who "have to fight for self determination in the digital age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/malte-spitzs-ted-talk-_n_1701775.html | title=Malte Spitz's TED Talk Takes On Mobile Phone Privacy Debate (VIDEO) | publisher=Huffington Post | date=25 July 2012 | accessdate=26 January 2016 | author=Fitzgerald, Britney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz | title=Betrayed by our own data | publisher=ZEIT | date=10 March 2011 | accessdate=26 January 2016 | author=Biermann, Kai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'' that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant.

:''For the municipality in the Philippines, see [[Picong, Lanao del Sur]].''

'''Picong''' or '''Piquant''' is light comical banter, usually at someone else's expense.  It is the way in which [[West Indies|West Indians]] (particularly those in the [[Eastern Caribbean]]) tease, heckle and mock each other in a friendly manner.  However, the line between humour and insult is fine and constantly shifting, and at times the convivial spirit may degenerate into more heated debate and perhaps, physical altercations. The ability to engage in picong without crossing over into insult is highly valued in the culture of [[calypso music]].

The sanctuary of [[Minerva]] at '''Portonaccio''' is an [[archaeological site]] on the western side of the plateau on which the ancient [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of [[Veii]], north of [[Rome]], [[Italy]], was located. The site takes its name from the locality within the village of Isola Farnese, part of Municipio XX, city of [[Rome]].

It is important for the elaborate polychrome terracotta decoration that was found here with a quantity and quality unparalleled in Etruria, much of which can be seen in the [[Villa Giulia]].

==The site==
The sanctuary complex was built in the 7th c. BC in a cutting on the side of the hill over which the city wall of Veii towered. One of the richest sources of Etruscan artifacts (pottery and other objects inscribed in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and [[terra cotta]] statuary and other decorative elements), it contained two main structures, one a sanctuary dedicated to the goddess [[Menerva]] (Etruscan spelling) and the other a temple that had statues of [[Turms]], [[Hercle]], Apollo (the [[Apollo of Veii]]) and [[Leto]] on the roof, which has come to be regarded as a temple of Apollo. Next to the temple of Apollo was a rectangular pool and a well provided water. The site has been left wooded, as it was in ancient times, when surrounded by a sacred grove and a wall.

The roof of the temple of Apollo has been restored on one side.

The site was excavated in modern times by [[Massimo Pallottino]] in the 1940s and published decades later by the first and second generation of his students. 

===The sanctuary to Minerva===
The Portonaccio ''Sanctuary of Minerva'' was the first [[Tuscan order|Tuscan–type]], i.e., [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], temple erected in [[Etruria]] (about 510 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boitani|first=Francesca|title=Apollo di Veio |url=http://www.apollodiveio.it/en/opera.asp|publisher=National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia|accessdate=25 February 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstruction proposed for it in 1993 by Giovanni Colonna together with Germano Foglia, presents a square {{convert|60|ft|m}} construction on a low podium (about 18 metres, considering the 29&amp;nbsp;cm foundation) and divided into a pronapse with two columns making up the facade between entrances, {{convert|24|ft|m}} deep and a group in the back made up of three {{convert|30|ft|m}} deep adjacent cells. The {{convert|21|ft|m|sing=on}} columns were made of stuccoed [[tuff]]&lt;!--NOT tufa--&gt; as were the walls, which inside the pronapse were decorated with various paintings on clay panels. The roof was in wood covered with polychrome terracotta. The terracotta was placed through a refined system of syllabic abbreviations and they were integrated with bronze inserts and a generous profusion of plastic inserts, mostly modelled by hand, among which a splendid series of grand [[antefix]]es (joint coverings) with the heads of [[Gorgon]]s, [[maenad]]s and [[satyr]]s.

===The temple of Apollo===

This sanctuary, among the most ancient and venerated on all of Etruria, was outside of the city and on a road leading to the Tyrrhenian coast and the Veii salt flats. Its most ancient nucleus was tied to the cult of the goddess Minerva and a small temple, a square altar, a portico and stairs from the road were built in about 530-530 BC in her honour. The three-cell temple with the polychrome terracotta decorations was erected in about 510 BC in the western part of the sanctuary.&lt;ref name="Moretti2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna Maria Sgubini Moretti|title=Veio, Cerveteri, Vulci: città d'Etruria a confronto : Roma, Museo nazionale etrusco di Villa Giulia, Villa Poniatowski, 1 ottobre-30 dicembre 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQde8hMY_88C&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 January 2001|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=978-88-8265-174-9|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to the temple there was a great pool with a tunnel and a fence that enclosed the sacred woods. The temple was in honour of the god Apollo in his prophetic oracle aspect inspired after the Delphi model to which purification ceremonies were tied. Heracles, the hero made god dear to tyrants, and maybe also Jupiter, whose image we have to imagine on the central wall of the temple were tied to Apollo. 

By the middle of the 5th century BC, all work on the temple was complete and it began a slow decline while the structures sacred to Minerva were renovated on the eastern sector of the sanctuary. The starting up again of the cult worshipping Minerva, which continued also after the conquering of Veii by Rome (396 BC) is documented by a splendid series of votive statues of classic and late-classic style boys, such as the famous head, “Malavolta” as to indicate the important role of the goddess in the rituals of the passage from adolescence to adulthood that signalled the fundamental phases of the life of the members of the aristocratic families of Veii. In the 2nd century BC, the tuff mine that destroyed the central area of the sanctuary was opened causing damage to the temple and the sliding down of material downhill. The recovery of the fragments of the sanctuary determined the start up of excavations in 1914, which continued after the discovery of the famous [[Apollo of Veii|statue of Apollo]] in 1916.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10124">'''Project Socrates''' was a classified U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] program established in 1983 within the [[Reagan administration]].  It was founded and directed by physicist Michael C. Sekora to determine why the United States was unable to maintain economic competitiveness—and to rectify the situation.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/spurring-americas-economic-renaissance|title=Spurring America's Economic Renaissance|last=Sanders|first=Joshua|date=September 14, 2010|publisher=Economy in Crisis|accessdate=31 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126122329/http://www.economyincrisis.org/content/spurring-americas-economic-renaissance|archivedate=26 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronald E. | last = Yates | title = For Some Executives, `Trade Wars` Taking On A Literal Meaning | date = 1992-07-05 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-05/business/9202290952_1_foreign-corporations-competitiveness-international-business | work = Chicago Tribune | accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Project Socrates:&lt;blockquote&gt; [B]ird’s eye view of competition went far beyond, in terms of scope and completeness, the extremely narrow slices of data that were available to the professors, professional economists, and consultants that addressed the issue of competitiveness.  The conclusions that the Socrates team derived about competitiveness in general and about the U.S. in particular were in almost all cases in direct opposition to what the professors, economists and consultants had been saying for years, and to what had been accepted as irrefutable underlying truths by decision-makers throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name="Sanders"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Reagan's presidential term ended and the [[George H. W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] came to the White House, Project Socrates was labeled as "[[industrial policy]]", and began to fall from favor.  As a result, in April 1990, the program was defunded.&lt;ref name="Wicker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/24/opinion/in-the-nation-the-high-tech-future.html?pagewanted=all|title=IN THE NATION; The High-Tech Future|last=Wicker|first=Tom|date=May 24, 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = John | last = Markoff | title = Technology Official Quits at Pentagon | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/technology-official-quits-at-pentagon.html | date = May 20, 1990 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
In 1983 Sekora was an intelligence officer within the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), working on preventing the flow of western military technologies to the Soviet Union.  At the time, the intelligence agencies of the [[Soviet Union]] like the [[KGB]] and [[GRU]] were very aggressive in their efforts to acquire technology from the United States as well as from various other western countries like [[France]] and [[Germany]]. They were using a multitude of covert and overt, legal and illegal means to acquire western [[military technology|military technologies]]. For example, DIA would block KGB's acquisition of a sensitive U.S. technology that the KGB had trans-shipped through an intricate maze of front companies throughout [[Africa]] (it turns out that the KGB was ultimately successful by trans-shipping it through European front companies).

It became clear that the United States' technology policy was radically different from the policies of all the other countries that Sekora had interacted with. The U.S. technology policy consisted primarily of protection in the form of [[export control]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to prevent the flow of U.S.-developed technology to military adversaries. In contrast, the technology policies of all other countries of the world addressed the flow of technology both into and out of the country.  Surprisingly, this was the policy of both U.S. adversaries and allied countries, and it was used by the countries to address both their military as well as commercial technologies.

The U.S. approach was premised on the notion that all technology of value to the United States was in the United States, that the most effective means to have the technology was to execute internal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D), so therefore, the only necessary national technology policy was to prevent its flow out of the country. In addition, only the flow of U.S. military critical technologies to the United States' military adversaries needed to be restricted.

So while the U.S. approach to technology policy was focused on simply reducing the flow of military technology, its ability to generate an economic competitive advantage was starting to rapidly deteriorate in several key industries, including the [[U.S. auto industry]]. By contrast, other countries were executing strategies to manage the flows of commercial and military technologies into and out of their respective countries to systematically and efficiently build their economic and military strengths.

Sekora concluded that in order for the United States to remain competitive, economically and militarily, the United States must abandon its simplistic approach to technology and execute strategies that managed the flows of technology into and out of the country in a manner that was superior to that which was executed by all its military competitors and commercial adversaries. The rest of the world was playing chess with the world's technologies, and the United States had to become the grand master of technology chess.

Sekora thereafter initiated the Socrates Project within the Defense Intelligence Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sekora | first1 = Michael | title = Mastering the Art of Competition | publisher = Jossey Bass | date = 28 Jan 2010  | isbn = 978-0-470-50071-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Wrubel | title = The Frontal Assault: A Conversation with Michael Sekora | date = 1990-07-10 | work = Financial World Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Lisa | last = Shuchman | title = World War Inc.?

==Mission==
The Socrates Project from its inception had a twofold mission. First was to determine the true underlying cause of the United States' declining competitiveness. Second was to use this understanding to develop the means to rebuild America's competitiveness.

In the early 1980s, it was becoming apparent to some people that the United States was losing its competitiveness. However, the Socrates team saw that what amounted to "one-liner" explanations of the reasons for the United States' declining competitiveness (e.g., "Japan, Inc.", "A non-level playing field")—which were widely distributed and fully accepted—were too superficial for Socrates' mission of rebuilding America's competitiveness, and were not supported by what was seen while working on the issue of preventing the [[Soviets]] from acquiring Western technology. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

To determine the source of the U.S. competitiveness problem, Project Socrates assembled an all-source intelligence system which enabled the project to examine competition on a global scale. The combination of deep intelligence and digital data provided a bird's-eye, holistic view of all forms of competition worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Esther | last = Smith | title = DoD Unveils Competitive Tool: Project Socrates Offers Valuable Analysis | date = 1988-05-05 | work = Washington Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socrates' discoveries==
Project Socrates identified five key mental shifts which had to take place in order to restore the United States' competitive edge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mike Sekora: Towards a technology based strategy | journal = Trade Reform | date = 2010-08-27 | first = Michael | last = Stumo| id = | url = http://www.tradereform.org/2010/08/mike-sekora-towards-a-technology-based-strategy/ | accessdate = 2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Decision-makers must revert to technology exploitation (i.e., the acquisition and utilization of technology to include R&amp;D) as the foundation for their decision-making—technology-based planning.
# The exploitation of the technology is the most effective foundation for decision making for the complete set of functions within the private and public sectors that determine U.S. competitiveness.
# To exploit technology more effectively than its competitors, the United States must generate and lead the next evolutionary step in technology exploitation—the automated innovation revolution.
# A system was developed within the Socrates Project of the [[U.S. intelligence community]], and then refined in the private sector, that would enable the United States to generate and lead the automated innovation revolution providing U.S. private and public organizations with the ability to generate and maintain a major competitive advantage over all competitors worldwide for many generations.
# The automated innovation system would, in addition, enable the U.S. private and public organizations to execute automated innovation in a manner that would enable the full range of U.S. resources to be exploited in a highly coherent, flexible, and independent fashion, further increasing the competitive advantages achieved and maintained by the U.S. organizations.

'''Rano Raraku''' is a volcanic crater formed of consolidated [[volcanic ash]], or [[tuff]], and located on the lower slopes of [[Terevaka]] in the [[Rapa Nui National Park]] on [[Easter Island]] in [[Chile]]. It was a [[quarry]] for about 500 years until the early eighteenth century, and supplied the stone from which about 95% of the island's known monolithic sculptures ([[moai]]) were carved. Rano Raraku is a visual record of moai design vocabulary and technological innovation, where 887 moai remain. Rano Raraku is in the [[World Heritage Site]] of Rapa Nui National Park and gives its name to one of the seven sections of the park.

==Description==
{{wide image|Rapanui-cratere-rana roratka-panorama.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Rano Raraku's [[crater lake]]}}

The sides of Rano Raraku crater are high and steep except on the north and northwest, where they are much lower and gently sloping.  The interior contains one of the island's three freshwater [[crater lake]]s, which is bordered by [[Totora (plant)|nga'atu or totora]] reeds. These plants, once thought as evidence of contact with the South American mainland, are now known to have been growing on the island for at least 30,000 years and were used by the [[Rapa Nui]] for thatched shelter and swimming aids.

==Incomplete moai in the quarry==
[[File:Isla de Pascua, Chile. 03.jpg|thumb|An incomplete moai in quarry]]

The incomplete statues in the quarry are remarkable both for their number, for the inaccessibility of some that were high on the outside crater wall and for the size of the largest; at 21.6&amp;nbsp;m (71&amp;nbsp;feet) in height, almost twice that of any moai ever completed and weighing an estimated 270 tonnes, many times the weight of any transported.

Some of the incomplete moai seem to have been abandoned after the carvers encountered inclusions of very hard rock in the material.

Others may be sculptures that were never intended to be separated from the rock in which they are carved.

==Standing moai at Ranu Raraku==
On the outside of the quarry are a number of moai, some of which are partially buried to their shoulders in the spoil from the quarry. They are distinctive in that their eyes were not hollowed out, they do not have [[pukao]] and they were not cast down in [[History of Easter Island|the island's civil wars]]. For this last reason, they supplied some of the most famous images of the island.

===Tukuturi===

Tukuturi is an unusual moai. Its beard and kneeling posture distinguish it from standard moai.

The peculiar posture of this statue is well known on Easter Island and is called ''tuku turi'' or simply ''tuku.'' It was the posture used by the men and women who formed the chorus in the festivals called ''riu,'' where the posture was known as ''tuku riu''. Typical also of the singers was the slightly backward inclination of the trunk, the raised head, and the goatee, all also seen in the statue.&lt;ref name = Englert&gt;Englert, Father Sebastian. ''Island at the Center of the World: New Light on Easter Island.'' New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

A triangular hill is in the background and the sea in the top right|Tukuturi, with [[Poike]] in the background and [[Ahu Tongariki]] against the spray on the right]]

Tukuturi is made of red [[scoria]] from [[Puna Pau]], but sits at Rano Raraku, the [[tuff]] quarry. It is possibly related to the [[Tangata manu]] cult, in which case it would be one of the last moai ever made.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Anne Van Tilburg (1994). ''Easter Island Archaeology, Ecology and Culture,'' p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely that this statue represents a riu singer and was made after the production of classic statues had ceased.&lt;ref name = Englert/&gt;

[[File:Red herring.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herrings [[kipper]]ed by smoking and salting until they turn reddish-brown, i.e., a "red herring". Prior to refrigeration kipper was known for being strongly [[pungency|pungent]]. In 1807, William Cobbett wrote how he used [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to lay a false trail, while training [[hunting dog]]s—an [[apocrypha]]l story that was probably the origin of the idiom.]]

A '''red herring''' is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. red herring, n. Third edition, September 2009; online version December 2011. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/160314; accessed 18 December 2011. An entry for this word was first included in New English Dictionary, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be either a logical [[fallacy]] or a [[literary device]] that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion. A red herring might be intentionally used, such as in mystery fiction or as part of [[rhetorical strategies]] (e.g., in politics), or it could be inadvertently used during argumentation.

The term was popularized in 1807 by English polemicist [[William Cobbett]], who told a story of having used a [[kipper]] (a strong-smelling smoked fish) to divert hounds from chasing a hare.

== Logical fallacy ==

As an [[informal fallacy]], the red herring falls into a broad class of [[relevance]] fallacies. Unlike the [[straw man]], which is premised on a distortion of the other party's position,&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hurley, Patrick J.|title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-8400-3417-5|pages=131–133|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222174516/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ikp2dGWT5O4C&amp;pg=PT155|archivedate=2017-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the red herring is a seemingly plausible, though ultimately irrelevant, diversionary tactic.&lt;ref name="Tindale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tindale, Christopher W.|title=Fallacies and Argument Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84208-2|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a red herring may be intentional, or unintentional; it is not necessarily a conscious intent to mislead.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The expression is mainly used to assert that an argument is not relevant to the issue being discussed. For example, ''"I think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis, and we do not want our salaries affected."'' The second sentence, though used to support the first sentence, does not address that topic.

== Intentional device ==

In fiction and non-fiction a red herring may be intentionally used by the writer to plant a false clue that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUXdoqa4wBAC&amp;pg=PA142 |page=142 |author=Niazi, Nozar |title=How To Study Literature: Stylistic And Pragmatic Approaches |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The character's name is a loose [[Italian language|Italian]] translation of "red herring" (''aringa rosa''; ''rosa'' actually meaning ''pink'', and very close to ''rossa'', ''red'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oxford Handbook of the Reception History of the Bible | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iePi5FO-bxAC&amp;pg=PA370 | page=370 | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2011 | isbn=9780199670390 | authors=Lieb, Michael; Mason, Emma; and Roberts, Jonathan | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222231515/https://books.google.com/books?id=iePi5FO-bxAC&amp;pg=PA370 | archivedate=2017-02-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A red herring is often used in legal studies and exam problems to mislead and distract students from reaching a correct conclusion about a legal issue, allegedly as a device that tests students' comprehension of underlying law and their ability to properly discern material factual circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=Steve (ed.)|title=The history of legal education in the United States : commentaries and primary sources|date=2005|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Clark, N.J.|isbn=1584776900|edition=2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the idiom ==

{{quote box|author=-[[William Cobbett]], February 14, 1807|title=Continental War|source=''Cobbett's Political Register, Volume XI''&lt;ref name=cobbett/&gt;|quote="When I was a boy, we used, in order to draw oft' the [[Harrier (dog)|harriers]] from the trail of a [[hare]] that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt&lt;ref&gt;''haunt'' – Wiktionary defines [[wikt:haunt|haunt]] as a "place at which one is regularly found; a hangout", but it can also mean a "feeding place for animals", both senses would work here.&lt;/ref&gt; early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches, across fields and through [[coppices]], till we got to a point, whence we were pretty sure the hunters would not return to the spot where they had thrown off; and, though I would, by no means, be understood, as comparing the editors and proprietors of the London daily press to animals half so sagacious and so faithful as hounds, I cannot help thinking, that, in the case to which we are referring, they must have been misled, at first, by some political deceiver."|width=30%|border=4px|align=right}}

In a literal sense, there is no such fish as a "red herring"; it refers to a particularly strong [[kipper]], a fish (typically a [[herring]]) that has been strongly [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] in [[brine]] and/or heavily [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]]. This process makes the fish particularly pungent smelling and, with strong enough brine, turns its flesh reddish.&lt;ref name=quinion2002&gt;{{cite web | author=Quinion, Michael | year=2002–2008 | title=The Lure of the Red Herring | work=[[World Wide Words]] | url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | accessdate=November 10, 2010 | authorlink=Michael Quinion | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180714/http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/herring.htm | archivedate=November 4, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its literal sense as a strongly cured kipper, the term can be dated to the mid-13th century, in the poem ''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'' by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]]: "He eteþ no ffyssh But heryng red."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter de Bibbesworth|Bibbesworth, Walter de]] (c. 1250) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg ''Femina''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=hmocAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Femina&amp;dq=Femina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KcecUKrvNpGImQW0zIDoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCg |date=2017-12-30 }} Trinity College, Cambridge MS B.14.40. 27.

Prior to 2008,&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; the [[figurative sense]] of "red herring" was thought to originate from a supposed technique of training young [[scent hound]]s.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; There are variations of the story, but according to one version, the pungent red herring would be dragged along a trail until a puppy learned to follow the scent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]]. (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Nashes Lenten Stuffe''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} "Next, to draw on hounds to a sent, to a redde herring skinne there is nothing comparable." (Since Nashe makes this statement not in a serious reference to hunting but as an aside in a humorous pamphlet, the professed aim of which is to extol the wonderful virtues of red herrings, it need not be evidence of actual practice. In the same paragraph he makes other unlikely claims, such as that the fish dried and powdered is a prophylactic for kidney or gallstones.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the dog was being trained to follow the faint odour of a [[Fox hunting|fox]] or a [[badger]], the trainer would drag a red herring (whose strong scent confuses the animal) perpendicular to the animal's trail to confuse the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jal.2008.09.004 |first=J.E.P |last=Currall  |year=2008 |title=Authenticity: a red herring? |journal=Journal of Applied Logic |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=534–544 |issn=1570-8683|last2=Moss |first2=M.S. |last3=Stuart |first3=S.A.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog eventually learned to follow the original scent rather than the stronger scent. A variation of this story is given, without mention of its use in training, in ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' (1976), with the earliest use cited being from W. F. Butler's ''Life of Napier'', published in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[[Burton Stevenson|Stevenson, Burton]] (ed.) (1976) [1948] ''The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' New York: Macmillan. p.1139. {{ISBN|0-02-614500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1981) gives the full phrase as "Drawing a red herring across the path", an idiom meaning "to divert attention from the main question by some side issue"; here, once again, a "dried, smoked and salted" herring when "drawn across a fox's path destroys the scent and sets the hounds at fault."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ivor H. (ed.) (1981) ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]] (Centenary edition, revised) New York: Harper &amp; Row. p.549. {{ISBN|0-06-014903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation of the dog story is given by Robert Hendrickson (1994) who says escaping convicts used the pungent fish to throw off hounds in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, Robert (2000). ''The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins''. United States: Checkmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a pair of articles by Professor Gerald Cohen and Robert Scott Ross published in ''Comments on Etymology'' (2008), supported by etymologist [[Michael Quinion]] and accepted by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the idiom did not originate from a hunting practice.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Ross researched the origin of the story and found the earliest reference to using herrings for training animals was in a tract on horsemanship published in 1697 by Gerland Langbaine.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Langbaine recommended a method of training horses (not hounds) by dragging the carcass of a cat or fox so that the horse would be accustomed to following the chaos of a hunting party.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; He says if a dead animal is not available, a red herring would do as a substitute.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; This recommendation was misunderstood by Nicholas Cox, published in the notes of another book around the same time, who said it should be used to train hounds (not horses).&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Either way, the herring was not used to distract the hounds or horses from a trail, rather to guide them along it.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

The earliest reference to using herring for distracting hounds is an article published on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist [[William Cobbett]] in his polemical periodical ''[[Political Register]]''.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Red herring", [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Sense 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobbett&gt;"...we used, in order to draw oft' the harriers from the trail of a hare that we had set down as our own private property, get to her haunt early in the morning, and drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four or five miles over hedges and ditches..." For the full original story by Cobbett, see [https://archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb#page/116/mode/2up "Continental War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629152657/http://www.archive.org/stream/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-06-29 }} on pg. 231-33 of ''Political Register'', February 14, 1807. In [https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb ''Cobbett's political register, Volume XI, 1807''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803231251/https://archive.org/details/cobbettspolitica11cobb |date=2016-08-03 }} at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is the origin of the figurative meaning of red herring.&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a red herring to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt; Quinion concludes: "This story, and [Cobbett's] extended repetition of it in 1833, was enough to get the figurative sense of ''red herring'' into the minds of his readers, unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen."&lt;ref name=quinion2002/&gt;

=== Real-world usage ===

Although Cobbett popularized the figurative usage, he was not the first to consider red herring for scenting hounds in a literal sense; an earlier reference occurs in the pamphlet ''Nashe's Lenten Stuffe'', published in 1599 by the Elizabethan writer [[Thomas Nashe]], in which he says "Next, to draw on hounds to a scent, to a red herring skin there is nothing comparable."&lt;ref name=Nashe&gt;[[Thomas Nashe|Nashe, Thomas]] (1599) [http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf ''Praise of the Red Herring''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030947/http://www.oxford-shakespeare.com/Nashe/Nashes_Lenten_Stuff.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }} In: William Oldys and John Malham (Eds) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22on%20hounds%20to%20a%20scent%22&amp;f=false  ''The Harleian miscellany''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230213316/https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=JxOjdlsWMGcC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;lpg=PA331&amp;dq=%22on+hounds+to+a+scent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LZlI9hToJr&amp;sig=aqRgPgjXnFakagAqVgvlw9YpOtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3JUuT4rlGOa5iQfnoNjdDg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA |date=2017-12-30 }} Volume 2, Printed for R. Dutton, 1809. Page 331.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' makes no connection with Nashe's quote and the figurative meaning of red herring to distract from the intended target, only in the literal sense of a hunting practice to draw dogs towards a scent.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The use of herring to distract pursuing scent hounds was tested on [[MythBusters (2010 season)#Episode 148 – Hair of the Dog|Episode 148]] of the series ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1683693|MythBusters: Season 9, Episode 1 - Hair of the Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the hound used in the test stopped to eat the fish and lost the fugitive's scent temporarily, it eventually backtracked and located the target, resulting in the myth being classified by the show as "Busted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog Episode 148: Hair of the Dog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105122838/http://mythbustersresults.com/hair-of-the-dog |date=2012-11-05 }}, Mythbustersresults.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mean sea level''' ('''MSL''') (often shortened to '''sea level''') is an [[mean|average]] level of the surface of one or more of [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]s from which heights such as [[elevation]] may be measured. MSL is a type of [[Geodetic datum#Vertical datum|vertical datum]]{{spaced ndash}}a standardised [[geodetic datum]]{{spaced ndash}}that is used, for example, as a [[chart datum]] in [[cartography]] and [[Navigation|marine navigation]], or, in aviation, as the [[standard sea level]] at which [[atmospheric pressure]] is measured to [[Calibration|calibrate]] altitude and, consequently, aircraft [[flight level]]s. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a [[Tide|mean low and mean high tide]] at a particular location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/148/what-is-sea-level#1 ''What is "Mean Sea Level"?''] ([[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea levels can be affected by many factors and are known to have varied greatly over [[Geologic time scale|geological time scale]]s. The careful measurement of variations in MSL can offer insights into ongoing [[climate change]], and [[sea level rise]] has been widely quoted as evidence of ongoing [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Solomon ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-3-4.html Technical Summary, Section 3.4 Consistency Among Observations] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}; Hegerl ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains1-3.html Executive summary, Section 1.3: Consistency of changes in physical and biological systems with warming] in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''above sea level'' generally refers to [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL).

== Measurement ==
[[File:Recent Sea Level Rise.png|thumb|Sea level measurements from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments show a rise of around {{convert|200|mm|in}} during the 20th century (2 mm/year).]]

Precise determination of a "mean sea level" is difficult to achieve because of the many factors that affect sea level.&lt;ref name=USNRC32&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]], ''Bulletin of the National Research Council 1932'' page 270&lt;/ref&gt; Sea level varies quite a lot on several scales of time and space. This is because the sea is in constant motion, affected by the tides, wind, atmospheric pressure, local gravitational differences, temperature, [[salinity]] and so forth. The easiest way this may be calculated is by selecting a location and calculating the mean sea level at that point and use it as a [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]. For example, a period of 19 years of hourly level observations may be averaged and used to determine the mean sea level at some measurement point.

To an operator of a [[tide gauge]], MSL means the "still water level"—the level of the sea with motions such as [[wind wave]]s averaged out—averaged over a period of time such that changes in sea level, e.g., due to the [[tide]]s, also get averaged out. One measures the values of MSL in respect to the land. Hence a change in MSL can result from a real change in sea level, or from a change in the height of the land on which the tide gauge operates.

In the UK, the [[Ordnance Datum]] (the 0 metres height on UK maps) is the mean sea level measured at [[Newlyn]] in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921. Prior to 1921, the datum was MSL at the [[Victoria Dock (Liverpool)|Victoria Dock, Liverpool]].

Since the times of the [[Russian Empire]], in [[Russia]] and other former its parts, now independent states, the sea level is measured from the zero level of [[Kronstadt]] Sea-Gauge. 

In Hong Kong, "mPD" is a surveying term meaning "metres above Principal Datum" and refers to height of 1.230m below the average sea level.

In France, the Marégraphe in Marseilles measures continuously the sea level since 1883 and offers the longest collapsed data about the sea level. It is used for a part of continental Europe and main part of Africa as official sea level. Elsewhere in Europe vertical elevation references (European Vertical Reference System) are made to the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|Amsterdam Peil]] elevation, which dates back to the 1690s.

Satellite altimeters have been making precise measurements of sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/94JC00478/full|title=Evaluating models of sea state bias in satellite altimetry|publisher=NASA|date=1994|doi=10.1029/94JC00478|bibcode=1994JGR....9912581G|volume=99|issue=C6|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|page=12581|last1=Glazman|first1=Roman E|last2=Greysukh|first2=Alexander|last3=Zlotnicki|first3=Victor}}[[Roman Glazman]]
Greysukh, A. M., Zlotnicki, V.&lt;/ref&gt; since the launch of [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] in 1992. A joint mission of [[NASA]] and [[CNES]], TOPEX/Poseidon was followed by [[Jason-1]] in 2001 and the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission]] on the Jason-2 satellite in 2008.

{{main|Elevation{{!}}Elevation}}

''Height above mean sea level'' (''AMSL'') is the elevation (on the ground) or altitude (in the air) of an object, relative to the average sea level datum. It is also used in aviation, where some heights are recorded and reported with respect to mean sea level (MSL) (contrast with [[flight level]]), and in the [[atmospheric sciences]], and [[land surveying]]. An alternative is to base height measurements on an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] of the entire Earth, which is what systems such as [[GPS]] do. In aviation, the ellipsoid known as [[World Geodetic System]] 84 is increasingly used to define heights; however, differences {{citation needed span|up to {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=off}}|date=December 2018}} exist between this ellipsoid height and mean tidal height. The alternative is to use a [[geoid]]-based vertical [[datum (geodesy)|datum]] such as [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988|NAVD88]].

When referring to [[geography|geographic]] features such as mountains on a [[topographic map]], variations in elevation are shown by [[contour line]]s. The elevation of a mountain denotes the highest point or summit and is typically illustrated as a small circle on a topographic map with the AMSL height shown in metres, feet or both.

In the rare case that a location is below sea level, the elevation AMSL is negative. For one such case, see [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]].

==== Difficulties in use ====
[[File:Geoida.svg|thumb|{{ordered list |Ocean |[[Reference ellipsoid]] |Local [[Plumb-bob|plumb line]] |[[Continent]] |[[Geoid]]}}]]

To extend this definition far from the sea means comparing the local height of the mean sea surface with a "level" reference surface, or geodetic datum, called the geoid. In a state of rest or absence of external forces, the mean sea level would coincide with this geoid surface, being an equipotential surface of the Earth's [[gravitation]]al field. In reality, due to currents, air pressure variations, temperature and salinity variations, etc., this does not occur, not even as a long-term average. The location-dependent, but persistent in time, separation between mean sea level and the geoid is referred to as (stationary) [[ocean surface topography]]. It varies globally in a range of ±{{nbsp}}2{{nbsp}}m.

Historically, adjustments were made to sea-level measurements to take into account the effects of the 235 lunar month [[Metonic cycle]] and the 223-month [[eclipse cycle]] on the tides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celticnz.co.nz/US15.html|title=Stonehenge pt 3|website=www.celticnz.co.nz|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dry land ==

[[File:BadwaterSL.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|Sea level sign seen on cliff (circled in red) at [[Badwater Basin]], [[Death Valley National Park]]]]

Several terms are used to describe the changing relationships between sea level and dry land. When the term "relative" is used, it means change relative to a fixed point in the sediment pile. The term "eustatic" refers to global changes in sea level relative to a fixed point, such as the centre of the earth, for example as a result of melting ice-caps. The term "steric" refers to global changes in sea level due to [[thermal expansion]] and [[salinity]] variations. The term "isostatic" refers to changes in the level of the land relative to a fixed point in the earth, possibly due to thermal buoyancy or [[tectonics|tectonic]] effects; it implies no change in the volume of water in the oceans. The melting of [[glacier]]s at the end of [[ice age]]s is one example of eustatic [[sea level rise]]. The [[subsidence]] of land due to the withdrawal of [[groundwater]] is an isostatic cause of relative sea level rise. [[Paleoclimatologist]]s can track sea level by examining the rocks deposited along coasts that are very tectonically stable, like the east coast of North America. Areas like volcanic islands are experiencing relative sea level rise as a result of isostatic cooling of the rock which causes the land to sink.

On other planets that lack a liquid ocean, [[planetologist]]s can calculate a "mean altitude" by averaging the heights of all points on the surface. This altitude, sometimes referred to as a "sea level", serves equivalently as a reference for the height of planetary features.

[[File:Mass balance atmospheric circulation.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]s between ocean, [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[glacier]]s]]

Local mean sea level (LMSL) is defined as the height of the sea with respect to a land benchmark, averaged over a period of time (such as a month or a year) long enough that fluctuations caused by [[ocean surface wave|waves]] and [[tide]]s are smoothed out. One must adjust perceived changes in LMSL to account for vertical movements of the land, which can be of the same order (mm/yr) as [[sea level change]]s. Some land movements occur because of [[isostasy|isostatic]] adjustment of the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] to the melting of [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. The weight of the ice sheet depresses the underlying land, and when the ice melts away the [[post-glacial rebound|land slowly rebounds]]. Changes in ground-based ice volume also affect local and regional sea levels by the readjustment of the [[geoid]] and [[true polar wander]]. [[Atmospheric pressure]], [[ocean current]]s and local ocean temperature changes can affect LMSL as well.

''Eustatic'' change (as opposed to local change) results in an alteration to the global sea levels due to changes in either the volume of water in the world's oceans or net changes in the volume of the [[ocean basin]]s.&lt;ref name="Oilfield Glossary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=eustatic%20sea%20level|title=Eustatic sea level |author= |work=Oilfield Glossary |publisher= Schlumberger Limited|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short term and periodic changes ===
[[File:Glaciers and Sea Level Rise (8742463970).jpg|thumb|Melting glaciers can cause a change in sea level]]
There are many factors which can produce short-term (a few minutes to 14 months) changes in sea level. Two major mechanisms are causing sea level to rise. First, shrinking land ice, such as mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets, is releasing water into the oceans. Second, as ocean temperatures rise, the warmer water expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-effects/sea-level.html|title=Global Warming Effects on Sea Level|website=www.climatehotmap.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least the last 100 years, sea level has been rising at an average rate of about {{convert|1.8|mm|2|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|author=Bruce C. Douglas|title=Global Sea Rise: A Redetermination|volume=18|pages=279–292|year=1997|doi=10.1023/A:1006544227856|issue=2/3|bibcode = 1997SGeo...18..279D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this rise can be attributed to the increase in temperature of the sea and the resulting slight [[thermal expansion]] of the upper {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off}} of sea water. Additional contributions, as much as one-quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and [[glacier]]s and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human uses.&lt;ref name=IPCC4&gt;{{IPCC4/wg1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aviation ==
{{main|Altitude#Aviation{{!}}Altitude in aviation}}

Pilots can estimate height above sea level with an [[altimeter]] set to a defined [[barometric pressure]]. Generally, the pressure used to set the altimeter is the barometric pressure that would exist at MSL in the region being flown over. This pressure is referred to as either [[QNH]] or "altimeter" and is transmitted to the pilot by radio from [[air traffic control]] (ATC) or an [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS). Since the terrain elevation is also referenced to MSL, the pilot can estimate height above ground by subtracting the terrain altitude from the altimeter reading. [[Aviation chart]]s are divided into boxes and the maximum terrain altitude from MSL in each box is clearly indicated. Once above the transition altitude, the altimeter is set to the [[international standard atmosphere]] (ISA) pressure at MSL which is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 inHg.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Code of Federal Regulations [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFar.nsf/3276afbe72d00920852566c700670189/da37f1d83828491d852566cf00615210!OpenDocument Sec. 91.121]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">A '''semantic loan''' is a process of borrowing [[semantics|semantic]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] (rather than [[lexical item]]s) from another [[language]], very similar to the formation of [[calque]]s. In this case, however, the complete word in the borrowing language already exists; the change is that its meaning is [[Extension (semantics)|extended]] to include another meaning its existing translation has in the lending language. Calques, [[loanword]]s and semantic loans are often grouped roughly under the phrase "borrowing". Semantic loans often occur when two languages are in close contact, and takes various forms. The source and target word may be cognates, which may or may not share any contemporary meaning in common; they may be an existing loan translation or parallel construction (compound of corresponding words); or they may be unrelated words that share an existing meaning.

==Examples==
Some examples arise from [[reborrowing]]. For example, English ''pioneer'' was borrowed from [[Middle French]] in the sense of "digger, foot soldier, pedestrian", then acquired the sense of "early colonist, innovator" in English, which was reborrowed into French.&lt;ref name="oxford_durkin"&gt;''The Oxford Guide to Etymology,'' by Philip Durkin, 5. Lexical borrowing, 5.1 Basic concepts and terminology, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UZkjLniuwRQC&amp;pg=PP212 pp. 212–215]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example is the German semantic loan ''realisieren''. The English verb "to realise" has more than one meaning: it means both "to make something happen/come true" and "to become aware of something". The [[German language|German]] verb "realisieren" originally only meant the former: to make something real. However, German later borrowed the other meaning of "to realise" from English, and today, according to [[Duden]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Duden - das große Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; also means "to become aware of something" (this meaning is still considered by many to be an [[Anglicism]]). The word "realisieren" itself already existed before the borrowing took place; the only thing borrowed was this second meaning. (Compare this with a calque, such as ''[[antibody]]'', from the German ''Antikörper'', where the word "antibody" did not exist in English before it was borrowed.)

A similar example is the German semantic loan ''überziehen'', which meant only to draw something across, before it took on the additional borrowed meaning of its literal English translation ''overdraw'' in the financial sense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Note that the first halves of the terms are cognate (über/over), but the second halves are unrelated (ziehen/draw).

Semantic loans may be adopted by many different languages: [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''kokháv'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ''zvezdá'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''gwiazda'', [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''tähti'' and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''sao'' all originally meant "star" in the astronomical sense, and then went on to adopt the [[sememe]] "star", as in a famous entertainer, from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cus.cam.ac.uk/~gz208/english.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205065046/http://www.cus.cam.ac.uk/~gz208/english.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the words are unrelated (save for the Russian and Polish words), but share a base meaning, here extended metaphorically.

'''Sumptuary laws''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sumptuāriae lēgēs'') are [[law]]s that attempt to regulate consumption; ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines them as "Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures in the matter of apparel, food, furniture, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 1436 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, they were laws that were intended to regulate and reinforce [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] and [[morality|morals]] through restrictions, often depending upon a person's social rank, on their permitted clothing, food, and luxury expenditures.

Societies have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes.  They were used as an attempt to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They made it easy to identify [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|social rank]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], and as such could be used for [[social discrimination]].&lt;ref name="Ribeiro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ribeiro |first=Aileen |title=Dress and Morality |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2003 |pages=12–16 |isbn=978-1-85973-782-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws frequently prevented [[commoner]]s from imitating the appearance of aristocrats and also could be used to [[social stigma|stigmatize]] disfavored groups. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], sumptuary laws in [[medieval commune|medieval cities]] were instituted as a way for the [[nobility]] to cap or limit the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the prosperous [[bourgeoisie]].  If bourgeois subjects appeared to be as wealthy or wealthier than the ruling nobility, it could undermine the nobility's presentation of themselves as powerful, legitimate rulers. This could call into question their ability to control and defend their [[fief]], and inspire potential traitors and rebels. Such laws continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt;

==Classical world==

===Ancient Greece ===
The first written Greek law code (Locrian code), by [[Zaleucus]] in the 7th century BC, stipulated that: 
{{quote|A free-born woman may not be accompanied by more than one female slave, unless she is drunk; she may not leave the city during the night, unless she is planning to commit adultery; she may not wear gold jewelry or a garment with a purple border, unless she is a courtesan; and a husband may not wear a gold-studded ring or a cloak of Milesian fashion unless he is bent upon prostitution or adultery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:12.21.1 "Diodorus Siculus, Library 12.21", Demosthenes Against Timocrates 139–43]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It also banned the drinking of undiluted [[wine]] except for medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/YAK_ZYM/ZALEUCUS.html Zaleucus – Britannica 1911 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The ''Sumptuariae Leges'' of [[ancient Rome]] were various laws passed to prevent inordinate expense (Latin ''sūmptus'') in banquets and dress, such as the use of expensive [[Tyrian purple]] dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000117024929/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/survival/Alison_Austin/dyeing.html Dyeing in the ancient world – Austin, Alison, University of North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/268/2/3.html In Support of the Oppian Law by Cato the Censor. Rome (218 BC–84 AD). Vol. II. Bryan, William Jennings, ed. 1906. The World's Famous Orations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]], men were forbidden to wear [[silk]].

It was considered the duty of government to put a check upon extravagance in personal expenditure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) |author2=William Wayte |author3=G. E. Marindin  | encyclopedia= A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities | title = Census | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063&amp;query=head%3D%231015 | accessdate = 2006-05-25 | edition = third | year = 1890 | publisher = Albemarle Street | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such restrictions are found in laws attributed to the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] and in the [[Twelve Tables]]. The [[Roman censor]]s, who were entrusted with the ''disciplina'' or ''cura morum'', published the ''nota censoria''. In it were listed the names of everyone found guilty of a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind are recorded. As the [[Roman Republic]] wore on, further such laws were passed; however, towards the end of the Republic, they were virtually repealed. Any such laws which may have still existed were ignored during the period of profligate [[Luxury good|luxury]] characterizing the height of the Roman Empire, except the laws regarding the wearing of Tyrian purple.&lt;ref name="CodexTheodosianus"&gt;Codex Theodosianus 14.10.2–3, tr. C. Pharr, "The Theodosian Code", p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[Roman Emperor]] could wear the symbol of his office, a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in [[Gold (color)|golden]] thread, and [[Roman senator]]s were the only ones who could wear the badge of their office, a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. During the height of the Empire, expenditure on silk imported from [[China|Sinica]] was so high that Imperial advisers warned that Roman [[silver]] reserves were becoming exhausted.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==Asia==

===China===
Sumptuary laws existed in China in one form or another from the [[Qin dynasty]] onwards (221&amp;nbsp;BC).  The [[Confucian]] virtue of restraint was embodied in the scholarly system central to China's bureaucracy and became encoded in its laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spence | first = Jonathan D. | title = The Search for Modern China | publisher = [[W.W.Norton]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-393-30780-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laws concerned the size and decoration of graves and mausoleums. The founder of the [[Ming dynasty]], the [[Hongwu Emperor]], issued such regulations in the first year of his rule (1368) and tightened them in 1396, allowing only the highest nobility and officials of the top three ranks a  memorial [[stele]] installed on top of a [[bixi (tortoise)|stone tortoise]]; the steles of lower-level [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] were perched on rectangular pedestals, while commoners had to be satisfied with a simple gravestone. The location of graves, and the number of attendant statues depended on rank.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Brill Archive |year=1892|first=Jan Jakob Maria |last=de Groot|title=The Religious System of China|volume=II
|url=https://archive.org/stream/religioussystem01groogoog#page/n105/mode/1up |pages=451–452 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After circa 1550, sumptuary law in China was reformed. It had long been ineffective.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pomeranz | first = Kenneth | title = Political economy and ecology on the eve of industrialisation: Europe, China and the global conjuncture | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1086/532293 | pages = 425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of luxuries had risen over the previous several centuries, and at the time of the European [[Industrial revolution]], Chinese consumption of luxuries such as tea, sugar, fine silk, tobacco and eating utensils was on a par with [[Core-periphery|core regions]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Pomeranz 2002 425"/&gt;

===Japan under the shōguns===
According to ''Britannica Online'', "In feudal Japan sumptuary laws were passed with a frequency and minuteness of scope that had no parallel in the history of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9070320 Online Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tokugawa period]] (1603–1868) in Japan, people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws that included regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class (''[[chōnin]]'') had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic [[samurai]], and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the ability of the merchants to wear far more luxurious clothing and to own far more luxurious items. The [[shogunate]] eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a [[daisho|matched pair]] when on official duty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vh_rAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=daisho+edict&amp;dq=daisho+edict&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T9nATfyrKobk0QGDs6C4Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK ''Cutting Edge: Japanese Swords in the British Museum'', Victor Harris, Tuttle Pub., 2005 p.26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic world==

Islamic sumptuary laws are based upon teachings found in the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]]. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that drag on the ground, seen as a sign of vanity and excessive pride, are also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this.

Prohibition of depictions of human and animal figures in general are similar to those of the Quranic prohibition on [[you shall not make for yourself an idol|graven images]]. Hadiths do allow the depiction of animals on clothing items.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Xinru. Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, p.137, 1998, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564452-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==

Sumptuary laws issued by secular authorities aimed at keeping the main population dressed according to their "station" do not begin until the later 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 114–41; Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}; M.G. Muzzarelli, ''Guardaroba medievale: Vesti e società dal XIII al XVI secolo'' (Bologna 1999) pp 268-85, 306-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were addressed to the entire social body, but the brunt of regulation was directed at women and the middle classes. Their curbing of display was ordinarily couched in religious and moralizing vocabulary, yet was affected by social and economic considerations aimed at preventing ruinous expenses among the wealthy classes and the drain of capital reserves to foreign suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized very succinctly in  David Jacoby, "Silk Economics and Cross-Cultural Artistic Interaction: Byzantium, the Muslim World, and the Christian West" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''58''' (2004: pp. 197-240) p. 206, with references.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtesans===
Special forms of dress for [[prostitute]]s and [[courtesan]]s were introduced in the 13th century: in [[Marseilles]] a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on.  Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm.  Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented working equipment (and capital) for a prostitute, and they could be exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women.  By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in [[Florence]], [[Venice]] (the European capital of courtesans) or [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane:139–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
In England, which in this respect was typical of Europe, from the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in the [[Medieval England|Middle Ages]] until well into the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Ribeiro" /&gt; sumptuary laws dictated what colour and type of clothing, furs, fabrics, and trims were allowed to persons of various ranks or incomes.  In the case of clothing, this was intended, amongst other reasons, to reduce spending on foreign textiles and to ensure that people did not dress "above their station":

{{quote|The excess of apparel and the superfluity of unnecessary foreign wares thereto belonging now of late years is grown by sufferance to such an extremity that the manifest decay of the whole realm generally is like to follow (by bringing into the realm such superfluities of silks, [[cloth of gold|cloths of gold]], silver, and other most vain devices of so great cost for the quantity thereof as of necessity the moneys and treasure of the realm is and must be yearly conveyed out of the same to answer the said excess) but also particularly the wasting and undoing of a great number of young gentlemen, otherwise serviceable, and others seeking by show of apparel to be esteemed as gentlemen, who, allured by the vain show of those things, do not only consume themselves, their goods, and lands which their parents left unto them, but also run into such debts and shifts as they cannot live out of danger of laws without attempting unlawful acts, whereby they are not any ways serviceable to their country as otherwise they might be|Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, by order of [[Elizabeth I]]&lt;ref&gt;Statute issued at Greenwich, 15 June 1574, 16 Elizabeth I, [http://elizabethan.org/sumptuary/  transcribed with modernized spelling], retrieved 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1571 Act of Parliament to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade decreed that on Sundays and holidays all males over six years of age, except for the nobility and persons of degree, were to wear woollen caps on pain of a fine of three farthings (¾ penny) per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?num=555&amp;u=1&amp;seq=438&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=pst.000017915519 13 Eliz. c.19] ''An Acte for the making of Cappes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/statute_cap|title=statute cap – definition of statute cap in English|work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law instituted the [[flat cap]] as part of English wear. The 1571 act was repealed in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017915502;view=1up;seq=165 39 Eliz. c.18] ''An Acte for the reviving continuance explanacion perfecting and repealing of divers Statutes''&lt;/ref&gt;

An extremely long list of items, specifying colour, materials, and sometimes place of manufacture (imported goods being much more tightly restricted) followed for each sex, with equally specific exceptions by rank of nobility or position held. For the most part, these laws seem to have had little effect, though the [[Parliament of England]] made repeated amendments to the laws,&lt;ref name=Scarisbrick1&gt;{{cite book |last=Scarisbrick |first=Diana |date=1994 |title=Jewellery in Britain 1066-1837 A Documentary, Social, Literary and Artistic Survey  |publisher=Michael Russell (Publishing) |page=1 |isbn=0859551903}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several monarchs (most notably the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]]s) continually called for stricter enforcement, especially at Court "to the intent there may be a difference of estates known by their apparel after the commendable custom in times past."&lt;ref&gt;http://elizabethan.org/sumptuary/ruffs-hose-swords.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
During the Medieval and Renaissance area in Italy, various towns passed sumptuary laws (''leggi suntuarie'') often in response to particular events or movements. For example, [[San Bernardino da Siena]], in his public sermons in Siena, thundered against the vanity of luxurious dress; this, however, was counterbalanced by the economic benefit that Siena derived as a manufacturer of items, including clothes, of luxury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accademiadeirozzi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/numero6.pdf Accademia dei Rozzi], article titled ''L'importante e aparire: le leggi suntuarie a Siena e la loro funzione'', by Renato Legarini, page 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt; One source describes these type of laws as constantly published, and generally ignored. These laws, mostly aimed at female apparel, became sometimes a source of revenue for the state: the Florentine laws of 1415 restricted the luxury that could be worn by women, but exempted those willing to pay 50 florins a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SiKODAAAQBAJ La Moda: Una storie dal Medioevo a oggi
By Giorgio Riello.&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were often quite specific. Low necklines were prohibited in [[Genoa]], [[Milan]], and Rome in the early 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''History of Costume'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and laws restricting [[zibellini]] ([[sable]] [[fur]]s carried as fashion accessories) with heads and feet of precious metals and jewels were
issued in [[Bologna]] in 1545 and Milan in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;Netherton, Robin, and Gale R. Owen-Crocker, editors, ''Medieval Clothing and Textiles'', Volume 2, Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK, and Rochester, New York, the Boydell Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84383-203-8}}, pp. 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[Montaigne]]'s brief essay "On sumptuary laws" criticized 16th-century French laws, beginning: 
{{quote|The way by which our laws attempt to regulate idle and vain expenses in meat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed ... For to enact that none but princes shall eat [[turbot]], shall wear [[velvet]] or gold [[lace]], and interdict these things to the people, what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one more agog to eat and wear them?}}
He also cites [[Plato]] and [[Zaleucus]].

==Early modern era==
In the [[early modern period]], sumptuary laws continued to be used to support native textile industries in the face of imports.  Prohibitions continued to be tied to rank and income and continued to be widely ignored.

===France===
In 1629 and 1633, [[Louis XIII of France]] issued edicts regulating "Superfluity of Dress" that prohibited anyone but princes and the nobility from wearing [[goldwork (embroidery)|gold embroidery]] or caps, shirts, collars and cuffs embroidered with metallic threads or lace,&lt;ref&gt;Kõhler, Carl: ''A History of Costume'', Dover Publications reprint, 1963, from 1928 Harrap translation from the German, {{ISBN|0-486-21030-8}}, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; and puffs, slashes, and bunches of ribbon were severely restricted.  As with other such laws, these were widely disregarded and laxly enforced.  A series of popular engravings by [[Abraham Bosse]] depicts the supposed effects of this law.&lt;ref&gt;Lefébure, Ernest: ''Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day'', p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial America===
In the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], only people with a personal fortune of at least two hundred pounds could wear [[lace]], silver or gold thread or [[button]]s, [[cutwork]], [[embroidery]], hatbands, belts, ruffles, capes, and other articles.  After a few decades, the law was being widely defied.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Scott, ''Fresh Lipstick: Redressing Fashion and Feminism'' p 24 {{ISBN|1-4039-6686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/primarysources/sumptuary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
{{Main article|Clothing laws by country}}

While there are rarely restrictions on the type or quality of clothing, beyond maintenance of [[Indecent exposure|public decency]] (covering parts of the body, depending upon the [[jurisdiction]]; not exhibiting unacceptable wording or images), it is widely forbidden to wear certain types of clothing restricted to specific occupations, specifically the [[uniform]]s of organisations such as [[police]] and the [[military]].

In some jurisdictions clothing or other visible signs of religious or political opinion (e.g. Nazi imagery in Germany) are forbidden in certain public places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65142 Eurasianet.org: Uzbekistan Goes After Islam with Clothing Ban and Cameras, 16 March 2012.] "A 1998 law forbids Uzbeks from wearing religious clothing in public.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtamu.edu/webres/File/Journals/MCJ/aydin.pdf Hasan Aydin, University of Nevada, Reno: Headscarf (Hijab) Ban in Turkey: importance of veiling.] "Turkey has implemented a ban on the use of the Hijab, or the headscarf, in state controlled areas like universities, government offices, and other public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21997089 BBC: Islamic headscarf debate rekindled in France, 2 April 2013.]  "Conspicuous signs of religious affiliation, including Islamic headscarves, are banned from French state schools, and full-face veils (burkas and niqabs) cannot be worn in public places."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The German Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code) in §86a outlaws "use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[United States law|American states]] in the 20th century prohibited the wearing of [[KKK]] hoods, masks, masquerade, or [[drag (clothing)|drag]]; gay men in New York City seized on the exemption for [[masquerade ball]]s in the 1920s to 1930s to go in drag.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chauncey]], ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. Basic Books, 1995. pp. 169-175, nn. 55-58; 295-296, nn. 77-79 {{ISBN|0-465-02621-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proscription or requirement of native dress==
Sumptuary laws have also been used to control populations by prohibiting the wearing of [[national dress|native dress]] and hairstyles, along with the proscription of other cultural customs.  [[John Perrot|Sir John Perrot]], Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, banned the wearing of traditional woollen mantles, "open smocks" with "great sleeves", and native headdresses, requiring the people to dress in "civil garments" in the English style.&lt;ref&gt;Berleth, Richard: ''The Twilight Lords'', 1978, Barnes and Noble reprint 1994, {{ISBN|1-56619-598-5}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar manner, the [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]], part of the [[Act of Proscription]] issued under [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]] following the [[Jacobite risings]], made wearing Scottish [[Highland dress]] including [[tartan]]s and [[kilt]]s illegal in Scotland for anyone not in the British military.  The Act was repealed in 1782, having been largely successful, and a few decades later, "romantic" Highland dress was enthusiastically adopted by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] on a [[Walter Scott]]-inspired [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|visit to Scotland]] in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, John Telfer: ''The Costume of Scotland'', 1981, Batsford edition 1989, {{ISBN|0-7134-2535-0}}, p. 50-105 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], the wearing of traditional dress (which also has an ethnic connotation) in certain places, such as when visiting government offices, was made compulsory in 1989 under the [[driglam namzha]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51617.htm US State Dept (two passages)] and [http://www.crin.org./docs/resources/treaties/crc.27/Bhutan.doc Submission to UN Committee, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the traditional dress includes the [[kabney]], a long scarf whose coloring is regulated. Only the [[Druk Gyalpo|King of Bhutan]] and [[Je Khenpo|Chief Abbot]] may don the saffron scarf, with various other colors reserved for government and religious officers, and white available for common people.

==Pejorative uses of the term ''sumptuary law''==

The term ''sumptuary law'' has been used as a [[pejorative]] term to describe any governmental control of consumption, whether based on moral, religious, health, or public safety concerns. American Judge [[Thomas M. Cooley]] generally described their modern form as laws that "substitute the legislative judgment for that of the proprietor, regarding the manner in which he should use and employ his property."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas M. Cooley]], ''Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.; 5th edition (April 1998) (1868)&lt;/ref&gt; Policies to which the term has been critically applied include [[prohibition|alcohol prohibition]],&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"&gt;Everett Sommerville Brown, ''Ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution'', (University of Michigan: 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/1999-00/Htm/Initiatives/Initiative%20To%20The%20Legislature/INITIATIVE%20248.htm Washington State Initiative 229]&lt;/ref&gt; [[smoking ban]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Johns-Manville Sales Corp. v.

===Alcohol prohibition===
{{main article|Prohibition}}
As early as 1860, [[Anthony Trollope]], writing about his experiences in [[Maine]] under [[Maine law|the state's prohibition law]], stated, "This law (prohibition), like all sumptuary laws, must fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/specialrpts/alcohol/d1hist.htm "A History of Alcohol," ''Portland Press Herald'', October 19, 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, [[William Howard Taft]] decried [[prohibition in the United States]] as a bad sumptuary law, stating that one of his reasons for opposing prohibition was his belief that "sumptuary laws are matters for parochial adjustment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,731975,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Burton, Baker, Taft''], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (October 15, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; Taft later repeated this concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928319-2,00.html [[Charles Phelps Taft]], "No Taft could", ''Time Magazine'', December 10, 1928]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Indiana]] also discussed alcohol prohibition as a sumptuary law in its 1855 decision ''Herman v. State''.&lt;ref&gt;''Herman v. State'', 8 Ind. 545 (1855).&lt;/ref&gt; During state conventions on the ratification of the [[21st Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] in 1933, numerous delegates throughout the United States decried prohibition as having been an improper sumptuary law that never should have been included in the [[Constitution of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Everett Sommerville Brown 1938"/&gt;

In 1971, a United States federal study stated that federal laws on alcohol include "sumptuary laws which are directed at the purchaser", including, "Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales as well. Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence of alcohol as well as for drunken behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/nc/nc2a.htm Jane Lang McGrew, ''History of Alcohol Prohibition''], published for the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug prohibition===
{{main article|Prohibition of drugs}}
When the U.S. State of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [[Decriminalization of non-medicinal marijuana in the United States|decriminalization]] in two initiatives, 229 and 248, the initiatives' language stated, "Cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary law of a nature repugnant to our Constitution's framers."

'''Tartanry''' is the [[kitsch]] and ahistorical elements of [[Scottish culture]] that have been over-emphasised or superimposed on the country, first by the emergent [[Scottish tourist industry]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, and later by the [[American film industry]].&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/11744/Whelan2015-vol2.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Nearly Dark, Darkly Near. Telling tales: storytelling in the Scottish oral tradition and the problems inherent in attempts to study, preserve or continue it: a suggested methodology for future interactions|last=Whelan|first=Greg|date=2015|website=|access-date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest use of the word "tartanry" itself is said to have been in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times (Colour Suppl.) 31 Oct 73 ''Tartanry has spread into radio, television, cabaret and clubs''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Tartanry is the reduction of Scottish culture to [[kitsch]], [[:wikt:twee|twee]], inaccurate imagery based on [[ethnic stereotypes]]. Often the image presented is that of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]] as [[noble savage]]. While there are strong, legitimate cultural traditions behind [[Scottish clan]] societies and the older textile designs that preceded the modern [[tartan]]s and [[kilt]]s, and instruments like [[bagpipe]]s are a part of the living musical traditions, Tartanry is when these things are tokenized, distorted, caricatured, misrepresented as ancient in the instances where they are not, or attached to fabricated histories. While [[Scottish Gaelic]] is a living language, that has developed and grown with modern culture, tartanry presents it as a dead relic and curiosity, and those acting from this perspective may simply redefine words, or change their spellings to gibberish, for no other reason than to appear quaint or [[exoticism|exotic]].&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

Tartanry is defined by literary scholar [[Cairns Craig]] as, "the false glamour that [[Walter Scott|Scott]] had foisted on Scotland and which had turned it into [[Brigadoon]]."&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

==History==
[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s flattering portrait of the [[kilt]]ed [[King George IV]]]]
Modern historians suggest that due to economic and social change, the clan system in the Highlands was already declining by the time of the failed [[Jacobite Rising of 1745|1745 rising]].&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Ray, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2pyqgupHqtgC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=clans+tartan+laws+jacobite&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=i54TTpD2E8eu8gPgzOH8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEYQ6wEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Highland Heritage: Scottish Americans in the American South''] (UNC Press Books, 2001), {{ISBN|0-8078-4913-8}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In its aftermath the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process, including a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan (in the [[Dress Act 1746]]) and limitations on the activities of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the legislation was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a process of the rehabilitation of Highland culture. The Dress Act was repealed in 1782, and tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. However, by the nineteenth century tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Roberts2002/&gt;

In the 1820s, as part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic revival]], tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.&lt;ref name=Roberts2002&gt;J. L. Roberts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WlnNUCS4R_MC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=clans+tartan+laws+jacobite&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=nJoTTry1IMGq8QODnbX8Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEgQ6wEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|1-902930-29-0}}, pp. 193-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sievers2007&gt;M.

Morère, ''Scotland and France in the Enlightenment'' (Bucknell University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-8387-5526-7}}, pp. 75-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Ferguson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nPpp6ED8c3EC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=ossian+macpherson&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=UaIUTrLIAYGq8APf5tz7Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEkQ6wEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ossian%20macpherson&amp;f=false ''The identity of the Scottish Nation: an Historic Quest''] (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-7486-1071-5}}, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]'s [[Waverley novels]] further helped popularise select aspects of Scottish life and history and he founded the Celtic Society of Edinburgh in 1820.&lt;ref name=Moncreiffe1967p24/&gt; He staged the royal [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]] in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan.

Moncreiffe of that Ilk, ''The Highland Clans'' (London: Barrie &amp; Rocklif, 1967), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and the Celtic Society urged Scots to attend festivities "all plaided and plumed in their tartan array".&lt;ref&gt;M. Magnusson, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (Grove Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-8021-3932-9}}, pp. 653-4.&lt;/ref&gt; One contemporary writer sarcastically described the pomp that surrounded the celebrations as "Sir Walter's Celtified Pagentry".&lt;ref name=Moncreiffe1967pp653-4&gt;I. Moncreiffe of that Ilk, ''The Highland Clans'' (London: Barrie &amp; Rocklif, 1967), pp. 653-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Duncan, ''Scott's Shadow: The Novel in Romantic Edinburgh'' (Princeton University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-691-04383-3}}, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the result was a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry.&lt;ref name=Milne2010p138/&gt;

[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]], son of an [[Argyll]] family, wrote of the Romantic reinvention of Highland customs:

{{cquote|Soon the vulgar imagination was so completely occupied by plaids, targets, and claymores, that, by most Englishmen, Scotchman and Highlander were regarded as synonymous words. Few people seemed to be aware that, at no remote period, a Macdonald or a Macgregor in his tartan was to a citizen of Edinburgh or Glasgow what an Indian hunter in his war paint is to an inhabitant of Philadelphia or Boston. Artists and actors represented Bruce and Douglas in striped petticoats. They might as well have represented Washington brandishing a tomahawk, and girt with a string of scalps.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The History Of England From the Accession of James II/Chapter XIII#State of the Highlands|The History Of England From the Accession of James II: Chapter XIII (under “The State of the Highlands”)]] – Thomas Babington Macaulay&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity.&lt;ref name=Milne2010p138&gt;N. C. Milne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Z_G1jHe2aAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=walter+scot+royal+visit+tartan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XkAUTq-eOs7KsgbFmrzMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Scottish Culture and Traditions''] (Paragon Publishing, 2010), {{ISBN|1-899820-79-5}}, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by Queen Victoria who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort and the popularity of the tartan fashion. Her Highland enthusiasm led to the design of two new tartan patterns, “Victoria” and “Balmoral”, the latter named after her [[Balmoral Castle|castle Balmoral]] in Aberdeen, which from 1852 became a major royal residence.&lt;ref name=Sievers2007/&gt;

'''''The Clouds''''' ({{lang-grc|Νεφέλαι}} ''Nephelai'') is a [[Greek comedy]] [[theatre|play]] written by the playwright [[Aristophanes]]. A lampooning of intellectual fashions in [[classical Athens]], it was originally produced at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] in 423{{nbsp}}BC and was not as well received as the author had hoped, coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year. It was revised between 420 and 417{{nbsp}}BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

No copy of the original production survives, and scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of [[Aristophanes#Old Comedy|Old Comedy]]. This incompleteness, however, is not obvious in translations and modern performances.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Somerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; 

Retrospectively, ''The Clouds'' can be considered the world's first extant "comedy of ideas"&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric, Comedy and the Violence of Language in Aristophanes' Clouds'' Daphne O'Regan, Oxford University Press US 1992, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered by literary critics to be among the finest examples of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Old-and-new Comedy – Six essays in perspective'' Kenneth.J.Reckford, UNC Press 1987, page 393&lt;/ref&gt; The play also, however, remains notorious for its caricature of [[Socrates]] and is mentioned in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' as a contributor to the philosopher's trial and execution.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Apology (Plato)#4|''The Apology'' translated by Benjamin Jowett, section4]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:el:Ἀπολογία Σωκράτους|Apology, Greek text, edited J Burnet, section 19c]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The play begins with Strepsiades suddenly sitting up in bed while his son, Pheidippides, remains blissfully asleep in the bed next to him. Strepsiades complains to the audience that he is too worried about household debts to get any sleep – his wife (the pampered product of an aristocratic clan) has encouraged their son's expensive interest in horses. Strepsiades, having thought up a plan to get out of debt, wakes the youth gently and pleads with him to do something for him. Pheidippides at first agrees to do as he's asked then changes his mind when he learns that his father wants to enroll him in The Thinkery, a school for wastrels and bums that no self-respecting, athletic young man dares to be associated with. Strepsiades explains that students of The Thinkery learn how to turn inferior arguments into winning arguments and this is the only way he can beat their aggrieved creditors in court. Pheidippides however will not be persuaded and Strepsiades decides to enroll himself in The Thinkery in spite of his advanced age.

There he meets a student who tells him about some of the recent discoveries made by Socrates, the head of The Thinkery, including a new unit of measurement for ascertaining the distance jumped by a flea (a flea's ''foot'', created from a minuscule imprint in wax), the exact cause of the buzzing noise made by a gnat (its rear end resembles a trumpet) and a new use for a large pair of compasses (as a kind of fishing-hook for stealing cloaks from pegs over the gymnasium wall). Impressed, Strepsiades begs to be introduced to the man behind these discoveries. The wish is soon granted: Socrates appears overhead, wafted in a basket at the end of a rope, the better to observe the Sun and other meteorological phenomena. The philosopher descends and quickly begins the induction ceremony for the new elderly student, the highlight of which is a parade of the Clouds, the patron goddesses of thinkers and other layabouts. The Clouds arrive singing majestically of the regions whence they arose and of the land they have now come to visit, loveliest in all being Greece. Introduced to them as a new devotee, Strepsiades begs them to make him the best orator in Greece by a hundred miles. They reply with the promise of a brilliant future. Socrates leads him into the dingy Thinkery for his first lesson and The Clouds step forward to address the audience.

Putting aside their cloud-like costumes, The Chorus declares that this is the author's cleverest play and that it cost him the greatest effort. It reproaches the audience for the play's failure at the festival, where it was beaten by the works of inferior authors, and it praises the author for originality and for his courage in lampooning influential politicians such as [[Cleon]]. The Chorus then resumes its appearance as clouds, promising divine favours if the audience punishes Cleon for corruption and rebuking Athenians for messing about with the calendar, since this has put Athens out of step with the moon.

Socrates returns to the stage in a huff, protesting against the ineptitude of his new elderly student. He summons Strepsiades outside and attempts further lessons, including a form of meditative incubation in which the old man lies under a blanket while thoughts are supposed to arise in his mind naturally. The incubation results in Strepsiades masturbating under the blanket and finally Socrates refuses to have anything more to do with him. The Clouds advise him to find someone younger to do the learning for him. His son, Pheidippides, subsequently yields to threats by Strepsiades and reluctantly returns with him to the Thinkery, where they encounter the personified arguments Superior (Right) and Inferior (Wrong), associates of Socrates. Superior Argument and Inferior Argument debate with each other over which of them can offer the best education. Superior Argument sides with Justice and the gods, offering to prepare Pheidippides for an earnest life of discipline,  typical of men who respect the old ways; Inferior Argument, denying the existence of Justice, offers to prepare him for a life of ease and pleasure, typical of men who know how to talk their way out of trouble. At the end of the debate, a quick survey of the audience reveals that buggers – people schooled by Inferior Arguments – have got into the most powerful positions in Athens. Superior Argument accepts his inevitable defeat,  Inferior Argument leads Pheidippides into the Thinkery for a life-changing education and Strepsiades goes home happy. The Clouds step forward to address the audience a second time, demanding to be awarded first place in the festival competition, in return for which they promise good rains – otherwise they'll destroy crops, smash roofs and spoil weddings.

The story resumes with Strepsiades returning to The Thinkery to fetch his son. A new Pheidippides emerges, startlingly transformed into the pale nerd and intellectual man that he had once feared to become. Rejoicing in the prospect of talking their way out of financial trouble, Strepsiades leads the youth home for celebrations, just moments before the first of their aggrieved creditors arrives with a witness to summon him to court. Strepsiades comes back on stage, confronts the creditor and dismisses him contemptuously. A second creditor arrives and receives the same treatment before Strepsiades returns indoors to continue the celebrations. The Clouds sing ominously of a looming debacle and Strepsiades again comes back on stage, now in distress, complaining of a beating that his new son has just given him in a dispute over the celebrations. Pheidippides emerges coolly and insolently debates with his father a father's right to beat his son and a son's right to beat his father. He ends by threatening to beat his mother also, whereupon Strepsiades flies into a rage against The Thinkery, blaming Socrates for his latest troubles. He leads his slaves, armed with torches and mattocks, in a frenzied attack on the disreputable school. The alarmed students are pursued offstage and the Chorus, with nothing to celebrate, quietly departs.

==Historical background==
''The Clouds'' represents a departure from the main themes of Aristophanes' early plays – Athenian politics, the [[Peloponnesian War]] and the need for peace with Sparta. The Spartans had recently stopped their annual invasions of [[Attica]] after the Athenians had taken Spartan hostages in the [[Battle of Sphacteria]] in 425 and this, coupled with a defeat suffered by the Athenians at the [[Battle of Delium]] in 424, had provided the right conditions for a truce. Thus the original production of ''The Clouds'' in 423 BC came at a time when Athens was looking forward to a period of peace. [[Cleon]], the populist leader of the pro-war faction in Athens, was a target in all Aristophanes' early plays and his attempts to prosecute Aristophanes for slander in 426 had merely added fuel to the fire. Aristophanes however had singled Cleon out for special treatment in his previous play ''[[The Knights]]'' in 424 and there are relatively few references to him in ''The Clouds''.

Freed from political and war-time issues, Aristophanes focuses in ''The Clouds'' on a broader issue that underlies many conflicts depicted in his plays – the issue of Old versus New, or the battle of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific speculations of [[Ionia]]n thinkers such as [[Thales]] in the sixth century were becoming commonplace knowledge in Aristophanes' time and this had led, for instance, to a growing belief that civilized society was not a gift from the gods but rather had developed gradually from primitive man's animal-like existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Greek Philosophy'' Martin West, in 'Oxford History of the Classical World', J.Boardman, J.Griffin and O.Murray (eds), Oxford University Press 1986, page 121&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time that ''The Clouds'' was produced, [[Democritus]] at Abdera was developing an [[atomism|atomistic theory]] of the cosmos and [[Hippocrates]] at Cos was establishing an empirical and science-like approach to medicine. [[Anaxagoras]], whose works were studied by Socrates, was living in Athens when Aristophanes was a youth. Anaxagoras enjoyed the patronage of influential figures such as [[Pericles]], but oligarchic elements also had political advocates and Anaxagoras was charged with impiety and expelled from Athens around 437 BC.

The battle of ideas had led to some unlikely friendships that cut across personal and class differences, such as between the socially alert Pericles and the unworldly Anaxagoras, and between the handsome aristocrat, [[Alcibiades]], and the ugly plebeian, [[Socrates]]. Socrates moreover had distinguished himself from the crowd by his heroism in the retreat from the Battle of Delium and this might have further singled him out for ridicule among his comrades.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, pages 108&lt;/ref&gt; He was forty-five years old and in good physical shape when ''The Clouds'' was produced&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; yet he had a face that lent itself easily to caricature by mask-makers, possibly a contributing reason for the frequent characterization of him by comic poets.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; 
In fact one of the plays that defeated ''The Clouds'' in 423 was called ''Connus'', written by Ameipsias, and it too lampooned Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, Clouds'' A. Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1975, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is a famous story, as reported for example by Aelian, according to which Socrates cheerfully rose from his seat during the performance of ''The Clouds'' and stood in silent answer to the whispers among foreigners in the festival audience: "Who is ''Socrates''?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Plato appears to have considered ''The Clouds'' a contributing factor in Socrates' trial and execution in 399 BC. There is some support for his opinion even in the modern age.&lt;ref name="Aristophanes 1973, page 109"&gt;''Aristophanes:Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'' A.Sommerstein, Penguin Classics 1973, page 109&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays however were generally unsuccessful in shaping public attitudes on important questions, as evidenced by their ineffectual opposition to the Peloponnesian War, demonstrated in the play ''[[Lysistrata]]'', and to populists such as Cleon.  Moreover, the trial of Socrates followed Athens' traumatic defeat by Sparta, many years after the performance of the play, when suspicions about the philosopher were fuelled by public animosity towards his disgraced associates such as [[Alcibiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], pages XIV–XV&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates is presented in ''The Clouds'' as a petty thief, a fraud and a [[sophist]] with a specious interest in physical speculations.  However, it is still possible to recognize in him the distinctive individual defined in Plato's dialogues.&lt;ref name="Postmodern Platos Catherine H 1996, page 135"&gt;''Postmodern Platos'' Catherine H.Zuckert, University of Chicago Press 1996, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; 
The practice of [[ascetism]] (as for example idealized by the Chorus in lines 412–19), disciplined, introverted thinking (as described by the Chorus in lines 700–6) and conversational [[dialectic]] (as described by Socrates in lines 489–90) appear to be caricatures of Socratic behaviours later described more sympathetically by Plato.  
The Aristophanic Socrates is much more interested in physical speculations than is Plato's Socrates, yet it is possible that the real Socrates did take a strong interest in such speculations during his development as a philosopher&lt;ref&gt;''The Socratic Movement'' Paul Vander Waerdt, Cornell University Press 1994, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some support for this in Plato's dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'' 96A.

It has been argued that Aristophanes caricatured a 'pre-Socratic' Socrates and that the philosopher depicted by Plato was a more mature thinker who had been influenced by such criticism.&lt;ref name="Postmodern Platos Catherine H 1996, page 135"/&gt; Conversely, it is possible that Aristophanes' caricature of the philosopher merely reflects his own ignorance of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], pages XXII&lt;/ref&gt;  
According to yet another view, ''The Clouds'' can best be understood in relation to Plato's works, as evidence of a historic rivalry between poetic and philosophical modes of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''Postmodern Platos'' Catherine H.Zuckert, University of Chicago Press 1996, page 133, commenting on ''Socrates and Aristophanes'' by Leo Strauss, University of Chicago Press 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Clouds'' and Old Comedy==
During the ''[[parabasis|parabasis proper]]'' (518–62), the Chorus reveals that the original play was badly received when it was produced.  References in the same parabasis to a play by [[Eupolis]] called ''Maricas'' produced in 421 BC and criticism of the populist politician [[Hyperbolus]] who was ostracized in 416 indicate that the second version of ''The Clouds'' was probably composed somewhere between 421–16 BC. 
The parabasis also includes an appeal to the audience to prosecute Cleon for corruption. Since Cleon died in 422 it can be assumed that this appeal was retained from the original production in 423 and thus the extant play must be a partial revision of the original play.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], pages XXVIII–XXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised play is an incomplete form of [[Aristophanes#Aristophanes and Old Comedy|Old Comedy]]. Old Comedy conventionally limits the number of actors to three or four, yet there are already three actors on stage when Superior and Inferior enter the action and there is no song at that point that would allow for a change of costume. The play is unusually serious for an Old Comedy and possibly this was the reason why the original play failed at the City Dionysia.&lt;ref name="Aristophanes 1973, page 109"/&gt; 
As a result of this seriousness, there is no celebratory song in the ''exodus'', and this also is an uncharacteristic omission.  A typical Aristophanic Chorus, even if it starts out as hostile to the protagonist, is the protagonist's cheer squad by the end of the play.  In ''The Clouds'' however, the Chorus appears sympathetic at first but emerges as a virtual antagonist by the end of the play.

The play adapts the following elements Old Comedy in a variety of novel ways.
*'''[[Parodos]]''':  The arrival of the Chorus in this play is unusual in that the singing begins offstage some time before the Chorus appears.  It is possible that the concealed Chorus was not fully audible to the audience and this might have been a factor in the original play's failure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page 99 note 275–90&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the majestic opening song is more typical of tragedy than comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Parabasis''': The ''parabasis proper'' (lines 518–62) is composed in [[choriamb|eupolidean tetrameter]] rather than the conventional [[anapestic tetrameter]].  Aristophanes does not use eupolideans in any other of his extant plays.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refclouds1970|Clouds (1970)]], page 119 note 518–62&lt;/ref&gt;  The first parabasis (510–626) is otherwise conventional. However the second parabasis (1113–30) is in a shortened form, comprising an [[:wikt:epirrhema|epirrhema]] in trochaic tetrameter but without the songs and the antepirrhema needed for a conventional, symmetrical scene.
*'''[[Agon]]''':  The play has two agons.  The first is between Superior and Inferior (949–1104).  Superior's arguments are in conventional anapestic tetrameter but Inferior presents his case in iambic tetrameters, a variation that Aristophanes reserves for arguments that are not to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' D.MacDowell (ed.), Oxford University Press 1971, page 207 note 546–630&lt;/ref&gt; A similar distinction between anapestic and iambic arguments is made in the agons in ''[[The Knights]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Knights'' 756–940&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Frogs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Frogs'' 895–1098&lt;/ref&gt; The second agon in ''The Clouds'' is between Strepsiades and his son (1345–1451) and it is in [[iambic tetrameter]] for both speakers.
*'''Episodes''':  Informal dialogue between characters is conventionally in [[iambic trimeter]].  However the scene introducing Superior and Inferior is conducted in short lines of anapestic rhythm (889–948).  Later, in the agon between Strepsiades and his son, a line of dialogue in iambic trimeter (1415) – adapted from [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' – is inserted into a speech in iambic tetrameter, a transition that seems uncharacteristically clumsy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes:Wasps'' D.MacDowell (ed.), Oxford University Press 1971, page 187 note 1415&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trowel''''' is an [[academic journal]] published by postgraduate students at the School of Archaeology, [[University College Dublin]], [[Ireland]].

It was first published in 1988. The journal was redesigned and relaunched for Volume X 2005 after a five-year hiatus in publication. This involved a change from an A4 black and white format to an A5 full colour volume. New sections added included a 'reflections' section, featuring contributions from prominent members of Irish society on their experiences of archaeology, and a book reviews section.

Volume XI included contributions from post-graduate students from [[NUI Galway]] and [[University College Cork]] making ''Trowel'' one of only four national academic journals in [[Ireland]] focusing on the publication of articles relating to [[archaeology]]. Others include the ''[[Journal of Irish Archaeology]]'' (published by the [[Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland]]), the Journal of the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]], and Section C of the Proceedings of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].

'''Agnes Joseph Madeline Dillon''' (8 January 1903 – 4 April 1993), known as '''Una Dillon''', was a British bookseller. She founded [[Dillons Booksellers]].

==Life==
Agnes Joseph Madeline Dillon was born in [[Cricklewood]] and she was known as "Una". Dillon was born in Hendon to Teresa and Joseph Thomas Dillon. She was one of six children who their catholic parents paid to get well educated. The elder brother died during World War one, a sister became a nun and another brother emigrated. [[Carmen Dillon|Carmen]], Agnes (Una) and Teresa were left to fulfil their parent's ambition for them.&lt;ref name=una&gt;Jean H. Cook, ‘Dillon, Agnes Joseph Madeline [Una] (1903–1993)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51834, accessed 11 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon was working for the charity now known as [[Mind (charity)|Mind]] dealing with books. She enjoyed this and decided to set herself up in business with a bookstore. Her parents lent her money and she bought out a shop which she thought she could improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-una-dillon-1455775.html|title=Obituary: Una Dillon|date=1993-04-17|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillon bought [[Dillons Booksellers]] first building on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in [[London]], near [[University College London]], which she bought in 1936. Dillon drove the business forward delivering books by bike within her own target of eight hours. Her business thrived and her customers, and friends, included [[C. Day Lewis]], the poet [[John Betjeman]] and other bibliophiles.&lt;ref name=una/&gt;

Dillon subsequently sold the majority of the company to the [[University of London]] in 1956, with the proviso that it used her name. Dillon retired from the business in 1968.&lt;ref name=una/&gt;

The concept of [[border security]] in the [[United States of America]] shares a complex relationship with the persistent threat of [[terrorism]].  Border security includes the protection of land borders, [[port]]s, and [[airport]]s.  The relationship is unique in the sense that the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] must constantly reevaluate and tweak its border security policy to address the perceived threats posed to the United States through the form of human terrorism or the smuggling and detonation of a [[weapon of mass destruction]].

== Historical context ==
Directly after the [[September 11 attacks|events of September 11, 2001]], the Federal Government typically placed a higher priority on obvious aspects of homeland security, such as intelligence reform, as opposed to border security.  However, the government as well as the American public eventually reasoned that in order for a high-magnitude attack like September 11 to occur, something had to be seriously wrong with the border security apparatuses that were in place at the time.  After all, every single one of the terrorist hijackers on September 11 had been a recipient of a temporary U.S tourist visa,&lt;ref name="fairus_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecentersc582 | title=Identity and Immigration Status of 9/11 Terrorists | accessdate=March 14, 2011 | date=February 2004 | website=Federation for American Immigration Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means they were legally allowed to be in the United States.  If nineteen men who were committed to causing harm to Americans were capable of getting past the government screening restrictions that were in place, one could only imagine how great of a threat to America was posed by the largely unchecked {{convert|3017|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], the {{convert|1933|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Mexico–United States border|Mexico–US border]], and the many unsecured ports.&lt;ref name="dhs_border_xing"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dhs.gov/files/programs/gc_1200605716403.shtm | title=Background: U.S. Land Border Crossing Updated Procedures | accessdate=March 14, 2011 | date=September 16, 2008 | publisher=US Department of Homeland Security | quote=Beginning January 31, 2008 the Department of Homeland Security is: 1. Ending oral declarations at the border, except in extraordinary situations, 2. Accepting a list of about two dozen types of documents at the border instead of the over 8,000 documents currently being accepted}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the American public also questions why cracking down on illegal entries will hinder the ability of terrorists who enter the country legally.

Ever since September 11, many actions have been taken to improve border security in the United States.  The creation of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in 2002 as well as the implementation of many new policies and procedures (both classified and unclassified) has without a doubt made America's borders, ports, and airports safer than they were in 2001.  However, there is no question that the threats posed by terrorism via America's land borders, ports, and airports still exist; and there are still questions as to whether the United States is truly safe from another attack.

== Threats of terrorism ==

===Land borders===

The sheer sizes of both the Canada–US and Mexico–US borders present the Federal Government's security forces with challenges with regards to their ability to protect the homeland.  According to a 2004 report from the [[Congressional Research Service]], there are "great difficulties in securing the many points through which people and goods may enter legally, and the thousands of miles of ‘lines’, thinly guarded stretches of coasts and land borders which entry is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Port and Maritime Security: Background and Issues for Congress | author=Frittelli, John F. | year=2005 | publisher=Library of Congress | quote=The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 heightened awareness about the vulnerability to terrorist attack of all modes of transportation. Port security has emerged as a significant part of the overall debate on U.S. homeland security. The overarching issues for Congress are providing oversight on current port security programs and making or responding to proposals to improve port security. | url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL31733.pdf | work=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the phenomenon of undocumented migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, some government officials and political candidates have made public statements referring to the threat of terrorists crossing the Southwest border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pallack|first=Becky|title=Grijalva slams Saucedo Mercer on 'Middle Easterner' comments (updated)|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/grijalva-slams-saucedo-mercer-on-middle-easterner-comments-updated/article_57ea11f8-f19d-11e1-b798-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isacson|first=Adam|title=Are terrorists crossing the border "from time to time?"|url=http://borderfactcheck.tumblr.com/post/28518566683/are-terrorists-crossing-the-border-from-time-to-time|website=Border Fact Check|publisher=Washington Office on Latin America|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the [http://www.wola.org/ Washington Office on Latin America]'s [http://borderfactcheck.com/ Border Fact Check blog] has pointed out, the Mexico section of the State Department's 2012 Country Reports on Terrorism notes that "No known international terrorist organization had an operational presence in Mexico and no terrorist group targeted U.S. citizens in or from Mexican territory.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Reports on Terrorism: Western Hemisphere Overview|url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2011/195546.htm|website=Country Reports on Terrorism|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 the Department of Homeland Security affirmed that it did not have "any credible information on terrorist groups operating along the Southwest border."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goerdt|first=Ana|title=Do terrorists use the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the United States?|url=http://borderfactcheck.tumblr.com/post/30532954020/do-terrorists-use-the-u-s-mexico-border-to-enter-the|website=Border Fact Check|publisher=Washington Office on Latin America|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ports===
The Federal Government faces threats to national security through its many ports. As part of her testimony at a Congressional Hearing on container security, JayEtta Hecker, Director for Physical Infrastructure Issues at the [[Government Accountability Office]], said "drugs and illegal aliens are routinely smuggled into this country, not only in small boats but also hidden among otherwise legitimate cargoes on large commercial ships.  These same pathways are available for exploitation by a terrorist organization or any nation or person wishing to attack us surreptitiously."&lt;ref name="hecker_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03297t.pdf | title=Container Security: Current Efforts to Detect Nuclear Materials, New Initiatives, and Challenges | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Hecker, JayEtta Z. | date=November 18, 2002 | website=United States General Accounting Office | publisher=United States Government | pages=3 | quote=As indispensable as the rapid flow of commerce is, the terrorist attacks of September 11th have served to heighten awareness about the supply system’s vulnerability to terrorist actions. Drugs and illegal aliens are routinely smuggled into this country, not only in small boats but also hidden among otherwise legitimate cargoes on large commercial ships. These same pathways are available for exploitation by a terrorist organization or any nation or person wishing to attack us surreptitiously. The Brookings Institution reported in 2002 that a weapon of mass destruction shipped by container or mail could cause damage and disruption costing the economy as much as $1 trillion.3 Port vulnerabilities stem from inadequate security measures as well as from the challenge of monitoring the vast and rapidly increasing volume of cargo, persons, and vessels passing through the ports. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that various assessments of national security have concluded that the nation’s ports are far more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than the nation’s aviation system, where most of the nation’s efforts and resources have been placed since September 11th.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ms. Hecker's testimony also touched on the fact that the sheer number of cargo containers that enter the United States augments this threat.&lt;ref name="hecker_2011 quote"&gt;With more than 6 million containers a year entering U.S. ports, examining them all has not been possible. Instead, Customs has acknowledged that its approach relies on reviewing shipping manifests, invoices and other commercial documents, and intelligence leads to target approximately 2 percent of the containers that enter the country nationwide for physical inspection, though the actual percentage varies from port to port.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the March 2008 edition of [[Scientific American]], more than 42 million {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} containers enter American ports each year.&lt;ref name="sciam_nuclear_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=detecting-nuclear-smuggling | title=Detecting Nuclear Smuggling | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Cochran, Thomas B. | author2=McKinzie, Matthew G. | date=March 24, 2008 | publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
More than 87 million people enter the U.S. every year through airports, which makes them a primary point of entry for potential terrorists.{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}} For example, in May 2012, the C.I.A. revealed that it uncovered a plot to bring down a commercial plane using explosive devices. According to the C.I.A. these plans belonged to members of Al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;Alcorn, J. (2012, December 5). Airport security. The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref name="time_jihad_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1042473,00.html | title=A Jihadist's Tale | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=MacLeod, Scott | date=March 28, 2005 | website=Time Magazine | publisher=Time Inc. | quote=After he was denied entry at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for apparently falsifying details on his visa application, al-Banna's life took a turn that led him down the path of radical Islam and ultimately to join the insurgency against the U.S. in Iraq. His odyssey ended on March 3 when al-Banna's brother Ahmed received a call on his cell phone from a man identifying himself as "one of your brothers from the Arab peninsula"--the term radical Islamists use to signify the core of the Muslim world, centered on the holy city of Mecca. Al-Banna's family says that as far as they knew, Ra'ed was in Saudi Arabia working at a new job. But the voice on the other end sounded Iraqi, Ahmed says. "Congratulations," the caller told him. "Your brother has fallen a martyr."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Ra’ed al-Banna demonstrates that the threat of an attack of this manner still exists.{{qn|date=March 2011}}

== Current policies and security mechanisms ==

===Land borders===
In a 2008 article for the [[Manhattan Institute]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]] claimed that border security is one of the most critical issues facing the United States today and should by monitored by a single organization that embraced [[CompStat]], the organizational philosophy of the NYPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_homeland_security.html | title=The Resilient Society | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Giuliani, Rudolph W. | date=Winter 2008 | website=City Journal | publisher=The Manhattan Institute | quote=It’s also past time to rethink aviation security and to stop frisking toddlers and grandmothers trying to get onto planes. Instead, good intelligence, behavior analysis, biometrics, and trustedtraveler programs can help speed legitimate travelers through airports. For example, I don’t think that the Transportation Security Administration needs to spend much time searching Senator Ted Kennedy before he boards a plane—which is what the TSA did in August 2004 because a person on a watch list had a similar name. The federal Terrorist Watch List, which still has incomplete and inaccurate information, needs a serious cleanup.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A myriad of agencies guard America's land borders, including the [[United States Border Patrol]], [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]](ICE), the [[Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Guard to Help Secure Southwest Border" May 25, 2010. New York Times. March 25, 2011 &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/us/26border.html/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Homeland Security has completed nearly 700 miles of fencing along the borders.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.com"&gt;Alden, E., &amp; Roberts, B. (2011, July).

===Ports===

From 2001 to 2006, the Federal Government increased funding for port security by 700%.&lt;ref name="dhc_secure_ports_2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0865.shtm | title=Fact Sheet: Securing U.S. Ports | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | date=February 22, 2006 | publisher=Department of Homeland Security | quote=The Administration has dramatically strengthened port security since 9/11.      * Funding has increased by more than 700% since September 11, 2001.     * Funding for port security was approximately $259 million in FY 2001.     * DHS spent approximately $1.6 billion on port security in FY 2005.  Following 9/11, the federal government has implemented a multi-layered defense strategy to keep our ports safe and secure. New technologies have been deployed with additional technologies being developed and $630 million has been provided in grants to our largest ports, including $16.2 million to Baltimore; $32.7 million to Miami; $27.4 million to New Orleans, $43.7 million to New York/New Jersey; and $15.8 million to Philadelphia. | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327042404/http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0865.shtm# | archive-date=March 27, 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in funding allowed the Department of Homeland Security to implement a [[defense in depth]] against external threats.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the [[U.S. Coast Guard]], Terminal Operator, and the [[Port Authority]] shared responsibility for providing security at American ports. In 2006, those agencies screened all cargo entering the country.&lt;ref name="dhc_secure_ports_2011" /&gt;  U.S. Customs and Border Patrol utilized X-ray, gamma ray machines, and radiation detection devices to screen cargo, operating over 680 radiation portal monitors and over 170 large scale non-intrusive inspection devices. In addition, there were more than 600 canine teams that could "identify narcotics, bulk currency, human beings, explosives, agricultural pests, and chemical weapons" working U.S. ports of entry.&lt;ref name="dhc_secure_ports_2011" /&gt;

===Airports===
Airport security mechanisms must be quick, efficient, and effective due to the massive amounts of travelers, the Department of Homeland Security has implemented the [[Automated Targeting System]], a [[data mining]] program.  The Automated Targeting System works by collecting information from airlines such as passport data, credit card numbers, and identity information. That information is then run against a list of known terrorists, phone numbers connected to terrorist cells, and other pertinent intelligence data.&lt;ref&gt;Baker. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2001, the United States passed the [[Aviation and Transportation Security Act]], creating the [[Transportation Security Administration]]TSA,  and requiring airlines to give information of all U.S. bound travelers to the Department of Homeland Security.  This data is fed into the Automated Targeting System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laurance|first=Castelli|title=Privacy Impact Assessment, CBP Automated Targeting System|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_cbp_ats.pdf|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=March 26, 2011|quote=ATS-Passenger (ATS-P) is the module used at all U.S. airports and seaports receiving international flights and voyages to evaluate passengers and crewmembers prior to arrival or departure. It assists the CBP officer’s decision-making process about whether a passenger or crewmember should receive additional screening prior to entry into or departure from the country because the traveler may pose a greater risk for violation of U.S. law. The system analyzes the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) data from TECS, Passenger Name Record (PNR) data from the airlines, TECS crossing data, TECS seizure data, and watched entities. ATS-P processes available information from these databases to develop a risk assessment for each traveler. The risk assessment is based on a set of National- and user-defined rules which are comprised rule sets that pertain to specific operational/tactical objectives or local enforcement efforts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and helps TSA, FBI, CIA, and other organizations to create the [[Secondary Security Screening Selection|Selectee]] and [[No Fly List]].

In addition to the ATS System, another mechanism to deter terrorists is utilized in case they are not detected by the flagging protocols. [[Federal Air Marshals]] are the law enforcement branch of the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. They fly either in uniform or incognito and act as the law enforcement while on board to protect passengers and crew members from criminals and terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;"TSA: Frequently Asked Questions." TSA. Nov 16, 2008 &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/research/privacy/faqs.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427205030/http://www.tsa.gov/research/privacy/faqs.shtm |archivedate=April 27, 2007 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Secondary Security Screening Selection]] system flags passengers for extra surveillance while in the airport but does not prohibit them from flying. These individuals, often referred to as "selectees", are pulled aside at security checkpoints and searched thoroughly. Their luggage may be hand searched. Individuals are added to the lists through airport screening processes. Individuals are potentially flagged if they have purchased a ticket in cash, purchased a ticket within the previous 24 hours, purchased a one-way ticket, or arrived with no baggage.&lt;ref&gt;"TSA: Mythbuster."

Starting in March 2010, the TSA begin a wide-scale deployment of [[Full body scanner]]s, in addition to [[Metal Detector|metal detectors]], to physically screen airline passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) |url=http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm |publisher=TSA |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311010041/http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm |archivedate=March 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness of US-Mexico Border Security Policies==

Some evidence exists that past border security efforts have been successful. Between 2010 and 2012, [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] seized almost three quarters more money, over a third more narcotics, and nearly double the weapons seized between 2006 and 2008 along the Southwest border.&lt;ref name="Counternarcotics Strategy"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/policy-and-research/southwest_border_strategy_2013.pdf | title= National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy | accessdate= Nov 20, 2014 | date= 2013 | publisher= Office of National Drug Control Policy | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131018163506/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/policy-and-research/southwest_border_strategy_2013.pdf# | archive-date= October 18, 2013 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to the increased border security, border cities have become some of the safest in the [[United States]]. Southwest border states have experienced an average 40% drop in violent crime rates, and the 4 major cities with the lowest crime rates in the [[US]] are all in border states.&lt;ref name="Counternarcotics Strategy"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/policy-and-research/southwest_border_strategy_2013.pdf | title= National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy | accessdate= Nov 20, 2014 | date= 2013 | publisher= Office of National Drug Control Policy | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131018163506/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/policy-and-research/southwest_border_strategy_2013.pdf# | archive-date= October 18, 2013 | dead-url= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The No Fly List, a comprehensive list of individuals prohibited from flying into or out of the United States, has exponentially grown in size. The List existed before 9/11 but only contained the names of 16 people and now lists over one million names. The List includes high-profile individuals such as the Bolivian President and other foreign dignitaries. The List still contains 14 out of the 19 September 11 hijackers and several other deceased individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 Commission Report : Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States. New York: Norton Paperbacks, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system occasionally leads to a "false positive" which is the accidental flagging of individuals that have similar names to suspected terrorists or are on the List for illegitimate reason. In some cases, children under the age of five have been flagged as suspects. It contains many common names such as Gary Smith or Robert Johnson which makes traveling very difficult for all individuals with that name. Several U.S. congressmen have name matches on the list including Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who has subsequently been stopped at airports. The List does not include the names of individuals involved in the liquid explosive terrorist attack attempt. TSA also reported that some of the names of the most dangerous terrorists are not on the list in case the List is leaked. Daniel Brown, a U.S. Marine returning from Iraq, was denied entry into the United States because his name matched one on the list. He later found out that he had been flagged on a previous flight for having gunpowder residue on his boots which was likely acquired during an earlier tour of duty in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;"‘No-fly’ list delays Marine's Iraq homecoming."

'''United States congressional apportionment''' is the process&lt;ref name="Kristin D. Burnett"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kristin D. Burnett |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf |title=Congressional Apportionment (2010 Census Briefs C2010BR-08) |publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] are distributed among the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] according to the most recent decennial [[United States Census|census]] mandated by the [[United States Constitution]]. Each state is [[Apportionment (politics)|apportioned]] a number of seats which approximately corresponds to its share of the aggregate population of the 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;The populations of [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Territories of the United States|federal territories]] are not included in this figure.&lt;/ref&gt; However, every state is constitutionally guaranteed at least one seat.

The number of voting seats in the House of Representatives has since 1913 been 435, capped at that number by the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]]—except for a temporary (1959–1962) increase to 437 when [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] were [[Admission to the Union|admitted into the Union]].&lt;ref name="USPL 62-5"&gt;[[Public Law 62-5]] of 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of a state's total congressional delegation also determines the size of its representation in the [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. Electoral College]], which also affects the [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]] process.

==Constitutional context==
{{United States House of Representatives}}
[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 2, Clause 3 of the [[United States Constitution]] initially provided:

{{quote|Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three fifths of all other Persons]].

The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative;…}}

Following the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the first of those provisions was superseded by Section 2 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]:

{{quote|Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.&lt;ref&gt;Rendered ''[[Mootness|moot]]'' by the [[Revenue Act of 1924]] and [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]].&lt;/ref&gt; But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.}}

==Reapportionment==
Reapportionments normally occur following each decennial census, though the law that governs the total number of representatives and the method of apportionment to be carried into force at that time are enacted prior to the census.

The decennial apportionment also determines the size of each state's representation in the [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. Electoral College]]. Under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the U.S. Constitution, the number of electors of any state equals the size of its total congressional delegation (House and Senate seats).

Federal law requires the [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|Clerk of the House of Representatives]] to notify each state government no later than January 25 of the year immediately following the census of the number of seats to which it is entitled. If the number of seats has changed, the state determines the boundaries of [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional districts]]—geographical areas within the state of approximately equal population—in a process called [[redistricting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|2|2c}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any citizen of the State can challenge the constitutionality of the redistricting in their US district court.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|28|2284|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}

Because the deadline for the House Clerk to report the results does not occur until the following January, and the states need sufficient time to perform the redistricting, the decennial census does not affect the elections that are held during that same year. For example, the electoral college apportionment during 2000 presidential election was still based on the 1990 census results. Likewise, the congressional districts and the electoral college during the 2020 general elections will still be based on the 2010 census.

==Number of members==
[[File:US population per representative.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|The U.S. population has increased more rapidly than the membership of the House of Representatives.]]

The size of the U.S. House of Representatives refers to total number of congressional districts (or seats) into which the land area of the United States proper has been divided.  The number of voting representatives is currently [[Reapportionment Act of 1929|set at 435]]. There are an additional five [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|delegates to the House of Representatives]]. They represent the [[District of Columbia]] and the territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], which first elected a representative in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=79834 Bush signs federalization bill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213232012/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=79834# |date=2009-02-13 }}, Agnes E. Donato, Saipan Tribune, May 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. [[Puerto Rico]] also elects a [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|resident commissioner]] every four years.

===Controversy and history===
Since 1789, when the Federal Government began operating under the Constitution, the number of citizens per congressional district has risen from an average of 33,000 in 1790 to almost 700,000 {{As of|2008|lc=on}}.  Prior to the 20th century, the number of representatives increased every decade as more states joined the union, and the population increased.

The ideal number of members has been a contentious issue since the country's founding. [[George Washington]] agreed that the original representation proposed during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] (one representative for every 40,000) was inadequate and supported an alteration to reduce that number to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2001/01/george-will-called-me-idiot-jonah-goldberg/|title=George Will Called Me An Idiot|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|date=2001-01-15|work=National Review|access-date=2018-04-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213221035/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTMxYWU4ZjU1M2U5NmJhZjc4YjRiY2Y2NTc4MjNjM2M=|archive-date=2009-02-13|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only time that Washington pronounced an opinion on any of the actual issues debated during the entire convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_917.asp Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention - Tuesday September 17, 1787]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 55]], [[James Madison]] argued that the size of the House of Representatives has to balance the ability of the body to legislate with the need for legislators to have a relationship close enough to the people to understand their local circumstances, that such representatives' social class be low enough to sympathize with the feelings of the mass of the people, and that their power be diluted enough to limit their abuse of the public trust and interests.

{{quote|... first, that so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many; ...&lt;ref name="The Federalist #55"&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa55.htm The Federalist #55]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Madison also addressed Anti-Federalist claims that the representation would be inadequate, arguing that the major inadequacies are of minimal inconvenience since these will be cured rather quickly by virtue of decennial reapportionment. He noted, however,

{{quote|I take for granted here what I shall, in answering the fourth objection, hereinafter show, that the number of representatives will be augmented from time to time in the manner provided by the Constitution. On a contrary supposition, I should admit the objection to have very great weight indeed.}}

Madison argued against the assumption that more is better:

{{quote|Sixty or seventy men may be more properly trusted with a given degree of power than six or seven. But it does not follow that six or seven hundred would be proportionally a better depositary. And if we carry on the supposition to six or seven thousand, the whole reasoning ought to be reversed.  ... In all very numerous assemblies, of whatever character composed, passion never fails to wrest the scepter from reason.&lt;ref name="The Federalist #55"/&gt;}}

=== Membership cap===
The [[Apportionment Act of 1911]] ([[Public Law 62-5]]) raised the membership of the U.S. House to 433 and provided for an apportionment. It also provided for additional seats upon the admissions of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] as states, increasing the number to 435 in 1912.

In 1921, Congress failed to reapportion the House membership as required by the United States Constitution. This failure to reapportion may have been politically motivated, as the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1920|newly elected Republican majority]] may have feared the effect such a reapportionment would have on their future electoral prospects.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Representation, Meeting The Ideal of One Man One vote" - [[Michel Balinski]] and H. Peyton Young -- Page 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_conApport.html#seven |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228091000/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_conApport.html#seven#seven |archive-date=2009-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A reapportionment in 1921 in the traditional fashion would have increased the size of the House to 483 seats, but many members would have lost their seats due to the population shifts, and the House chamber did not have adequate seats for 483 members. By 1929, no reapportionment had been made since 1911, and there was vast representational inequity, measured by the average district size. By 1929 some states had districts twice as large as others due to population growth and demographic shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Apportionment of Representatives in Congress|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1927120600|journal=CQ Researcher by CQ Press|language=en|issn=1942-5635}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1929 Congress (with Republican control of both houses of Congress and the presidency) passed the [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]] which capped the size of the House at 435 (the then current number) and established a permanent method for apportioning a constant 435 seats. This cap has remained unchanged since then, except for a temporary increase to 437 members upon the 1959 admission of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] into the Union.&lt;ref name=USHouseO&amp;D&gt;{{cite web| title=Proportional Representation| url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Proportional-Representation/| publisher=Office of the Historian, United States House of Representatives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three states – [[Wyoming]], [[Vermont]], and [[North Dakota]] – have populations smaller than the average for a single district. As of May 2016, there is approximately one representative for every 720,000 people in the country

====Clemons v. Department of Commerce====
{{Main|Clemons v. Department of Commerce}}
A 2009 lawsuit, ''[[Clemons v. Department of Commerce]]'', sought a court order for Congress to increase the size of the House's voting membership and then reapportion the seats in accordance with the population figures of the 2010 Census. The intent of the plaintiff was to rectify the disparity of congressional district population sizes among the states that result from the present method of apportionment. Upon reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2010, the holdings of the lower district and appellate courts were vacated and the case remanded to the U.S. District Court from which the case originated with instructions that the district court dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.

===Proposed expansion===
{{See also|List of U.S. states by population}}
The [[Article the First|first proposed amendment]] to the Constitution within the [[Bill of Rights (United States)|Bill of Rights]] attempted to set a pattern for growth of the House along with the population, but has not been ratified.

{{quote|Article the first ... After the first [[United States Census|enumeration]] required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty thousand persons.&lt;ref name='AmendmentsNotRatified'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|title=Constitutional Amendments Not Ratified|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=United States House of Representatives| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927073820/http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml| archivedate= 27 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The proposed [[Wyoming Rule]] calls for expanding the House until the standard Representative-to-population ratio equals that of the smallest entitled unit (currently the state of [[Wyoming]]). This proposal is primarily designed to address the fact that some House districts are currently nearly twice the size of others; for instance, there are just over 1 million residents in [[Montana]]'s single district, compared to about 570,000 in Wyoming's. Although a larger House size will generally result in the smallest and largest districts being proportionally closer in size, this is not always the case. Therefore, in some cases, the Wyoming Rule may actually result in an increase in the ratio of the sizes of the largest and smallest districts. For instance, after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]] and with a House size of 435, the largest district (Montana's at-large district) had 799,065 residents, 76% larger than the smallest district (Wyoming's at-large district with 453,588 residents). The Wyoming Rule would have given a House size of 547 in 1990. Using that size, the largest district (North Dakota's at-large district) would have had 638,800 residents, 92% larger than the smallest districts (Delaware's two districts at approximately 333,084 residents each), which is larger than the 76% figure mentioned above.

On May 21, 2001, Rep. [[Alcee Hastings]] sent a [[Dear colleague letter (United States)|dear colleague letter]] pointing out that U.S. expansion of its legislature had not kept pace with other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairvote.org/?page=866 House of Representatives? Hardly.], Alcee Hastings, May 21, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, during the [[110th Congress]], [[Thomas M. Davis|Representative Tom Davis]] introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would add two seats to the House, one for Utah and one for the [[District of Columbia]]. It was passed by the House, but was tripped up by procedural hurdles in the Senate and withdrawn from consideration.  An identical bill was reintroduced during the [[111th Congress]].  In February 2009 the Senate adopted the measure 61-37.  In April 2010, however, House leaders decided to shelve the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/20/AR2010042004796.html | work=The Washington Post | first1=Ann E. | last1=Marimow | first2=Ben | last2=Pershing | title=Congressional leaders shelve D.C. voting rights bill | date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apportionment methods==
Apart from the requirement that each state is to be entitled to at least one representative in the House of Representatives, the number of representatives in each state is in principle to be proportional to its population. No fair apportionment method was devised until recently with five distinct apportionment methods having been used since the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], with none of them producing fully proportional apportionment among the states.

The first apportionment was contained in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Art. I, § 2, cl. 3 of the Constitution]]. After the first Census in 1790, Congress passed the [[Apportionment Act of 1792]] and adopted the [[D'Hondt method#D'Hondt and Jefferson|Jefferson method]] to apportion U.S. Representatives to the states based on population.&lt;ref&gt;3 Annals of Cong. 539 (1792)&lt;/ref&gt; The Jefferson method required fractional [[remainder]]s to be discarded when calculating each state's total number of U.S. Representatives and was used until the 1830 census.&lt;ref&gt;Act of Jan. 14, 1802, {{USStat|2|128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of Dec. 21, 1811, {{USStat|2|669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of Mar. 7, 1822, {{USStat|3|651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of May 22, 1832, {{USStat|4|516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sainte-Laguë method|Webster method]],  proposed in 1832 by [[Daniel Webster]] and adopted for the 1840 Census, allocated an additional Representative to states with a fractional remainder greater than 0.5.&lt;ref&gt;Act of 25 June 1842, ch 46, {{USStat|5|491}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]/[[Samuel Finley Vinton|Vinton]] ([[Largest remainder method|largest remainder]]) method was used from 1850&lt;ref&gt;Act of May 23, 1850, {{USStat|9|432-433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of 1862, {{USStat|12|572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of 1872, {{USStat|17|28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of 1882, {{USStat|22|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of 1901, {{USStat|31|733}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1900. The Vinton or Hamilton method was shown to be susceptible to an [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref name=HistoricalApportionment&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Apportionment-Historical Perspective |url=https://www.census.gov/population/apportionment/about/history.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=27 October 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apportionment Act of 1911]], in addition to setting the number of U.S. Representatives at 435, returned to the Webster method, which was used until the 1940 Census, when the current method, known as the [[Huntington–Hill method]] or method of equal proportions, was adopted.&lt;ref name="Kristin D. Burnett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The History of Apportionment in America |publisher=American Mathematical Society |url=http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/apportion2.html |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=2 USC §2a |publisher=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/02/2a- |accessdate=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Computing Apportionment |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/apportionment/computing.html |accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised method was necessary in the context of the cap on the number of Representatives set in 1929.

===The method of equal proportions===
{{Further|Huntington–Hill method}}
The apportionment methodology currently used is the method of equal proportions, so called because it guarantees that no additional transfer of a seat (from one state to another) will reduce the ratio between the numbers of persons per representative in any two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edward V Huntington |title=The Mathematical Theory of the Apportionment of Representatives |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year=1921 |pmc=1084767 |pmid=16576591 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=123–7 |doi=10.1073/pnas.7.4.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method of equal proportions minimizes the percentage differences in the populations of the congressional districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Congressional Apportionment |website=NationalAtlas.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_conApport.html#six |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030080614/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_conApport.html#six#six |archivedate=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2009-02-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this method, as a first step, each of the 50 states is given its one guaranteed seat in the House of Representatives, leaving 385 seats to assign.

The remaining seats are allocated one at a time, to the state with the highest priority number. Thus, the 51st seat would go to the most populous state (currently California). The priority number is determined by a formula that is mathematically computed to be the ratio of the state population to the [[geometric mean]] of the number of seats it currently holds in the assignment process, ''n'' (initially 1), and the number of seats it ''would'' hold ''if'' the seat were assigned to it, ''n''+1.

The formula for determining the priority of a state to be apportioned the next available seat defined by the method of equal proportions is

:&lt;math&gt; A_{n} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{n(n+1)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the population of the state, and ''n'' is the number of seats it currently holds before the possible allocation of the next seat.  An equivalent, recursive definition is

:&lt;math&gt; A_{n+1} = \sqrt{\frac{n}{n+2}} \ A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is still the number of seats the state has before allocation of the next, and for ''n'' = 1, the initial ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is explicitly defined as

:&lt;math&gt; A_{1} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Consider the reapportionment following the 2010 U.S. Census: beginning with all states initially being allocated one seat, the largest value of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the largest state, California, which is allocated seat 51. After being allocated its 2nd seat, its priority value decreases to its ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; value, which is reordered to a position back in line. The 52nd seat goes to Texas, the 2nd largest state, because its ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; priority value is larger than the ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of any other state. However, the 53rd seat goes back to California because its ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; priority value is larger than the ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of any other state. The 54th seat goes to New York because its ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; priority value is larger than the ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of any other state at this point. This process continues until all remaining seats are assigned. Each time a state is assigned a seat, ''n'' is incremented by 1, causing its priority value to be reduced and reordered among the states, whereupon another state normally rises to the top of the list.

The Census 2010 Ranking of Priority Values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=U.S. Bureau of the Census |title=PRIORITY VALUES FOR 2010 CENSUS |publisher=U.S. Bureau of the Census |url=https://www.census.gov/population/apportionment/files/Priority%20Values%202010.pdf |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the order in which seats 51–435 were apportioned after the 2010 Census, with additional listings for the next five priorities. [[Minnesota]] was allocated the final (435th) seat. [[North Carolina]] missed its 14th seat by 15,754 residents as the 436th seat to be allocated; ten years earlier it had gained its 13th seat as the 435th seat to be allocated based on the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=U.S. Bureau of the Census |title=Census 2000 Ranking of Priority Values |publisher=U.S. Bureau of the Census |date=2001-02-21 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/apportionment/00pvalues.txt |accessdate=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note: The first apportionment was established by the Constitution based on population estimates made by the [[Philadelphia Convention]], and was not based on any census or enumeration.''

AR's act of admission was unconditional, so it legally received its House seat the moment the act was signed (June 15, 1836).  Michigan's admission, however, was conditioned on its accepting Congress' award of the disputed Toledo Strip to Ohio in exchange for the Upper Peninsula; it did NOT gain its seat until the presidential proclamation called for by this section was issued (January 26, 1837). This is also why AR is considered to have been admitted first (25th state vs. MI 26th), even though (per the later North &amp; South Dakota precedent) MI's act of admission is deemed to have become law before AR's. --&gt; || [[Michigan]] admitted

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14328">The [[Vietnamese language]] is written with a complex [[Latin-script alphabet]] that requires various accommodations in computing. Historically, Vietnamese was written in a much more complex logographic script, ''{{lang|vi|[[chữ Nôm]]}}'', which does not yet enjoy full computer support.

==Fonts and character encodings==

===Vietnamese alphabet===
{{Multiple image
| direction = vertical
| image1 = Hook (diacritic).svg
| image2 = Hook (diacritic) in Calibri.png
| footer = It is common for two diacritics to be placed on a single Vietnamese vowel. Some fonts stack these diacritics, while others offset the tone mark.
}}

There are as many as 46 [[character encoding]]s for representing the [[Vietnamese alphabet]].&lt;ref name="WinVNKey manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Express Manual for WinVNKey|author1=Ngô Đình Học|author2=Trần Tư Bình|work=WinVNKey|date=July 21, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url=http://winvnkey.sourceforge.net/express-manual-for-winvnkey.htm#The_charsets_in_WinVNKey}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unicode]] has become the most popular, due to its superior compatibility and software support. Diacritics may be encoded either as [[combining character]]s or as [[precomposed character]]s, which are scattered among the [[Latin Extended-A]], [[Latin Extended-B]], and [[Latin Extended Additional]] blocks. The [[Vietnamese đồng]] symbol is encoded in the [[Currency Symbols (Unicode block)|Currency Symbols]] block. The [[Vietnamese language#Middle Vietnamese|Middle Vietnamese]] letter [[B with flourish]] (ꞗ) is included in the [[Latin Extended-D]] block. The [[Apex (diacritic)#Usage in Middle Vietnamese|apex]] is not included in Unicode, but {{unichar|1dc4|Combining macron-acute|cwith=◌}} may serve as a rough approximation.

Early versions of Unicode assigned the characters {{unichar|0340|Combining grave tone mark|cwith=◌}} and {{unichar|0341|Combining acute tone mark|cwith=◌}} for the purpose of placing these marks beside a circumflex, as is common in Vietnamese typography. These two characters have been deprecated; {{unichar|0301|Combining acute accent|cwith=◌}} and {{unichar|0300|Combining grave accent|cwith=◌}} are now used regardless of any present circumflex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combining Diacritical Marks|work=Unicode 7.0 Character Code Charts|publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_0300.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For systems that lack support for Unicode, dozens of 8-bit Vietnamese [[code page]]s have been designed.&lt;ref name="WinVNKey manual"/&gt; The most commonly used of them were [[VISCII]], [[VSCII]] (TCVN 5712:1993), [[Vietnamese Professionals Society|VPS]], and [[Windows-1258]].&lt;ref name="BGTV fonts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chọn Font chữ, bảng mã để gõ tiếng Việt|work=Bộ gõ tiếng Việt.Com|publisher=MangVN|year=2009|url=http://bogotiengviet.com/fontchu-bangma.htm|language=vi|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120102739/http://bogotiengviet.com/fontchu-bangma.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where [[ASCII]] is required, such as when ensuring readability in plain text e-mail, Vietnamese letters are often encoded according to [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable]] (VIQR) or [[VSCII]] Mnemonic (VSCII-MNEM),&lt;ref name="Lunde"&gt;{{cite book|title=CJKV Information Processing|edition=2nd|first=Ken|last=Lunde|authorlink=Ken Lunde|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|year=2009|pages=47–49|isbn=978-0-596-51447-1|via=Google Books|url=//books.google.com/books?id=SA92uQqTB-AC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though usage of either variable-width scheme has declined dramatically following the adoption of Unicode on the [[World Wide Web]]. For instance, support for all above mentioned 8-bit encodings, with the exception of Windows-1258, was dropped from [[Mozilla]] software in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/2P5kCJJS_WI Character encoding changes in m-c require c-c action]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Vietnamese fonts intended for [[desktop publishing]] are encoded in [[VNI#VNI Encoding|VNI]] or TCVN3 ([[VSCII]]).&lt;ref name="BGTV fonts"/&gt; Such fonts are known as "ABC fonts".&lt;ref name="Hoang To"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sử ký Tinh Vân: 20 năm sẻ chia và sáng tạo|trans-title=History of Tinhvan: 20 years of sharing and creating|volume=1|author1=Hoàng Tô|author2=Nguyễn Quan Sơn|author3=Nguyễn Sơn Tùng|author4=Phan Quang Minh|author5=Phạm Thúc Trương Lương|author6=Nguyễn Quang Hiệp|author7=Bùi Văn Kiên|author8=Nguyễn Ích Vinh|publisher=Tinhvan Group|date=20 July 2014|page=37|via=Google Books|url=//books.google.com/books?id=aaZABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular [[web browser]]s lack support for specialty Vietnamese encodings, so any webpage that uses these fonts appears as unintelligible ''[[mojibake]]'' on systems without them installed.

[[File:I acute - soft dotted and Lithuanian dot.svg|thumb|right|At right, an ''í'' that retains its [[tittle]].]]

Vietnamese frequently stacks diacritics, so typeface designers must take care to prevent stacked diacritics from colliding with adjacent letters or lines. When a tone mark is used together with another diacritic, offsetting the tone mark to the right preserves consistency and avoids slowing down [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Design Challenges|first=Donny|last=Trương|work=Vietnamese Typography|accessdate=April 10, 2018|url=https://vietnamesetypography.com/design-challenges/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advertising signage and in [[cursive]] handwriting, diacritics often take forms unfamiliar to other Latin alphabets. For example, the lowercase letter I retains its [[tittle]] in ''ì'', ''ỉ'', ''ĩ'', and ''í''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite book|chapter=Viết Thư|title=Vietnamese reading selections|edition=2|publisher=[[w:Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]]|year=1956|pages=98–100|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015082440291;view=1up;seq=4|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nuances are rarely accounted for in computing environments.

===''{{lang|vi|Chữ Nôm}}''===
[[File:Nom Character V04-5055.svg|thumb|right|180px|alt=𬖾|The ''{{lang|vi|nôm}}'' character for ''{{lang|vi|[[pho|phở]]}}'' is {{vi-nom|𬖾}}.&lt;ref name="Kiem"&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=phở|author=Trần Văn Kiệm|work=Giúp đọc Nôm và Hán Việt|edition=4th|year=2004|url=http://nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Dictionary|language=vi}} [http://nomfoundation.org/common/nom_details.php?codepoint=6309d&amp;img=1]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Unicode includes over 10,000 ''{{lang|vi|nôm}}'' characters as part of Unicode's repertoire of [[CJK Unified Ideographs]]. Of these characters, 10,082 can be found in the [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B]] block, while the rest are distributed between the [[CJK Unified Ideographs]], [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A]], and [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C]] blocks. A further 1,028 characters, including over 400 characters specific to the [[Tày language]], are encoded in the [[CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E]] block. The characters are taken from the Vietnamese standards [[TCVN 5773:1993]] and [[TCVN 6909:2001]], as well as from research by the Han-Nom Research Institute and other groups.&lt;ref name="VNPF Hồng"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nguyễn Quang Hồng|title=Giới thiệu Kho chữ Hán Nôm mã hoá|trans-title=Hán Nôm Coded Character Repertoire Introduction|publisher=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/vn/du-an-nom/Kho-chu-Han-Nom-ma-hoa/Gioi-thieu-Kho-chu-Han-Nom-ma-hoa|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the characters in TCVN 5773:1993 and about 95% of the characters in TCVN 6909:2001 have corresponding codepoints in Unicode 5.1, though TCVN 5773:1993 itself mapped most of its characters to the [[Private Use Area]] of Unicode.{{sfn|Lunde|2009|pp=152–153}}

The two most comprehensive ''{{lang|vi|nôm}}'' fonts are the [[Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation]]'s ''{{lang|vi|Nôm Na Tống}} Light''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nôm Font|publisher=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url=http://nomfoundation.org/nom-tools/Nom-Font}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the community-developed ''HAN NOM A''/''HAN NOM B'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICODE Han Nom Font Set|author1=Đỗ Quốc Bảo|author2=Tô Minh Tâm|author3=Thiền Viện Viên Chiếu|date=December 8, 2005|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url=http://vietunicode.sourceforge.net/fonts/fonts_hannom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which place a large number of unstandardized characters in the [[Private Use Areas]].

The Unicode Consortium's [[Han unification#Unihan database files|Unihan]] database includes Vietnamese readings of some characters but does not distinguish between [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] and ''{{lang|vi|nôm}}'' readings.

Like other [[CJK characters|CJKV writing systems]], ''{{lang|vi|chữ Nôm}}'' is traditionally [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|written vertically]], from top to bottom and right to left.

Both {{lang|vi|chữ Hán}} and {{lang|vi|chữ Nôm}} may be annotated using [[ruby character]]s.{{sfn|Lunde|2009|p=529}}

==Text input==
A purely physical Vietnamese keyboard would be impractical, due to the sheer number of letter-diacritic-diacritic combinations in the alphabet. Instead, Vietnamese input relies on software-based keyboard layouts, [[virtual keyboard]]s, or [[input method]]s (also known as IMEs).

===Keyboard layouts===
[[File:KB Vietnamese.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Microsoft Windows]] includes a Vietnamese keyboard layout based on TCVN 6064:1995.]]

Vietnamese keyboard layouts rely on [[dead key]]s to compose letters with diacritics. Most desktop operating systems include a Vietnamese keyboard layout similar to [[TCVN 6064:1995]], a Vietnamese national standard.

===Input methods===
[[File:Xvnkb-screenshot.png|thumb|left|upright|xvnkb, an IME compatible with the [[X Input Method]] framework on Unix systems, supports output in six character encodings.]]

The three common Vietnamese input methods are [[Telex (input method)|Telex]], [[VNI#VNI Input Method|VNI]], and [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]]. Telex indicates diacritics using letters that are unlikely to appear at the end of a word, while VNI repurposes the number keys or function keys and VIQR repurposes various punctuation marks. The Telex and VIQR conventions originated in an earlier era of [[telex]] machines and typewriters, respectively.

Support for these input methods is provided by input method editors (IMEs), which are known in Vietnamese as ''{{lang|vi|bộ gõ}}'', literally "pecker". IMEs may be provided by the operating system, installed as a third-party application, installed as a [[browser extension]], or provided by an individual website in the form of a [[Scripting language|script]]. Common third-party applications include GoTiengViet, [[UniKey (IME)|UniKey]], VietKey, [[VPSKeys]], [[WinVNKey]], and xvnkb. On [[Unix-like]] operating systems, the [[Intelligent Input Bus|IBus]] and [[Smart Common Input Method|SCIM]] frameworks both support Vietnamese. IMEs scripts such as AVIM, Mudim, and VietTyping can be found on most Vietnamese [[Internet forum|message board]]s, the [[Vietnamese Wikipedia]], and other text-intensive websites. The Vietnamese Web browser [[Cốc Cốc]] comes with an input method built-in.

Input methods allow words to be composed in a more flexible order than keyboard layouts allow. For example, to enter the word "{{lang|vi|[[wikt:viết|viết]]}}" using the TCVN 6064:1995 keyboard layout, one must type {{key press|V}}{{key press|I}}{{key press|3}}{{key press|8}}{{key press|T}}, in that order. By contrast, most IMEs permit the user to insert diacritics at the end of the word: {{key press|V}}{{key press|I}}{{key press|E}}{{key press|E}}{{key press|T}}{{key press|S}} in Telex, {{key press|V}}{{key press|I}}{{key press|E}}{{key press|T}}{{key press|6}}{{key press|1}} in VNI, or {{key press|V}}{{key press|I}}{{key press|E}}{{key press|T}}{{key press|^}}{{key press|'}} in VIQR. Some IMEs even allow diacritics to be entered before their base letters. Depending on an IME's implementation, it may also be possible to edit an existing word's diacritics without retyping the word.

Borrowing a feature common among [[Chinese input methods for computers|Chinese input methods]], some Vietnamese IMEs allow one to skip diacritics altogether. Instead, after typing the base letters, the user selects the accented word from a candidate list. In order to provide this [[autocomplete]] list, the IME may need to communicate with a [[Web service]]. Some IMEs also use candidate lists to allow the user to convert text from the Vietnamese alphabet to ''{{lang|vi|chữ Nôm}}'', because there is no one-to-one correspondence between alphabetic words and ''{{lang|vi|nôm}}'' characters.

==Other considerations==
Typical Vietnamese text contains a high proportion of compound words. Compound words are never hyphenated in contemporary usage, so [[spell checker]]s are limited to checking individual syllables unless a statistical [[language model]] is consulted.

Vietnamese has rigid spelling rules and few exceptions, so [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech engine]]s may avoid dictionary lookups except when encountering a foreign loan word. TTS engines must account for [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, which are essential to the meaning of any Vietnamese word.
