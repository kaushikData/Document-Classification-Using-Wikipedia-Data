      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2947">'''Acerrimo Moerore''' (January 2, 1949) is a letter of [[Pope Pius XII]] to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Episcopate]] after the [[jail]]ing and [[torturing]] of Cardinal [[Joseph Mindszenty]].&lt;ref&gt;Acerrimo Moerore,  Acta Apostolicae Sedis, AAS 1949  29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of letter==
The Pope asks the Catholic [[bishop]]s of Hungary to pray to the [[Virgin Mary]] and to include in their prayers to her those who persecute them.  They should also pray for those who live in [[hate]] and discord, so that with divine assistance better and more peaceful times may descend over Hungary.

The Pope is alarmed over the jailing and torturing of Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty, a violation of [[human rights]] and dignity, and an [[affront]] against religion itself. Not only the Catholics in [[Hungary]], decent people all over he world watch  in horror. The Cardinal stood up for the freedom of the Church and the Hungarian people, and therefore all accusations are highly honourable.  The Pope takes part in the continued suffering of the Hungarian bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Acerrimo Moerore 3&lt;/ref&gt;   Freedom is so important, that it may be necessary to sacrifice one's life.

The Pope is quite aware of the great tribulations and sufferings, which the Church has to endure in Hungary. But he is also aware of the great [[loyalty]] and strength of its bishops, who are asked  to combine courage with wisdom in this situation. He appeals to them to be united. He reminds them, that their forefathers overcame similar problems. They knew that the Christian faith can be maligned and attacked,   but never defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Acerrimo Moerore 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeals to them,  to follow their examples. They  will find the most wonderful consolation and help;  the consolation to work for the peace and kingdom of  Christ. His kingdom is not of this world, because of the mandate, to change behaviour and life,   in order to reach through this earthly misery the heavenly kingdom. The Pope concludes his  letter with the most cordial [[Apostolic Blessing]]s to his brother bishops and their faithful, especially all those who are persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Acerrimo Moerore 7&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8789">[[Image:Underwater Panther rock painting (crop).jpg|right|350px|thumb|Picture on a rock of an [[underwater panther]] (''mishibizhiw'') as well as two snakes and a canoe, attributed to the [[Ojibwe people]].  From [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]].]] '''Anishinaabe traditional beliefs''' cover the traditional belief system of the [[Anishinaabe]]g peoples, consisting of the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]]/[[Nipissing First Nation|Nipissing]], [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwa/Chippewa]]/[[Saulteaux]]/[[Mississaugas]], [[Odawa people|Odawa]], [[Potawatomi]] and [[Oji-Cree]], located primarily in the [[Great Lakes region]] of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

==Medicine Societies==
The Anishinaabe have three different Medicine Societies.

===Midewiwin===
{{Main article|Midewiwin}}
The '''''Midewiwin''''' (also spelled '''Midewin''' and '''Medewiwin''') is the '''Grand Medicine Society''' of the indigenous groups of the [[Maritimes]], [[New England]] and [[Great Lakes]] regions in North America. Its practitioners are called ''Midew'' and the practices of ''Midewiwin'' referred to as the ''Mide''.  The ''Midewiwin'' society is a secretive [[Animism|animistic]] religion, requiring an initiation, and then progressing to four levels of practitioners, called "degrees". Occasionally, male ''Midew'' are called ''Midewinini'', which sometimes is very loosely translated into English as "[[medicine man]]".

===Waabanowin===
{{Main article|Wabunowin}}
The  '''''Waabanowin''''' (also spelled '''Wabuowin''', '''Wabunohwin''' and '''Wabunohiwin''') is the '''Dawn Society''', also sometime improperly called the "Magical Dawn Society". Its practitioners are called ''Waabanow'' and the practices of ''Waabanowin'' referred to as the ''Waabano''. The ''Wabanowin'' are distinct society of visionaries. Like the ''Midewiwin'', the ''Waabanowin'' is a secretive [[Animism|animistic]] religion, requiring an initiation. But unlike the ''Mide'', the ''Waabano'' have sometimes two levels and sometimes four. This variation being dependent on the particular lodge.  They were systematically imprisoned in [[mental hospital]]s by the United States government in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Because of this persecution the ''Waabanowin'' went underground and have just begun to reemerge since the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]]. The ceremonies and traditions are closely guarded.

===Jiisakiiwin===
The '''''Jiisakiiwin''''' are also known as the '''Shaking Tent''' or the '''Juggler's Tent'''. Among the Anishinaabeg, a particularly powerful and well-respected spiritual leader who had trained from childhood is called a ''Jaasakiid'' or ''Jiisakiiwinini'', also known as a "Juggler" or "Shaking-tent Seer." In the past they were hunted down and murdered by both Canadian and United States officials. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Migration story===
According to the oral history of the Anishinaabeg, they originally lived on the shores of the "Great Salt Water" (presumably the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]). They were instructed by seven prophets to follow a sacred ''miigis'' shell ([[whiteshell]]) toward the west, until they reached a place where food grew upon the water.&lt;ref&gt;Benton-Banai (1988), pp. 89-102&lt;/ref&gt; They began their migration some time around 950,&lt;ref name="BBonezerotwo"&gt;Benton-Banai (1988), pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; stopping at various points several times along the way, most significantly at ''Baawitigong'', [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], where they stayed for a long time, and where two subgroups decided to stay (these became the [[Potawatomi]] and [[Ottawa]]). Eventually, after a trick by two of the clans, the other clans travelled West (see William Warren's account of this incident) and arrived at the [[wild rice|wild ricing]] lands of Minnesota and Wisconsin (wild rice being the food that grew upon the water) and made ''Mooningwanekaaning minis'' ([[Madeline Island]]: "Island of the [[yellow-shafted flicker]]") their new capital. In total, the migration took around five centuries.&lt;ref name="BBonezerotwo" /&gt;

Following the migration there was a cultural divergence separating the Potawatomi from the Ojibway and Ottawa. Particularly, the Potawatomi did not adopt the agricultural innovations discovered or adopted by the Ojibway, such as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] crop complex, copper tools, conjugal collaborative farming, and the use of canoes in rice harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes, Waldman &amp; Braun.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Nanabozho stories===
{{Main article|Nanabozho}}

'''[[Nanabozho]]''' (also known by a variety of other names and spellings, including ''Wenabozho'', ''Menabozho'', and ''Nanabush'') is a [[trickster]] figure and [[culture hero]] who features as the protagonist of a cycle of stories that serve as the [[Anishinaabe]] origin belief. The cycle, which varies somewhat from community to community, tells the story of Nanabozho's conception, birth, and his ensuing adventures, which involve interactions with [[Manitou|spirit]] and animal beings, the creation of the Earth, and the establishment of the [[Midewiwin]].  The myth cycle explains the origin of several traditions, including [[mourning]] customs, beliefs about the [[afterlife]], and the creation of the sacred plant ''asemaa'' ([[tobacco]]).

In regards to romantic relationships, [[Buddhism]] has very liberal views.&lt;ref&gt;"Dhammananda, K. Sri. "Buddhist Views on Marriage." Www.budsas.org. Buddhist Study and Practice Group, [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/237.htm], 11 Mar. 2001. Retrieved on 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddhism encourages independence through non attachment. Non attachment is the idea that in order to be fulfilled and happy in life, a person cannot be attached to any one thing because this thing can cause suffering.&lt;ref&gt;'Valentine, Matt. "The Beginners Guide to Letting Go and Becoming Enlightened Through Non-Attachment." www.buddhaimonia.com. 02 Mar. 2015. Web. 16 Apr. 2016. [http://buddhaimonia.com/let-go-find-peace].'&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be happy and to follow the path of enlightenment, Buddhism teaches people to discard all things in life that can cause pain. This idea is not referring to worldly objects in the physical sense, but in a spiritual sense. To achieve non attachment, one must detach from the idea of a perfect person and holding one’s partner to an impossible standard. Instead, one must accept a partner for who they are unconditionally. In Buddhism, this is the key to a happy romantic relationship. Accepting a partner for who they are, for who they are throughout their life no matter what changes, and making the best of every situation is how one achieves personal fulfillment in a romantic relationship.

The idea of [[unconditional love]] is essentially what Buddhism teaches.&lt;ref&gt;"Piver, Susan. "Buddhism and Relationships." Www.pbs.org. 01 Mar. 2010. Retrieved on 16 Apr. 2016. [https://www.pbs.org/thebuddha/blog/2010/Mar/1/buddhism-and-relationships-susan-piver]."&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is a [[social construct]] that has changed vastly throughout the course of history. People married for a variety of reasons including: status, wealth, power and love. Buddhist text do not delve too deeply into the idea of marriage because Buddhism leaves the decision to marry up to each individual person. In Buddhism, marriage is not a religious obligation, a means for procreation, or a romantic notion of love. It is simply an option for each individual to make. If an individual believes marriage will bring them happiness and keep them on the path of enlightenment, then they are free to make that choice. Buddhism does not provide rules or traditions about marriage; instead, the religion offers advice to help a person live happily while they are married. This advice is thought to help give people the best chance at a happy relationship. Buddhist texts do make it clear that men should be limited to one wife. A major belief in Buddhism in regards to marriage is that one should not stray from their wife and family.&lt;ref&gt;"Dhammananda, K. Sri. "Buddhist Views on Marriage." Www.budsas.org. Buddhist Study and Practice Group, [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/237.htm], 11 Mar. 2001. Retrieved on 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist text, it is clear that The Buddha thought that the biggest hurdle of man is their weakness to other women. He saw the weakness and trouble that other women brought to a family and advised against it. Instead of a religious obligation, marriage is seen as an individual choice. Buddhism allows for each person to make the decision of whether or not they want to be married, how many children they want to have, and who they want to marry.

The way Buddhists view divorce is very interesting. The religion does not prohibit it, but, the idea of living the Buddhist lifestyle would suggest that one not need to divorce. If a person is living by the ideals of Buddhism and accepting someone for who they are and following the path of enlightenment, it stands to argument that they would never need a divorce because they would be fulfilled with their marriage and their partner. It is also stated that separation is preferable to being miserable for a prolonged period of time. The religion prefers that a couple separate rather than live together and be counterproductive to personal fulfillment and enlightenment. Buddhism also made it clear that to prevent divorce; older men should not have younger wives. The claim was that the age difference would make them incompatible and cause problems leading to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;"Dhammananda, K. Sri. "Buddhist Views on Marriage." Www.budsas.org. Buddhist Study and Practice Group, [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/237.htm], 11 Mar. 2001. Retrieved on 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Buddhism says that any person is free to divorce, especially if it is hindering their path to personal fulfillment. However, it makes the important distinction that living a Buddhist lifestyle would mean creating a happy and strong relationship that would not end in divorce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">The '''Carbonária''' was originally an anti-clerical, revolutionary, conspiratorial society, originally established in [[Portugal]] in 1822 and soon disbanded. It was allied with the Italian [[Carbonari]]. A new organization of the same name and claiming to be its continuation was founded in 1896 by Artur Augusto Duarte da Luz de Almeida. This organization agitated against the monarchy and was involved in various anti-monarchist conspiracies. Its operational units, structured into a hierarchy of ''barracas'', ''choças'' and ''vendas'', received military training.

On 1 February, 1908 [[Charles of Portugal|King Carlos I of Portugal]] and his eldest son and heir [[Luis Filipe, Duke of Braganza|Luis Filipe]] were assassinated by [[Alfredo Luís da Costa]] and [[Manuel Buíça]] in a conspiracy involving the Carbonária.&lt;ref name="payne"&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne22.htm Chapter 22 Portugal under the Nineteenth-Century Constitutional Monarchy], Stanley G. Payne, A History of Spain and Portugal, Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910 the Carbonária had some 40,000 members and was instrumental in the Republican [[5 October 1910 revolution]].&lt;ref name="payne" /&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Dennett was born on March 28, 1942 in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck) and Daniel Clement Dennett, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C&amp;pg=PA615&amp;dq=Daniel+Dennett+1942+father | title = Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers | isbn = 9781843710370 | author1 = Shook | first1 = John R | date = June 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/daniel-c-dennett-reference/daniel-c-dennett|title=Daniel C. Dennett Biography|work=eNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett spent part of his childhood in [[Lebanon]], where, during [[World War II]], his father was a covert counter-intelligence agent with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] posing as a cultural attaché to the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name="Spydad"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/23/nyregion/23spydad.html |title=A Dead Spy, a Daughter's Questions and the C.I.A |periodical=New York Times |last=Feuer |first=Alan |publication-date=2007-10-23 |work= |accessdate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was five, his mother took him back to Massachusetts after his father died in an unexplained plane crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,1193371,00.html|title=The semantic engineer|first=Andrew|last=Brown|date=April 17, 2004|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett.&lt;ref name="Spydad"/&gt; Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, "You know what you are, Daniel? You're a philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;Dennett in conversation with [[Michio Kaku]] on ''[http://www.kpfa.org/exploration-67 Explorations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712172013/http://www.kpfa.org/exploration-67 |date=July 12, 2014 }}'' radio program (broadcast on [[KPFA-FM]], [[Berkeley, California]], June 12, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennett graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in 1959, and spent one year at [[Wesleyan University]] before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1963.  At [[Harvard University]] he was a student of [[W. V. Quine]]. In 1965, he received his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the [[University of Oxford]], where he studied under [[Gilbert Ryle]] and was a member of [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford College]].&lt;ref name="In-depth interview with Daniel Dennett"&gt;{{citation |url=https://highprofiles.info/interview/daniel-dennett/ |title=In-depth interview with Daniel Dennett |last=Spencer |first=Nick |publication-date=2013 |work= |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation was entitled "The Mind and the Brain: Introspective Description in the Light of Neurological Findings; Intentionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel C.

[[File:Daniel dennett Oct2008.JPG|thumb|left|Dennett in 2008]]
Dennett describes himself as "an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]]—or, more properly, the beneficiary of hundreds of hours of informal tutorials on all the fields that interest me, from some of the world's leading scientists".&lt;ref name="what_I_want_to_be"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |editor=[[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] |title=Curious Minds: How a Child Becomes a Scientist |origyear=2004 |date=September 13, 2005 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-7686-2 |chapter=What I Want to Be When I Grow Up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the recipient of a [[Fulbright Fellowship]], two [[Guggenheim Fellowships]], and a Fellowship at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/daniel-dennett|title=American Scientist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] and a Humanist Laureate of the [[International Academy of Humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?page=index&amp;section=iah|title=Council for Secular Humanism|work=secularhumanism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named 2004 Humanist of the Year by the [[American Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_the_AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year|title=Humanists of the Year|work=American Humanist Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, he was named to the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]'s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/ |title= Honorary FFRF Board Announced |accessdate=August 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217052917/http://ffrf.org/news/releases/honorary-ffrf-board-announced/|archivedate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]], an annual award for a person who has made an exceptional contribution to European culture, society or social science, "for his ability to translate the cultural significance of science and technology to a broad audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=346065|title=Erasmus Prize 2012 Awarded to Daniel C.

In 2018, he was awarded an [[Honorary Degree]] by [[Radboud University]], located in [[Nijmegen]], [[Netherlands]] for his contributions to and influence on cross-disciplinary science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ru.nl/english/news-agenda/news/vm/2018/february/honorary-doctorates-radboud-university-2018/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
{{Criticism of Christianity sidebar}}

===Free will===
While he is a confirmed [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] on [[free will]], in "On Giving Libertarians What They Say They Want"—Chapter 15 of his 1978 book ''[[Brainstorms]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology'', MIT Press (1978), pp. 286–299&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett articulated the case for a two-stage model of decision making in contrast to [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] views.

{{quote|The model of decision making I am proposing has the following feature: when we are faced with an important decision, a consideration-generator whose output is to some degree undetermined, produces a series of considerations, some of which may of course be immediately rejected as irrelevant by the agent (consciously or unconsciously). Those considerations that are selected by the agent as having a more than negligible bearing on the decision then figure in a reasoning process, and if the agent is in the main reasonable, those considerations ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent's final decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Brainstorms'', p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including [[William James]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Arthur Holly Compton]], and [[Henry Margenau]], Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:

{{quote|
# First ... The intelligent selection, rejection, and weighing of the considerations that do occur to the subject is a matter of intelligence making the difference.
# Second, I think it installs indeterminism in the right place for the libertarian, if there is a right place at all.
# Third ... from the point of view of biological engineering, it is just more efficient and in the end more rational that decision making should occur in this way.
# A fourth observation in favor of the model is that it permits moral education to make a difference, without making all of the difference.
# Fifth—and I think this is perhaps the most important thing to be said in favor of this model—it provides some account of our important intuition that we are the authors of our moral decisions.
# Finally, the model I propose points to the multiplicity of decisions that encircle our moral decisions and suggests that in many cases our ultimate decision as to which way to act is less important phenomenologically as a contributor to our sense of free will than the prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself: the decision, for instance, not to consider any further, to terminate deliberation; or the decision to ignore certain lines of inquiry.
}}

{{quote|These prior and subsidiary decisions contribute, I think, to our sense of ourselves as responsible free agents, roughly in the following way: I am faced with an important decision to make, and after a certain amount of deliberation, I say to myself: "That's enough. I've considered this matter enough and now I'm going to act," in the full knowledge that I could have considered further, in the full knowledge that the eventualities may prove that I decided in error, but with the acceptance of responsibility in any case.&lt;ref&gt;''Brainstorms'', pp. 295–97&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leading libertarian philosophers such as [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, [[Moral character|character]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and feelings and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]]. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:

{{quote|[As Dennett admits,] a causal indeterminist view of this deliberative kind does not give us everything libertarians have wanted from free will. For [the agent] does not have complete control over what chance images and other thoughts enter his mind or influence his deliberation. They simply come as they please. [The agent] does have some control ''after'' the chance considerations have occurred.}}
{{quote|But then there is no more chance involved. What happens from then on, how he reacts, is ''determined'' by desires and beliefs he already has. So it appears that he does not have control in the ''libertarian'' sense of what happens after the chance considerations occur as well. Libertarians require more than this for full responsibility and free will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kane, ''A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will'', Oxford (2005) pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Philosophy of mind===
Dennett has remarked in several places (such as "Self-portrait", in ''Brainchildren'') that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in [[empirical]] research. In his original [[Thesis|dissertation]], ''Content and Consciousness'', he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as ''Content and Consciousness'' has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided ''Brainstorms'' into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in ''The [[Intentional stance|Intentional Stance]]'' and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Guttenplan |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Guttenplan|title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1994 |pages=642 |isbn=0-631-19996-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 5 of ''Consciousness Explained'' Dennett describes his [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness. He states that, "all varieties of perception—indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity—are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'" (p.&amp;nbsp;111). Later he asserts, "These yield, over the course of time, something ''rather like'' a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ..." (p.&amp;nbsp;135, emphasis in the original).

In this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as [[Neural Darwinism]]. He also presents an argument against [[qualia]]; he argues that the [[concept]] is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of [[physicalism]]. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.

Dennett self-identifies with a few terms: "[Others] note that my 'avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters' often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dennett, ''The Message is: There is no Medium''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Consciousness Explained'', he affirms "I am a sort of '[[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|teleofunctionalist]]', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist'". He goes on to say, "I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of [[Verificationism|verificationist]]".{{Page needed|date=September 2017}}

===Evolutionary debate===
Much of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (''Kinds of Minds''), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (''[[Freedom Evolves]]'').

Dennett sees evolution by natural selection as an [[algorithm]]ic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as [[long division]] often incorporate a significant degree of [[randomness]]).&lt;ref&gt;p. 52-60, ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life'' (Simon &amp; Schuster; reprint edition 1996) ({{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who preferred to stress the "pluralism" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).

Dennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly [[Adaptationism|adaptationist]], in line with his theory of the [[intentional stance]], and the evolutionary views of [[biologist]] Richard Dawkins. In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould.  This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with [[E. O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over human [[sociobiology]] and its descendant [[evolutionary psychology]], which Gould and [[Richard Lewontin]] opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and [[Steven Pinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of "[[greedy reductionism]]", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: "Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply." Gould, 1980. [http://www.ags.uci.edu/~mzyoung/p1.htm "Sociobiology and the Theory of Natural Selection"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070715005236/http://www.ags.uci.edu/~mzyoung/p1.htm |date=July 15, 2007 }} In G. W. Barlow and J. Silverberg, eds., ''Sociobiology: Beyond Nature/Nurture?'' Boulder CO: Westview Press, pp. 257–269.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong disagreements have been launched against Dennett from Gould and his supporters, who allege that Dennett overstated his claims and misrepresented Gould's to reinforce what Gould describes as Dennett's "Darwinian fundamentalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/Gould.html 'Evolution: The pleasures of Pluralism']&amp;nbsp;— Stephen Jay Gould's review of ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', June 26, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennett's theories have had a significant influence on the work of evolutionary psychologist [[Geoffrey Miller (evolutionary psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]].

===An account of religion and morality===
[[File:Solidarity message to ex-Muslims - Daniel Dennett.webm|thumb|left|Daniel Dennett sends a solidarity message to [[Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain|ex-Muslims convening in London]] in July 2017.]]

In ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Dennett writes that evolution can account for the origin of morality. He rejects the idea of the [[naturalistic fallacy]] as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.

In his 2006 book, ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'', Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.
In this book he declares himself to be "[[Brights movement|a bright]]", and defends the term.

He has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a "Don't ask, don't tell" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual.&lt;ref name="Dennett2010"&gt;[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP08122150.pdf Preachers who are not Believers (PDF)], Evolutionary Psychology, Vol. 8, Issue 1, March 2010, pp. 122–50, ({{ISSN|1474-7049}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffic.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_247_011511.mp3 Podcast: interview with Daniel Dennett. Further developments of the research: pastors, priests, and an Imam who are closet atheists].&lt;/ref&gt; The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, ''Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehumanist.com/magazine/may-june-2014/arts_entertainment/caught-in-the-pulpit-leaving-belief-behind|title=Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind - TheHumanist.com|date=2014-04-22|work=TheHumanist.com|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other philosophical views===
He has also written about and advocated the notion of [[memetics]] as a philosophically useful tool, most recently in his "Brains, Computers, and Minds", a three-part presentation through Harvard's MBB 2009 Distinguished Lecture Series.

Dennett has been critical of [[postmodernism]], having said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Postmodernism, the school of "thought" that proclaimed "There are no truths, only interpretations" has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for "conversations" in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel (October 19, 2013). [http://edge.org/conversation/dennett-on-wieseltier-v-pinker-in-the-new-republic "Dennett on Wieseltier V. Pinker in The New Republic: Let's Start With A Respect For Truth."]  ''Edge.org''.  Retrieved August 4, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dennett adopted and somewhat redefined the term "deepity", originally coined by Miriam Weizenbaum&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel. ''Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking''.  W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2013 p.56&lt;/ref&gt; (daughter of computer scientist [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]). Dennett used "deepity" for a statement that is apparently profound, but is actually trivial on one level and meaningless on another. Generally, a deepity has two (or more) meanings: one that is true but trivial, and another that sounds profound and would be important if true, but is actually false or meaningless. Examples are "Que sera sera!", "Beauty is only skin deep!", "The power of intention can transform your life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/25/change-your-life-life-deepities-oliver-burkeman |title=This column will change your life: deepities - 'A deepity isn't just any old pseudo-profound bit of drivel. It's a specific kind of statement that can be read in two different ways…'|newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 May 2013  |author=Oliver Burkeman |accessdate= 6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Wikt:Citations:deepity#English|has been cited]] many times.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
While approving of the increase in efficiency that humans reap by using resources such as expert systems in medicine or GPS in navigation, Dennett sees a danger in machines performing an ever-increasing proportion of basic tasks in perception, memory, and algorithmic computation because people may tend to anthropomorphize such systems and attribute intellectual powers to them that they do not possess.&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 402&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the relevant danger from AI is that people will misunderstand the nature of basically "parasitic" AI systems, rather than employing them constructively to challenge and develop the human user's powers of comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.402-403&lt;/ref&gt;

As given in his most recent book, ''[[From Bacteria to Bach and Back]]'', Dennett's views stand in contradistinction to those of [[Nick Bostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. 400&lt;/ref&gt;  Although acknowledging that it is  "possible in principle" to create AI with human-like comprehension and agency, Dennett maintains that the difficulties of any such "[[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]" project would be orders of magnitude greater than those raising concerns have realized.&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P. p164-5 and 399-400&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dennett, the prospect of [[superintelligence]] (AI massively exceeding the cognitive performance of humans in all domains) is at least 50 years away, and of far less pressing significance than other problems the world faces.&lt;ref&gt;From Bacteria to Bach and Back The Evolution of Minds, Daniel C. Dennett 2017 Penguin P.399-400&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dennett married Susan Bell in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fullerton.edu/cmcconnell/491/AP/Dennett.html "Author Profile:  Daniel Dennett."]''Fullerton.edu''.

[[File:Deir el-Shelwit recycled Medinet Habu.jpg|200px|thumb|Reused blocks in the southern wall]]
'''Deir el-Shelwit''' (Arabic: دير الشلويط – Dayr aš-Šalwīṭ, French: ''Deir Chelouit''&lt;ref name="zivie"&gt;Christiane M. Zivie: ''Le temple du Deir Chelouit'', Cairo, IFAO, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] to [[Isis]] from the Greco-Roman period. It stands on the West bank of the [[Nile]] at [[Luxor]], 1&amp;nbsp;km from [[Malkata]] and about 4&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]].&lt;ref name="waseda"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waseda.jp/prj-egypt/sites/Msouth-E.html#Isis_Temple|title=Excavations of the Architecture "Kom al-Samak" and Other Investigations at Malqata-south|website=www.waseda.jp|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today all that remains of the temple is its small main building and ruins of the [[Pylon (architecture)|propylon]], along with its brick enclosure wall and the well.&lt;ref name="waseda" /&gt; The temple precinct had an area of 74×51 metres; the temple itself is much smaller, with an area of 13×16 m.&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;Dieter Arnold, Sabine H. Gardiner, Nigel Strudwick, Helen Strudwick: ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture'', I.B. Tauris, 2003, {{ISBN|1-86064-465-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-86064-465-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its entrance faces south. The outer walls do not have much decoration but on the inside the reliefs are well preserved. The shrine is surrounded by a corridor from which side chapels and a ''[[wabet]]'' (place of cleansing) open; also the stairs lead to the roof from this corridor.&lt;ref name="arnold" /&gt; On the southern side of the outer wall some stone blocks from earlier buildings had been reused, judging from the reliefs on them most of them appear to be from [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]].

The propylon is located 60 meters east from the temple, and is lavishly decorated on all sides.

The importance of the Isis temple of Deir el-Shelwit is because Graeco-Roman era religious buildings are rare in this area, and this is the only one not associated with the [[Theban Triad]] but with Isis.

==History==
According to inscriptions on the propylon, construction of the Isis temple started around the beginning of 1st century [[Common_Era|CE]]. No earlier building is known to have stood on this site.&lt;ref name="waseda"/&gt; According to one theory the temple's construction started under the reign of [[Nectanebo II]] and reached its finished form during the Greek-Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxor-on-line.com/temple-deir-el-shelwit.html Luxor Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation==
The temple was first examined by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] in the mid-19th century, but he did not make a detailed description of it. A French expedition led by [[Christiane Zivie]] studied the inscriptions on the propylon and published their studies in 1992.&lt;ref name="zivie" /&gt; Between 1971 and 1979 archaeologists from the [[Waseda University]] of Japan worked on the site, they cleared the enclosure wall and the enclosed precinct from debris and excavated the temple's well which was filled with pottery shreds. Thirty-two strata of fillings were detected in the well, up to the point of 4 meters under ground level, where water made further excavation impossible. Remains found in the well prove that the well (and the temple itself) was already abandoned and used as a trash deposit by the Coptic era.&lt;ref name="waseda"/&gt;

==Decoration==
The reliefs of the temple are dated to the Greek-Roman era and are similar to the ones in [[Dendera]] and [[Philae]]. On the walls of the temple and the pylon the [[cartouche]]s of [[Hadrian]]us, [[Antoninus Pius]], [[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vespasianus]] and [[Caius Iulius Caesar|Julius Caesar]] can be seen.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt; On the reused blocks built into the outer walls of the temple reliefs stylistically dated to the [[New Kingdom]] can be seen.

[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|250px|Hubbard in Los Angeles, 1950]]
[[L. Ron Hubbard]] was the inventor of [[Dianetics]] and founder of [[Scientology]]. Born in [[Tilden, Nebraska]] in March 1911, Hubbard grew up with his family in [[Helena, Montana]]. He was unusually well-traveled for a young man of his time due to his father's frequent relocations in connection with his service in the [[United States Navy]]. He lived in a number of locations in the United States and traveled to Guam, the Philippines, China, and Japan. He enrolled at [[George Washington University]] in 1930 to study civil engineering, but dropped out in his second year. While at GWU, he organized an expedition to the Caribbean for fellow students which looms large in his official biography but was a flop according to contemporary accounts. He subsequently spent time in [[Puerto Rico]] panning for gold, before returning to the United States, marrying his pregnant girlfriend, and embarking on a career as a "penny-a-word" writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first1=Hugh B. |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Scientology]] depicts Hubbard in hagiographic terms and draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy.&lt;ref name=c228&gt;Christensen, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that many aspects of the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Christensen238 /&gt; Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church.&lt;ref name="DRC-232"&gt;Christensen, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and [[Olav Hammer]], in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |last2=Hammer |first2=Olav |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6p9ZVm-poRoC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=scientology#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false |title=The Invention of Sacred Tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-86479-4 |accessdate=2016-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and ancestry ==
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, Timothy L. ''American religious leaders'', p. 175. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a former United States Navy sailor who worked as a newspaper employee at the time of his son's birth, and Ledora May Waterbury, a housewife who had originally trained as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Miller-11"&gt;Miller, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Christensen236&gt;Christensen, pp. 236–7&lt;/ref&gt;  L. Ron was named after his maternal grandfather, Lafayette "Lafe" O. Waterbury.&lt;ref name="Miller-18" /&gt;  After moving to [[Kalispell, Montana]], the family settled in 1913 in the state capital, Helena.&lt;ref name=Christensen236 /&gt; Hubbard's father worked as a manager and bookkeeper, first for a local theater&lt;ref name="Miller-15"&gt;Miller, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and later for a coal company owned by his father-in-law.&lt;ref name="Miller-18"&gt;Miller, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The elder Hubbard re-enlisted in the Navy when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, while his mother Ledora May worked as a clerk for the state government.&lt;ref name="Miller-19"&gt;Miller, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Scientology biographies present a fictitious family heritage for Hubbard. According to an account published in the Church of Scientology's ''Ability'' magazine in 1959, Hubbard was "descended from Count de Loup who entered England with the Norman invasion and became the founder of the English de Wolfe family which emigrated to America in the 17th century. On his father's side, from the English Hubbards, who came to America in the 19th century."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; The story went that Count de Loup (or de Loupe) was a French courtier who saved the King of France from an attack by a wolf; the grateful monarch bestowed the title of Count de Loupe, which was eventually anglicized to "De Wolf", the name of Hubbard's maternal grandfather. No records exist to substantiate this story.&lt;ref name="Miller-8"&gt;Miller, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Ross Hubbard was an orphan, born Henry August Wilson in August 1886, who had been adopted by an Iowa farming couple by the name of Hubbard. The couple changed his given names to Harry Ross.&lt;ref name="Miller-11" /&gt;

A biographical profile published by the Church of Scientology in 1973 states that the young Hubbard "spent many of his childhood years on a large cattle ranch in Montana" that was owned by his wealthy grandfather, Lafe Waterbury.&lt;ref&gt;"About The Author", in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life|Have you lived before this life?: A scientific survey : a study of death and evidence of past lives]]'', p. 297. Church of Scientology Publications Organization, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-88484-055-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Church accounts, Hubbard passed long days on the ranch "riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer."&lt;ref name="SW-Creating" /&gt; Another Church biography describes his grandfather as a "wealthy Western cattleman" from whom Hubbard "inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc."&lt;ref name=r17&gt;Rolph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary records and Hubbard's relatives contradict this depiction. Hubbard's grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, briefly owned a plot of land covering 320&amp;nbsp;acres (0.5&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) near Kalispell, where he pastured horses and worked as a [[veterinarian]]. A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury's assets as a relatively modest $1,550.&lt;ref name="Atack-48"&gt;Atack, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubbards and Waterburys lived in a pair of townhouses, not a ranch, in the center of Helena, only two blocks from each other and not far from the [[Montana State Capitol]].&lt;ref name="Miller-17"&gt;Miller, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; They also owned a small plot outside the city. Hubbard's aunt told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1990 that the family did not have a ranch, "just several acres (with) a barn on it.&amp;nbsp;... We had one cow (and) four or five horses."&lt;ref name="SW-Creating"&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). "[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-24/news/mn-1012_1_l-ron-hubbard The Making of L. Ron Hubbard: Creating the Mystique]". ''Los Angeles Times'', p. A38:1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood ==

=== Growing up ===
Biographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology depict Hubbard as a [[child prodigy]].&lt;ref name="Tucker-300" /&gt; He is portrayed as riding a horse before he was able to walk and able to read and write by the time he was four.&lt;ref name="Tucker-300"&gt;Tucker, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Scientology account, the young Hubbard lived in the rugged West, "[r]iding horses at the age of three and a half" and facing dangers such as "escaping a pack of coyotes astride his mare named Nancy Hanks."&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; He was said to have "considered until he was 10 years old that the handling of a rifle or hunting coyotes or trying to break broncos was more useful than school knowledge", and "[a]ttempts to send him to school were seldom availing."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt;

According to the Church publication ''What is Scientology?'', Hubbard was "reading and writing at an early age, and soon satisfying his insatiable curiosity with the works of Shakespeare, the Greek philosophers, and other classics." His mother Ledora is described as "a rarity in her time. A thoroughly educated woman, who had attended teacher's college prior to her marriage to Ron's father, she was aptly suited to tutor her young son."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part01/Chp03/pg0086.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– The Founder of Scientology]." Church of Scientology International, 1992. Accessed March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Christensen comments that this presentation of the exceptional qualities of his mother is typical of [[hagiographies]]&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Virgin Mary]]&amp;nbsp;– and forms a kind of after-the-event rationalization, in which qualities assigned to the subject are also attributed to the subject's mother. Presenting Ledora as "aptly suited" to educate her son suggests that she was, in effect, chosen to be his mother; she is not presented as responsible for stimulating her son's interest in the classics but was there simply to assist his development.&lt;ref name=Christensen236 /&gt; (Indeed, as Christiansen notes, his parents do not have important roles in his official biography and are only significantly mentioned at the beginning of the story, where their respective professions are emphasized.)&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's official biographers also state that, during his childhood in Montana, he was befriended by "Old Tom", a [[medicine man]] from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Blackfeet]] tribe. He is also purported to have become, at six years old, "one of the few whites ever admitted into Blackfoot society as a bona fide [[blood brother]]".&lt;ref name=Christensen236 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Secret"&gt;"L. Ron Hubbard and American Pulp Fiction", in Hubbard, L. Ron: "The Great Secret", p. 107–8. Galaxy Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-59212-371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been disputed by his unofficial biographers. [[Jon Atack]] notes that the Blackfoot reservation was over a hundred miles away from Helena.&lt;ref name="Atack-48" /&gt; A ''Los Angeles Times'' investigation in 1990 reported that "Old Tom" was not listed in a 1907 register of the Blackfeet and that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood. Although the Church of Scientology states that Hubbard was awarded blood brotherhood "in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders",&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/ L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle March 13, 1911–1921]". Church of Scientology International, 2007. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; a Scientologist of fractional Blackfoot ancestry sought during the mid-1980s to prove that Hubbard had been a Blackfoot blood brother but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="SW-Staking"&gt;Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990). "The Making of L. Ron Hubbard: Staking a Claim to Blood Brotherhood". ''Los Angeles Times'', p. A38:5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boy Scouts and "Snake" Thompson ===
[[File:Queen Anne High School 1909 or 1910.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Exterior view of a large building|[[Queen Anne High School (Seattle, Washington)|Queen Anne High School]], Seattle, which L Ron Hubbard attended in 1926–27]]
During the 1920s, the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas. Harry Hubbard rejoined the Navy as an enlisted man but was promoted to [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in October 1918&lt;ref name="Miller-20"&gt;Miller, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant]] in November 1919.&lt;ref name="Miller-21"&gt;Miller, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His posting aboard the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']] in 1921 required his wife and son to relocate to the ship's home ports, first [[San Diego]], then [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Miller-23"&gt;Miller, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard joined the local [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and later said that when he was 13, he became the "youngest Eagle Scout in the country". The Boy Scouts of America has said that, at the time, it did not keep a record of the ages of its Eagle Scouts, only an alphabetical list of those who had received the award. Journalist Michael Streeter comments that, in light of this, "it remains unclear just how Hubbard would have known he was its youngest member."&lt;ref name="Streeter-205"&gt;Streeter, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scientology biography states that Hubbard's achievement of Eagle Scout status was "an early indication that he did not plan to live an ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lron.hubbard.org/pg002.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Shaping the 21st century with solutions for a better world&amp;nbsp;– The early years 1911–1923] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624014725/http://lron.hubbard.org/pg002.html |date=2004-06-24 }}" Church of Scientology International, 2005. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Christiansen notes that this passage implies that Hubbard consciously "planned" to live an extraordinary life, strengthening the underlying idea that from early childhood he worked towards the goals that led to Scientology.&lt;ref name="DRC-237"&gt;Christensen, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] in a ceremony that the Church of Scientology describes as Hubbard having "represented American Scouting at the White House", by which time "the thirteen-year-old L. Ron Hubbard had become a reasonably famous figure in fairly adventurous circles."&lt;ref name="Adventurer-06"&gt;"[http://adventurer.lronhubbard.org/page06.htm L. Ron Hubbard Adventurer/Explorer&amp;nbsp;– Daring Deeds &amp; Unknown Realms]". Church of Scientology International, 2004. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Atack describes the event more prosaically as a meet-and-greet in which Hubbard was one of forty boys who spoke their names to the President and shook his hand.&lt;ref name="Atack-50"&gt;Atack, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Another Scientology biography says that Hubbard became "the fast friend of the President's son, Calvin Coolidge, Jr., whose untimely death is probably responsible for L. Ron Hubbard's early interest in healing research."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; Atack deems this fictitious, as Calvin Coolidge, Jr. and Hubbard never crossed paths.&lt;ref name="Atack-50" /&gt;

The Hubbards traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1923 aboard the [[USS U. S. Grant (AP-29)|USS ''U.S. Grant'']], traveling from Seattle to [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], via the [[Panama Canal]]. During this trip, Hubbard reportedly received an education in [[Freudian psychology]] from Commander Joseph "Snake" Thompson, a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and student of [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="Miller-23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitehead-46"&gt;Whitehead, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Church of Scientology, Thompson "took it upon himself to pass on the essentials of Freudian theory to his young friend." Hubbard later said that through Thompson's friendship, "I attended many lectures given at naval hospitals and generally became conversant with psychoanalysis as it had been exported from Austria by Freud."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lron.hubbard.org/pg003.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Shaping the 21st century with solutions for a better world&amp;nbsp;– On the road to discovery 1923–1929] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501184919/http://lron.hubbard.org/pg003.html |date=2011-05-01 }}" Church of Scientology International, 2005. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Another Scientology text states that Thompson spent "many an afternoon in the Library of Congress teaching L. Ron Hubbard what he [knew] of the human mind."&lt;ref name="Chronicle1922"&gt;"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page01.htm L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle 1922–1923]". Church of Scientology International, 2007. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no independent confirmation of Hubbard's claims, though Thompson's existence has been proven.&lt;ref name="Atack-50" /&gt; This encounter is used in Scientology's biographies as evidence that Hubbard was trained in a scientific approach to the mind, but found it unsatisfying. Christiansen notes that Dianetics was "very much inspired by Freudian theory". Hubbard's invocation of Thompson therefore serves to highlight his claimed knowledge of Freud's ideas, but also his exceptional maturity; as the official account has it, "Ron was also left with many unanswered questions" which prompted him to undertake further enquiries. This, in Christiansen's view, has strong parallels with the story of the child Jesus: "in particular, the emphasis on the clever child having different skills and qualities from those of boys of the same age", as displayed in incidents such as the twelve-year-old Jesus lecturing the scribes in the Temple of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Christensen238&gt;Christensen, p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Harry Ross Hubbard was posted to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] at [[Bremerton, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Miller-27"&gt;Miller, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His son was enrolled at Union High School, Bremerton&lt;ref name="Miller-27" /&gt; and later studied at [[Queen Anne High School (Seattle, Washington)|Queen Anne High School]] in Seattle.&lt;ref name="Miller-28"&gt;Miller, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Hubbard's father was sent to the U.S. Naval Station in Guam. Although Hubbard's mother also went to Guam, Hubbard himself did not accompany them but was placed in his grandparents' care in Helena, Montana, to complete his schooling.&lt;ref name="Miller-28" /&gt;

== Travels in the Far East and Pacific ==

=== First trip to Asia ===
[[File:USS Gold Star (AG-12).jpg|right|thumb|alt=Side view of a ship upon water, with mountains visible in the background|The [[USS Gold Star (AK-12)|USS ''Gold Star'']], aboard which L. Ron Hubbard traveled to China in 1928]]
Between 1927 and 1929, Hubbard traveled to [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Philippines]], and Guam. ''What is Scientology'' and other Scientology texts present this era as a time when he sought, and was freely offered, ancient Eastern wisdom but found it lacking, as he had earlier with Western science.&lt;ref name=Christensen239&gt;Christensen, pp. 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; A biographical account in Hubbard's 1982 novel ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'' says that, "he worked... aboard a coastal trader which plied the seas between Japan and Java. He came to know old Shanghai, Beijing and the Western Hills at a time when few Westerners could enter China."&lt;ref name="Battlefield"&gt;"About the Author", in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Battlefield Earth''. (No page number given.) Galaxy Press, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-59212-007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have spent weeks questioning Buddhist [[lama]]s and watching them meditate. He also recounted meeting Old Mayo, supposedly the last Chinese magician in a line that stretched back to the Court of [[Kublai Khan]].&lt;ref name=Christensen239 /&gt; According to the Church of Scientology, these travels were funded by his "wealthy grandfather".&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix" in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Hymn of Asia''. (No page number given.) Church of Scientology of California, Publications Organization, 1974. {{ISBN|0-88404-035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard is described not as a tourist but as a gifted student, intensely curious for answers to human suffering and warmly received everywhere because he was perceived as special.&lt;ref name=Christensen239 /&gt; He is purported to have faced many dangers in the company of "Major Ian Macbean of the British Secret Service", including an "encounter with Cantonese pirates, the engineering of a jungle road across Guam's denser corner, and the evening he decked an Italian swordsman named Giovinni. (Although not before he took a saber cut across the left cheek, and Macbean nearly lost a hand)."&lt;ref name="Adventurer-06" /&gt;

Hubbard's unofficial biographers present a very different account of his Asian travels, drawing on his school records, his contemporary diaries, and his father's service record. Hubbard recorded two trips to the east coast of China in his diaries. The first was made in the company of his mother while traveling from the United States to Guam in 1927. It consisted of a brief stop-over in two Chinese ports before the pair transferred to a U.S. Navy transport, the [[USS Gold Star (AK-12)|USS ''Gold Star'']], for the journey to Guam. Hubbard spent about six weeks on the island before returning to the United States aboard the [[USS Nitro (AE-2)|USS ''Nitro'']]. He used his diary to record his impressions of the places he visited, noting his unfavorable impression of the poverty and the appearance of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as "gooks", "lazy", and "ignorant".&lt;ref name="Atack-54" /&gt; His second visit was a family holiday that took Hubbard and his parents to China via the Philippines in 1928.&lt;ref name="Atack-54"&gt;Atack, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-31"&gt;Miller, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether he ever traveled to western China, Tibet, or India; Atack comments that Hubbard's only corroborated visit to India appears to have been a flight change at [[Calcutta]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Atack-57"&gt;Atack, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to the United States in September 1927, Hubbard enrolled at [[Helena High School]], but earned poor grades.&lt;ref name="Miller-34"&gt;Miller, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned school the following May and went back west to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle. In June, he traveled to Guam on a U.S. Navy transport, the [[USS Henderson (AP-1)|USS ''Henderson'']], to reunite with his parents. His mother took over his education in the hope of putting him forward for the entrance examination to the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Miller-41" /&gt;

=== Second trip to Asia ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-031735, Tsingtau, Teilansicht.jpg|right|thumb|alt=View of a coastal city from a high-altitude point at sea|Aerial view of [[Qingdao, China]], taken in 1930, two years after Hubbard's visit]]
A number of naval families, including Hubbard's, traveled from Guam to China aboard the ''USS Gold Star'' between October and December 1928. The ship visited Manila in the Philippines and traveled on to [[Qingdao]] (Tsingtao), from where Hubbard and his parents traveled inland to [[Beijing]], before returning to the ship for transport to [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]] and finally back to Guam.&lt;ref name="Miller-41"&gt;Miller, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology presents a completely different version of this family holiday, stating that Hubbard "made his way deep into Manchuria's Western Hills and beyond&amp;nbsp;– to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of Kublai Khan."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/early-years/asia-and-the-south-pacific.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile: Asia and the South Pacific]". Church of Scientology International, 2010. Accessed February 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Atack, these occurrences are not mentioned in the diary that Hubbard kept of his trip.&lt;ref name="Atack-57" /&gt; Many years later, Hubbard said that "I was a harum-scarum kid; I wasn't thinking about deep philosophic problems."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Further Introduction to Dianetics", lecture of September 23, 1950. Quoted in Atack, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

As on his previous trip, Hubbard recorded his impressions in his diary. He remained unimpressed with China. After seeing Qingdao he wrote: "A Chinaman can not live up to a thing, he always drags it down." He characterized the sights of Beijing as "rubberneck stations" for tourists and described the palaces of the [[Forbidden City]] as "very trashy-looking" and "not worth mentioning". He visited a section of the [[Great Wall of China]] near Beijing, which did impress him,&lt;ref name="Miller-42"&gt;Miller, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; but his overall conclusion of the Chinese was very negative: "They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here."&lt;ref name="Miller-43"&gt;Miller, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Back on Guam, Hubbard spent much of his time writing dozens of short stories and essays.&lt;ref name="Miller-44"&gt;Miller, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have "befriend[ed] the local [[Chamorros]] and [taught] in the native schools",&lt;ref name="Chronicle1922" /&gt; exploring "cliff-side caves to disabuse local villagers of a devil named Tadamona".&lt;ref name="Early Years"&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/early-years/asia-and-the-south-pacific.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Asia and the South Pacific]". Church of Scientology International, 2010. Accessed March 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his mother's assistance with his education, he failed the Naval Academy entrance examination. His father's next posting took the family to Washington, D.C., where Hubbard was sent to study at the Swavely Preparatory School in [[Manassas, Virginia]] within the D.C. metropolitan area. The Hubbards returned to Helena, Montana for a short visit to Hubbard's grandparents in August 1929 before he enrolled at Swavely the following month.&lt;ref name="Miller-45"&gt;Miller, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard proved unable to enter the Naval Academy because he was found to be too near-sighted to meet the physical admission criteria.&lt;ref name="Miller-46"&gt;Miller, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1940s, Hubbard wrote a series of private [[Affirmations (L. Ron Hubbard)|Affirmations]] in which he tells himself "your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASzmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76 | title=Going Clear| last1=Wright| first1=Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1930 he enrolled at Woodward School for Boys in Washington, D.C. as a means of earning credits for admission to [[George Washington University]], thereby avoiding the university's entrance examination, and successfully graduated in June. The following September, he entered George Washington University as a freshman.&lt;ref name="Miller-47"&gt;Miller, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Woodward, the 19-year-old Hubbard enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|Private]] in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]], stating his age as 21 and listing his profession as "photographer".&lt;ref name="Miller-46" /&gt; He was promoted to [[First Sergeant]] only six weeks later, a development that Atack attributes to the fact that the unit he joined&amp;nbsp;– the 20th Marine Corps Reserve&amp;nbsp;– was actually a training unit connected with George Washington University. His character was rated "excellent" but on October 22, 1931 he was discharged with the notation, "Not to be re-enlisted."&lt;ref name="Atack-58"&gt;Atack, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his limited experience of the Marine Corps, he told readers of ''Adventure'' magazine in October 1935 that "I've known the Corps from Quantico to Peiping, from the South Pacific to the West Indies."&lt;ref name="Adventure"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (October 1, 1935). "A candid interview with L. Ron Hubbard about his time in the USMC". ''Adventure''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-69"&gt;Miller, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard's two-year career at George Washington University looms large in his own accounts and the biographies published by the Church of Scientology.  George Malko comments in ''[[Scientology: The Now Religion]]'',

{{quote|Hubbard's career at George Washington University is important because many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a graduate engineer, but "a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics."&lt;ref name="Malko-31"&gt;Malko, George.

Official biographical accounts of his life state that his "study of engineering, mathematics and nuclear physics laid the foundation for his later philosophical research."&lt;ref name="Founder"&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/founder.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Founder]". Church of Scientology International, 2010.

Ron: ''Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought'', p. vii. Los Angeles: Bridge Publications, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4031-4420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one Scientology account,

{{quote|[Hubbard] studied mathematics, engineering and attended the first American class on atomic and molecular phenomena.

Ron Hubbard?]". Church of Scientology International, 2011. Accessed March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard's education in "atomic and molecular phenomena" is highlighted in many Scientology biographies. According to one, he was "a member of the first U.S. course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; A 1961 publication calls him "L. Ron Hubbard, C.E., Ph.D., a nuclear physicist&amp;nbsp;... educated in advanced physics and higher mathematics and also a student of Sigmund Freud and others, [who] began his present researches thirty years ago at George Washington University."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "PE Handout", HCO Information Letter of April 14, 1961. Reprinted in the ''Organization Executive Course'' volume 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, another Scientology publication described him as "Doctor Hubbard, American nuclear physicist and leading world authority on the subject of life sources and mental energies and structures."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "What is Scientology", HCO Bulletin of June 23, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Scientologists in later years that "Nearly all nuclear physicists&amp;nbsp;– atomic and molecular phenomena boys&amp;nbsp;– 'Buck Rogers Boys', we were known as&amp;nbsp;... Like so many physicists I wrote science fiction for years, and that was the only remunerative use I made of this material."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Radiation and the Scientologist", lecture of April 13, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

One account published by the Church of Scientology says that Hubbard theorized that "the world of subatomic particles might possibly provide a clue to the human thought process" and he was "concerned for the safety of the world, recognising that if man were to handle the atom sanely for the greatest benefit, he would first have to learn to handle himself." He enrolled on a nuclear physics course "to synthesise and test all knowledge for what was observable, workable and could truly help solve man's problems."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lron.hubbard.org/pg005.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Shaping the 21st century with solutions for a better world&amp;nbsp;– Exploring the riddles of existence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316020911/http://lron.hubbard.org/pg005.html |date=2011-03-16 }}". Church of Scientology International, 2005. Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Another profile calls him "a product of the atomic age" and describes how his classmates dreamed of unlocking the energy of the atom, while Hubbard himself sought to "discover the basic equations of life force, simply, to him, another kind of energy."&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Dianetics", in Hubbard, L. Ron: ''Child Dianetics'', p. 175. The Publications Organization World Wide, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard stated that he "set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in Asian philosophy."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt;

Other Scientology accounts present a different perspective. A 1959 biography describes Hubbard as "never noted for being in class" and says that he "thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects."&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; He attributed his choice of course to his father, having "decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics and so I found myself obediently studying."&lt;ref name="Atack-59"&gt;Atack, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1953 lecture, he said that he was "forced into engineering, mathematics, majoring in nuclear physics&amp;nbsp;– very antipathetic to me, but there was order and there was discipline&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Mechanics of the Mind", lecture of January 10, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Christiansen comments that the claims made about Hubbard's expertise and scientific knowledge are crucial to Scientology's own self-image and legitimation. Hubbard is presented as "a man with an impressive amount of various theoretical as well as practical personal competences and educational qualifications." Scientology traces its own origins to Hubbard's "scientific" methodology, which he is said to have learned while at university. Although Scientology positions itself as a religious belief, it nonetheless claims to be a true science, a "technology" capable of achieving precise and replicable results.&lt;ref name="DRC-242"&gt;Christensen, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic record and extracurricular activities ===
Hubbard's academic record, which came to light in the 1970s, revealed that he had been a student in George Washington University's School of Engineering and had majored in [[civil engineering]]. He attended the summer semester in 1931 and the fall and spring semesters in 1931–32. In September 1931, he was placed on probation and he failed to return for the fall 1932 semester.&lt;ref name="Wallis-21"&gt;Wallis, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; A Scientology account says that he "excell[ed] in but thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects";&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; while the latter may have been true, the former certainly was not, as his grades were consistently poor. At the end of his first year, he received a D average grade, earning an A for physical education, B for English, C for mechanical engineering, D for general chemistry and Fs for German and calculus.&lt;ref name="Miller-49"&gt;Miller, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; During his second year, he enrolled in a class on atomic and molecular physics&amp;nbsp;– the "nuclear physics" course cited in his official biographies&amp;nbsp;– but earned an F grade. His other grades were also poor, ranging from a B for English to D in calculus and electrical and magnetic physics.&lt;ref name="Miller-57"&gt;Miller, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out soon afterwards. Although Hubbard told [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]] in 1950 that "I never took my degree,"&lt;ref name="Maisel"&gt;Maisel, Albert (December 5, 1950). "Dianetics&amp;nbsp;– Science or Hoax?" ''Look'' magazine, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; a biography published a few years later by the Church of Scientology's ''Ability'' magazine nonetheless identifies him as the holder of a "B. S. in Civil Engineering".&lt;ref name="Brief Biography"&gt;"A Brief Biography of L. Ron Hubbard", ''Ability'', Church of Scientology Washington, D.C. Issue 111, January 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard was far more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and participating in the university flying club. He wrote for the George Washington University student newspaper, ''[[The GW Hatchet|The University Hatchet]]'', as a reporter for a few months in 1931.&lt;ref name="Miller-47" /&gt; According to official biographies, "he earned his wings as a pioneering barnstormer at the dawn of American aviation" and became "a roving reporter for ''Sportsman Pilot''" who "helped inspire a generation of pilots who would take America to world airpower."&lt;ref name="Great Secret" /&gt; One account published by the Church of Scientology states that he was "recognized as one of the country's most outstanding pilots. With virtually no training time, he takes up powered flight and barnstorms throughout the Midwest."&lt;ref name="Chronicle1930-1940"&gt;[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page02.htm L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– A Chronicle&amp;nbsp;– 1930–1940]". Church of Scientology International, 2007. Accessed February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His pilot's license, however, records that he only qualified to fly gliders rather than powered aircraft.&lt;ref name="Atack-64"&gt;Atack, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard left the university after two years and married in 1933. He began writing for the popular pulp magazines at that time. His first story was "The Green God," which appeared in ''Thrilling Adventures'' in 1934. According to [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]], Associate Professor of Religion at University of Tromso, he was a quick and prolific writer, which fellow authors envied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=James R. |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-971595-4 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2016-03-18 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=May 2017}} According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard's decision to drop out of university was not the result of educational failure on his part, but was instead because he found that "beyond a basic methodology, university offered nothing."&lt;ref name="Founder" /&gt; Hubbard is said to have "decid[ed] that formal study had nothing more to offer".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lron.hubbard.org/pg006.html L.

Church of Scientology International, 2005. Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expeditions ==

=== Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition ===
Hubbard's final semester at George Washington University saw him embark on what the Church of Scientology describes as a career as an "adventurer and explorer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Adventurer and Explorer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311131716/http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations.html |date=2011-03-11 }}. Church of Scientology International, 2010. Accessed February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1932, he announced in ''The University Hatchet'' that he had organized an expedition to the Caribbean for "fifty young gentleman rovers" aboard the schooner ''Doris Hamlin''. The aims of the "Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition" were to explore and film the pirate "strongholds and bivouacs of the [[Spanish Main]]" and to "collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums".&lt;ref name="Miller=52"&gt;Miller, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition did not go according to plan after its departure from [[Baltimore]] on June 23, 1932. Ten of the "gentleman rovers" pulled out before the start and the ship was blown far off course by storms, making an unplanned first landfall at [[Bermuda]]. Eleven more members of the expedition quit while there, before the ship sailed on to its intended first port of call, Martinique.&lt;ref name="Miller=54"&gt;Miller, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; ''En route'', it was discovered that the ship's fresh water had all leaked away. More expedition members abandoned ship on arrival. As the expedition was critically short of money, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore,&lt;ref name="Miller=55"&gt;Miller, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; bringing to an end what the captain described as "the worst trip I ever made".&lt;ref name="Miller=54" /&gt; Hubbard nonetheless presented the expedition as a success and blamed the captain for its travails: "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts."&lt;ref name="CMPE"&gt;[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/carribean-motion-picture-expedition.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition]". Church of Scientology International, 2010. Accessed February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology states that a "National Museum" (it does not specify which one) acquired specimens collected by the expedition and the ''[[New York Times]]'' purchased some of its photographs.&lt;ref name="CMPE" /&gt; Hubbard's book ''Mission into Time'' states that the expedition's underwater films and specimens "provided the Hydrographic Office and the University of Michigan with invaluable data for the furtherance of their research."&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. ''Mission into Time'', p. 7. AOSH DK Publications Department A/S, 1973. {{ISBN|87-87347-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hubbard's unofficial biographer [[Russell Miller]] reports that the ''New York Times'' "hold[s] no photographs from the expedition, [has] no evidence that it was ever intended to buy such photographs, nor indeed any indication that the newspaper was even aware of the expedition's existence," and that neither the U.S. Hydrographic Office nor the University of Michigan has any record of films or specimens from the expedition.&lt;ref name="Miller=56"&gt;Miller, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church of Scientology, "even some fifty years later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage as the one grand adventure in the twilight of their youth."&lt;ref name="CMPE" /&gt; Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition "was a crazy idea at best, and I knew it, but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet."&lt;ref name="Adventure2"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron, "The Camp-Fire", ''Adventure'' magazine, vol. 93 no. 5, October 1, 1935. Quoted in Atack, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''Look'' magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition "was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933."&lt;ref name="Maisel" /&gt; The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.&lt;ref name="Atack-63"&gt;Atack, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition ===
[[File:Luquillo, Puerto Rico.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Aerial view of a coastal city from inland|[[Luquillo, Puerto Rico]], near where Hubbard is said to have carried out the "West Indies Mineralogical Survey" in 1932]]
After leaving university, Hubbard is said to have carried out a further expedition to Puerto Rico. It is described by a 1959 biography as having been undertaken to "blow off steam by leading an expedition into Central America {{sic}}".&lt;ref name="Brief Biography" /&gt; An account published in ''Mission into Time'' states "Conducting the West Indies Minerals Survey, he made the first complete mineralogical survey of Puerto Rico. This was pioneer exploration in the great tradition, opening up a predictable, accurate body of data for the benefit of others. Later, in other, less materialistic fields, this was to be his way many, many times over."&lt;ref name="Mission" /&gt; The Church of Scientology claims that Hubbard's father "had long dreamed of augmenting his Lieutenant's pay with a mining venture and a bit of investment capital from like-minded officers" and dispatched Hubbard to the Puerto Rican hinterland where he "sluiced inland rivers and crisscrossed the island in search of elusive gold." While there, Hubbard "conducted much ethnological work amongst the interior villages and native hillsmen".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/puerto-rican-mineralogical-expedition.html L. Ron Hubbard Biographical Profile&amp;nbsp;– Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition]". Church of Scientology, 2010. Accessed February 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition's existence has been questioned by Hubbard's unofficial biographers. Miller states that neither the [[United States Geological Survey]] nor the [[Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources|Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources]] have records of any such expedition.&lt;ref name="Miller=56" /&gt; Hubbard stayed on Puerto Rico from November 1932 to mid-February 1933. According to Miller, Hubbard went there for an entirely different purpose. Harry Ross Hubbard sent a letter to the [[Navy Department]] on October 13, 1932, in which he requested a passage for his son to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] to "place his services at the disposal of the American Red Cross in their relief work on that island."&lt;ref name="Miller=56" /&gt; Three weeks earlier, Puerto Rico had been hit by the [[1932 San Ciprian hurricane]] and suffered catastrophic damage. The storm killed 225 people, injured 3,000 more, and left over 100,000 people homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Maldonado, A. W. ''Luis Muñoz Marín: Puerto Rico's democratic revolution'', p. 99. Editorial Universidad de Puerto Rico, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8477-0158-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard traveled to the island aboard the [[USS Kittery (AK-2)|USS ''Kittery'']], arriving on November 4.&lt;ref name="Miller-57" /&gt; It is unclear whether he contributed to the Red Cross relief effort, though in a 1957 lecture he said that he had been "a field executive with the American Red Cross in the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Creating a Third Dynamic / United Survival Action Clubs", lecture of December 30, 1957. Ability Congress, 5th lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point during his short stay on the island, he appears to have done some work for a Washington D.C. firm called West Indies Minerals Incorporated. A letter dated February 16, 1933 describes Hubbard as the company's "field representative" who accompanied the letter's author on a survey of a small property near the town of [[Luquillo, Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Atack-63" /&gt; According to his own account, Hubbard spent much of his time prospecting unsuccessfully for gold. A photograph published in Hubbard's book ''Mission into Time'' shows him using a gold pan alongside the caption "Sluicing with crews on Corozal River '32"&lt;ref name="Atack-63" /&gt; and an article in the August 18, 1933 ''Washington Daily News'' describes Hubbard as having "left here last year for Antilles, West Indies, in search of gold so that he might return and marry the girl he met shortly before his departure".&lt;ref name="Miller-61"&gt;Miller, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Hubbard wrote in ''Adventure'' magazine,

{{quote|Harboring the thought that the Conquistadores might have left some gold behind, I determined to find it&amp;nbsp;... Gold prospecting in the wake of the Conquistadores, on the hunting grounds of the pirates in the islands which still reek of Columbus is romantic, and I do not begrudge the sweat which splashed in muddy rivers, and the bits of khaki which have probably blown away from the thorn bushes long ago&amp;nbsp;...

After a half year or more of intensive search, after wearing my palms thin wielding a sample pack, after assaying a few hundred sacks of ore, I came back, a failure.&lt;ref name="Adventure2" /&gt;}}

He married the girl in question, [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]], on April 13, 1933. Chronically short of money, he turned to full-time fiction writing to support himself and his new wife;&lt;ref name="Miller-62"&gt;Miller, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; six of his pieces were published commercially during 1932 to 1933&lt;ref name="Atack-64" /&gt; as he embarked on a literary career that made him a somewhat well-known figure in the world of pulp magazine fiction.

== Significance for Scientology ==

Hubbard's early life is accorded great significance by the Church of Scientology, which draws on his legacy as its ultimate source of doctrine and legitimacy.&lt;ref name=c228 /&gt; Dorthe Refslund Christensen comments:

{{quote|[The Church's] account primarily wants to communicate that L. Ron Hubbard led an unusual life since his childhood; that he worked for humanity throughout his life; and that Dianetics and Scientology are based on the unique knowledge and wisdom of this person who has dedicated his entire life to the communication of this knowledge to his fellow man.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Hubbard portrayed himself as a pioneering explorer, world traveler and nuclear physicist. By contrast, his critics have characterized him as a liar, charlatan, and madman.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; Many of his autobiographical statements have been proven to be fictitious.&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;Urban, Hugh B. "Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America." ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' '''74''':2 (2006) 356–89&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's portrayal of Hubbard's life displays many standard features of hagiography, such as the emphasis on the continuity of the subject's life. Events are woven together in a seamless tapestry that culminates in the subject's achievement of his spiritual goals. They are presented as part of a "master plan" that gives meaning to the subject's life in the context of a belief system. By doing this, the belief system is legitimized and given an aspect of genuineness through stressing its originator's personal qualities.&lt;ref name="DRC-234"&gt;Christensen, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard is therefore portrayed, as he put it himself, as a man who "knew exactly where I was going" from the age of three.&lt;ref name="Early Years" /&gt; He is presented as a person who constantly worked towards a single objective. Each event in his life is seen as a stepping stone along the way to the development of Dianetics and Scientology. He is cast as a singular and forward-thinking individual whose unique qualities and knowledge are essential prerequisites for his discoveries.&lt;ref name="DRC-234" /&gt; As the Church puts it, "even in his early youth he exemplified a rare sense of purpose and dedication which, combined with his adventurous spirit, made him a living legend."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lron.hubbard.org/pg001.html L. Ron Hubbard&amp;nbsp;– Shaping the 21st century with solutions for a better world&amp;nbsp;– Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416050959/http://lron.hubbard.org/pg001.html |date=2011-04-16 }}" Church of Scientology International, 2005. Accessed March 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Hubbard's early life, as told by the Church, is closely related to Scientology's own self-image as a synthesis of Western scientific precision with Eastern philosophy. His claimed knowledge of these fields and practices underlines his claim to have founded a religion that combines the best of both to appeal to all people.&lt;ref name="DRC-234" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3450">An '''electronic daily devotional''' is inspirational Christian, Bible-based material that can be delivered through a variety of channels. Unlike Bible software that is designed for in-depth Bible study, [[daily devotional]]s in electronic form are designed to focus the mind on one or two thoughts.

== History ==
Devotional classics such as [[Oswald Chambers]]' ''[[My Utmost for His Highest]]'' went electronic as a part of Bible software book collections when Bible software emerged in the 1980s in response to the capabilities of personal computers. These early versions were awkward to scroll through. The emergence of the internet in the 1990s prompted an explosion of online daily devotional offerings. With the advent of cell phones, iPods and smart phones, mobile delivery of daily devotionals has changed even more.

== Software-based devotionals ==
The same electronic publishers that brought Bible software to desktop users—[[e-Sword]], [[LOGOS]], [[Pradis]], PC Study Bible, [[Online Bible]], and [[QuickVerse]], among others, also include devotional classics in electronic media. These devotional materials are tied to the user's computer.

== Online devotionals ==
''Our Daily Bread'' was among the earliest of the classic devotionals to appear on the Internet. Online archives of the devotional are available back to January 1994.   Upper Room Ministries began emailing the ''Upper Room'' daily devotional guide in 1997.   In the years following, many Christian organizations began adding a daily devotional to their website. The following is an incomplete list of daily devotional services available through recognized Christian organizations.

== Mobile devotionals ==
Many of the web-based devotional providers offer mobile delivery of their electronic devotionals. The most popular method of delivery remains email which is accessible through internet capable mobile phones as well as computers. Some organizations offer RSS feeds. All of these mobile options require connection to the internet.

A number of devotional providers also offer a daily devotional in text-message format appropriate for any cell phone with text capability. Internet service is not required. Many providers offer this service for free while some charge a monthly fee. Of the fee-based service providers, a small number, such as The Bible Now, use the monthly fee to support other faith-based initiatives, including Christian adoption (such as the Aspen Project) and short-term missions to Mexico (Casa por Cristo).

{{Politics of Pakistan}}
'''Freedom of religion in Pakistan''' is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] for individuals of various religions and religious sects.

Pakistan gained independence in 1947 and was founded upon the concept of [[Two-nation theory]]. At the time of Pakistan's creation the 'hostage theory' had been espoused. According to this theory the Hindu minority in Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5c9ta97GeoC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=hostage+theory+partition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c-9vZX0r3P&amp;sig=auNLJqHQWUqTL6kEEGn883_4CQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLyMOGgcvQAhUL_mMKHcI8BzYQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=hostage%20theory%20partition&amp;f=false|title=The Long Partition and the Making of Modern South Asia: Refugees, Boundaries, Histories|last=Zamindar|first=Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780231138475|location=|pages=72|quote=The logic of the ''hostage theory'' tied the treatment of Muslim minorities in India to the treatment meted out to Hindus in Pakistan.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrqLBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=In+this+regard,+it+repeatedly+stressed+the+hostage+population+theory+that+held+that+%27hostage%27+Hindu+and+Sikh+minorities+inside+Pakistan+would+guarantee+Hindu+India%27s+good+behaviour+towards+its+own+Muslim+minority.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L3B0Cgt-VK&amp;sig=klC8zzBclekIlvCfcK_2M_6n4NM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjplv_cna_RAhUKopQKHV0SBi8Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20this%20regard%2C%20it%20repeatedly%20stressed%20the%20hostage%20population%20theory%20that%20held%20that%20'hostage'%20Hindu%20and%20Sikh%20minorities%20inside%20Pakistan%20would%20guarantee%20Hindu%20India's%20good%20behaviour%20towards%20its%20own%20Muslim%20minority.&amp;f=false|title=Creating a New Medina: State Power, Islam, and the Quest for Pakistan in Late Colonial North India|last=Dhulipala|first=Venkat|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781316258385|location=|pages=19|quote=Within the subcontinent, ML propaganda claimed that besides liberating the 'majority provinces' Muslims it would guarantee protection for Muslims who would be left behind in Hindu India.

However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted figure and is approximately 2.2% of the country. See:

Progress on religious freedom is being made gradually as Pakistan transitions to democracy from Zia's legacy, in 2016 [[Sindh]] with Pakistan's largest Hindu minority passed a bill that outlawed forced conversions. The bill was tabled by a faction of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] which in Sindh is led by Sufi leader Pir Pagara, called PML-F, Pakistan Muslim League functional.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/1243091/sindh-assembly-passes-bill-forced-religious-conversions/&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan is 96% Muslim, and most provinces are overwhelmingly Muslim, Pakistan's most religiously diverse province is Sindh with an 8% religious minority population (predominantly Hindus and also Christians) and there is significant protection within Sindh province against forced conversions against one's will.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/1256767/curbs-forced-conversion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional position==
The original [[Constitution of Pakistan]] did not discriminate between Muslims and non-Muslims. However, the amendments made during [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s Islamization led to the controversial [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization#Hudood Ordinance|Hudood Ordinance]] and Shariat Court. Later, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]]'s government tried to enforce a Shariat Bill, passed in May 1991. After the incident of [[9/11]], [[Pervez Musharraf]] government took steps to curtail the religious intolerance of non-Muslims.
&lt;!--That seems pretty much like POV original research.--&gt;

==Blasphemy laws==
{{main|Blasphemy law in Pakistan}}
{{see also|Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}
The Pakistani government does not restrict religious publishing. However, it restricts the right to freedom of speech with regard to religion. Speaking in opposition to [[Islam]] and publishing an attack on Islam or its [[prophet]]s are prohibited. Pakistan's penal code mandates the [[death penalty]] or [[life in prison]] for anyone defiling the name of [[Muhammad]]. This penal code mandates life imprisonment for desecrating the [[Quran]], and up to 10 years' imprisonment for insulting another's religious beliefs with intent to outrage religious feelings.

Pakistan's [[blasphemy]] laws are problematic both in their form and their application and have been the source of much debate and harm since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Dayan Hasan, Human Rights Watch, June 2011: https://www.youtube.com/user/cfr#p/u/0/WuFoB59w2kM&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged in some cases that Muslims who have engaged in public debate about their religion have been prosecuted for blasphemy.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar S. Ahmed, '[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36108-2002May17&amp;notFound=true Pakistan's blasphemy laws: words fail me]', ''Washington Post'', 19 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs, [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], was assassinated on 2 March 2011 for his lifelong stand against the laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/shahbaz-bhatti-obituary | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Annabelle | last=Bentham | title=Shahbaz Bhatti obituary | date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Governor of Punjab, [[Salmaan Taseer]], was killed by his own bodyguard on 4 January 2011 for standing up for a blasphemy defendant.

[[Christian]] scriptures and books are available in [[Karachi]] and in travelling bookmobiles. [[Hindu]] and [[Parsi people|Parsi]] scriptures are freely available. Foreign books and magazines may be imported freely, but are subject to censorship for religious content.

==The Ahmadi position==
The Pakistan government does not ban formally the public practice of the [[Ahmadiyya]], but its practice is restricted severely by law. A 1974 constitutional amendment declared Ahmadis to be a non-Muslim minority because, according to the Government, they do not accept Muhammad as the last prophet of Islam. However, Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims and observe Islamic practices. In 1984, under [[Ordinance XX]] the government added Section 298(c) into the Penal Code, prohibiting Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslim or posing as Muslims; from referring to their faith as Islam; from preaching or propagating their faith; from inviting others to accept the Ahmadi faith; and from insulting the religious feelings of Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Trespasses of the State, Ministering to Theological Dilemmas through the Copyright/Trademark, Naveeda Khan, Sarai Reader, 2005; Bare Acts. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt;
. This section of the Penal Code has caused problems for Ahmadis, particularly the provision that forbids them from "directly or indirectly" posing as Muslims. The Ahmadis must not use the standard Muslim greeting form and must not name their children Muhammad. The constitutionality of Section 286(c) was upheld in a split-decision Supreme Court case in 1996. The punishment for violation of this section is imprisonment for up to 3 years and a fine. It has been alleged that this provision has been used extensively by the Government and anti-Ahmadi religious groups to target and harass Ahmadis. Ahmadis also are prohibited from holding any conferences or gatherings.

==Electoral process for non-Muslims==
In 1980s Zia ul-Haq introduced a system under which non-Muslims could vote for only candidates of their own religion. Seats were reserved for minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Government officials stated that the separate electorates system is a form of [[affirmative action]] designed to ensure minority representation, and that efforts are underway to achieve a consensus among religious minorities on this issue. But critics argue that under this system Muslim candidates no longer had any incentive to pay attention to the minorities. Pakistan's separate electoral system for different religions has been described as 'political Apartheid'. Hindu community leader Sudham Chand protested against the system but was murdered. In 1999, Pakistan abolished this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=22 August 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and personal freedom for non-Muslims==
The judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdiction, reflecting differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The federal sharia court and the sharia bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinances, and judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslims. The federal sharia court also may overturn any legislation judged to be inconsistent with the tenets of Islam.

The Hudood Ordinances criminalize non-marital [[rape]], [[extramarital sex]], and various [[gambling]], [[alcohol]], and [[property]] offences. The Hudood Ordinances are applied to Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Some Hudood Ordinance cases are subject to [[Hadd]], or Quranic, punishment; others are subject to [[Tazir]], or secular punishment.

Although both types of cases are tried in ordinary criminal courts, special rules of evidence apply in Hadd cases, which discriminate against non-Muslims. For example, a non-Muslim may testify only if the victim also is non-Muslim. Likewise, the testimony of women, Muslim or non-Muslim, is not admissible in cases involving Hadd punishments. Therefore, if a Muslim man rapes a non-Muslim woman in the presence of women or non-Muslim men, he cannot be convicted under the Hudood Ordinances.

Christian Church leaders argue that the government needs to go beyond the rhetoric of "minorities are enjoying all rights in the country" when they are not, and take practical steps to ensure that this is done.

According to a survey in 2010 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 76% of [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]] polled supported the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for those who [[Apostasy in Islam|leave Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ Muslim Public Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah | Pew Global Attitudes Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual freedom==
The Penal Code incorporates a number of Islamic law provisions. The judicial system encompasses several different court systems with overlapping and sometimes competing jurisdictions that reflect differences in civil, criminal, and Islamic jurisprudence. The Federal Shari'a Court and the Shari'a bench of the Supreme Court serve as appellate courts for certain convictions in criminal court under the Hudood Ordinance, which criminalizes rape, extramarital sex, property crimes, alcohol, and gambling; judges and attorneys in these courts must be Muslim. The Federal Shari'a Court may overturn any legislation judged inconsistent with the tenets of Islam. In March 2005, however, the Supreme Court Chief Justice ruled that the Federal Shari'a Court had no jurisdiction to review a decision by a provincial high court even if the Federal Shari'a Court should have had initial appellate jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=IRF2009&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127370.htm 2009 Report on International Religious Freedom : Pakistan], U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

For both Muslims and non-Muslims, all consensual extramarital sexual relations are considered a violation of the Hudood Ordinances. If a woman cannot prove the absence of consent in a rape case, there is a risk that she may be charged with a violation of the Hudood Ordinances for [[fornication]] or [[adultery]]. The maximum punishment for this offence is public flogging or stoning. However, there are no recorded instances of either type of punishment since the law was introduced.

According to a police official, in a majority of rape cases, the victims are pressured to drop rape charges because of the threat of Hudood adultery charges being brought against them. A parliamentary commission of inquiry for women has criticized the Hudood Ordinances and recommended their repeal. It also has been charged that the laws on adultery and rape have been subject to widespread misuse, and that 95 percent of the women accused of adultery are found innocent in the court of first instance or on appeal. This commission found that the main victims of the Hudood Ordinances are poor women who are unable to defend themselves against slanderous charges. According to the commission, the laws also have been used by husbands and other male family members to punish their wives and female family members for reasons that have nothing to do with perceived sexual impropriety. Approximately one-third or more of the women in jails in [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Mardan]] in 1998 were awaiting trial for adultery under the Hudood Ordinances. 

However, a major amendment was passed to fix and/or get rid of these archaic laws. The [[Women's Protection Bill|Woman's Protection Bill]] passed in 2006. It returned a number of offences from the Zina Ordinance to the [[Pakistan Penal Code]], where they had been before 1979, and created an entirely new set of procedures governing the prosecution of the offences of adultery and fornication, whipping and amputation were removed as punishments.  The law meant women would not be jailed if they were unable to prove rape, and allows rape to be proved on grounds other than witnesses, such as forensics and DNA evidence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=wlulr|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Minorities Concern of Pakistan, forced conversion of Christian and Hindu girls are on the rise in Pakistan. Three international Christian organizations are planning to raise their voice on this issue in the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ministry of Religious Affairs==
The Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is entrusted with safeguarding religious freedom, has on its masthead a Koranic verse: "Islam is the only religion acceptable to God." The Ministry claims that it spends 30 percent of its annual budget to assist indigent minorities, to repair minority places of worship, to set up minority-run small development schemes, and to celebrate minority festivals. However, religious minorities question its expenditures, observing that localities and villages housing minority citizens go without basic civic amenities. The [[National Commission for Justice and Peace]] (NCJP) of the Catholic Bishops' Conference, using official budget figures for expenditures in 1998, calculated that the Government actually spent $17 (PRs850) on each Muslim and only $3.20 (PRs160) on each religious minority citizen per month.
Religious minority interests have also been represented by a [[Ministry of Minorities (Pakistan)|Minorities Ministry]], which has taken various forms and now sits under the Religious Affairs Ministry again, since June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.dawn.com/news/1020392/concern-over-merger-of-ministries - Concern over merger of ministries, Dawn News&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Resolution==
On 23 September 2009, the [[United States House of Representatives]] introduced a "House [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] 764" which calls on Pakistan to restore [[religious freedom]] in the country where [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Hindu]]s, [[Christianity in Pakistan|Christian]]s, [[Persecution of Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya]]s and [[Bahai]]'s (the religions mentioned by name) are subjugated. The resolution was introduced by Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]]. As of December 2016, the resolution failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=hr111-764|title=H.

'''Hidayatullah''' is an [[Islam]]ic mass organization based in [[Indonesia]], founded in 1973. It is aimed at propagation of puritanical interpretation of Islam, and ''[[dawah]]'' (proselytization). The organization operates [[pesantren]] (Islamic seminary), [[mass media]], women’s division, and coop.
==History==
===Origin===
Hidayatullah was founded on 7 January 1973 (2 Dzulhijjah 1392 Hijriah), by [[Ustadz Abdullah Said]] in [[Balikpapan]] as a form of [[pesantren]] (Islamic school, most of whom are boarders). From a pesantren, Hidayatullah was developed further with many activities such as social, mission, education and economy programs and spread to many regions. As of 2003, this institution had networks in 200 cities, in every province in Indonesia. By the first national meeting on July 9–13, 2000 in Balikpapan, Hidayatullah changed its form to a mass organization and declared itself as an [[Islamic Struggle Movement]].

Its mission is to realize society based on Al-Qur'an that free from thoughts, ism and attitude that allying Allah (syirik). The strengthen of sentence of tauhid “Laa ilaaha illallah” on earth · The executing of Syari’ah Islam by whole Muslims · Realization of the strength of Islam people in many life area · The birth of combatant cadre · Increase of standing, degree and prestige of the weak and oppressed onesTake role effectively in doing reform process (tajdid) in philosophy of Islam thought as basic for development of Islam civilization in the future · Prepare concept and strategy of struggle accurately · Prepare and build organizations of dakwah, education, social, politic, youth, female matters, and others that are strong, solid, modern and professional · Labouring and pushing the efforts on enhancing the quality of human resources.

===Belief===
Hidayatullah was born when Muslims were awaiting the coming of a XV Hijriah century, believed to be the era of Islam resurrection. The main theme at that time was “Back to [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]].” Hidayatullah is a thought movement that tries to interpret “Back to Qur’an and Sunnah” more concretely, so, Al-Qur'an and Sunnah became a blueprint for Islam civilization development.

Hidayatullah believes that the setback of Muslems is mostly caused by a partial understanding of the universality of Islam. Each group takes the theme and program focus according to their partial view, and then even theme and program focus become a kind of group ideology. As an Islam mass organization that is based on [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]], Hidayatullah claims themselves to be an Islamic Struggle Movement (Al-Harakah Al-Jihadiyah Al-Islamiyah) with [[dakwah]] (mission) and [[tarbiyah]] (education) as main programs.

==Activity==
===Dakwah===
Hidayatullah main program is dakwah (mission) and tarbiyah (education). Since its first step, Hidayatullah have sent students to do dakwah as part of education process. Existence of Hidayatullah in various places is an effort to build wide dakwah network and can reach and serve all levels of ummah. Hidayatullah tries to put da’i as “missionaries of Islam” so that the profile of da’i is ones who have excellent and militant characteristic and also have potency to build a balance civilization between earthly and eternity.

Since 1978 Hidayatullah have sent da’i around the country. Hidayatullah tries to enhance the quality of da’i by founding Religion College of Islam Lukman Al Hakim (STAIL) in Surabaya and Moslem Law Science College of Hidayatullah (STIS) in Balikpapan as education institutes for cadre of da’i. Because of profession of da’i more tend to dedication therefore Hidayatullah give full scholarship (expense of living cost and education) for students of STAIL and STIS with tenure pattern. In this way expected can be yielded da’i with stratum one qualification in education, dakwah and syariah who have militant soul, ready to be assigned entire Indonesia, expected can stay permanently, given subsidy for maximal 3 years or till they able to be economic performer where they are assigned.

===Education===
In second 25 years step of Hidayatullah, education has a central and strategic role, especially when it is connected with effort to enhance human resources quality. It is caused by the realization for human standing and prestige increase and socialization of Islam values can be done only by high quality human resource.

According to Islam terminology, high quality human resource is human being capable to use all thinking and recitation potency inside himself or herself well balanced so that all domination of science, domination of technology and his/her skill give benefit to himself/herself, his/her environmental and world generally. Therefore, the development of human resource must be focused on the principles of tauhid and good behaviour without ignoring standing of intellectuality.

Hidayatullah introduces concept of integral Islam education and implement it in management of Hidayatullah schools from kindergarten until college level. The "integral" term shows a unity of all existing element, either faith and godly and science and technology, school and society, formal and non-formal, etc.

Hidayatullah education institute covers Kindergarten and Play Group, Elementary School or Madrasah Ibtidaiyah in almost all areas, Junior High School/Madrasah Tsanawiyah and Senior High School/Madrasah Aliyah at least in each region and 3 colleges in Surabaya, Balikpapan and Depok.

Aside from expectation to minimize economic inabilities, PPAS are expected to be able to produce cadres of combatant (mujahid) that will be ahead in the front line to straighten up the pennant of Islam.

The existence of more than 200 PPAS with averagely 150 orphans and poor children per PPAS is prove of the siding of Hidayatullah’s to the weak (dhu’afa) and the oppressed ones (mustadh’afin), the orphans and poor children.

Most of the da’i have since built their own pesantren in areas where they were posted –this in addition to the continued effort of the Hidayatullah to develop boarding schools in whatever regions where there are none.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4346">'''Hinn'''  ({{lang-ar|حنّ}}) are [[supernatural]] creatures, besides [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]], in [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian lore]] and also a group of [[pre-Adamite|pre-Adamitic race]] in [[Islam|Islam-related]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Rosenthal ''Knowledge Triumphant: The Concept of Knowledge in Medieval Islam'' Brill Archive 1970 page 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Adamitic circles==
According to [[Alawi]] faith, the Hinn are part of the "circle of time", belonging to a period preceding the creation of mankind. Therefore before human, the ''[[hinn (legendary creature)|hinn]]'', ''[[binn (legendary creature)|binn]]'', ''[[timm (legendary creature)|timm]]'', ''[[rimm (legendary creature)|rimm]]'', ''[[Jann (legendary creature)|jann]]'' and ''[[jinn]]'' roamed the earth. These six periods symbolize a negative progress until humans emerge, thus the first letters of the first four circles mean ''[[Habtar]]'' (here referring to the personification of evil) and the latter referring to Jann and Jinn as subordinates of the [[Devil (Islam)|devil]]. The following circle divides human history, starting with [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] and ends with [[Muhammad]], the  period in which humans now live.&lt;ref&gt;Yaron Friedman ''The Nuṣayrī-ʻAlawīs: An Introduction to the Religion, History, and Identity of the Leading Minority in Syria'' BRILL 2010 {{ISBN|978-9-004-17892-2}} page 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, hinn have been said to be associated with air and another creature, binn, with water in a document called, "[[Revelations of ʻAbdullah Al-Sayid Muhammad Habib]]". In the same document, hinn and binn are said to be extinct, unlike jinn.&lt;ref&gt;Ḥasan Shaukī Ḥassīb, Al Hay'at Al-kashfiyah Li H̲al Mushkilat Al-bariyah: (Revelations of ʻAbdullah Al-Sayid Muhammad Habib Concerning the Creation and the Sidereal Universe)'' Luzac &amp; Company, 1909, p 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ibn Kathir]] the hinn belongs together with the jinn to those creatures who shed blood on earth before humankind, causing the angels to protest against [[God in Islam|God's]] command to place [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] as a vicegerent.&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&amp;C Black 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-826-44957-3}} page 16&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Al-Bidāya wa-n-Nihāya'' he relates, the hinn and binn were exterminated by the jinn, so that they could dwell on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Katheer ''Early Days: Al Bidayah - Wan Nihayah'' Darussalam Publishers 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur]] states in his work ''at-Tahreer wa’t-Tanweer'', the hinn and binn may be a reference to [[Persian mythology]] or the [[Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Greek]] [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, who were driven away by their deities.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamqa.info/en/72470&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinn fighting alongside angels==
According to some accounts, the ''Hinn'' supported the angels, led by [[Iblis]] during a battle against the earthen jinn, who bore disaster on the world. [[Tabari]] explained the Hinn were created out of fire, like the jinn. But the Hinn, who belong to Iblis´s group are created out of the fire of ''samum'' (scorching fire), which is mentioned in the [[Quran]] (15:27) while the regular jinn are created out of ''marij min nar ''(smokeless flame), which is mentioned in (55:15).&lt;ref&gt;Lucinda Mosher, David Marshall: ''Sin, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation: Christian and Muslim Perspectives.'' Georgetown University Press, 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-62616-284-6}}, S. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore and poems==
According to some folklore, the Hinn are believed to be still alive and took shape of dogs. Based on a [[hadith]], if a [[wild dog]] approaches a Muslim, he shall throw some food to him and chase him away, because he would have an evil soul.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinn were mentioned in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] poems along with jinn.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian]] tradition, '''holy cards''' or '''prayer cards''' are small, [[Catholic devotions|devotional]] pictures [[Mass production|mass-produced]] for the use of the faithful. They usually depict a religious scene or a [[saint]] in an image about the size of a [[playing card]]. The reverse typically contains a [[prayer]], some of which promise an [[indulgence]] for its recitation. The circulation of these cards is an important part of the visual [[folk culture]] of Roman Catholics, and in modern times, prayer cards have also become popular among Orthodox Christians and Protestant Christians, although with the latter, biblical themes are emphasized within them.&lt;ref name="Hasinoff2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasinoff|first=Erin L.|title=Faith in Objects: American Missionary Expositions in the Early Twentieth Century|date=2011-11-22|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230339729|page=206|quote=Protestant prayer cards tended to emphasize biblical themes as opposed to devotional subjects (Leonard Primiano, personal communication, 2011).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Illes2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Illes|first=Judika|title=Encyclopedia of Mystics, Saints &amp; Sages|date=2011-10-11|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062098542|page=68|quote=In recent years, holy cards have become increasingly popular among Orthodox Christians as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old master prints==
[[File:Maestro di flemalle, forse robert campin, annunciazione, 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Annunciation by Robert Campin; [[Woodblock printing|wood print]] is top right, between candle fixtures.]]
[[Old master print]]s, nearly all on religious subjects, served many of the same functions as holy cards, especially the cheaper [[woodcut]]s; the earliest dated surviving example is from 1423, probably from southern Germany, and depicts [[Saint Christopher]], with handcolouring, it is found as part of the binding of a manuscript of the ''Laus Virginis'' (1417) which belongs to the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/guide/atoz/incunabula/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402010642/http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/specialcollections/collections/guide/atoz/incunabula/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2010 |title=Incunabula |work=Guide to Special Collections |publisher=John Rylands University Library |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Rylands Library (1969) ''Catalogue of an Exhibition of Manuscripts and Early Printing Originating in Germany''. Manchester: John Rylands Library; p. 15 (gives references to Dodgson: Woodcuts; 2 &amp; Schreiber: Manuel; 1349)&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[engraving]] or [[etching]] were more commonly used. Some had elaborate borders of paper [[lace]] surrounding the images; these were called ''dévotes dentelles'' in France.

One use of such cards is illustrated in an early 15th-c painting of the Annunciation by [[Robert Campin]], which stages the event in a bourgeois home; above the fireplace, a print of Christopher carrying the Christ child is tacked to the wall, possibly as a more affordable alternative to a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Het hemels prentenboek: Devotie- en bidprentjes vanaf de 17e eeuw tot het begin van de 20e eeuw|publisher=Gooi en Sticht|first=J. A. J. M.|last=Verspaandonk|year=1975|location=Hilversum|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lithography==
The invention of colour [[lithography]] made it possible to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards.  An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of St Sulpice]] in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate [[pastel]] colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs. [[Belgium]] and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did [[Italy]] in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as [[Bayard Presse|Maison de la Bonne Presse]] in France and [[Ars Sacra]] in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.

==Special types of cards==
Special holy cards are printed for Roman Catholics to be distributed at funerals; these are "[[In memoriam card]]s", with details and often a photograph of the person whom they commemorate as well as prayers printed on the back.  Other specialized holy cards record [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]s, and other religious anniversaries.  Others are not customized, and are circulated to promote the [[veneration]] of the saints and images they bear.

At the end of the nineteenth century, some Protestants also produced similar images of their own. They produced ''Bible cards'' or ''[[Sunday school]] cards'', with lithographed illustrations depicting [[Bible stories]] and [[parable]]s, more modern scenes of religious life or prayer, or sometimes just a Biblical text illuminated by [[calligraphy]]; these were linked to Biblical passages that related to the image.  The reverse typically held a [[sermonette]] instead of a prayer. Imagery here was always the servant of text, and as such these Protestant cards tended to be replaced by [[Tract (literature)|tract]]s that emphasized message instead of imagery, and were illustrated with [[cartoon]]-like images if they were illustrated at all.

==World War II and the Cold War==
The ''[[Head of Christ]]'' painting has been printed more than 500 million times, including pocket-sized cards for carrying in a [[wallet]].&lt;ref name="Lippy1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippy|first=Charles H.|title=Being Religious, American Style: A History of Popular Religiosity in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yB1R5485dUC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=30 April 2014|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313278952|page=185|quote=Of these one stands out as having deeply impressed itself of the American religious consciousness: the "Head of Christ" by artist Warner Sallman (1892-1968). Originally sketched in charcoal as a cover illustration for the ''Covenant Companion'', the magazine of the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America denomination, and based on an image of Jesus in a painting by the French artist Leon Augustin Lhermitte, Sallman's "Head of Christ" was painted in 1940. In half a century, it had been produced more than five hundred million times in formats ranging from large-scale copies for use in churches to wallet-sized ones that individuals could carry with them at all times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[World War II]] era, "millions of cards featuring the Head of Christ were distributed through the USO by the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[YMCA]] to members of the American armed forces stationed overseas".&lt;ref name="Moore2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Stephen D.|title=God's Beauty Parlor|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804743327|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], both Catholics and Protestants helped to popularize these cards, presenting "a united front against the menace of godless Communism".&lt;ref name="Prothero2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=Stephen|title=American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon|date=15 December 2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9780374178901|page=117|quote=During the postwar revival of the 1940s and 1950s, as Protestants and Catholics downplayed denominational differences in order to present a united front against the menace of godless Communism, Sallman's Jesus became far and away the most common image of Jesus in American homes, churches, and workplaces. Thanks to Sallman (and the savvy marketing of his distributors), Jesus became instantly recognizable by Americans of all races and religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish law of 2009==
In [[Ireland]], cards are sold certifying that a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] has been said for the benefit of sick or dead people, and are typically given to the family of the sick or dead person. Disputes arose over the validity of cards issued by priests living outside Ireland. Section 99 of the 2009 Charities Act regulates sales of Mass Cards, which can only be sold "pursuant to an arrangement" with a "recognised person", such as a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]], without stipulating whether that person had to be resident in Ireland or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2009/a0609.pdf Charities Act 2009 text]&lt;/ref&gt; A court challenge to the new law by a business that sold 120,000 cards a year failed in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1217/church.html McNally case; accessed from RTE website August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of the law can result in a 10-year prison sentence or a €300,000 fine.

'''Iatromantis'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Greek]]: ἰατρόμαντις from ἰατρός, ''iatros'' "healer"  and μάντις, ''mantis'' "seer".&lt;/ref&gt; is a Greek word whose literal meaning is most simply rendered "physician-seer," or "[[medicine-man]]".  The iatromantis, a form of Greek [[shamanism|shaman]], is related to other semimythical figures such as [[Abaris]], [[Aristeas]], [[Epimenides]], and [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book

In the classical period, [[Aeschylus]] uses the word to refer to [[Apollo]]&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, Eumenides l. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Asclepius]], Apollo's son.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, Suppliant Women l. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]], ''iatromantis'' figures belonged to a wider Greek and Asian [[shamanic]] tradition with origins in [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

More than just a medical technique, incubation reportedly allowed a human being to experience a fourth state of consciousness different from [[sleeping]], [[dream]]ing, or ordinary [[Wakefulness|waking]]: a state that Kingsley describes as “consciousness itself” and likens to the ''[[turiya]]'' or ''[[samādhi]]'' of the [[Yoga|Indian yogic]] traditions.  Kingsley identifies the Greek [[pre-Socratic]] philosopher [[Parmenides]] as an ''iatromantis''.  This identification has been described by Oxford academic Mitchell Miller as "fascinating" but also as "very difficult to assess as a truth claim".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Miller, "The Proem of Parmenides" in Sedley, David (ed.), ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy, Volume 30'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 15, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Spiritual Leader of Bhutan Walking to the festival.jpg|thumb|The Je Khenpo in 2010, at [[Punakha Dzong]], in a saffron [[kabney]]]]
{{Politics of Bhutan}}

The '''Je Khenpo''' ({{Bo|t=རྗེ་མཁན་པོ་|w=Rje Mkhan-po}}; "The Chief Abbot of the Central Monastic Body of Bhutan"&lt;ref name=CoBE/&gt;), formerly called the '''''Dharma Raj''''' by orientalists,  is the title given to the senior religious hierarch of [[Bhutan]].  His primary duty is to lead the '''[[Dratshang Lhentshog]]''' (Commission for the Monastic Affairs) of Bhutan, which oversees the Central Monastic Body, and to arbitrate on matters of doctrine, assisted by ''Five Lopen Rinpoches '' (learned masters).&lt;ref name=USLCCS2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 - Bhutan: Religious Tradition |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Je Khenpo is also responsible for many important liturgical and religious duties across the country.  The sitting Je Khenpo is also formally the leader of the southern branch of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] sect, which is part of the [[Kagyu]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism|Himalayan Buddhism]]. Aside from the [[Druk Gyalpo|King of Bhutan]], only the Je Khenpo may don a saffron [[kabney]].&lt;ref name=USLCCS3&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 - Bhutan: Social System |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to the [[dual system of government]] established by [[Ngawang Namgyal]] in the 17th century, the powers of the government of Bhutan are ideally split between the religious branch, headed by the Je Khenpo, and the administrative branch, headed by the [[Druk Desi]].&lt;ref name=USLCCS4&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 - Bhutan: Theocratic Government, 1616-1907 |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Je Khenpo is granted on merit by election, and typically is given to the most respected monk in the [[Dratshang Lhentshog]] (Commission for the Monastic Affairs).  Thus, unlike reincarnation lineages such as the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], or [[Panchen Lama]], the position of Je Khenpo is never held by a child but always by a seasoned monk.

Historically, the role of the Je Khenpo was quite powerful. The Je Khenpo and [[Druk Desi]] collaborated to disempower the office of the Zhabdrung through finding multiple incarnations of various aspects of the Zhabdrung; both the Je Khenpo and the Druk Desi wanted to retain the power they had accrued through the [[dual system of government]].&lt;ref name=USLCCS1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6 - Bhutan: Administrative Integration and Conflict with Tibet, 1651–1728 |edition=3rd |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, [[United States Library of Congress]] |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the establishment of the [[monarchy]] in 1907, the relative influence of the Je Khenpo has diminished. Nonetheless, the position remains a powerful one and the Je Khenpo is typically viewed as the closest and most powerful advisor to the [[King of Bhutan]].

The 67th Je Khenpo, [[Ngawang Thinley Lhundup]], died at the age of 84 on 10 June 2005. He was noted as a strict disciplinarian who would not compromise any rules in managing the Central Monastic Body.  In addition to his position as Je Khenpo, he was recognized as the [[tulku]] of [[Nyizergang]], the seat of the [[tertön]] [[Woogpa Lingpa]], in [[Wangdue Phodrang Province]].

The 70th and present Je Khenpo is ''[[His Holiness]] [[Tulku]]'' [[Jigme Choedra, 70th Je Khenpo|Jigme Choedra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://es-es.facebook.com/70thJeKhenpo/ His Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to be the reincarnation of [[Maitreya]] as well as the [[mahasiddha]] [[Saraha]], [[Hungchen Kara]], [[Kheuchung Lotsawa]], and [[Pema Tsering]].

In 2008, the office of the Je Khenpo was codified as part of the [[Constitution of Bhutan]]. Under Article 3 Section 4, the King appoints the Je Khenpo as the spiritual leader of Bhutan on the recommendation of the Five Lopons. In turn, the Je Khenpo appoints, on the recommendation of the [[Dratshang Lhentshog]] (Commission for the Monastic Affairs), monks with the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ''ked-dzog'' (stages of development and completion in [[Vajrayana]] practice) as the Five Lopons.&lt;ref name=CoBE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |format=PDF |title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan (English) |publisher=Government of Bhutan |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate= 6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jews' Gate Cemetery''' is a [[Jewish cemetery]] located on [[Windmill Hill, Gibraltar|Windmill Hill]] within a [[nature reserve]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. Also known as the '''Windmill Hill Cemetery''', it is the site of the earliest known [[Bereavement in Judaism|Jewish burials]] in Gibraltar. The cemetery opened by 1746 and closed in 1848. It is the burial site of a number of Gibraltar's [[Chief Rabbi]]s. The graveyard is protected by the [[law of Gibraltar]].

The reason for this location for burials of members of the [[History of the Jews in Gibraltar|Jewish community]] is uncertain. One theory is that the more visible and accessible cemetery utilised by [[Christianity|Christians]], near the border with Spain, was more subject to the laws regarding expulsion of Jews,&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt; which had been mandated by the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]].&lt;ref name=rock/&gt; The best-preserved [[headstone|gravestones]] at Jews' Gate Cemetery are those that, until recently, were protected by a layer of [[mud]] and [[peat]]. The inscriptions on the [[limestone]] tombstones that have been exposed to the elements have become difficult to decipher. During half of the year, the winter and spring, plants are allowed to grow freely in the cemetery, in deference to the [[Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society]]. The area is a favoured mating and nesting ground of the [[Barbary partridge]]; after their nesting season, the cemetery is cleared and the impression of neglect is removed.&lt;ref name=hassid&gt;{{cite web|title=The Windmill Hill (Jews’ Gate) Cemetery|url=http://www.jewishgibraltar.com/interest.php|work=jewishgibraltar.com|publisher=Gibraltar Jewish Community|author=Rabbi Roni Hassid|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded Rabbi [[Yehuda ben Yitshak Halevi]] as Gibraltar's Chief Rabbi. Abudarham inaugurated the [[Synagogues of Gibraltar#The Flemish Synagogue|Flemish Synagogue]] on [[Line Wall Road, Gibraltar|Line Wall Road]] at the turn of the 19th century, laying the stone which still bears his name.&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt; He also established a school of religious study in [[Parliament Lane, Gibraltar|Parliament Lane]].&lt;ref name=rock/&gt; Abudarham died in 1804, victim of a [[yellow fever]] epidemic.

The second oldest tombstone is the third from the left. The grave is that of Rabbi [[Raphael Moshe Hassan]], who died in 1810. His inscription is also legible and reads:&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt;

{{quote|text=Tomb of our master, teacher and rabbi, a sage complete in his knowledge of all areas of Tora, Dayan and teacher, pious and humble, his honour our teacher and rabbi Raphael Moshe Hassan, of blessed memory, called to the Heavenly Court …5th Adar 1 year 5570 from the creation (1810).}}

The fifth tomb from the left in the enclosure is that of Rabbi [[Avraham Haim Burgel]], the son of Rabbi [[Nathan Burgel]], author of ''[[Hok Natan]]''. The younger Burgel died in 1813. His epitaph is:&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt;

{{quote|text=The tomb of the sage versed in all areas of the Tora, our honourable teacher and rabbi Abraham Hayim Burgel, son of that Tsadik the rabbi “Hok Natan” of blessed memory, and his repose was on Wednesday 22nd Elul 5573 (1813).}}

Rabbi [[Yeshaya Anahory]] also died in 1813, shortly after Rabbi Burgel. His tomb is within the far right of the walled enclosure. His inscription has been transcribed as:&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt;

{{quote|text=This is the tomb of the sage in all areas of Tora, the famed judge, the pious and humble honourable teacher and Rabbi Yeshaya Anahory of blessed memory, and his repose was in honour on 6th Tishri 5574 (1813).}}

The gravestone second from the left is that of Rabbi [[Yosef Elmalech ben Ayush]]. He first served as a rabbi in [[Morocco]] in 1788, and later accepted the position of [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] (rabbinical judge) in Gibraltar, and remained there until his death in 1823. The fourth gravestone from the left is that of Rabbi [[Avraham Yisrael]] who died in 1844.&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt;

In the southern portion of the cemetery is a smaller enclosure with just a single grave, that of Rabbi [[Yisrael ben Yeshaya]] who died in 1841. After his death, the position of [[Chief Rabbi in Gibraltar]] remained open for four decades. Adjacent to the wall surrounding the rabbi's tomb, is that of Rabbi [[Yitshak Halevi III]]. He died in 1847, the year before the cemetery's closing. By then, there was little remaining space in the graveyard, which would make sense of the south-north orientation of his tomb, compared to the east-west alignment of other graves.&lt;ref name=hassid/&gt; Another grave within Jews' Gate Cemetery is that of Rabbi Raphael Hayyim Moses Benaim.&lt;ref name=gate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Descriptive Catalogue of the Bension Collection of Sephardic Manuscripts and Texts|year=1979|publisher=University of Alberta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGnh80hn-kgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Joseph+Abudarham,+Gibraltar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PL-NDqn_Cg&amp;sig=B2mggob57rTJZPRMHouo76liMNE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqpjUO3tEMjBygGesICADw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Joseph%20Abudarham%2C%20Gibraltar&amp;f=false|author=Aranov, Saul I.|accessdate=26 September 2012|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kanishka stupa''' ({{Lang-ur|کنشک اسٹوپ}}) was a monumental [[stupa]] established by the [[Kushan]] king [[Kanishka]] during the 2nd century CE in today's [[Shaji-ki-Dheri]] on the outskirts of [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]]. 

The stupa was built during the Kushan era to house Buddhist relics, and would become perhaps the tallest buildings in the ancient world.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The stupa is also famous for its Buddhist relics, which were transferred to the U Khanti Hall at [[Mandalay Hill]], in [[Mandalay]], [[Burma]] after their discovery.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marshall, John H. (1909): "Archaeological Exploration in India, 1908–9." (Section on: "The stūpa of Kanishka and relics of the Buddha"). ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 1909, pp. 1056–1061.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandra1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rai Govind Chandra|title=Indo-Greek Jewellery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97od3sgsAjcC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-088-4|pages=82–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
According to Buddhists the building of the stupa was foretold by the Buddha:
:"The Buddha, pointing to a small boy making a mud tope….[said] that on that spot Kanishka would erect a tope by his name." Vinaya sutra &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kumar 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The same story is repeated in a [[Khotan]]ese scroll found at [[Dunhuang]], which first described how Kanishka would arrive 400 years after the death of the Buddha. The account also describes how Kanishka came to raise his stupa: 
:"A desire thus arose in [Kanishka to build a vast stupa]….at that time the four world-regents learnt the mind of the king. So for his sake they took the form of young boys….[and] began a stupa of mud....the boys said to [Kanishka] ‘We are making the Kanishka-stupa.’….At that time the boys changed their form....[and] said to him, ‘Great king, by you according to the Buddha’s prophecy is a Sangharama to be built wholly (?) with a large stupa and hither relics must be invited which the meritorious good beings...will bring." &lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kumar 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===First stupa (150 CE)===
[[File:Loriyan_Tangai_complete_Stupa.jpg|thumb|upright|Probable initial appearance of the first stupa. [[Loriyan Tangai]], 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=BA/&gt;]]
The original Kushan stone [[stupa]] was probably built after the death of [[Kanishka the Great]],&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; between 150 and 300 CE, but probably circa 151 CE, with a shape similar to the contemporary [[Loriyan Tangai]] stupas and the addition of [[schist]] reliefs.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Le"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=9780984404308|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=hephthalite+peshawar#v=onepage&amp;q=hephthalite%20peshawar&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Second stupa (4th century CE)===
The stupa was rebuilt under Kushan rule in the 4th century CE into a [[cruciform]] stupa with a tower-like structure, with four staircases and four corner bastions, and possibly pillars at each corner.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The stupa's symmetrically cross-shaped [[plinth]] measured {{convert|175|ft|m}}, though the plinth had large staircases at each of the stupa's sides. In total, the base of the stupa may have spanned {{convert|272|ft|m}} on each side.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The plinth was likely decorated with sculpted reliefs,&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; while niches built into the dome's four cardinal points was inlayed with precious stone.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The tall wooden superstructure was built atop a decorated stone base,&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; and crowned with a 13-layer copper-[[gilding|gild]]ed ''[[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]].''&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; Modern estimations suggest that the stupa had a height of {{convert|400|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt;

&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="200px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Reconstruction===
The stupa was then destroyed by the [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] during their invasion of the area in the 460s CE.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; 

The stupa's wooden superstructure was rebuilt atop the stone base,&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; and crowned with a 13-layer copper-[[gilding|gild]]ed ''[[Chatra (umbrella)|chatra]].''&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; In the 5th century CE, stucco imagery was probably added to the site, in keeping with contemporary popularity for Buddhist imagery.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt;

===Destruction===
[[Sung Yun]] noted in the early 6th century that the tower had been struck by lightning at least three times, having been rebuilt after each strike.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The tall stupa with a copper top acted as a [[lightning rod]]. This propensity to attract lightning strikes may explain the dearth of any surviving examples of wooden-tower stupas.&lt;ref name="Longhurst"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longhurst|first1=A. H.|title=The Story of the Stupa|date=1995|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120601604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The stupa was discovered and excavated in 1908–1909 by a British archaeological mission under [[David Brainard Spooner]], and led to the discovery in its base of the [[Kanishka casket]], a six-sided rock crystal [[reliquary]] containing three small fragments of bone,&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, D. B. (1908–9): "Excavations at Shāh-ji-Dherī." ''Archaeological Survey of India'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; relics of the Buddha (which were transferred to [[Mandalay]], [[Burma]] and a dedication in [[Kharoshthi]] involving Kanishka.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandra1979"/&gt;

==Contemporary accounts==
[[Image:KanishkaCasket.JPG|thumb|The inscribed [[Kanishka casket]] found at the site of the Kanishka Stupa and containing [[relic]]s of the Buddha, now in [[Peshawar Museum]], Pakistan, while the relics are in [[Mandalay]], Burma.]]
In the 400s CE, the [[China|Chinese]] Buddhist [[pilgrim]] ''[[Faxian]]'' visited the structure and described it as "the highest of all the towers" in [[Jambudvipa|the "terrestrial world"]],&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; which ancient travelers claimed was up to {{convert|560|ft|m}} tall,&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; though modern estimates suggest a height of {{convert|400|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt;

In 520 CE, [[Sung Yun]] describes the stupa in the following terms:- 
:"The king proceeded to widen the foundation of the Great Tower 300 paces and more. To crown all, he placed a roof-pole upright and even. Throughout the building he used ornamental wood, he constructed stairs to lead to the top....there was an iron-pillar, 3-feet high with thirteen gilded circlets. Altogether the height from the ground was 700 feet.”

==Legacy==
The stupa is believed to have influence later constructions of "tower stupas" throughout ancient [[Turkistan]].&lt;ref name="Le"/&gt; The construction of wooden towers topped with metal ''chatras'' made such buildings act as lightning rods, which could explain why such towers have all but disappeared.&lt;ref name="Longhurst"/&gt;

==Current status==
[[Image:Buddha relics.JPG|thumb|right|Buddha relics from Kanishka's stupa were transferred to [[Mandalay]], [[Burma]].]]
The site has not been preserved. The location was re-identified in 2011. It is located outside the Gunj Gate of the old Walled City of Peshawar and is called Akhunabad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130617190004/http://tribune.com.pk/story/240321/gandhara-civilisation-revered-buddhist-site-rediscovered-near-peshawar Gandhara civilisation: Revered Buddhist site rediscovered near Peshawar], Manzoor Ali, August 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kingdom Hall''' is a [[place of worship]] used by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. The term was first suggested in 1935 by [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], then president of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]], for a building in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'' chap. 20 p. 319, 721&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford's reasoning was that these buildings would be used for "preaching the good news of the Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'' chap. 20 p. 319 Building Together on a Global Scale&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses use Kingdom Halls for the majority of their [[worship]] and [[Bible]] instruction. Witnesses prefer the term "Kingdom Hall" over "[[Church (building)|church]]", noting that the term often translated "church" in the Bible refers to the congregation of people rather than a structure.&lt;ref&gt;"Should We Go to Christian Meetings?", ''Awake!'', March 8, 2001, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses - geograph.org.uk - 175707.jpg|thumb|left|A Kingdom Hall in Biddulph, United Kingdom]]
Kingdom Halls are typically modest, functional structures with practicality in mind.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will'' p.120-123 (Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; As Witnesses do not use [[religious symbols]], such are not displayed on or in Kingdom Halls. An annual yeartext, or "theme [[Chapters and verses of the Bible#Verses|scripture]]", which is the same for all congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide, is prominently displayed in each Kingdom Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''Texas Monthly'' magazine, July 1980, page 136,138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LS4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], "A Witness house of worship is called a Kingdom Hall. ...Appropriate to the movement's rejection of pomp and display, the [particular Hall visited by the writer], shared with two other congregations, resembled the meeting room of a budget motel, complete with rows of stackable chairs. The lone feature that marked it as a room devoted to religion was a sign, affixed to a plain wooden canopy over the speaker's stand, that bore the entreaty, "And now, Jehovah . . . grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness." The congregation of approximately 75 included admirably equal portions of blacks, whites, and Mexican Americans, a not uncommon manifestation of ethnic ecumenicity in Witness circles."&lt;/ref&gt; This text can be displayed in several languages if the Hall is used by foreign language congregations.&lt;ref&gt;"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', December 1976, page 4, "It is recommended that the yeartext be displayed in the Kingdom Hall in countries where this can be done without difficulties resulting. ...Often it is best to display the yeartext at the front or side of the hall so it can be seen easily."&lt;/ref&gt; A Kingdom Hall typically has a [[library]], [[Donation|contribution]] boxes,&lt;ref&gt;“To the House of Jehovah Let Us Go”, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', April 1993, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and a literature counter, where publications are displayed, stored and dispensed.&lt;ref&gt;"Bible-based Society of Kingdom Witnesses", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1962, page 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Kingdom Halls have multiple [[auditorium]]s to allow more than one congregation to conduct meetings simultaneously. Where there is more than one auditorium, each auditorium or the entire structure may be referred to as "a Kingdom Hall". Larger ''Assembly Halls'' or ''Convention Centers of Jehovah's Witnesses'', or any rented arena or stadium used for larger gatherings of Jehovah's Witnesses are also regarded 'as a large Kingdom Hall'; undignified behavior is considered inappropriate during their religious events, even if the facility is an [[Stadium|entertainment venue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maintain Fine Conduct That Glorifies God", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 2000, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings for worship===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Worship}}
Congregations typically meet in their Kingdom Halls two days each week for worship.&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will'', ©2005 Watch Tower, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Worship|Meetings]] usually open and close with [[Kingdom songs|song]] and [[prayer]]. Meetings held in the Kingdom Hall include Bible readings and public talks on matters such as the Bible, [[family]] life, [[Christian]] qualities and [[prophecy]]. There are also discussions of specially prepared study articles in ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine and other [[List of Watch Tower Society publications|publications of Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'' by Jacob Neusner, ©2003, Westminster John Knox Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0MJrFwCHJQkC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry'', ©1983,1989 Watch Tower, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions'' by Wendy Doniger (editor), ©2006, in association with Merriam-Webster, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IDsk47MeksAC&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''World Religions: An Introduction for Students'' by Jeaneane D. Fowler, ©1997, Sussex Academic Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joydUNzV5R0C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses also meet in Kingdom Halls for preparation and prayer before engaging in their [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices##Evangelism|door-to-door ministry]].

====Classes====
Kingdom Halls may also be used to teach sign language or other foreign language classes.&lt;ref&gt;"Highlights of the Past Year", ''2007 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', pages 6, 15-18&lt;/ref&gt; Kingdom Halls are also used for sessions especially developed for particular areas of service, such as the ''Pioneer Service School'' for full-time preachers, and the ''Kingdom Ministry School'' for elders and ministerial servants.&lt;ref&gt;"Imitate the Greatest Missionary", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 2008, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where the [[literacy]] rate is low, congregations may arrange to use Kingdom Halls to conduct literacy classes, which non-Witnesses may also attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1986 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Students}}

===Weddings===
Kingdom Halls may be used for [[wedding]] ceremonies of [[Baptized#Jehovah's Witnesses|Witness-baptized]] couples. A couple sends a request in writing to the congregation's "[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|service committee]]", which assesses whether the couple is "in good standing, living in harmony with Bible principles and Jehovah’s righteous standards" and that they also approve of the members of the couple's [[wedding party]] (that is, [[Wedding ceremony participants#Groomsmen|groomsmen]] and [[bridesmaids]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2008, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses attach no special significance to a Kingdom Hall wedding over a secular service, and Witness couples may choose to be married elsewhere for personal or practical reasons. Kingdom Halls are not used for [[wedding reception]]s or other social events.&lt;ref&gt;"Marriage Ceremony and Requirements", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1956, page 571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''How to Be a Perfect Stranger: The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook'' by Stuart M. Matlins, Arthur J. Magida (editors), ©2004, Skylight Paths Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3vDI7YSzQEQC&amp;pg=PT148&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 128-129, "Marriage Ceremony  Jehovah's Witnesses view marriage as a sacred vow made before God. ...The marriage ceremony, which may last about 30 minutes, is a ceremony in itself. ...Appropriate Attire  Men" A jacket and tie. No head covering is required. Women: A dress or a skirt and blouse. Dress "modestly" and "sensibly". Hems need not reach below the knees nor must clothing cover the arms. Open-toed shoes and modest jewelry are permissible. No head covering is required. There are no rules regarding colors of clothing. ...After the Ceremony  Is there usually a reception after the ceremony? Yes. It may be held in homes or a catering hall. It is never held in the Kingdom Hall where the wedding took place."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funerals===
[[Funeral]] services may be held in a Kingdom Hall if the body of [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]] considers that "the deceased had a clean [[reputation]] and was a member of the congregation or the minor child of a member".&lt;ref name=funeralkm&gt;"Question Box", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', March 1997, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The family of the deceased may ask any respected male member of the congregation to conduct the service, which involves a simple Bible-based discourse.&lt;ref&gt;"Is Your Course of Life Death-Oriented?", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1978, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on family preference and local custom, a Kingdom Hall funeral may or may not have the [[coffin|casket]]ed deceased present.&lt;ref name=funeralkm /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''How to Be a Perfect Stranger: The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook'' by Stuart M. Matlins, Arthur J. Magida (editors), ©2004, Skylight Paths Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3vDI7YSzQEQC&amp;pg=PT148&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 129, "Funerals and Mourning   Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the dead are "conscious of nothing at all" and are asleep in the grave awaiting resurrection to life. ...The funeral service, which is a ceremony in itself, may last about 15 to 30 minutes. ...Where will the ceremony take place? Either at a Kingdom Hall or in a funeral home. ...Will there be an open casket? Possibly. This depends on the preference of the immediate family."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster relief===
[[Disaster relief]] efforts of Jehovah's Witnesses are typically channeled through permanent local Disaster Relief Committees&lt;ref&gt;"Volunteers continue Katrina disaster relief work" by David J. Bush, ''Salisbury Post'', September 1, 2007, page F0&lt;/ref&gt; under the various [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Branches and zones|branch offices]], and are staged at Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls as close as practical to the disaster area. Major disaster relief efforts include:

* ''War'': During the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994, a Kingdom Hall property in [[Goma]] (then [[Zaire]], now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) housed 1600 Witness and non-Witness refugees. In July 1994, relief workers set up a 60-bed relief hospital at the Kingdom Hall, as well as a water treatment system.&lt;ref&gt;"Caring for Victims of Rwanda’s Tragedy", ''Awake!'', December 22, 1994, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Earthquake'': Following the [[Great Hanshin earthquake]] in 1995, six Kingdom Halls in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]] were used as relief centers and supply depots.&lt;ref&gt;"Volunteers at Work", ''Awake!'', July 22, 2001, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Love Toward Those ‘Related in the Faith’", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1999, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Japan", ''1998 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

: Following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], an Assembly Hall and three Kingdom Halls in Haiti were staffed and equipped as temporary clinics and medical centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Witnesses' relief efforts in Haiti continue|publisher=Watch Tower Society|date=January 28, 2010|url=http://www.jw-media.org/hti/20100128.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320025654/http://www.jw-media.org/hti/20100128.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Doctor Heads Home to Haiti" by Lionel J. Malebranche, MD, ''Annals of Internal Medicine'', February 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Storm'': In the ten months following [[Tropical Storm Allison]] in 2001, seven Kingdom Halls were used as relief centers to dispatch volunteer crews and to store tools and materials while they organized 11,700 volunteers to repair or rebuild 723 homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Love in Action—A Marathon Relief Effort", ''Awake!'', November 22, 2002, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

: For over two years after Hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] in 2005, Kingdom Halls were used as relief centers, warehouses, and fuel depots. Nearly 17,000 Witness volunteers repaired more than 5,600 homes and 90 Kingdom Halls during their extended relief effort in the United States' [[Gulf Coast]] region.&lt;ref&gt;"A Love More Powerful Than a Hurricane!", ''Awake!'', August 2008, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Volcano'': On January 18, 2002, the day after the eruption of [[Mount Nyiragongo#2002 eruption|Mount Nyiragongo]], six Kingdom Halls in the vicinity received three tons of basic necessities and housed 1,800 refugees. One week later, these relief centers were providing daily rations to 5000 people.&lt;ref&gt;"How We Escaped a Terrifying Lava Flow!", ''Awake!'', November 8, 2002, pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Bishopsworth KH Build 2011.JPG|thumb|A Kingdom Hall under construction in [[Bishopsworth]], Bristol, UK]]
The construction crews of Kingdom Halls and larger Assembly Halls consist of volunteering Jehovah's Witnesses,&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''The Encyclopedia of Louisville'' by John E. Kleber, ©2000, University Press of Kentucky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXbYITw4ZesC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 444, "Jehovah's Witnesses are well known in the Greater Louisville area, having been a part of "Kentucky sod" since the late 1800s. ...From 1947 to 1970 ten more Kingdom Halls were constructed in Louisville, all by volunteer labor."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''World Religions 101: An Overview for Teens'' by Margaret O. Hyde, Emily G. Hyde, ©2008, Twenty-First Century Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-9x_DjVh-y4C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes from other countries, who have been pre-approved for work on [[construction site]]s.

In many countries, a number of standard designs for construction are used that can be built in just a few days.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Religion in the contemporary world: a sociological introduction'' by Alan E. Aldridge, ©2000, Polity Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=01fWBEOTB1AC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 116-117, "Witnesses are extremely well organized. ...One particular way in which the [Watch Tower] society mobilizes its members is to build their places for worship and assembly, the Kingdom Halls. A 'rapid-building crew' of Witness volunteers can erect a functional but well-built Kingdom Hall in a weekend."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holbrook'' by Holbrook Historical Society, ©2004, Arcadia Publishing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cYsikz2srKcC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 63, "The Kingdom Hall. Shown here is the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses on North Franklin Street. This hall was built by the membership in one weekend."&lt;/ref&gt; The act of constructing a Kingdom Hall in this manner is called a ''quick-build'', although typically the preparation work involving the structural foundation and surrounding surface may take several weeks prior to the scheduled build. For various reasons, not all Kingdom Halls are constructed as ''quick-builds'' or using the standard designs. There is however, a noticeably dominant architectural style of the Kingdom Hall which is often used based on standardized design concepts and models, depending on needs.

A Kingdom Hall or Assembly Hall may be created by renovating an existing structure, such as a theater or non-Witness house of worship.&lt;ref&gt;''New York: The Movie Lover's Guide : The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York'' by Richard Alleman, ©2005, Broadway, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 416, "Albemarle Theater, 973 Flatbush Avenue. Just like the old Stanley Theater in Jersey City, Brooklyn's 2,700-seat Albemarle movie palace later served as a Kingdom Hall for the Jehovah's Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Abyssinian to Zion: A Guide to Manhattan's Houses of Worship'' by David W. Dunlap, ©2004, Columbia University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0JVmnJdqKYoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA117&amp;dq=%22kingdom+hall%22 As Retrieved 2009-08-18], page 117, "The remarkable Kingdom Hall at 609 West 161st Street was formerly the Hebrew Tabernacle of Washington Heights, by George and Edward Blum and Ludwig Hanauer, completed in 1925."&lt;/ref&gt; In areas of repeated or reputed vandalism, particularly in cities, some Kingdom Halls are built without windows to reduce the risk of property damage.&lt;ref&gt;"How Kingdom Halls Are Built", ''Awake!'', August 22, 1972, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was announced to elders in the United States that new Kingdom Halls worldwide would all be based on one of three similar design plans, depending on the required size.&lt;!-- The new Kingdom Halls will be zoned as commercial rather than residential buildings, which provides significant cost savings, as well as improved design and construction benefits for a building that is generally as heavily used as a Kingdom Hall is. [Any evidence that ALL existing Kingdom Halls are zoned as residential? Is the statement about cost savings sourced, or is it speculation?]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Regional Building Committee ===
Jehovah's Witnesses' branch offices appoint local Regional Building Committees (RBC) to oversee the construction and maintenance of their places of worship. The objective of such committees, which usually consist of five to seven persons, often with experience in the construction trades, is to coordinate the efforts of those involved so as to provide attractive and functional facilities that are financially viable.&lt;ref name=rbc&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|pages=325&amp;ndash;328|title=Jehovah's Witnesses&amp;mdash;Proclaimers of God's Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RBCs cooperate with local congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses seeking to build or renovate a place of worship, under the direction of the local branch office. Committees help in assessing the suitability of a possible construction site, purchasing the land and materials and coordinating the efforts of volunteers from the wider area.&lt;ref name=rbc /&gt; Members of a Regional Building Committee work voluntarily and receive no remuneration for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|title=Kingdom Hall Construction in the United States|page=3|date=August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, January 31, 2015, in a special meeting with all elders in the United States via live video feed, it was announced that Regional Building Committees will be replaced by Local Design/Construction Department of the branch office, but with a more defined organizational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Speeding Up Kingdom Hall Construction |chapter-url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/2016-yearbook/highlights/speeding-up-kingdom-hall-construction/ |title=2016 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses |page=15 |date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
In 1983, an arrangement was instituted whereby Kingdom Halls were financed by loans from the Watch Tower Society. In addition to contribution boxes for local congregation expenses and "the worldwide work", each congregation had a contribution box specifically for voluntary donations toward Kingdom Hall construction.&lt;ref&gt;"How Is It All Financed?", ''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', pages 344-345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Announcements", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', June 1991, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; These donations were pooled by the Watch Tower Society into the ''Society Kingdom Hall Fund'', which was used for financing the construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide, particularly in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=September 1999|pages=3&amp;ndash;4|title=True Worship Is Expanding in Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"International Kingdom Hall Building in Some European Lands", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', May 2003, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a congregation received local approval to build a new Kingdom Hall, the congregation could apply for a loan from the Society Kingdom Hall Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=September 1983|page=3|title=A New Program for Kingdom Hall Construction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congregation repaid the loan to the Watch Tower Society, in addition to its continued contributions to the Kingdom Hall Fund. Interest was charged on the loans until September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Letter to all Congregations'', June 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=December 1993|page=3|title=Continued Expansion Increases Need for Kingdom Halls}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=April 1985|page=4|quote=These loans are repaid to the Society Kingdom Hall Fund with interest at the rate of 6 percent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way Kingdom Halls are funded was significantly modified in 2014. The provision of Kingdom Hall loans from the Society was ceased, as was the separate ''Society Kingdom Hall Fund''. Instead, all congregations contribute an ongoing pre-determined amount to the branch office each month, in addition to donations for other purposes, into a single ''World Wide Work'' fund, and new Kingdom Halls are financed by the branch office. The stated purpose was so that areas without the resources for a new hall may be supplemented by funding from more affluent areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Maintenance==
Routine maintenance of Kingdom Halls is performed by the members of the congregations that use them, typically according to a scheduled checklist.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', March 2003, included a "Safety Checklist" on page 4, and a checklist for "Care of Building and Property" on page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Kingdom Hall operating committee" oversees maintenance of the building; at least one elder or ministerial servant from each congregation is selected to be part of the operating committee.&lt;ref&gt;"Let Us Keep Our Place of Worship in Good Repair", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', August 2003, page 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Kingdom Hall maintenance costs are covered by donations to a local fund.&lt;ref&gt;"The Giver of “Every Good Gift”", ''The Watchtower'', December 1, 1993, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Libyan society is composed of several Ashraf tribes. [[Ashraf]] ({{Lang-ar|أشرف}}) refers to someone claiming descent from [[Muhammad]] by way of his daughter [[Fatimah]]. The word is the plural of ''sharīf'' "noble", from ''sharafa'' "to be highborn". Ashraf, if pronounced with long ''ā'' in the second syllable ({{lang|ar|أشراف}} /ašrāf/) is the plural of [[Sharif]], but with short ''a'' ({{lang|ar|أشرف}} /ašraf/) is the intensive of ''sharīf'' meaning "very noble", "nobler", "noblest".

The following priestly societies and [[religious institute]]s use some pre-1970 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] or of a similar missal. Those not in full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the [[Holy See]] are marked as "canonically irregular". Most use a pre-1970 edition of the Roman Missal, but some follow the proper missal of the [[Dominican Rite]] or the [[Carmelite Rite]] and thus celebrate not the [[Tridentine Mass]] but a form of [[liturgy]] permitted under the 1570 papal bull ''[[Quo primum]]''.

The use of a pre-1970 [[Roman Missal]] is not prohibited by the current rules of the Catholic Church. See [[Tridentine Mass]] which contains much information about the format of a Tridentine Mass and the history of the various Missals of the Roman Rite. 
 
They are dedicated to preserving older [[Latin liturgical rites|liturgical rite]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Those approved by the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei]] are sometimes called ''[[Ecclesia Dei]] Communities''.

== History ==
The chapel was originally built by Brother Déodat in March 1914 (measuring 9 feet long by 4.5 feet wide). After taking criticism from other [[monk|brother]]s, Déodat demolished the chapel. He finished a second chapel in July 1914 (measuring 9 feet by 6 feet).&lt;ref name="Sizes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.urbanghostsmedia.com/2013/03/guernsey-decorative-little-chapel/ | title=Third Time Lucky for Guernsey's Decorative ‘Little Chapel’ | publisher=Urban Ghosts | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the [[Bishop of Portsmouth (Catholic)|Bishop of Portsmouth]] visited in 1923, he could not fit through the door, so Déodat again demolished it. The third and current version of the chapel started soon after the last demolition, and measures 16 feet by 9 feet.&lt;ref name="Demolition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Little Chapel, Guernsey, Channel Islands"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f1dHIIj0Yc&amp;list=PLD6ADB4A617BBD50A | title=Little Chapel, Guernsey, Channel Islands | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Déodat went to France in 1939 and died there, never having seen his chapel finished.&lt;ref name="Shell chapel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.r-l-p.co.uk/+shell.html | title=THE SHELL CHAPEL | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a committee was established to restore the chapel, and today it falls under the care of [[Blanchelande College]].

In 2010, five stained glass windows were smashed, causing £3,000 worth of damage&lt;ref name="BBC "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/guernsey/8575892.stm | title=Vandalism 'will not close' Little Chapel in St Andrew | work=BBC News | date=19 March 2010 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leading to condemnation of the vandals.&lt;ref name="Window"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/latest/2010/03/06/little-chapel-windows-smashed/ | title=Little Chapel windows smashed | work=This is Guernsey | date=6 March 2010 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The windows had been smashed previously, notably three times in 2003.&lt;ref name="Window 2003"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/latest/2003/04/01/vandals-target-little-chapel/ | title=Vandals target Little Chapel | work=This is Guernsey | date=1 April 2003 | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel has been described as "probably the biggest tourist attraction in Guernsey",&lt;ref name="G Press"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/news/2013/09/10/little-chapel-disappears-from-bus-timetable/ | title=Little Chapel disappears from bus timetable | work=The Guernsey Press | date=10 September 2013 | accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "intricate".&lt;ref name="Cruise"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.princess.com/find/excursion/exDetails.do?tourCode=GCI-200&amp;t=R&amp;exType=S | title=Guernsey Island Drive, Little Chapel &amp; Workshops | work=Princess Cruises | accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, there was major work on the overgrowth which was, in places, hiding parts of the chapel.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_guernseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=507884 | title=Unseen features at the Little Chapel get uncovered | work=Channel TV | date=28 October 2013 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Moore, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 it was closed to allow some major structural work to be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandfm.com/little-chapel-to-close/ |title=Little Chapel To Close |publisher=Island FM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works include underpinning the building, stabilising the foundations and weatherproofing the building, and are estimated to cost £500,000. Fundraising is being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guernseypress.com/news/2016/09/17/500000-is-needed-to-save-the-little-chapel/ |title=£500,000 is needed to save the Little Chapel |publisher=Guernsey Press |date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fully open again to the public in April 2017, the major works such as stabilising the foundations are complete however additional fundraising is needed to finish the final phase of renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guernseypress.com/news/2017/04/11/a-work-in-progress-2/ |title=A work in progress |publisher=Guernsey Press |date=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decoration ==
[[File:Guernsey July 2011 234, Little Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Surfaces of the chapel are covered with broken china]]
The Little Chapel is decorated with seashells, pebbles, and broken china.&lt;ref name="Home"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/guernsey-is-a-little-bit-of-britain-abroad-1676295 | title=Guernsey is a little bit of Britain abroad| work=The Mirror | accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "From a distance the colours and design make a pleasing whole, close-up it's amazing to see all the different pieces used to create the effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/picassiette-architecture-garden-art-mosaic-art-the-little-chapel-guernsey/ |title=Architecture &amp; Garden Art – Picassiette Mosaic Art – The Little Chapel – Guernsey |publisher=Mosaic Art Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has room for around eight people.&lt;ref name="Shell chapel"/&gt;

The chapel was brought sudden fame following a ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' article, which led to islanders donating coloured china; the Lieutenant-Governor of the island offered [[mother of pearl]], and other gifts came from around the globe.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thelittlechapel.org/history.asp | title=History | publisher=The Little Chapel | accessdate=30 June 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020924235623/http://www.thelittlechapel.org/history.asp | archivedate=24 September 2002 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic style is "''pique-assiette''" or "''Picassiette''" (a French term based on a pun blending ''pique-assiette'' – literally, plate-pincher, the sort of person crashing into a party to enjoy a free meal – and famous artist [[Pablo Picasso]]). According to Mosaic Art Source, "[P]ieces of broken pottery, china, glass, buttons, figurines, and/[or] jewelry are cemented onto a base to create a new surface. Almost any form can be used as a base, and any combination of pieces can be applied, restricted only by the individual creator's imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosaicartsource.com/mosaicart/mosaic_art_resource/mosaic_glossary.html#p |title=Glossary: ''pique assiette'' |publisher=mosaicartsource.com |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031235758/http://mosaicartsource.com/mosaicart/mosaic_art_resource/mosaic_glossary.html |archive-date=31 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was the nickname of a French ''[[Outsider art|Art Brut]]'' artist, Raymond Isidore, who decorated his house near [[Chartres]], known as Maison Picassiette,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartres-tourisme.com/node/234|website=office du tourisme de Chartres|title=Maison Picassiette|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; much in the same style as the Little Chapel.

== In media ==
{{Portal|Channel Islands}}
The Little Chapel features in the game ''Guernsey Monopoly'', part of the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board game series, which was released in 2013.&lt;ref name="Monopoly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/news/2013/10/25/guernsey-monopoly-goes-on-sale/ | title=Guernsey Monopoly goes on sale | work=The Guernsey Press | date=25 October 2013 | accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manimekalai''' ({{lang-ta|மணிமேகலை}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pmworks.html ''Manimekalai'' - Original Text in Tamil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/4_drav/tamil/pm/pm141__u.htm ''Manimekalai'' - English transliteration of Tamil original]&lt;/ref&gt; by the poet [[Chithalai Chathanar]], is one of [[The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature]] according to later Tamil literary tradition.&lt;ref name="Muk1"&gt;Mukherjee 1999, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Manimekalai'' is a poem in 30 cantos. Its story is a [[sequel]] to another of the Five Great Epics, ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', and tells the story of the daughter of [[Kovalan]] and [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]], who became a [[Buddhist]] Bikkuni.

==Author and period of composition==
There is some controversy about the exact date of this work. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar believed it must have been composed before the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rao Bahadur Krishnaswāmi Aiyangar, ''Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting'', London, 1928, p.185, 201, etc.. Available at www.archive.org [https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2018}} Paula Richman believes it was composed in the 6th century CE.&lt;ref name="Paula Richman 2003, pp.458"&gt;Paula Richman, ”Cīttalai Cāttanār, Manimekhalai”  summary in Karl H. Potter ed.,''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Buddhist philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.''  New Delhi, 2003, pp.458.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hikosaka (1989), Manimekalai was written between A.D. 890 and 950, an inference based on linguistic assessment.

The aim of the author, [[Chithalai Chathanar|Seethalai Saathanar]] (or Cīttalai Cāttanār) was to compare Buddhism favourably with the other prevailing religions in South India in order to propagate Buddhism. He criticizes and exposes the weaknesses of the other contemporary Indian religions, while praising the Buddha's Teaching, the [[Dharma]], as the most perfect religion.

==The Epic==
As a continuation of [[Silappatikaram]] ({{lang-ta|சிலப்பதிகாரம்}}), this epic describes how Manimekalai, the beautiful daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, follower of local deities later included in [[Hinduism in Tamil Nadu|Hinduism]], converted to Buddhism. According to the poem, Maṇimekalai studies the six systems of philosophy of Hinduism and other prevalent religions of the time and compares them to the teachings of the Buddha. She is most impressed with Buddhism which treats everyone equal with loving kindness and fraternity. Later, upon hearing doctrinal expositions from the Buddhist teacher [[Bhikshu]] Aravaṇa Aḍigal, she becomes a dedicated [[Bhikshuni]] or [[Buddhist nun]]. Manimekhalai fully practices the Buddha's teachings and attains the highest stage of Buddhist spiritual knowledge or attainment, i.e. she became an [[arhant]]. The Manimekhalai poem thus is an example of female spiritual empowerment within a culture wherein otherwise there were few options for women. Pandit [[Iyothee Thass]] (1845-1914) revealed more about Manimekalai as "Arachchelvi" (Female [[Arhant]]) and documented some original poems written by Seeththalai Saththanar, which are not available in the Manimekalai as edited by [[U.V. Swaminatha Iyer]] who allegedly left out some of the original poems.
  
The epic gives much information on the history of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Buddhism]] and its place during that period, contemporary arts and culture, and the customs of the times. The exposition of the Buddhist doctrine in the poem deals elegantly with the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''ārya-satyāni''), [[Dependent Origination]] (''pratītyasamutpāda''), mind (citra) and Buddhist practices like virtue (''[[Śīla]]'') and non-violence (''[[ahimsa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Rao Bahadur Krishnaswāmi Aiyangar, ''Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting'', London, 1928, p.185, 201, etc.. Available at www.archive.org [https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paula Richman, ”Cīttalai Cāttanār, Manimekhalai”  summary in Karl H. Potter ed.,''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Buddhist philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.''  New Delhi, 2003, pp.457–462.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting===
The poem is set in both the harbour town of Kāveripattinam, the modern town of [[Poompuhar]] in Tamil Nadu, and in [[Nainatheevu]] of Nāga Nadu, a small sandy island of the [[Jaffna Peninsula]] in modern [[Sri Lanka]]. The story runs as follows: The dancer-courtesan Manimekalai is pursued by the amorous Cholan prince Udayakumāran, but rather wants to dedicate herself to a religious celibate life. The sea goddess Manimekala Theivam or Maṇimekhalā Devī puts her to sleep and takes to the island Maṇipallavam (Nainatheevu). After waking up and wandering about the island Maṇimekalai comes across the Dharma-seat, the seat on which Buddha had taught and appeased two warring [[Nāga|Naga]] princes, which was placed there by the God [[Indra]]. Those who worship it miraculously know their previous life. Manimekalai automatically worships it and recollects what had happened in her previous life. 

She then meets the guardian goddess of the Dharma seat, Deeva-Teelakai (Dvīpa Tilakā) who explains to her the significance of the Dharma seat and lets her acquire the magic never-failing begging bowl ([[cornucopia]]) called Amṛta Surabhi (”cow of abundance”), which will always provide food to alleviate hunger. The goddess also predicts that Bhikshu Aravaṇa Aḍigal in her native town will teach her more. Manimekalai then used the mantra which the sea goddess had given her and returns to Kāveripaṭṭinam, where she meets the Bhikshu Aravaṇa Aḍigal, who expounds her the Buddha's Teaching and advises her about the nature of life. She then becomes a Buddhist nun or [[Bhikshuni]] and practices to rid herself from the bondage of birth and death and attain [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvāṇa]].&lt;ref&gt;Hisselle Dhammaratana, ''Buddhism in South India'', Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, 1964.

===Notable characters===
*'''Manimekalai''' - The daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi, who was born with bravery and virtues.
*'''Udayakumaran''' - The Chola King, who was madly in love with Manimekalai. He was a foolish king, who wanted things done only in the way he wanted them to be. 
*'''Sudhamati''' - Manimekalai's most faithful and trustworthy friend.
*'''Manimekalā''' - The sea goddess who protects the heroine.
*'''Deeva Teelakai''' - Guardian Goddess of the Dharma seat. She was born in the town of Puhar and got married to a merchant. Her husband once traveled to trade. Even after so many days he didn't return. Feared and worried that her husband might have died she tries to give away her life. (Not by suicide but by doing "sathiya paritchai" i.e. praying to God to take away her life due to the death of her husband). Suddenly she hears a voice from the sky which says that her husband is alive and he will come back. But Deeva Teelakai expresses her disinterest in a family life and her interest in spirituality. She then gets the Amirta Surabhi and was also guided by the voice to travel to the Dharma seat and protect it until she meets her destiny.

===Disappearance of Kāveripaṭṭinam or Puhār===
The poem relates that the town Kāveripattinam or [[Puhar|Puhār]] was swallowed up by the sea (i.e. destroyed by a [[tsunami]] or flood) due to the Cholan King not holding the annual [[Indra]] festival and thereby causing the wrath of the sea goddess Manimekalā. This account is supported by archaeological finds of submerged ruins off the coast of modern Poompuhar.&lt;ref&gt;Gaur A. S. and Sundaresh, ''Underwater Exploration off Poompuhar and possible causes of its Submergence'', 1998, ''Puratattva'', 28: 84-90.

Available online at [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6826956/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist School Affiliation==
The work contains no direct references to [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] as propagated by [[Nagarjuna]], etc., and appears to be a work of an [[Early Buddhist schools|early Buddhist]], [[Sravakayana]] school such as the [[Sthavira]] or [[Sautrantika]] school. The emphasis on "the path of the Pitakas of the Great One" (i.e. [[Tipitaka]]) and the exposition of Dependent Origination, etc., in Chapter 30, could suggest that it is work of the Sautrantika school.&lt;ref&gt;Rao Bahadur Krishnaswāmi Aiyangar, ''Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting'', London, 1928, p.xxvii, p. 85, 104, 188. Available at www.archive.org [https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp]&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.K. Warder]] instead suggests that the poem may be affiliated with the Theravada school.

In the conclusion of the poem, Aravaṇa Aḍigal encourages full liberation from the three roots of evil—greed, hatred and delusion (''[[Rāga (Buddhism)|rāga]], [[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dosa]], [[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]''). The final sentence of the poem states that Maṇimekhalai strove to rid herself of the bondage of birth. This emphasis on liberation  from the defilements (''[[kilesa]]''), ending the cycle of  birth, old age and death (''[[samsara]]''), and becoming an [[arahant]], also suggests that the author of the poem was affiliated to an early Sravakayana Buddhist school.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyangar p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aiyangar (p.&amp;nbsp;80) suggests that the [[Buddhist logic]] as expounded by Aravaṇa Aḍigal in Chapter 29 of the ''Maṇimekhalai'' antedates the logic of [[Dignāga]] and his school.

==Survival of Text==
The Manimekhalai is the only extant Tamil Buddhist literary work of what once was an extensive literature. The reason for its survival is probably its status as the sequel to the ''Silapathikaram'' or ''Sīlappadhikāram''.&lt;ref name="Paula Richman 2003, pp.458"/&gt;  
Tamil Nadu produced many Buddhist teachers who made valuable contributions to Tamil, Pali and Sanskrit literature. Reference to their works is found in Tamil literature and other historical records.

Lost Tamil Buddhist works are the poem ''Kuṇḍalakesī'' by Nāgaguttanār, the grammar ''Vīrasoliyam'', the Abhidhamma work ''Siddhāntattokai'', the panegyric ''Tiruppadigam'', and the biography ''Bimbisāra Kadai''.&lt;ref name="Buddhism in South India"&gt;Hisselle Dhammaratana, ''Buddhism in South India'', Kandy, 1964. Available online at Buddhist Publication Society Online Library [http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh124-u.html#Appendix ''Buddhism in South India''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
The first translation of ''Manimekalai'' by R. B. K. Aiyangar, was published in ''Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting''.&lt;ref&gt;Rao Bahadur Krishnaswāmi Aiyangar, ''Maṇimekhalai in its Historical Setting'', London, 1928. Available at www.archive.org [https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp]&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts of this were republished in Hisselle Dhammaratana's ''Buddhism in South India'' &lt;ref name="Buddhism in South India"/&gt; A more recent translation of the poem was done by Alain Daniélou with the collaboration of T.V. Gopala Iyer.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Daniélou &amp; Iyer, ''Manimekhalai: the Dancer with the Magic Bowl by Shattan'', New York, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Japanese translation by [[Shuzo Matsunaga]], published in 1991.

==Publishing in modern times==
[[File:Tamil palm-leaf manuscript of Ciṟupañcamūlam 2.jpg|thumb|800px|center|A palm leaf manuscript with ancient Tamil text.]]
[[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]] (1855-1942 CE) resurrected the first three epics of Tamil literature from appalling neglect and wanton destruction of centuries.&lt;ref name="Lal"&gt;Lal 2001, pp. 4255-4256&lt;/ref&gt; He reprinted this literature present in the palm leaf form to paper books.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. 1994, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramaswami Mudaliar, a Tamil scholar first gave him the palm leaves of ''Civaka Cintamani'' to study.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;  Being the first time, Swaminatha Iyer had to face a lot of difficulties in terms of interpreting, finding the missing leaves, textual errors and unfamiliar terms.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;  He went for tiring journeys to remote villages in search of the missing manuscripts.  After years of toil, he published ''Civaka Cintamani'' in book form in 1887 CE followed by ''Silapadikaram'' in 1892 CE and ''Manimekalai'' in 1898 CE.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;  Along with the text, he added a lot of commentary and explanatory notes of terms, textual variations and approaches explaining the context.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;

==Criticism and Comparison==
To some critics, ''Manimekalai'' is more interesting than ''Silappadikaram'', but in terms of literary evaluation, it seems inferior.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;Zvelebil 1974, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Manimekalai with all its superficial elements seems to be of lesser interest to the author himself whose aim was pointed toward spreading Buddhism.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;  In the former, ethics and religious doctrine are central, while in the latter poetry and storyline dominate. ''Manimekalai'' also criticizes [[Hinduism]] while preaching the ideals of Buddhism as it downplays human interests in favor of supernatural features. The narration in ''akaval'' meter moves on in ''Manimekalai'' without the relief of any lyric, which are the main features of ''Silappadikaram''.&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil 1974, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Manimekalai'' in puritan terms is not an epic poem, but a grave disquisition on philosophy.&lt;ref name="cal"/&gt; There are effusions in the form of a song or a dance, which style may not go well with western audiences as they are assessed to be inspired on the spur of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;Paniker 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Calcutta review, the three epics on the whole have no plot and no characterization for an epic genre.&lt;ref name="cal"/&gt;  The plot of ''Civaka Cintamani'' is monotonous and deficient in variety in strength and character and does not stand the quality of an epic.&lt;ref name="cal"&gt;University of Calcutta 1906, pp. 426-427&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish community of [[Mashhad]]''', Iran formed in the 1740s, when [[Nadir Shah Afshar]] called for the relocation of forty Jewish families from [[Qazvin]] and Dilaman to [[Kalat, Khorasan|Kalat]].  Circumstances ultimately led these families to settle in Mashhad.  Known for their integrity and loyalty, these trusted Jewish families were selected to protect Nadir Shah’s treasures and jewels, spoils which he had taken from his Indian invasion.  He did not live long enough to witness the implementation of his proclamation.

==Background==
Mashhadi Jews living in the current Iranian diaspora remain steadfast in their community ties.  Religion, community, and nationality are key components forming the identity of the Mashhadi Jewish community. Similar to many of their Jewish brethren, the Jews of Mashhad gravitated towards professions that allowed their trade skills to flourish.  They were avid merchants, navigating the ancient [[Silk Road]].  Mashhadi Jews were held with the highest regard by [[Sunni]] Turkmen and [[Shiite]] Mashhadi tradesmen, because of their reputation for honorable and ethical business practices.  The perils of travel subjected Mashhadi traders to freezing temperatures, murderous bandits, and limited means of transportation.

Due to their occupations and the arduous conditions involved in their travels, Mashhadi men adopted a lifestyle which required spending several months to years on the road without their families.  Modern Mashhadi men continue their forefathers’ unique tradition of working as traveling merchants to support their families.  Mashhadi women have likewise upheld their matriarchal tradition of creating family and community cohesiveness by nurturing home, family, and community relationships.  Unlike their female predecessors, modern Mashhadi women are exemplary businesswomen, who are heirs to the savvy trade skills of their ancestors.

==History==
The pivotal historic event that transformed an undefined group of Iranian Jews into an unfaltering community was the [[Allahdad]] (means “God’s Justice”) of 1839.  Building social tensions and resentment and suspicion by Shiite Muslims of the Jewish inhabitants of Mashhad's Eydgah ghetto, culminated in an explosive event.  A [[blood libel]] on the commemoration day of a holy Muslim Imam led to a devastating pogrom.  On the eve of Mashhad's Allahdad (March 27, 1839), an estimated thirty-six Jews were killed and approximately seven Jewish girls were abducted to become Muslim child brides.  Within the next twenty-four hours, under the risk of death, approximately three hundred Jewish families made the pretense of converting to Islam, under the advisement of their community leaders. The term Allahdad was coined by the forced converts to relate their past sins with the calamity they were enduring.

Following the forced conversions, a number of Jewish families, unable to sustain the facade of Muslim faith, escaped to Herat, Afghanistan.  Later on, from Afghanistan to Sub-Continent (Pakistan). Very few Mashhadi converts permanently assimilated to Islam.  It is estimated that the remaining community members proceeded to live dual lives as crypto-Jews through the 1920s.  During this time, the Jadid-al-Islam (a term meaning “New Muslims”) boasted of two known Sheikhs, fifty-seven known [[Hajji]]s, and twenty-one known Karbalais while preserving their secret Jewish identities. Their ties to the Islamic religion were complex at times.

Mashhadi families gradually migrated to [[Merv|Marv]] and surrounding areas of Czarist Turkmenistan, in an effort to escape persecution in Mashhad and look for better business opportunities in pre-communist Russia.  The seemingly stable social and trade environment of Russia did not benefit them for long.  In the fall of 1917, the Russian revolution caused the first return of Mashhadi Jews, from Marv to Mashhad.  Mashhadis who remained in Russia, fell prey to Stalin's “purge of petit bourgeoisie” and some members of the community were imprisoned.  In 1925, Reza Shah made an agreement with Stalin to exchange Iranian and Russian nationals.  The imprisoned Mashhadis were released to return home, once again.  A second blood libel in 1946 led the disenchanted community's gradual relocation to the tolerant cities of Tehran and Jerusalem, joining the few Mashhadi families who already resided there.

Within an eighty-year span, the Mashhadi community migrated at least five times to avoid persecution.  Throughout this short period they migrated from Mashhad to Herat, Mashhad to Russia and back, Mashhad to Jerusalem and Tehran, ultimately fleeing during the Iranian Revolution of 1979.  Mashhadi communities now exist in Israel, New York, Milan, Hamburg, London and Pakistan. In Pakistan, Mashhadi families are Muslims. Some of them are Shia and some of them are Sunnis.

Mashhadi youth have assumed their predecessors' ethos of primarily socializing and marrying within their community.  This once necessary survival mechanism has transitioned to a comfortable modus operandi for today's Mashhadis.  Many praise the modern Mashhadi community for their sense of unity, while some question their insular lifestyle.  All perspectives undeniably credit the Mashhadi community for their fervor in upholding their Jewish heritage and traditions.

The resounding conclusion of the Mashhadi story is one that reflects their ability to protect their inherent Jewish religion. The unusual survival method of the Mashhadi crypto-Jews laid the foundation for a modern Mashhadi community who now safely and proudly practice Judaism.

==Timeline of Jews of Mashhad==

Iranian Jews are considered to be the descendants of the Assyrian 722 B.C. and Babylonian Exiles 586 B.C.  Within this diaspora, a smaller tribe of Jews evolved, due to their geographic setting in the city of Mashhad, and their robust community ties. 
 
*1650 – Safavid dynasty ruling in Iran calls to convert or kill all Iranian Jews
*1739 – Nadir Shah of the Afsharid dynasty invades India.
*1740 – Nadir Shah brings spoils back from his Indian invasion, in the form of treasures and jewels.
*1746 – Nadir Shah orders the relocation of forty Jewish families from Qazvin to Khorasan province, for the purpose of guarding his acquired treasures and jewels.  Nadir Shah holds a favorable disposition towards Jews.
*1747 – Nadir Shah is assassinated.  Persecution of Iranian Jews resumes.  Seventeen of the forty original families move to Eydgah ghetto, Mashhad.
*1750 – Seven of the original forty families proceed from Sabzavar and settle in Mashhad.
*1755 – Sixteen of the original forty families proceed from Kalat and settle in Mashhad.
*1839 – The Allahdad - the forced conversion of Mashhadi Jews to Islam - March 27, 1839 (12 Nissan 5599/11 Muharram 1255). Mashhadi (Anusim) live dual lives as crypto-Jews, through 1925
*1840 – A number of Jewish families, unable to sustain the facade of Muslim faith, escaped to Herat, Afghanistan
*1886 –	Some Mashhadi Jewish families immigrate to Turkmenistan, Russia, through 1917.
*1890 – Muslim Mashhadi attempts to expose secret Jewish burial proceedings of crypto-Jews.  A potential pogrom is averted.
*1890s – After completing the Hajj, some Mashhadi families make Aliya to Jerusalem, instead of returning from Mecca to Mashhad.
*1901 – Haji Adonya HaCohen builds the first Mashhadi Jewish synagogue in Jerusalem, followed by Haji Yehezkel‘s synagogue, built in 1905.
*1910s – Some Mashhadi Jews move to London	
*1918 – Russian Revolution and start of communism prompts the first wave of Mashhadi Jews to return from Marv to Mashhad.
*1925 –	Reza Shah permits freedom of religious practice in Iran.  Mashhadis begin to practice their Jewish faith openly
*1946 –	Second notable Blood Libel in Mashhad forces the now openly Jewish Mashhadi community to begin a decade-long migration to Tehran and Israel.
*1940s – Some Mashhadi Jews move to United States, well through 1980s
*1948 - The Jewish population of Mashhad is 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jews Community of Mashhad |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/meshed-mashhad |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1950s – Some Mashhadi Jews move to Germany and Italy.
*1979 –	Iranian revolution impels Iranian Jews to flee Iran
*2010 –	Over twenty-thousand Mashhadi Jews now reside in Israel, New York, Milan, Germany, and London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">In [[Judaism]], '''Mishnah Yomis''' ({{lang-he-n|משנה יומית}} "The Daily Study of the [[Mishnah]]") refers to the [[Torah]] study cycle in which two Mishnayos (brief collections of rulings dealing with the Oral Law) are learned every day.

== History ==
Although Jews have been studying the Mishnah ever since it was first compiled about 2000 years ago, this systematic cycle was first established in 1948 by Rabbi [[Yonah Sztencl]]. His goal in creating the Mishnah Yomis cycle was to memorialize the Jews that were killed in [[the Holocaust]], through a global studying of the Mishnah. He also wanted to provide a realistic way for even a simple, working Jew to familiarize himself with the six orders of the Mishnah, upon which the Jewish system of law is based. In just 6 years, anyone can learn the entire set of 4,192 Mishnayos.

== Calendar ==
The previous Mishnah Yomis cycle, the 12th, began on 22 Tamuz 5770 (July 4, 2010). The current cycle began on Wednesday, 20 Adar-B 5776 (March 30, 2016). The current daily sections being studied can be found at [http://dafyomi.co.il/calendars/myomi/todays_mishnah.php dafyomi.co.il/calendars/myomi/todays_mishnah.php] and [http://www.mishnahyomit.com www.mishnahyomit.com], along with recordings and discussion for each. A PDF calendar for the whole current year is found at [http://www.mishnahyomit.com/learnAids/A5%20Calendar%20-%205776.pdf www.mishnahyomit.com].

The term is thought to have been derived from ''myōjin'' (名神 'notable deity'), a title once granted by the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] to ''kami'' deemed to have particularly impressive power and virtue and/or have eminent, well-established shrines and cults.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=15 ''Myōjin'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=260 ''Myōjin taisha'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=17 ''Shingō'']&lt;/ref&gt; This term is first attested in the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'', where offerings from the kingdom of Bohai ([[Balhae]]) are stated to have been offered to "the eminent shrines (名神社 ''myōjin-sha'') in each [[Provinces of Japan|province]]" in the year 730 ([[Tenpyō|Tenpyō 2]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=續日本紀/卷第十 (Shoku Nihongi, vol. 10)|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%BA%8C%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E7%B4%80/%E5%8D%B7%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|「庚戌。遣使奉渤海信物於諸國名神社。」}}

An epithet [[homophone|homophonous]] with this imperially bestowed title, "shining/apparent ''kami''" (written with different [[Chinese characters]]), was in popular usage from around the [[Heian period]] up until the end of the [[Edo period]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakamura|first1=Issei|title=平安期における大明神号の成立とその意義  (The Formation and Significance of the Title Daimyoujin in the Heian Period)|journal=The Bukkyo University Graduate School review.

The leftmost banner (white with blue border and red lettering) carries the inscription ''[[Takeminakata|Suwa Hosshō Kamishimo Daimyōjin]]'' (諏訪法性上下大明神), while on the second banner from right (white with black lettering), flanking the legend ''[[Ise Shrine|Tenshō Kōtaijingū]]'' (天照皇大神宮) are inscribed ''Hachiman daibosatsu'' (八幡大菩薩) and ''[[Kasuga Shrine|Kasuga Daimyōjin]]'' (春日大明神).]]The earliest recorded usages of 'shining/apparent deity' are found in sources such as in the ''Sumiyoshi-taisha Jindaiki''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=住吉大明神大社神代記|url=http://kamnavi.jp/sumiyosi/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (住吉大社神代記, "The [[Sumiyoshi taisha|Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine]]'s Records of the [[Age of the Gods]]", supposedly compiled in the year 731 but thought to actually be of a much later date), which refers to the [[Sumiyoshi sanjin|three Sumiyoshi deities]] as 'Sumiyoshi Daimyōjin' (住吉大明神),&lt;ref name="Nakamura74"&gt;Nakamura (2009), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=日本三代實錄/卷第卌九 (Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku, vol. 49)|url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E4%B8%89%E4%BB%A3%E5%AF%A6%E9%8C%84/%E5%8D%B7%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%8C%E4%B9%9D}}&lt;/ref&gt; (completed in 901), which refers to '[[Matsunoo-taisha|Matsuo Daimyōjin]]' (松尾大明神).

While at first this title did not yet seem to have the Buddhist connotations that would later be associated with it, the connection between ''daimyōjin'' with the concept of ''[[honji suijaku]]'' (i.e. that the native ''kami'' are actually manifestations of Buddhist deities) was reinforced by an apocryphal utterance of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] often claimed to be derived from the ''Karuṇāpuṇḍarīka-sūtra'' (悲華經 "Compassionate Lotus [[Sutra]]"; Japanese: ''Hikekyō'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=悲華經 (北涼 曇無讖譯)|url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/T03n0157|website=CBETA 漢文大藏經}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compassionate Lotus Sutra (Taisho 0157)|url=http://www.ydsnrs.com/zjg/qita/world/0157.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoted and alluded to in various medieval works, but which is not in the actual sutra's text: "After I have [[Parinirvana|passed into ''nirvana'']], during the [[Three Ages of Buddhism#Latter Day of the Law|Latter Day of the Law]], I shall appear as a great shining/apparent deity (大明神) and save all sentient beings."{{efn|「我滅度後、於末法中、現大明神、広度衆生。」}}&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura (2009), pp. 82-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the early modern period, use of titles such as ''myōjin'' or ''gongen'' for many deities and their shrines were so widespread that these gods were rarely referred to by their proper names.&lt;ref name="Nakamura74" /&gt; For instance, both [[Takemikazuchi|the god]] of [[Kashima Shrine]] and the shrine itself were known as 'Kashima Daimyōjin' (鹿島大明神); [[Takeminakata|the deity]] enshrined in [[Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]] was called 'Suwa Daimyōjin' (諏訪(大)明神), and so on. (cf. [[Hachiman|Hachiman-daibosatsu]] (八幡大菩薩) or [[Kumano shrine|Kumano Gongen]] (熊野権現)). After his death, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] was deified under the name '[[Toyokuni Shrine (Kyoto)|Toyokuni Daimyōjin]]' (豊国大明神).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nomura|first1=Gen|title=豊国大明神号の創出過程に関する一考察 (On the deification of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as Toyokuni Daimyojin)|journal=Shigaku zasshi|date=2012-11-20|volume=121|issue=11|pages=1878-1900|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110009562128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lillehoj|first1=Elizabeth (ed.)|title=Art and Palace Politics in Early Modern Japan, 1580s-1680s|date=2011|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004206120|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TMVF6kpoqkC&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Yoshida Shintō]], the conferral of ranks and titles like ''myōjin'' was institutionalized, with the sect issuing out authorization certificates to shrines for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maeda|first1=Hiromi|title=Court Rank for Village Shrines. The Yoshida House’s Interactions with Local Shrines during the Mid-Tokugawa Period|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=2002|volume=29|issue=3/4|pages=325-358|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2785}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=372 ''Yoshida Shintō'']&lt;/ref&gt; The sect considered the title to be higher than the overtly Buddhist ''gongen'' as part of the sect's [[Honji suijaku#Inversion|inversion of ''honji suijaku'']], an issue which became a point of contention with the Sannō Ichijitsu Shintō (山王一実神道) sect spearheaded by the [[Tendai]] monk [[Tenkai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sugahara|first1=Shinkai|title=The Distinctive Features of Sannō Ichijitsu Shinto|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=1996|volume=23|issue=1/2|pages=61-84|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2587}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=362 ''Sannō Shintō'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Meiji government officially [[Shinbutsu bunri|separated Shinto from Buddhism]], official use of titles and terminology perceived as having Buddhist connotations such as ''(dai)myōjin'', ''(dai)gongen'' or ''daibosatsu'' by shrines were legally abolished and discouraged. However, a few deities/shrines are still often referred to as ''(dai)myōjin'' in popular usage even today. (E.g. [[Kanda Shrine|Kanda Myōjin]] in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo]], enshrining the deified [[Onryō|vengeful spirit]] of [[Taira no Masakado]]).

She is principally a [[fertility goddess]]. Temple hymn sources identify her as the "true and great lady of heaven" (possibly in relation to her standing on the mountain) and kings of Sumer were "nourished by Ninhursag's milk". Sometimes her hair is depicted in an [[omega]] shape and at times she wears a horned head-dress and tiered skirt, often with bow cases at her shoulders. Frequently she carries a mace or baton surmounted by an omega motif or a derivation, sometimes accompanied by a lion cub on a leash. She is the [[tutelary deity]] to several Sumerian leaders.

==Names==
{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}
Nin-hursag means "lady of the sacred mountain" (from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[EREŠ|NIN]] "lady" and ḪAR.SAG  "sacred mountain, foothill",&lt;ref name=Dalley326&gt;{{cite book |title= Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others|last=Dalley |first= Stephanie |authorlink= Stephanie Dalley |page=326 |year= 1998|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn=978-0-19-283589-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly a reference to the site of her temple, the E-Kur (House of mountain deeps) at [[Eridu]]. She had many names including '''Ninmah''' ("Great Queen");&lt;ref name=Dalley326/&gt; '''[[Mami (goddess)|Nintu]]''' ("Lady of Birth");&lt;ref name=Dalley326/&gt; '''[[Mami (goddess)|Mamma]]''' or '''[[Mami (goddess)|Mami]]''' (mother);&lt;ref name=Dalley326/&gt; '''Aruru''',&lt;ref name=Dalley326/&gt; '''[[Belet-Ili]]''' (lady of the gods, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]])&lt;ref name=Dalley326/&gt;

According to legend, her name was changed from Ninmah to Ninhursag by her son [[Ninurta]] in order to commemorate his creation of the mountains. As Ninmenna, according to a Babylonian investiture ritual, she placed the golden crown on the king in the ''Eanna'' temple.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some of the names above were once associated with independent goddesses (such as [[Ninmah]] and Ninmenna), who later became identified and merged with Ninhursag, and myths exist in which the name Ninhursag is not mentioned.

Possibly included among the original mother goddesses was '''Damgalnuna''' (great wife of the prince) or '''Damkina''' (true wife), the consort of the god Enki.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy A. Black, Anthony Green, Tessa Rickards, ''Gods, demons, and symbols of ancient Mesopotamia: an illustrated dictionary'' (1992), p. 56f. &amp; 75&lt;/ref&gt; 
The mother goddess had many epithets including ''shassuru'' or 'womb goddess', ''tabsut ili'' 'midwife of the gods', 'mother of all children' and 'mother of the gods'.  In this role she is identified with '''[[Ki (goddess)|Ki]]''' in the [[Enuma Elish]].  She had shrines in both Eridu and Kish.

==Mythology==
In the legend of [[Enki]] and Ninhursag, Ninhursag bore a daughter to Enki called [[Ninsar]] ("Lady Greenery"). Through Enki, Ninsar bore a daughter [[Ninkurra]]. Ninkurra, in turn, bore Enki a daughter named [[Uttu]]. Enki then pursued Uttu, who was upset because he didn't care for her. Uttu, on her ancestress Ninhursag's advice buried Enki's seed in the earth, whereupon eight plants (the very first) sprung up. Enki, seeing the plants, ate them, and became ill in eight organs of his body. Ninhursag cured him, taking the plants into her body and giving birth to eight deities: [[Abu (god)|Abu]], [[Nintulla]] (Nintul), [[Ninsutu]], [[Ninkasi]], [[Nanshe]] (Nazi), [[Azimua]], [[Ninti]], and [[Enshag]] (Enshagag).

In the text 'Creator of the Hoe', she completed the birth of mankind after the heads had been uncovered by Enki's hoe.

In creation texts, Ninmah (another name for Ninhursag) acts as a midwife whilst the mother goddess [[Nammu]] makes different kinds of human individuals from lumps of clay at a feast given by Enki to celebrate the creation of humankind.

==Worship==
Her symbol, resembling the Greek letter ''omega'' [[Ω]], has been depicted in art from approximately [[3000 BC]], although more generally from the early [[second millennium BC]]. It appears on some [[boundary stone]]s—on the upper tier, indicating her importance. The omega symbol is associated with the Egyptian cow goddess [[Hathor]], and may represent a stylized womb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matrifocus.com/LAM06/spotlight.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol appears on very early imagery from Ancient Egypt. Hathor is at times depicted on a mountain, so it may be that the two goddesses are connected.

Her temple, the [[Esagila]] (from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[É (temple)|E]] (temple) + SAG (head) + ILA (lofty)) was located on the [[KUR]] of [[Eridu]], although she also had a temple at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].

'''Panentheism''' (meaning "all-in-God", from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πᾶν}} ''pân'', "all", {{lang|grc|ἐν}} ''en'', "in" and {{lang|grc|Θεός}} ''Theós'', "God")&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; is the [[belief]] that the [[Divinity|divine]] pervades and [[wikt:interpenetration|interpenetrates]] every part of [[Universe|the universe]] and also extends beyond time and space. The term was coined by the German philosopher [[Karl Krause]] in 1828 to distinguish the ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;John Culp (2013): [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panentheism “Panentheism”], in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Retrieved 18 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[pantheism]], which holds that the divine and the universe are [[Identity (philosophy)|identical]],&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch, Bromiley, Barrett 1999"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sCY4sAjTGIYC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity |publisher=William B.

Barrett| volume=4 |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-2416-1 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; panentheism maintains an [[Ontology|ontological]] distinction between the divine and the [[secular|non-divine]] and the significance of both.

*In panentheism, God is viewed as the [[soul]] of the universe, the universal [[spirit]] present everywhere, which at the same time "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]]" all things created.
*While pantheism asserts that "all is God", panentheism claims that God is greater than the universe. Some versions of panentheism suggest that the universe is nothing more than the manifestation of God. In addition, some forms indicate that the [[universe]] is contained within God,&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch, Bromiley, Barrett 1999"/&gt; like in the [[Kabbalah]] concept of [[tzimtzum]]. Also much [[Hindu thought]]&amp;nbsp;– and consequently [[Buddhist philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is highly characterized by panentheism and [[pantheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441533/pantheism/38168/Pantheism-and-panentheism-in-non-Western-cultures “Pantheism and Panentheism in non-Western cultures”], in: ''Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Robert.

Stanley Thomes, London 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;viii. {{ISBN|0-7487-0586-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic tradition however, on which Krause's concept was built, seems to have been [[Neoplatonic philosophy]] and its successors in [[Western philosophy]] and [[Orthodox theology]].

== In philosophy ==
=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===
The religious beliefs of [[Neoplatonism]] can be regarded as panentheistic. [[Plotinus]] taught that there was an ineffable transcendent God ("[[Henology|the One]]", ''to En'', τὸ Ἕν) of which subsequent realities were emanations. From "the One" emanates the Divine Mind (''[[Nous]]'', Νοῦς) and the Cosmic Soul (''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'', Ψυχή). In Neoplatonism the world itself is God (according to [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] 37). This concept of divinity is associated with that of the ''[[Logos]]'' (Λόγος), which had originated centuries earlier with [[Heraclitus]] (c. 535–475 BC). The ''Logos'' pervades the [[cosmos]], whereby all thoughts and all things originate, or as Heraclitus said: "He who hears not me but the Logos will say: All is one." Neoplatonists such as [[Iamblichus]] attempted to reconcile this perspective by adding another [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] above the original monad of force or ''[[Dunamis]]'' (Δύναμις). This new all-pervasive monad encompassed all creation and its original uncreated emanations.

=== Modern philosophy ===

[[Baruch Spinoza]] later claimed that "Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', part I, prop. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; "Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner."&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', part I, prop. 25S.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Spinoza has been called the "prophet"&lt;ref&gt;Picton, J. Allanson, "Pantheism: Its Story and Significance", 1905.&lt;/ref&gt; and "prince"&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Alexander Campbell, "Philosophy of Theism", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[pantheism]], in a letter to [[Henry Oldenburg]] Spinoza states that: "as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;''Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza'', Wilder Publications, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-60459-156-9}}, letter 73.&lt;/ref&gt; For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under two attributes of [[Thought]] and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other [[Attributes of God|attributes]] which are not present in our world.

According to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote "Deus sive Natura" (God or Nature) Spinoza did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's [[immanence]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jaspers, ''Spinoza ''(''Great Philosophers''), Harvest Books, 1974, {{ISBN|978-0-15-684730-8}}, pp. 14 and 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term "panentheism", rather than "pantheism" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, "in" God. Yet, American philosopher and self-described panentheist [[Charles Hartshorne]] referred to Spinoza's philosophy as "[[classical pantheism]]" and distinguished Spinoza's philosophy from panentheism.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, ''Philosophers Speak of God,'' Humanity Books, 1953, ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1828, the German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) seeking to reconcile [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]], coined the term ''panentheism'' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] expression πᾶν ἐν θεῷ, ''pān en theṓ'', literally "all in god"). This conception of God influenced New England [[transcendentalists]] such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The term was popularized by [[Charles Hartshorne]] in his development of [[process theology]] and has also been closely identified with the [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=David L.|title=Theologies of the 21st Century: Trends in Contemporary Theology|date=2014|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene OR|isbn=1625648642|page=228|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zFYNBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=new%20thought%20panentheism&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formalization of this term in the West in the 19th century was not new; philosophical treatises had been written on it in the context of [[Hinduism]] for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Southgate|first1=Christopher|title=God, Humanity and the Cosmos: A Companion to the Science-Religion Debate|date=2005|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=London|isbn=0567030164|pages=246–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmGvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=panentheism+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwB2oVChMIjvGuia6dyAIVii-ICh25JAZc#v=onepage&amp;q=panentheism%20hinduism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers who embraced panentheism have included [[Thomas Hill Green]] (1839–1882), [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] (1843–1925), [[Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison]] (1856–1931) and [[Samuel Alexander]] (1859–1938).&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper ''Panentheism, the other God of the philosophers: from Plato to the present'' Baker Academic, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8010-2724-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1940s, Hartshorne examined numerous conceptions of God. He reviewed and discarded pantheism, [[deism]], and [[pandeism]] in favor of panentheism, finding that such a "doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations". Hartshorne formulated God as a being who could become "more perfect": He has absolute perfection in categories for which absolute perfection is possible, and relative perfection (i.&amp;nbsp;e., is superior to all others) in categories for which perfection cannot be precisely determined.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, ''Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism'' (1964) {{ISBN|0-208-00498-X}} p. 348; cf.

=== Hinduism ===
Earliest reference to panentheistic thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] is in a creation myth contained in the later section of [[Rig Veda]] called the [[Purusha Sukta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nigal|first1=Sahebrao Genu|title=Vedic Philosophy of Values|date=2009|publisher=Northern Book Centre|location=New Delhi|isbn=8172112807|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOIaShWLz3EC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=purusha+sukta+panentheism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XrrkiLt9ag&amp;sig=X6RiWvcr8O2cSMJOms2TIHKXI2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBGoVChMIhbf3lY6gyAIVCooNCh3PGQ68#v=onepage&amp;q=purusha%20sukta%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was compiled before 1100 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Oberlies (1998:155) gives an estimate of 1100 BC for the youngest hymns in book 10.

Panentheism is also expressed in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name="Southgate"/&gt; In verse IX.4, [[Krishna]] states: {{Quote|By Me all this universe is pervaded through My unmanifested form.&lt;br/&gt; All beings abide in Me but I do not abide in them.}}

Many schools of Hindu thought espouse [[monistic theism]], which is thought to be similar to a panentheistic viewpoint. [[Nimbarka]]'s school of differential monism ([[Dvaitadvaita]]), [[Ramanuja]]'s school of qualified monism ([[Vishistadvaita]]) and [[Saiva Siddhanta]] and Kashmir Shaivism are all considered to be panentheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Sherma, Rita DasGupta; Sharma Arvind.

She is the primordial energy that holds all creation and destruction, all cycles of birth and death, all laws of cause and effect within Herself, and yet is greater than the sum total of all these. She is transcendent, but becomes immanent as the cosmos (Mula Prakriti). She, the Primordial Energy, directly becomes Matter.

=== Taoism ===
Taoism says that all is part of the eternal [[tao]], and that all interact through [[qi]].

=== Buddhism ===
The Reverend Zen Master [[Soyen Shaku]] was the first Zen Buddhist Abbot to tour the United States in 1905–6. He wrote a series of essays collected into the book ''Zen For Americans''.  In the essay titled "The God Conception of Buddhism" he attempts to explain how a Buddhist looks at the ultimate without an anthropomorphic God figure while still being able to relate to the term God in a Buddhist sense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, "panentheism," according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Zen For Americans'' by Soyen Shaku, translated by Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, 1906, pages 25–26. http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zfa/zfa04.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The essay then goes on to explain first utilizing the term "God" for the American audience to get an initial understanding of what he means by "panentheism," and then discusses the terms that Buddhism uses in place of "God" such as [[Dharmakaya]], [[Buddha]] or [[AdiBuddha]], and [[Tathagata]].

=== Christianity ===
Panentheism is also a feature of some Christian [[philosophical theology|philosophical theologies]] and resonates strongly within the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theological tradition]] of the [[Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Nesteruk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nesteruk|first1=Alexei V.|title="The Universe as Hypostaic Inherence in the logos of God: Panentheism in the Eastern Orthodox Perspective", in In Whom We Live and Move and Have Our Being: Panentheistic Reflections on God's Presence in a Scientific World, edited by Philip Clayton and Arthur Robert Peacocke|date=2004|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0802809780|pages=169–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N123ZrSR2b0C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Orthodox+christianity+panentheism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUrf_xm4HaAhUMSK0KHSW3BAUQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Orthodox%20christianity%20panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in [[process theology]]. Process theological thinkers are generally regarded in the [[Christian West]] as unorthodox. Furthermore, [[process philosophy|process philosophical]] thought is widely believed to have paved the way for [[open theism]], a movement that tends to associate itself primarily with the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] branch of [[Protestantism]], but is also generally considered unorthodox by most Evangelicals.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
{{See also|Omnipresence}}

In [[Christianity]], creation is not considered a literal "part of" God, and divinity is essentially distinct from creation (i.e., [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]). There is, in other words, an irradicable difference between the uncreated (i.&amp;nbsp;e., God) and the created (i.&amp;nbsp;e., everything else). This does not mean, however, that the creation is wholly separated from God, because the creation exists in and from the [[Energies of God|divine energies]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], these energies or operations are the natural activity of God and are in some sense identifiable with God, but at the same time the creation is wholly distinct from the divine essence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} God creates the universe by His will and from His energies. It is, however, not an imprint or emanation of God's own essence (''[[ousia]]''), the essence He shares pre-eternally with [[Holy Trinity|His Word and Holy Spirit]]. Neither is it a directly literal outworking or effulgence of the divine, nor any other process which implies that creation is essentially God or a necessary part of God. The use of the term "panentheism" to describe the divine concept in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian theology]] is problematic for those who would insist that panentheism requires creation to be "part of" God.

God is not merely Creator of the universe, as His dynamic presence is necessary to sustain the existence of every created thing, small and great, visible and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;St. Symeon in Practical &amp; Theological Discourses, 1.1: “When men search for God with their bodily eyes they find Him nowhere, for He is invisible. But for those who ponder in the Spirit He is present everywhere. He is in all, yet beyond all.”&lt;/ref&gt; That is, God's [[Energies of God|energies]] maintain the existence of the created order and all created beings, even if those agencies have explicitly rejected him. His love for creation is such that He will not withdraw His presence, which would be the ultimate form of [[annihilation]], not merely imposing death, but ending existence altogether. By this token, the entirety of creation is fundamentally "good" in its very being, and is not innately [[problem of evil|evil]] either in whole or in part. This does not deny the existence of spiritual or moral evil in a [[The Fall of Man|fallen]] universe, only the claim that it is an intrinsic property of creation. Sin results from the [[metaphysical libertarianism|essential freedom]] of creatures to operate outside the divine order, not as a ''necessary'' consequence of having inherited human nature.

==== Panentheism in other Christian confessions ====
Many Christians who believe in [[universalism (Christianity)|universalism]]&amp;nbsp;– mainly expressed in the [[Universalist Church of America]], originating, as a fusion of [[Pietist]] and [[Anabaptist]] influences, from the American colonies of the 18th century&amp;nbsp;– hold panentheistic views of God in conjunction with their belief in ''[[apocatastasis]]'', also called [[universal reconciliation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Panentheistic [[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]] often believe that all creation's subsistence in God renders untenable the notion of final and permanent alienation from Him, citing Scriptural passages such as Ephesians 4:6 ("[God] is over all and through all and in all") and Romans 11:36 ("from [God] and through him and to him are all things") to justify both panentheism and universalism.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Panentheism was also a major force in the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] church for a long time, based in part on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s concept of the [[Over-soul]] (from the synonymous essay of 1841).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Panentheistic conceptions of God occur amongst some modern theologians. [[Process theology]] and [[Creation Spirituality]], two recent developments in [[Christian theology]], contain panentheistic ideas. [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000), who conjoined process theology with panentheism, maintained a lifelong membership in the Methodist church but was also a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. In later years he joined the [[Austin, Texas]], [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregation and was an active participant in that church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charleshartshorne.html About Charles Hartshorne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114200326/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charleshartshorne.html |date=2007-11-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the ideas such as Thomas Oord's ‘theocosmocentrism’ (2010), the soft panentheism of open theism, Keith Ward's comparative theology and John Polkinghorne's critical realism (2009), Raymond Potgieter observes distinctions such as dipolar and bipolar:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The former suggests two poles separated such as God influencing creation and it in turn its creator (Bangert 2006:168), whereas bipolarity completes God’s being implying interdependence between temporal and eternal poles. (Marbaniang 2011:133), in dealing with Whitehead’s approach, does not make this distinction. I use the term bipolar as a generic term to include suggestions of the structural definition of God’s transcendence and immanence; to for instance accommodate a present and future reality into which deity must reasonably fit and function, and yet maintain separation from this world and evil whilst remaining within it.&lt;ref&gt;Potgieter, R., 2013, ‘Keith Ward’s soft panentheism’, In die Skriflig/In Luce Verbi 47(1), Art. #581, 9 pages. https://dx.doi.org/10.4102/ ids.v47i1.581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some argue that panentheism should also include the notion that God has always been related to some world or another, which denies the idea of creation out of nothing (''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''). [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] theologian [[Thomas Jay Oord]] (*&amp;nbsp;1965) advocates panentheism, but he uses the word "theocosmocentrism" to highlight the notion that God and some world or another are the primary conceptual starting blocks for eminently fruitful theology. This form of panentheism helps in overcoming the problem of evil and in proposing that God's love for the world is essential to who God is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Vaughn W.|title=Evangelism and the Openness of God: The Implications of Relational Theism|date=2013|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene OR|isbn=9781620320471|pages=242–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2lNAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Church International]] also holds to a panentheist doctrine.

=== Gnosticism ===
{{main|Gnosticism}}

"Gnosticism" is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems prevalent in the first and second century AD. The teachings of the various gnostic groups were very diverse. In his ''Dictionary of Gnosticism'',  Andrew Phillip Smith has written that some branches of Gnosticism taught a panentheistic view of reality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew Phillip|title=A Dictionary of Gnosticism|date=2014|publisher=Quest Books|location=Wheaton IL|isbn=9780835608695|page=186|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1tbBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held to the belief that God exists in the visible world only as sparks of spiritual "light". The goal of human existence is to know the sparks within oneself in order to return to God, who is in the Fullness (or [[Pleroma]]).

Gnosticism was panentheistic, believing that the true God is simultaneously both separate from the physical universe and present within it.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} As Jesus states in the [[Gospel of Thomas]], "I am the light that is over all things. I am all ... . Split a piece of wood; I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', saying 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This seemingly contradictory interpretation of gnostic theology is not without controversy, since one interpretation of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic theology]] holds that a perfect God of pure spirit would not manifest himself through the fallen world of matter.

[[Manichaeism]], being another gnostic sect, preached a very different doctrine in positioning the true Manichaean God against matter as well as other deities, that it described as enmeshed with the world, namely the gods of Jews, Christians and pagans.&lt;ref&gt;“Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the archont of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans (ethnic) are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have (this in store for themselves, namely) to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them (only) according to their own aspirations.” And elsewhere: “Now God has no part in this cosmos nor does he rejoice over it.” ''Classical Texts: Acta Archelai'', p. 76 ([www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf pdf online]). Cf. [http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/d/dualism.html The Mystica an ''Dualism''].&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this dualistic teaching included an elaborate cosmological myth that narrates the defeat of primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[Valentinianism|Valentinian Gnosticism]] taught that matter came about through [[Emanationism|emanations]] of the supreme being, even if to some this event is held to be more accidental than intentional.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} To other gnostics, these emanations were akin to the [[Sephirot]] of the Kabbalists and deliberate manifestations of a transcendent God through a complex system of intermediaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Judaism ===
While mainstream [[Rabbinic Judaism]] is classically monotheistic, and follows in the footsteps of [[Maimonides]] (c. 1135–1204), the panentheistic conception of God can be found among certain mystical Jewish traditions. A leading scholar of [[Kabbalah]], [[Moshe Idel]]&lt;ref&gt;''Hasidism: Between Ecstacy and Magic'', SUNY, 1995, p. 17 f.&lt;/ref&gt; ascribes this doctrine to the kabbalistic system of [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero]] (1522–1570) and in the eighteenth century to the [[Baal Shem Tov]] (c. 1700–1760), founder of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic movement]], as well as his contemporaries, Rabbi [[Dov Ber of Mezeritch|Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezeritch]] (died 1772), and Menahem Mendel, the Maggid of Bar. This may be said of many, if not most, subsequent Hasidic masters. There is some debate as to whether [[Isaac Luria]] (1534–1572) and [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], with its doctrine of [[tzimtzum]], can be regarded as panentheistic.

According to [[Hasidism]], the infinite [[Ein Sof]] is incorporeal and exists in a state that is both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanent]]. This appears to be the view of non-Hasidic Rabbi [[Chaim of Volozhin]], as well. [[Hasidic Judaism]] merges the elite ideal of [[kenosis|nullification]] to a transcendent God, via the intellectual articulation of inner dimensions through Kabbalah and with emphasis on the panentheistic [[divine immanence]] in everything.&lt;ref name=ariel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ariel|first1=David S.|title=Kabbalah: The Mystic Quest in Judaism|date=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0742545644|pages=184–85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDMBtWDSNIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars would argue that "panentheism" is the best single-word description of the philosophical theology of [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diller |first1=Jeanine and Asa Kasher |title=Models of God and Alternative Ultimate Realities |date=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-007-5218-4 |pages=425–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZhEAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore no surprise, that aspects of panentheism are also evident in the theology of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] as presented in the writings of [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881–1983), who was strongly influenced by Spinoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scult |first1=Mel |title=The Radical American Judaism of Mordecai M.

=== Islam ===
{{further|Tawheed}}
Several [[Sufi]] saints and thinkers, primarily [[Ibn Arabi]], held beliefs that have been considered panentheistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Minai|first1=Asghar Talaye|title=Mysticism, aesthetics, and cosmic consciousness: a post-modern worldview of unity of being|date=2003|publisher=Global Academic Pub.|location=N.Y.|isbn=1586842498|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; These notions later took shape in the theory of [[wahdat ul-wujud]] (the Unity of All Things). Some Sufi Orders, notably the [[Bektashis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abiva|first1=Huseyin|title=Bektashi Thought &amp; Practice|url=http://bektashiorder.com/thought-and-practice|website=Bektashi Order of Dervishes|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Sufism|Universal Sufi]] movement, continue to espouse panentheistic beliefs. [[Nizari]] [[Ismaili]] follow [[Panentheism (Ismailism)|panentheism according to Ismaili doctrine]]. Nevertheless, some [[Shia]] Muslims also do believe in different degrees of Panentheism.

Al-Qayyuum is a [[Names of God in Islam|Name of God]] in the Qur'an which translates to "The Self-Existing by Whom all subsist". In Islam the universe can not exist if Allah doesn't exist, and it is only by His power which encompasses everything and which is everywhere that the universe can exist. In Ayaẗ al-Kursii God's throne is described as "extending over the heavens and the earth" and "He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them". This does not mean though that the universe is God, or that a creature (like a tree or an animal) is God, because those would be respectively [[pantheism]], which is a heresy in traditional Islam, and the worst heresy in Islam, shirk (polytheism). God is separated by His creation but His creation can not survive without Him.

=== In Pre-Columbian America ===
The Mesoamerican empires of the [[Maya religion|Maya]]s, [[Aztec religion|Aztecs]] as well as the South American [[Religion in the Inca Empire|Incas]] ([[Tahuatinsuyu]]) have typically been characterized as [[polytheism|polytheistic]], with strong male and female deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=John|title=Gods &amp; Goddesses of the Inca, Maya, and Aztec Civilizations|date=2014|publisher=Rosen Education Service|location=New York|isbn=1622753968|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYwgBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Charles C. Mann]]'s history book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', only the lower classes of Aztec society were polytheistic. Philosopher James Maffie has argued that Aztec metaphysics was pantheistic rather than panentheistic, since [[Teotl]] was considered by Aztec philosophers to be the ultimate all-encompassing yet all-transcending force defined by its inherit duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maffie|first1=James|title=Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion|date=2013|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder|isbn=9781607322238|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JK-AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native American religion|Native American beliefs]] in [[Native Americans in the United States|North America]] have been characterized as panentheistic in that there is an emphasis on a single, unified divine spirit that is manifest in each individual entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Robert C. and Kathleen M. Higgins|title=From Africa to Zen: An Invitation to World Philosophy|date=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0742513491|pages=51–54|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=gVgdAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=native%20american%20panentheism&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q=panentheism&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (North American Native writers have also translated the word for God as the Great Mystery&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Means]], ''Where White Men Fear To Tread'' (Macmillan, 1993), pp. 3–4, 15, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; or as the Sacred Other&lt;ref&gt;[[George Tinker]], ''Spirit and Resistance: Political Theology and American Indian Liberation'', 2004, p. 89.  He defines the Sacred Other as "the Deep Mystery which creates and sustains all Creation".&lt;/ref&gt;) This concept is referred to by many as the [[Great Spirit]]. Philosopher [[J. Baird Callicott]] has described Lakota theology as panentheistic, in that the divine both transcends and is immanent in everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback|date=1994|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520085602|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvG8Sqq1FbIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception can be modern [[Cherokee]] who are predominantly [[monotheism|monotheistic]] but apparently not panentheistic;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Cherokee ''The Peoples of the World Foundation. Education for and about Indigenous Peoples: The Cherokee People''], retrieved 2008-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; yet in older Cherokee traditions many observe both aspects of pantheism and panentheism, and are often not beholden to exclusivity, encompassing other spiritual traditions without contradiction, a common trait among some tribes in the Americas.

=== Sikhism ===
The [[Sikh gurus]] have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy scripture of [[Sikhism]], but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. God is described in the [[Mul Mantar|Mool Mantar]], the first passage in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], and the basic formula of the faith is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji, Ang 1)
— ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ik Oankar Satnaam KartaaPurakh Nirbhau Nirvair AkaalMoorat Ajooni Saibhan GurPrasad''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
One primal being who made the sound (oan) that expanded and created the world. Truth is the name. Creative being personified. Without fear, without hate. Image of the undying. Beyond birth, self existent. By Guru's grace~
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Guru Arjan, the fifth guru of Sikhs, says, "God is beyond colour and form, yet His/Her presence is clearly visible" (Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]], Ang 74), and "Nanak's Lord transcends the world as well as the scriptures of the east and the west, and yet He/She is clearly manifest" (Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]], Ang 397).

Knowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by revelation of the ultimate reality through nadar (grace) and by [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]] (mystical experience). Says Guru Nanak; "''budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane.''" This translates to "He/She is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He/She is met, when He/She pleases, through devotion" (GG, 436).

Guru Nanak prefixed the numeral one (ik) to it, making it Ik Oankar or Ek Oankar to stress God's oneness. God is named and known only through his Own immanent nature. The only name which can be said to truly fit God's transcendent state is SatNam ( Sat Sanskrit, Truth), the changeless and timeless Reality. God is transcendent and all-pervasive at the same time. Transcendence and immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in the entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully. As says Guru Tegh Bahadur, Nanak IX, "He has himself spread out His/Her Own “maya” (worldly illusion) which He oversees; many different forms He assumes in many colours, yet He stays independent of all" (GG, 537).

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{further|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], God is described as a single, imperishable God, the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. The connection between God and the world is that of the creator to his [[Genesis creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref name="SmithGod"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= God |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  God is understood to be independent of his creation, and that creation is dependent and contingent on God.  Accordingly, the  [[Bahá'í Faith]] is much more closely aligned with traditions of monotheism than panentheism.  God is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. Instead, in the [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í understanding]], the world of creation [[wiktionary:emanate|emanates]] from God, in that all things have been realized by him and have attained to existence.&lt;ref name="saq"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1981 |title = Some Answered Questions |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-190-6 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/SAQ/saq-53.html.iso8859-1#gr5 | pages = 202–203 |origyear = 1904–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation is seen as the expression of God's will in the contingent world,&lt;ref name="SmithCreation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= creation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and every created thing is seen as a sign of God's sovereignty, and leading to knowledge of him; the signs of God are most particularly revealed in [[human beings]].&lt;ref name="SmithGod"/&gt;

=== Konkōkyō ===

In [[Konkokyo|Konkōkyō]], God is named “Tenchi Kane no Kami-Sama” which can mean “Golden spirit of the universe.” Kami(God) is also seen as infinitely loving and powerful.

Dr. '''Percival Ulysses "Perry" Cox''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rateyourdoc.org/bios/cox.htm |title=RateYourDoc.org at Sacred Heart Hospital |date=December 9, 2007 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209151616/http://www.rateyourdoc.org/bios/cox.htm |archivedate= December 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional character played by [[John C. McGinley]] on the American television [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. Dr. Cox appeared in every episode except "[[My Last Words]]," "[[My Comedy Show]]," and "[[My Full Moon]]," all in [[Scrubs (season 8)|Season 8]].

McGinley, [[Zach Braff]], and [[Donald Faison]] were the only cast members who returned as regulars for [[Scrubs (season 9)|Season 9]].

==Character profile==
Dr. Cox is sarcastic, bitter, cynical, uncaring, snobbish, and has a quick, cruel wit, normally expressed through frequent and sometimes incredibly long rants. At the beginning of the series, he is the chief attending physician at Sacred Heart Hospital; he is later promoted to residency director and, by the eighth season, to chief of medicine. In the ninth and final season, he becomes a professor when Sacred Heart is turned into a medical school. He is the superior and unwilling mentor of the series' protagonist, [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J.D." Dorian]] ([[Zach Braff]]). He has a "married but not married" relationship with his ex-wife, Jordan Sullivan ([[Christa Miller]]), with whom he has a son, Jack, and a daughter, Jennifer Dylan. He treats virtually everyone in the hospital with derision, especially his longtime nemesis, Chief of Medicine [[Bob Kelso]] ([[Ken Jenkins]]).

Cox is athletic, often found playing [[basketball]] in the hospital's parking lot with younger employees. In "[[My Friend the Doctor]]", he shows off by [[slam dunk|slam-dunking]] a basketball, but injures his back when he lands, a reminder that he is middle-aged. Out of vanity, he tries to hide his injury. He is also extremely [[egocentric]]; when named by a magazine as the best doctor in the city, he lines up every staff member beneath him, and his ex-wife, to consecutively praise him.

Cox grew up in an [[Irish Catholic]] family and has a younger sister, Paige ([[Cheryl Hines]]). Their family was extremely dysfunctional; their father was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and their mother did nothing to prevent the abuse. Cox has a strained relationship with his born-again Christian sister, who reminds him of the childhood he has tried to forget.&lt;ref name="My New God"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My New God|episodelink=My New God|series=Scrubs|network=NBC|airdate=January 17, 2006|season=5|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ironically, while he goes out of his way to distance himself from others, Cox often gets mixed up in the lives of both his patients and those around him. This personal involvement often manifests in destructive ways, with Cox either internalizing his feelings or externalizing them by targeting those around him. Despite this, he has intervened in some situations, with no expectation of personal gain and often to his own detriment, to help others. A notable example is when he punches Kelso in the face in front of the entire staff when Kelso berates [[Elliot Reid]] ([[Sarah Chalke]]).&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Dream Job | episodelink = My Dream Job | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = April 17, 2003 | season  = 2  | number = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McGinley in the Season 1 [[DVD]] bonus features, Dr. Cox's habit of often touching his nose is a homage to [[Paul Newman]]'s character in ''[[The Sting]]'', although Cox also uses it as a sign of irritation on occasion, rather than just a sign signifying "it's going to be OK", as it was used in the film. Dr. Cox has also been compared to [[Gregory House]]. This is further explored in "[[My House (Scrubs)|My House]]", during which Cox acquires a temporary limp. At the end of the episode, through a series of circumstances, Dr. Cox walks into the room where the other characters are sitting and in a very House-esque way, gives them the answers to everything they have been trying to figure out through the whole episode.

Cox accepts the position of chief of medicine after Kelso retires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Dumb Luck|episodelink=My Dumb Luck|series=Scrubs|airdate=April 24, 2008|season=7|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position, however, does not come easily. He temporarily holds the position until the board finds a replacement, Dr. Taylor Maddox ([[Courteney Cox]]). After concluding that Dr. Maddox is, in fact, worse than Kelso, Dr. Cox teams up with [[Janitor (Scrubs)|the Janitor]] and Kelso to oust her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Saving Grace | episodelink = My Saving Grace | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = January 13, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dr. Maddox is fired, the position is vacant until Dr. Kelso, behind Cox's back, recommends him for the job. Dr. Cox is initially hesitant to take the job out of fear of losing the connection he has with his patients. Although it takes a few days, Kelso convinces him to accept the position.&lt;ref name="My Cookie Pants"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Cookie Pants | episodelink = My Cookie Pants | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = January 27, 2009 | season = 8| number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Season 2 DVD commentary of [[His Story (Scrubs episode)|"His Story"]], series creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] stated that one of Dr. Cox's quirks is that he knows if someone is standing behind him and who it is, without turning around to check. This quirk is defied in "[[My Finale]]" when J.D. stands behind Cox as he tells one of the new interns how he really feels; throughout the speech, he gives no sign that he knows that J.D. is behind him.

He is also a very good golfer, regularly besting Kelso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Two Dads | episodelink = My Two Dads | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 23, 2001| season  = 1| number = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox harbors an intense hatred for [[Hugh Jackman]], mentioning him frequently in his rants about things he hates throughout the series. According to a 2006 interview with McGinley, Cox's reason for hating Jackman may be that Bill Lawrence envies the actor's talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johns |first1=Anna |title=John C. McGinley: The TV Squad Interview - TV Squad |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/05/16/john-c-mcginley-the-tv-squad-interview/ |publisher=TV Squad |date=May 16, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615042303/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/05/16/john-c-mcginley-the-tv-squad-interview/ |archivedate=June 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox is occasionally seen wearing a [[Detroit Red Wings]] jersey. McGinley is a Red Wings fan and a close friend of former Detroit defenseman [[Chris Chelios]], whose name can be seen on the back of Cox's jersey. He has also been seen wearing a T-shirt for Cheli's Chili Bar, a small chain of restaurants owned by Chelios.

Cox is a graduate of Hale University and [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], the former being a fictional adaptation of [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = February 3, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cox is often seen drinking [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] and has acknowledged (humorously) that he has a drinking problem. Cox drinks so much that J.D. fears that Cox will die of [[liver]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Mentor|episodelink=My Mentor|series=Scrubs|serieslink=Scrubs (TV series)|network=NBC|airdate=October 4, 2001|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making a mistake about a transplant patient that results in three deaths, a guilt-ridden Cox goes to work drunk and falls into a deep depression.&lt;ref name="My Lunch"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=My Lunch|episodelink=|series=Scrubs|airdate=April 25, 2006|season=5|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.D. eventually helps him forgive himself, however.&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Fallen Idol | episodelink = My Fallen Idol | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 6, 2006 | season  = 5  | number = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Jack's first full sentence is "Daddy drinks a lot".&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"/&gt;

==Relationships with other characters==

===In Sacred Heart===
Dr. Cox constantly berates the residents, giving [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J.D." Dorian]] female nicknames (e.g. "Tiffany", "Jennifer", "Carol", "Betsy", "Lindsey") and regularly calling him "Newbie". He also calls [[Elliot Reid]] ([[Sarah Chalke]]) "[[Barbie]]", [[Turk (Scrubs)|Turk]] ([[Donald Faison]]) "[[Gandhi]]" and [[Bob Kelso]] ([[Ken Jenkins]]) "Bob-O", "Bobcat", and "Beelzebob". The one person he openly admits to tolerating is head nurse [[Carla Espinosa]] ([[Judy Reyes]]). Throughout Season 1, he and Turk compete for her affections, with Cox eventually bowing out when he sees that Turk and Carla are in love. In one episode, it is seen that Cox helped Turk with how to deal with women when they are mad, Turk eventually taking Perry's advice. Turk soon learns that Carla and Cox went on a date before Turk came to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Quarantine | episodelink = My Quarantine | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 6, 2006 | season  = 4  | number = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his contempt for Turk in early seasons, Cox develops a restrained level of respect for him, and even occasionally gets along with and relates to him. Being reluctant at first, he even appoints Turk as the Chief Surgeon of Sacred Heart. Cox makes this decision after being told by Kelso that his own promotions by Kelso were against the latter's personal disdain for Cox, yet Cox's excellent medical knowledge made him the best candidate nonetheless - a feature that Turk shares with Cox.

He berates Elliot almost as much as J.D., frequently making fun of her insecurity, hairstyle and [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] background. However, he has also been known to stand up for her: he punches Kelso in the face when he yells at her in front of the staff.&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt;

Cox despises Kelso, Sacred Heart's chief of medicine. They disagree constantly about the best way to provide care, with Cox advocating for patients and Kelso adhering to the hospital's [[bottom line]]. At one point, he even punches Kelso in the face.&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt; On occasion, however, they have acknowledged the necessity of the other's position, and Kelso has admitted that they need each other.&lt;ref name="My Fallen Idol"/&gt; When Kelso retires and Cox succeeds him as chief of medicine, Cox confides in him about the pressures of the job, and the two form a "secret friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My New Role | episodelink = My New Role | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = February 3, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dr. Cox has had limited interactions with veteran nurse [[Laverne Roberts]] ([[Aloma Wright]]), his cynicism drives him to mock her strong religious beliefs on occasion. This culminates in Cox confronting her about a seemingly "miraculous" accident, unwilling to accept it as [[Miracle|divine intervention]]. Visibly upset, Laverne replies that after 24 years as a nurse, she has to believe in a "bigger plan", otherwise she'd lose all hope. Taken aback, Cox uncharacteristically apologizes and sincerely replies that he wishes he could also believe that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My No Good Reason | episodelink = My No Good Reason | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = March 15, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When she dies in the following episode, he joins the rest of the staff in bidding her farewell and drinking in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Long Goodbye | episodelink = My Long Goodbye | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = April 5, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He berates J.D. from their first meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My First Day | episodelink = My First Day | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 6, 2001 | season  = 1  | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphatically denies being his mentor, despite J.D.'s repeated attempts to win his favor. Nonetheless, Cox has shown concern for J.D.'s welfare, such as telling him not to blame himself for a patient's death&lt;ref name="My Lunch"/&gt; and (reluctantly) comforting him when his father dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Cake | episodelink = My Cake | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = October 12, 2004 | season  = 4  | number = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also tells J.D. that he trusts him as a doctor and a person and has taken an interest in him from the start because he seems "to actually give a crap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Last Day | episodelink = My Last Day (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 21, 2002 | season  = 1  | number = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox also recommends him as a promising, skilled, and hard-working doctor to a review board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Fifteen Minutes| episodelink = My Fifteen Minutes| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = November 15, 2001 | season  = 1  | number = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[My Finale]]", Cox finally admits that he considers J.D. a talented doctor, a good person, and a friend, although he has to be tricked to do it. He refuses to say this directly to J.D. or to hug him. A flash-forward scene at the end of the episode suggests that Cox will be a part of J.D.'s life well into the future (reluctantly, of course).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Finale| episodelink = My Finale| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = May 6, 2009 | season  = 8  | number = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ninth season, Sacred Heart has become a medical school, and Cox is hired as a professor. He immediately begins berating the series' new protagonist, Lucy Bennett ([[Kerry Bishé]]), and takes an interest in one of his students, Drew Suffin ([[Michael Mosley (actor)|Michael Mosley]]). He calls the latter "Number 1" and makes him his protégé, much to J.D.'s chagrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Our First Day of School| episodelink = Our First Day of School| series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = December 1, 2009 | season  = 9  | number = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he still provides advice and support to J.D. (albeit in his usual sarcastic fashion) by telling him that he has to learn to let his students make their own mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Our Role Models| episodelink = Our Role Models| series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = ABC  | airdate = December 8, 2009 | season  = 9  | number = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family life===
Cox's family is from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. He has a sister, [[List of minor characters of Scrubs#Dr. Cox and Jordan|Paige]] ([[Cheryl Hines]]), who is a [[born-again Christian]].&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt; Cox is presented as an ardent [[skeptic]]&lt;ref name="My New God" /&gt; who says that he does not "technically believe" in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Half-Acre | episodelink = My Half-Acre | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 7, 2006 | season  = 5  | number = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His political views are varied; he has expressed disdain for members of both political parties, as well as "registered Independents". He opposes the [[Iraq War]] and is disgusted when Elliot reveals that she is a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]].&lt;ref name="His Story IV"&gt;{{cite episode | title = His Story IV | episodelink = His Story IV | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 1, 2007 | season  = 6  | number = 07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also uses "Republican" as an insult for Paige.&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt;

Cox's father was an [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], and his mother would "watch silently while he drunkenly knocked [Dr. Cox and Paige] from room to room." At the end of one episode, he admits to his sister that seeing her reminds him of the childhood he has tried so hard to forget.&lt;ref name="My New God"/&gt;

Cox was apparently legally [[divorce]]d from [[Jordan Sullivan]] ([[Christa Miller|Christa Miller Lawrence]]), but the two have lived together in an exclusive relationship since Jordan discovered she was [[pregnant]].&lt;ref name="My Fruit Cups"&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Fruit Cups | episodelink = My Fruit Cups | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = November 14, 2002
 | season  = 5  | number = 102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed in flashbacks, the marriage appears to have started out strongly, but went downhill and eventually ended when Jordan slept with Dr. Cox's then-protégé Peter Fisher ([[Jay Mohr]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Own Private Practice Guy | episodelink = My Own Private Practice Guy | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = March 13, 2003 | season  = 2  | number = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the series, it is revealed that Ted did not submit the divorce papers properly, so Cox and Jordan have been married during the entire run of the show. They immediately resume the role of husband and wife since they have already reconciled, but they quickly become dissatisfied with being an ordinary married couple, so they agree to go back to acting as though they were divorced, even going so far as to actually legally divorce with Ted (again) ending their marriage. In later seasons, Cox quietly resumes wearing his wedding ring, and Jordan soon acquiesces to the marriage title after the birth of their second child, and it is implied that they have remarried.

He has two children with Jordan: a son named Jack and, after an unsuccessful [[vasectomy]], a daughter named Jennifer Dylan (J.D.). Jack is played by Andrew Miller and his twin brother (although in a cameo appearance in "[[My Missed Perception]]", he is played by Bill Lawrence and Christa Miller's son, William). When Jordan first becomes pregnant with Jack, she tells Cox that she was impregnated by a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[bellboy]], wanting Cox to stay because he wants to rather than out of obligation to his child.&lt;ref name="My Fruit Cups"/&gt; At first, Cox feels nothing for the then-nameless boy, but begins to feel a connection after the child responds to the name Jack, which Cox had been trying to impress upon him for some time. J.D.'s college friend Spencer ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) accidentally tells Cox that he is actually Jack's biological father,&lt;ref name="My Dream Job"/&gt; and he takes on the role of father much more seriously. Cox has a very unorthodox way of raising Jack, often treating him like his "drinking buddy". Nonetheless, Cox loves his son and tries fervently to be a better father than his own was. He often talks to Jack in lieu of a [[psychotherapy|therapist]]. He also dotes on his daughter; among other things, he goes far out of his way to have someone else give her a shot so that she will not associate him with pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = My Hard Labor | episodelink = My Hard Labor | series = Scrubs| serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 7, 2007 | season  = 7  | number = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox is best friends with Jordan's brother, Ben ([[Brendan Fraser]]), and is hit hard when he is diagnosed with [[leukemia]]; he is initially too afraid to treat him because he fears he will lose him. He rallies, however, and helps Ben go into [[remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Occurrence | episodelink = My Occurrence | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 7, 2002 | season  = 1  | number = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Hero | episodelink = My Hero (Scrubs) | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = May 14, 2002 | season  = 1  | number = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben dies in the episode "[[My Screw Up]]", but Cox convinces himself that he is still alive. When he finally admits that Ben is dead, he is devastated, and uncharacteristically allows people to comfort him at the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = My Screwup | episodelink = My Screwup | series = Scrubs | serieslink = Scrubs (TV series)  | network = NBC  | airdate = February 24, 2004 | season  = 3  | number = 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">'''Phraotes''' was an [[Indo-Parthian]] king of [[Taxila (ancient)|Taxila]], in northern [[Ancient India]], met by the Greek philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] around 46 CE according to the ''[[Life of Apollonius Tyana]]'' written by [[Philostratus]].

Apollonius reported constructions of the Greek type in Taxila, 
&lt;ref&gt;Description of the Hellenistic urbanism of Taxila:&lt;br&gt;
* "Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities" [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#§20 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20)]
*"I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above." [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_21.html#§23 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23)]&lt;/ref&gt;
probably referring to [[Sirkap]], and explains that Phraotes speaks Greek fluently, a language he had been educated in while in exile to the east, beyond the river [[Hyphasis]]:

:"Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place?" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_26.html#§29 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 29)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:[...]-"My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_31.html#§31 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 31)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins of a king "Prahat" or "Prahara", thought to be Phraotes, have been found in the area of Taxila, and it has been suggested that he might be identical with the Indo-Parthian king [[Gondophares]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Numismatic Society of India, 1968, vol. 30, p. 188-190. A. K. Narain&lt;/ref&gt; This is however unlikely, as this king was probably much earlier, but he could have been one of the later [[Indo-Parthian]] kings who were also named Gondophares.

'''Polyxo''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|k|s|oʊ}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Πολυξώ ''Poluxṓ'') is the name of several figures in [[Greek mythology]]: 

*Polyxo, one of the [[Oceanids]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', Preface&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, one of the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]].
*Polyxo, a [[Naiad]] of the river [[Nile]], presumably one of the daughters of the river-god [[Nilus (mythology)|Nilus]]. She was one of the wives of [[Danaus]] and bore him twelve daughters: [[Autonoe (disambiguation)|Autonoe]], [[Theano]], Electra, [[Cleopatra, daughter of Danaus|Cleopatra]], [[Eurydice (disambiguation)|Eurydice]], [[Glaucippe]], [[Anthelea]], [[Daughters of Danaus|Cleodora]], [[Euippe]], [[Erato (disambiguation)|Erato]], [[Stygne]], and [[Bryce (disambiguation)|Bryce]]. They married twelve sons of [[Aegyptus]] and [[Caliadne]], Polyxo's sister, and murdered them on their wedding nights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-|Pseudo]]-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.1.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 2.1.5]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, mother of [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]] and possibly [[Nycteïs|Nycteis]] by [[Nycteus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.10.1&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.10.1]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, mother of Actorion. She came to invite [[Triopas]] and [[Erysichthon of Thessaly|Erysichthon]] to her son's wedding, but Erysichthon's mother had to answer that her own son was not coming, as he had been wounded by a boar during hunt. The truth was that Erysichthon was dealing with the insatiable hunger sent upon him by the angry [[Demeter]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Callimachus]], Hymn to Demeter, 77 ff&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, a [[Lemnos|Lemnian]], nurse of [[Hypsipyle]] and a seeress. She advised that the Lemnian women conceive children with the [[Argonauts]], as all the men on the island had previously been killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1. 668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''Argonautica'', 2. 315 ff&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, a native of [[Argos]], who married [[Tlepolemus]] and fled with him to [[Rhodes]]. Together they had a son, whose name is not known. After Tlepolemus was killed in the [[Trojan War]], Polyxo became queen of Rhodes. She received [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] after the latter had been driven out of [[Sparta]] by [[Megapenthes]] and [[Nicostratus (mythology)|Nicostratus]] ([[Menelaus]], Helen's husband, was already dead by the time). Still, Polyxo blamed Helen for Tlepolemus' death and decided to take revenge on her. So when Helen was bathing, several handmaidens in the guise of the [[Erinyes]], sent by Polyxo, seized her and hanged her from a tree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 3. 19. 9 - 10&lt;/ref&gt; In an alternate version, Menelaus and Helen landed at Rhodes on their way back from Egypt, whereupon Polyxo sent a crowd of armed islanders of both genders against them, hoping to avenge her husband's death on Helen. Menelaus hid Helen away under the deck and had a beautiful servant dressed up as the queen, which resulted in her, and not the real Helen, being killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polyaenus]], ''Stratagems of War'', 1. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another source, which uses the name "Philozoe" rather than "Polyxo", informs that she held funeral games of Tlepolemus; youths competed in them, and the winners were crowned with white poplar leaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 911&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo, a [[Maenad]] in the retinue of [[Dionysus]] who attempted to kill [[Lycurgus of Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', 21. 69&lt;/ref&gt;
*Polyxo (or Polyzo), a sister of [[Meleager]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', 9. 584&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Presbyterian Church in Ireland''' ('''PCI'''; {{lang-ga|Eaglais Phreispitéireach in Éirinn}}, [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster-Scots]]: ''Prisbytairin Kirk in Airlann'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maynoothcc.org/ |title=maynoothcc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census/pdf/UlsterScots.pdf |title=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest [[Presbyterian]] denomination in Ireland, and the largest [[Protestant]] denomination in [[Northern Ireland]]. Like most [[Christianity in Ireland|Christian churches in Ireland]], it is organised on an all-island basis, in both Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The church has approximately 225,000 members.

== Membership ==
The Church has a membership of approximately 225,000 people in 536 [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] in 403 charges across both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. About 96% of the membership is in Northern Ireland. It is the second largest church in Northern Ireland, the first being the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Confusion can arise from the fact that overall, the majority of the people of Northern Ireland are members of the various [[Protestant]] churches such as the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Presbyterian Church|Church]], [[Church of Ireland]], [[Methodist Church]] and several others. Therefore the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is smaller than the combined Protestant denominations in Northern Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic the church is the second largest [[Protestant]] denomination, after the [[Church of Ireland]]. All the congregations of the church are represented up to the [[General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|General Assembly]] (the church's government).

== History ==
[[Presbyterianism]] in Ireland dates from the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in 1610. During the reign of [[James I of England]] (James VI of Scotland) a large number of Scottish Presbyterians emigrated to Ireland. The first move away from the [[Church of Scotland]], of which the Presbyterians in Ireland were part, saw the creation of the Presbytery of Ulster in 1642 by chaplains of a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army which had arrived to protect the mostly Protestant British (Scottish and English) settlers in Ulster and to crush the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] threatening these settlers. It succeeded in protecting the settlers, but failed abysmally to crush the rebellion. Under the more secure protection of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] congregations multiplied and new presbyteries were formed.  However, after the Restoration, nonconforming ministers were removed from parishes of the [[Established Church]], but no matter the opinions of the king on religion, the Irish administration could not afford to alienate such a substantial Protestant population and Presbyterianism was allowed to continue in the country, with the stipends of ministers paid through the ''regium donum'' – literally 'the King's gift'.

[[William III of England|William III]] rewarded Presbyterian support against [[James II of England|James II]] (James VII of Scotland) with an increase in the ''regium donum''. From the 1690s, Presbyterian congregations, now organised in the Synod of [[Ulster]], enjoyed practical freedom of religion, confirmed by the [[Toleration Act 1719|Toleration Act of 1719]]. However, their members remained very conscious both of continuing legal disabilities under the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|penal laws]] and of economic hardship as many were tenant farmers and objected to the payment of tithes to support the [[Church of Ireland]].  Throughout the eighteenth century, many Presbyterians were involved in movements for reform, which culminated with their prominent involvement in the [[United Irishmen]].&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Connolly ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Irish History'' (OUP, 1998), see also R. F. G. Holmes ''Our Irish Presbyterian Heritage'' (Belfast, 1985) and P. Brooke, ''Ulster Presbyterianism: the historical perspective'' (Dublin, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighteenth century saw significant tensions within the Synod of Ulster, which was divided between the [[Anti-Burgher|Old Lights and the New Lights]].  The Old Lights were conservative [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] who believed that ministers and ordinands should subscribe to the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].  The New Lights were more liberal and were unhappy with the Westminster Confession and did not require ministers to subscribe to it.  The New lights dominated the Synod of Ulster during the eighteenth century, allowing the more conservative [[Church of Scotland|Scottish Presbyterian]] dissenters, [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Seceders]] and [[Covenanters]] to establish a strong presence in Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McBride,''Scripture Politics: Ulster Presbyterians and Irish Radicalism in the Late Eighteenth Century'', (Oxford, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}

In the nineteenth century, a belief that some of those who did not subscribe to the Westminster Confession were in fact [[Arianism|Arian]] provoked a new phase of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;I. R.

This led to the restoration of obligatory subscription to the Westminster Confession within the Synod of Ulster and facilitated union with the Seceders in 1840 to create the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, whose first moderator was [[Samuel Hanna|Dr Samuel Hanna]].  The united church was active in missionary activity both at home and abroad, particularly benefitting from the evangelical [[Ulster Revival of 1859]].&lt;ref&gt;D. W.

The headquarters of the church are at Assembly Buildings, Fisherwick Place, Belfast, which were extensively renovated as part of a multimillion-pound project in 2010–2012. The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, a founding member of the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]], has 540 [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] in [[List of Irish Presbyteries|19 presbyteries across Ireland]]. The church's two nineteenth century theological colleges, [[Magee College]] (Derry) and Assembly's College (Belfast), merged in 1978 to form [[Union Theological College]] in Belfast.&lt;ref name="union150"&gt;Presbyterian Church in Ireland Press Release, 2003 [http://www.presbyterianireland.org/news/news2003/news0468.html ''Presbyterian College Celebrates 150 Years''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119145202/http://www.presbyterianireland.org/news/news2003/news0468.html |date=19 November 2008 }}.

== Church and worship ==
[[File:Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church, Bangor - geograph.org.uk - 567786.jpg|thumb|right|Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church, [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]]]]
Apart from the seats for worshippers, the inside of a Presbyterian church is dominated by four items of furniture.

*The '''Pulpit''' is the place from which sermons are preached.  It generally occupies the central place in the church, reflecting the central place of the proclamation of the Word of God in the worship of the Church. .
*The '''Bible Stand''' holds the bible in a prominent place in the church. The bible is the source of all authority in the life of the church.
*The '''Communion Table''', often placed directly in front of the pulpit.  The associated chairs are occupied by the minister and elders during the service of Holy Communion.
*The '''Baptismal Font''' is used during baptisms, which is regarded as a sign of the covenant between God and the Church, welcoming the child into the community of the Church.  Children are regarded as sharing the promise of salvation with adults in the church and have as much right to be baptised as adults. ('Infant Baptism' does not guarantee admission to Full Membership.  Full Membership is only accepted on Profession of a personal Faith.)

===Service===
The [[Bible|Word of God]] is central in the Presbyterian Church, along with Prayer and Praise. The worship is a mix of [[prayers]], [[hymns]], [[psalms]], [[paraphrases]], [[Scripture]] readings and [[sermons]]. In recent years, psalms and paraphrases have been used less but are still an important part of worship. The order of service varies from church to church but it generally involves a hymn, followed by a prayer, followed by a children's address and a children's hymn. This is then followed by an expository sermon by the minister and another hymn, then another prayer and a closing hymn. Many Presbyterian churches mix Psalms and formal hymns with choruses, suitable for children, and many churches now have praise bands with a variety of instruments, as well as the traditional organ.

==Logo and motto==
[[File:Pci burningbush.PNG|thumb|right|Burning Bush and motto]]
The motto of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland is "Ardens sed Virens" – "burning but flourishing". It is usually seen alongside the [[Burning bush|Burning Bush]], the church's symbol. A burning bush was included in the more modern logo (top).

According to the Bible, in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:2, [[Moses]] heard the voice of God coming from a '''burning bush''' that was not consumed by fire. This occurred after he had to flee [[Egypt]], and was when he was called to go and demand the release of the [[Israelites]].

==Social issues==
The Presbyterian church has been active in commenting on a variety of social issues within and outside the denomination. In May 2006, the church's press officer announced that ministers could bless same-gender civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2006/05/official_irish_presbyterian_cl.html|title=BBC - Will &amp; Testament: Official: Irish Presbyterian Clergy Can Bless Gay Partners|last=Crawley|first=William|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2006, the General Assembly (GA) voted to ban its ministers from blessing same-gender relationships reversing the previous announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/presbyterian-church-bans-blessing-of-gay-couples-1.785997|title=Presbyterian church bans blessing of gay couples|website=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the church voiced its opposition to the legalisation of gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/presbyterian-church-sticks-to-its-position-on-gay-marriage-despite-plea-to-think-again-31311216.html|title=Presbyterian Church sticks to its position on gay marriage despite plea to think again - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On women's issues, the church ordains women as ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2008/02/will_presbyterians_ever_elect.html|title=BBC - Will &amp; Testament: Will Presbyterians ever elect a female moderator?|last=Crawley|first=William|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On life issues, the denomination opposes abortion except for when the woman's life is in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/churches-views-vary-abortion|title=Churches views vary on abortion {{!}} The Irish Catholic|website=www.irishcatholic.ie|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious symbolism in the United States military''' includes the use of religious symbols for [[military chaplain]] insignia, uniforms, emblems, flags, and chapels; symbolic gestures, actions, and words used in military rituals and ceremonies; and religious symbols or designations used in areas such as headstones and markers in national cemeteries, and military ID tags ("[[dog tag]]s").

Symbolism sometimes includes specific images included or excluded because of religious reasons, choices involving colors with religious significance, and "religious accommodation" policies regarding the wear of "religious apparel" and "grooming" (such as "unshorn" hair and beards worn for religious reasons) with military uniforms. Additionally, military chaplains themselves are sometimes regarded as "symbols of faith" for military personnel who face challenges to their faith and values.&lt;ref name="reagan"&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 wwwpresidency.ucsb.edu].

==Chaplain insignia by military service==

===Army===
[[File:Shepherd's Crook Chaplain Insignia.jpg|thumb|left|The "Shepherd's Crook," the original insignia authorized for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] chaplains, 1880–1888, and still included as part of the [[United States Corps of Chaplains|U.S. Army Chaplain Corps]] regimental insignia]]

[[File:Chaplain WWI uniform.jpg|thumb|150px|WWI Army uniform coat with Christian Chaplain insignia]]
[[File:WWI Chaplain Coat.jpg|thumb|right|150px|WWI Army dress uniform coat with Christian Chaplain insignia]]
On July 29, 1775, the [[Continental Congress]] established the military chaplaincy, but chaplains did not wear insignia until 1880.
&lt;ref name="colors"&gt;[http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Colors/US_Army_Branch_Colors.htm www.alternatewards.com]. Retrieved June 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1835 Army Regulations prescribed black as the branch color for chaplains, directing that a chaplain wear a black coat.&lt;ref name="colors"/&gt; By 1861, US Army Regulations included the details that the chaplains should wear a single breast officer's frock coat made of black wool, with black cloth covering the buttons, and no shoulderboards.&lt;ref name="qm"&gt;[http://www.quartermastershop.com/CW%20US%20Officer/chaplain_frockcoat.html www.quartermastershop.com]. Retrieved May 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the Army Uniform Board "enhanced" the [[frock coat]] by adding black "herringbone braid" in across the chest at the buttons and buttonholes, with buttons still covered in black.&lt;ref name="qm"/&gt; This coat was used by army chaplains until 1880, when shoulder boards were authorized for chaplains for the first time, and the first official insignia was introduced.&lt;ref name="qm"/&gt;

Although the [[Latin Cross|Latin cross]] has long been the symbol for the majority of United States military chaplains, this first official chaplain insignia was the "[[shepherd's crook]]" (staff).&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[http://www.chaplain.us www.chaplain.us]. Retrieved May 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Authorized in General Order Number 10, and remaining in force for the period February 13, 1880 – May 5, 1888, it was described as "embroidered frosted silver bullion in center of black velvet shoulder straps, and was considered appropriate for both the frock coat or undress uniform."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; The plain "Latin cross" (silver on dark-blue shoulder straps) became the authorized chaplain insignia in 1898, replacing the shepherd's crook.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; Today, despite the fact that the shepherd's crook is no longer used as an insignia for individual chaplains, it is included in the design of the Chaplain Corps regimental insignia in honor of its place in Army Chaplain Corps history.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;[http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/Branch_Insignia/Branch_Insignia_Information/chaplain-corps.shtml www.armystudyguide.com]. Retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish chaplains were first authorized to serve during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but it was during [[World War I]] that the issue of insignia reached the army, when Congressman [[Isaac Siegel]] from New York petitioned the army that rabbis serving in uniform be permitted to wear "some other insignia in place of the cross."&lt;ref name="rabbis"&gt;Slomovitz, Albert Isaac, ''The Fighting Rabbis: Jewish Military Chaplains and American History'', 1999, New York University Press, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two weeks of receiving this request, the army issued a directive stating that "Objections having been made to Jewish Chaplains wearing the prescribed insignia, you are authorized by the [[Secretary of War]] to omit the prescribed insignia" (the cross).&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;"Army correspondence Concerning Jewish Insignia, NA-CCC-RG247, cited in Slomovitz, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after battlefront reports indicated that difficulties arose from the fact that Jewish chaplains wore no insignia, the army began to look into various proposals, including a continuation of the practice of having Jewish chaplains wear no insignia, to the creation of a separate insignia for them, to a return to the shepherd's crook as a shared symbol for all chaplains.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; General [[Henry Jerver]], acting assistant chief of staff for the army favored the third alternative, and within weeks of his decision this became the official policy for the Army.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; However, many Christian chaplains opposed this change of policy, and in August 1918 General Pershing cabled the War Department to inform it of this opposition.&lt;ref name="ac"/&gt; Not all Christian chaplains opposed the idea of a universal symbol, and some went on record agreeing with the statement of one chaplain that "I am a chaplain of the Christian faith, but I welcome the change. The shepherd's crook is symbolic of the chaplain's work."&lt;ref&gt;"Army and Navy Journal," July 20, 1918, as cited in Slomovitz, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to a consideration of the three options of no insignia for Jewish chaplains, a shared insignia, or a separate insignia, the army opted for a separate Jewish chaplain insignia that included an image of the two tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], using [[Roman numerals]] to indicate the commandments, with a small six-pointed [[Jewish star]] on top of the tablets.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; Other symbols considered included a six-pointed star ([[hexagram]]), which was rejected by the army because it could too easily be confused with the 5-pointed star worn by generals; a seven-branched candelabra ([[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]); and two "[[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]]" supporting the six-pointed star.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt;

This symbol would remain the insignia for Jewish chaplains until 1981, when the navy changed its insignia to include the first ten letters of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] alphabet—to replace the Roman numerals—and both the army and the air force followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/branches/Chaplains%20Corps.htm# |title=Jewish Chaplain insignia |access-date=2011-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205074157/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/branches/Chaplains%20Corps.htm# |archive-date=2008-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slomovitz, op. cit., p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; While the official change to Hebrew letters became official November 9, 1981&lt;ref name="ask"&gt;[http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/armybranches/blchap.htm USMilitary.about.com].

Insignia decisions for chaplains representing faith groups other than Christianity and Judaism have not been made unilaterally by the army, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.

The [[Continental Navy]], predecessor of the United States Navy, was approved by the [[United States Congress]] on October 13, 1775, with navy regulations (adopted November 28, 1775) that included as its second article: "The Commanders of the ships of the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen United Colonies]] are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent." But, while the need for navy chaplains was recognized from the beginning, attitudes and policies toward navy uniforms or insignia for its chaplains went through many changes before final decisions were made.&lt;ref name="perrinot"&gt;Perrenot, Preston B.[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkCBRExR94QC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=navy+shepherd's+crook+chaplain+insignia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mFKJySHwmW&amp;sig=BlG86c1Tfq39trmd6oa6yAiDdNM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s9zPTbuAM9DqgQer6NG-DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=navy%20shepherd's%20crook%20chaplain%20insignia&amp;f=false United States Navy Grade Insignia Since 1852, pg 92], copyright 2009 by Preston Perrinot. Retrieved May 15, 2011. (Chaplain Corps insignia section: pages 91-102.)&lt;/ref&gt; 1847 navy regulations did authorize chaplains to wear a blue uniform with black collar and cuffs with no insignia, and later, in 1864, chaplains were provided the same uniform as other staff officers, with the use of a silver cross as a corps device.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

However, regulations for navy chaplain uniforms and insignias changed a number of times over the following years: 1869–1876, when chaplains were considered as officers without rank, they wore the cross without any additional "sleeve lace"; in 1876, uniforms were no longer authorized for chaplains, who were to wear either civilian clothing or the vestments appropriate to their faith group; in 1883, the uniform became an option for chaplains, with the cross; and then in 1894, the epaulets and passants were removed so that chaplain uniforms had no insignia at all, neither any that indicated they were officers nor even the cross signifying that they were chaplains.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

It was not until 1905 that the navy uniform code included a permanent regulation for chaplains: along with ranks equivalent to line officers, they were to wear naval officer's uniforms with the sleeve braid in "lustrous black" (not gold, like that of other officers), and to wear both the officer rank insignia and a gold cross.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; In 1918, naval staff corps rules were changed, and the distinctive black braid of chaplains was replaced by the same gold braid worn by other officers, along with the Latin cross.&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt;

The navy policy on insignia for Jewish chaplains was not resolved as quickly as it was in the army. When Rabbi David Goldberg entered the navy October 30, 1917,&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Adam M., [http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2006/Sep/06Sep_Goldberg.pdf "Jewish Culture and the American Military"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815115932/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2006/Sep/06Sep_Goldberg.pdf# |date=2011-08-15 }}, Naval Postgraduate School Thesis, September 2006, pg. 19.

When Goldberg's request to wear the six-pointed star was rejected—based on the same fears the army had that a six-pointed star would be too similar to the five-pointed star worn by flag officers—he recommended the shepherd's crook as a universal symbol, a recommendation that met with opposition from many Christian chaplains.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; However, the Navy did authorize Goldberg to wear that symbol himself, in place of the cross.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; Goldberg wore this insignia until the end of [[World War II]], when navy policy eventually changed to allow navy Jewish chaplains to wear the tablets and the star, the same insignia worn by Jewish chaplains in the army.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt; This change took place in 1941,&lt;ref name="perrinot"/&gt; after only two Jewish chaplains (Goldberg and Harold Strauss) had worn the Shepherd's Crook insignia.&lt;ref name="jewishpress"&gt;Southwest Jewish Press, October 11, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the shepherd's crook has not been used as a chaplain insignia since that time, the term used for the active duty chaplain with the earliest appointment is the "Gray Shepherd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/virginian-pilot-ledger-star-norfolk/mi_8014/is_20060312/gerald-sargent/ai_n41307082 findarticles.com].

As in the case of the army, decisions about chaplain faith group insignia after those made regarding Jewish chaplains (the original decision and the later decision to change Roman numerals to Hebrew letters) have not been made unilaterally by the navy, but instead have been joint decisions for all military chaplains.

The [[United States Merchant Marine]] is a civilian auxiliary of the United States Navy, but in accordance with the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1936]] its members are considered military personnel during times of war when the merchant marine comes under the navy. Until World War I, merchant mariners did not wear uniforms, but they were introduced in 1919, because "young Americans now entering the merchant service have more regards for themselves and their job when wearing a uniform, and that the merchant sailor commands greater respect when ashore, either at home or in foreign ports, if in uniform.&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/03/09/97081981.pdf "Merchant Sailors Garb distinguished from that of Navy by stripes and insignia," The New York Times, March 9, 1919].

===Air Force===
On July 28, 1942, Chaplain Charles Carpenter was appointed to the newly created position of air chaplain for the [[Army Air Force]], within the larger [[United States Army]] organization. Later, when the [[United States Air Force]] was established as a separate service on September 18, 1947, the original plan was that chaplain support would continue to be provided by Army chaplains. However, on May 10, 1949, the decision was made that the still new branch of the military would have its own chaplains. At that point, chaplains serving with the Air Force began to wear Air Force uniforms, but continued to use the same Jewish and Christian Chaplain Corps insignia that had been used by the Army. In 1981, when the Navy approved the change to the Jewish chaplain insignia, from Roman numerals to Hebrew letters, both the Army and Air Force made the same change soon thereafter. Since then, the approval of insignia to represent chaplains of other faith groups has been made jointly by of all branches of the United States Armed Forces. However, while the designs for the insignia are the same for all services, the Air Force categorizes the insignia as "[[Badges of the United States Air Force|occupational badges]]," with different "wear use" rules than the other services.&lt;ref&gt;Air Force Instruction 36-2903, "Dress and personal appearance of Air Force personnel."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, while the [[Civil Air Patrol]] chaplain program is a separate organization than the USAF Chaplain Corps, it was established in 1950 under the guidance of the Air Force chief of chaplains and "is modeled after the Air Force Chaplain Service," and follows the same rules for faith group insignia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryatheists.org/regs/CAPReg265-1v2007.pdf Civil Air Patrol Regulation 265-1 of May 9, 2007].

Other than the short period 1880–1888 when all army chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook, the [[Latin cross]] (also referred to as the "Christian cross") has been the symbol for all Christian chaplains, regardless of denomination, although in some other nation's military forces, separate symbols are used for some Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant Chaplains, and sometimes for specific groups within the larger Protestant faith group, such as Calvinist Chaplains, and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs includes a number of different denominational versions of the cross on gravestones in veterans cemeteries.&lt;ref name="VA"&gt;[http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp www.cem.va] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711063328/http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hm/hmemb.asp |date=2007-07-11 }}.

But because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith," and therefore "The only members of the Church who wear the symbol of the cross are Latter-day Saint chaplains, who wear it on their military uniforms to show that they are Christian chaplains."&lt;ref name="ldscross"/&gt; Similarly, because the cross is not normally a symbol used by the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] (UU), an article on military chaplains written for members of that religious group had to explain that "UUs in the military are considered Protestants, and wear crosses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/145527.shtml www.uuworld.org].

The Jewish Chaplain insignia made up of two tablets of the Ten Commandments, with ten Roman numerals symbolizing the commandments, and with the six-pointed Star of David above the tablets, was adopted for Jewish army chaplains in 1917, and for Jewish naval chaplains in 1941. The original Army description did not specifically reference a star ''per se'', but instead read "a double Tablet bearing numerals from I to X, surmounted by two equilateral Triangles interlaced."&lt;ref name="med-dept"&gt;[http://med-dept.com/chap.php med-dept.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820214601/http://med-dept.com/chap.php# |date=2011-08-20 }}. Retrieved June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the tablets-and-star design was approved for United States Navy Jewish chaplains, only two Jewish chaplains wore the Shepherd's Crook insignia: Chaplain David Goldberg, during WWI, and Chaplain Harold Strauss, 1931–1941.&lt;ref name="jewishpress"/&gt; Beginning in 1917, Goldberg first wore the cross—the original symbol for all navy chaplains—until receiving permission to wear the Shepherd's Crook instead.&lt;ref name="rabbis"/&gt;

On August 5, 1980, Navy Chief of Chaplains Rear Admiral Ross Trower convened a blue ribbon panel made up of Jewish chaplains to consider the "beneficial suggestion" made to the Navy to change the Roman numerals to Hebrew letters.&lt;ref name="natkin"&gt;Natkin, Fred, "Story of a Symbol:Jewish Chaplain's Insignia," "Navy Chaplain's Bulletin," OPNAV P-09G-2, Volume 2, Number 5, Summer 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The question had been raised before and not all Jewish authorities were in favor of the change because of the concern that the insignia might be considered "holy"—"even mildly holy"—because of the presence of Hebrew writing.&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt; In fact, in a 1972 [[responsum]] from the [[National Jewish Welfare Board]] authored by Rabbi [[Solomon Freehof]], he recommended maintaining Roman numerals although he did state that when it came to using Hebrew letters simply to indicate numbers, "there is no strict law against it."&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt; Nevertheless, based on the panel's unanimous 1980 recommendation to make the change, Chaplain Trower made the formal recommendation to the President of the Navy Uniform Board that the Navy should make the change unilaterally, without the additional time that would be required for all services to study the question.&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt; Included in his recommendation was the statement that
{{quote|The Jewish Chaplain Corps device as it now appears, with Roman numerals representing the Ten Commandments, has been worn with pride by all previous and present Jewish chaplains. It is felt, however, that a change to Hebrew characters at this time would be unanimously and enthusiastically received by Jewish chaplains and Jewish personnel as a source of still greater pride, reflecting as it would a more significant and authentic representation of a heritage and faith eternally related to Hebrew as the language of the [[Old Testament]] and the [[prophet]]s&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt;}}

The President of the Navy Uniform Board approved the change on December 17, 1980,&lt;ref name="natkin"/&gt; with the army and air force quickly approving the change as well. (Note that the Roman numeral version read left to right, with the first five numerals on the left tablet and the second five on the right; the Hebrew reads right to left, with the first five numerals on the right and the second five on the left, as per Jewish tradition. Jewish tradition states that the tablets had flat tops and may even have been square instead of rectangular, but the Christian-influenced rectangular tablets with round tops is nonetheless very frequently found in Jewish art and synagogues, and was not objected to here either.) The new insignia was authorized for wear from 1981, with a grace period authorized to allow Jewish chaplains to make the required uniform changes by January 1, 1983.&lt;ref name="emerson"/&gt;

Remedial action was taken by immediately shaving the faces and cutting the hair of all inductees upon their arrival."&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

It appears that my predecessor's guidance in May on the subject of haircuts, beards and sideburns is insufficiently understand and, for this reason, I want to restate what I believed to be explicit: in the case of haircuts, sideburns, and contemporary clothing styles, my view is that we must learn to adapt to changing fashions. I will not countenance the rights or privileges of
any officers or enlisted men being abrogated in any way because they choose to grow sideburns or neatly trimmed beards or moustaches or because preferences in neat clothing styles are at variance with the taste of their seniors, nor will I countenance any personnel being in any way penalized during the time they are growing beards, moustaches, or sideburns.&lt;ref name="zgram"/&gt;}}

Weinberger]]) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1985/1985_84_1097 ''Goldman v. Weinberger,'' U.S. Supreme Court Case Summary &amp; Oral Argument]&lt;/ref&gt; When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the "neat and conservative" approval rule in a proposed "Religious Apparel Amendment." That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] was read into the ''Congressional Record.''&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Record'', 100th Congress, May 11, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore off a piece of his Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain [[Arnold Resnicoff]]'s kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines.&lt;ref&gt;"Solarz Passes Religious Apparel Amendment", ''The Jewish Press'', May 22, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;Library of Congress Veterans History Project: Arnold Resnicoff collection, AFC/2001/001/70629, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.&lt;ref name="accommodation"/&gt;

Resnicoff's report of the bombing, written at the request of the [[White House]], and read in April 1984 as a keynote speech by President [[Ronald Reagan]], explained the symbolism of Pucciarelli's actions and this kippah:

{{quote|Somehow he wanted those Marines to know not just that we were chaplains, but that he was a Christian and that I was Jewish. Somehow we both wanted to shout the message in a land where people were killing each other—at least partially based on the differences in religion among them—that we, we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt;}}
This story of this "camouflage kippah"—its symbolism in terms of Judaism as a sign of reverence and its symbolism in the military as a sign of interfaith cooperation and respect—was retold at many levels,&lt;ref&gt;Larry Bonko, "Rabbi's Camouflage Yarmulke Woven With Tragedy, Heroism," ''Norfolk Ledger-Star,'' Jan 13, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; including another occasion involving President Reagan, during a White House visit of the "American Friends of Lubavitch."&lt;ref name="wellsprings"&gt;"Rabbis Explain 'Top to Top'," ''Wellsprings,'' No. 12 (Vol 2, No. 7), August–September 1986," Lubavitch Youth Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; After telling them the Beirut story, Reagan asked them about the meaning of the kippah. Rabbi [[Abraham Shemtov]] responded, "Mr. President, the kippah to us is a sign of reverence," and one of his colleagues, Rabbi Feller, continued, 'We place the kippah on the very highest point of our being—on our head, the vessel of our intellect—to tell ourselves and the world that there is something which is above man's intellect—the infinite Wisdom of God."&lt;ref name="wellsprings"/&gt;

Although a number of military instructions use the Jewish headcovering as an example—noting factors that must be met to qualify under the "neat and conservative" requirement—the same criteria for permission apply to head coverings regardless of the faith of the military person requesting permission: "Religious headgear that meets these criteria is authorized irrespective of the faith group from which it originates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deomi.org/DiversityMgmt/documents/AR_600-20_27_April_2010.pdf Army Regulation 600-20, section 5-6.g.(4).(d).5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003163424/http://www.deomi.org/DiversityMgmt/documents/AR_600-20_27_April_2010.pdf# |date=2011-10-03 }}.

However, for many other religiously observant Jews, even such compromises are unacceptable—because for them the prohibition is "non-negotiable".&lt;ref name="heter"/&gt; They base their beliefs on the ruling of rabbis such as the "[[Tzemach Tzedek]]", a past leader of the Chabad movement, who wrote that "any means of removing hair from a man’s face is forbidden."&lt;ref name="heter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://holmininternational613.com/books/BEARD_JEWISH_LAW-E.pdf Gross, Rabbi Sholom Yehuda, "The Beard in Jewish Law"].

The Army had argued that religious accommodation non-shaving waivers that have been granted since 2009 to Sikhs and Muslims cannot serve as precedents for Stern's request because the former are "temporary" and "assignment specific", can be rescinded at any time based on military necessity, and were granted to applicants who had already begun military service, whereas Stern is requesting a "blanket waiver" as a prerequisite for his service as a chaplain.&lt;ref name="courtcase"/&gt;

Ironically, although the ID tags include religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met, some personnel have them issued or reissued without religious affiliation listed—or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without—out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands.

No denominational symbol is used, but it includes the biblical verse, "Sing God's praise anew from around the world, all who sail the sea"]]
Beginning in 1940, the policy was established that military chapels would be constructed with no permanent religious symbols, exterior or interior:

{{quote|In 1940, the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives summoned the Chief of Chaplains of the Army for questioning about a budget item which called for the construction of over one hundred chapels at military installations. Their indirect questions on the use of these chapels indicated their uneasiness in dealing with a problem which might evoke interreligious strife in America. Their fears were allayed, and approval for the chapel building program was quickly granted, when the Chief of Chaplains made it clear that the chapels were to be non-denominational in character, with no symbols, either within or without, to denote any particular religious belief. Previously no military chapel had ever been constructed without a cross, but the new policy dictated that henceforth, within the military, the religious sensitivies of all groups were to be scrupulously respected.&lt;ref name="lev"&gt;Lev, Aryeh, "The Impact of the Jewish Chaplaincy," Samuel D. Gershowitz Memorial Lecture, 1962, published by The National Jewish Welfare Board.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although some older military chapels still include religious symbols, and some older military installations (including [[United States Service academies]]) maintain chapels dedicated for specific religious worship, all current instructions and design manuals for new chapel construction and chapel usage follow this 1940 policy, explicitly prohibiting the use of permanent religious symbols, and even direct that temporary religious symbols should be displayed only during scheduled religious services.&lt;ref name="Armychapel"&gt;[http://www.chapnet.army.mil/Documents/r165_1.pdf Army Regulation 165-1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182411/http://www.chapnet.army.mil/Documents/r165_1.pdf# |date=2011-07-22 }}, December 3, 2009, pg. 36.

Portable religious symbols, icons, or statues may be used within a chapel during times of religious worship. Symbols are to be moved or covered when not in use during services. Distinctive religious symbols, such as crosses, crucifixes, the Star of David, Menorah, and other religious symbols will not be affixed or displayed permanently on the chapel interior, exterior, or grounds. Permanent or fixed chapel furnishings, such as the altar, pulpit, lectern, or communion rail will be devoid of distinctive religious symbols.&lt;ref name="Armychapel"/&gt;}}

The naval facilities design manual for chapels and religious educational facilities includes the following directions:

{{quote|Naval chapels differ from comparable facilities in civilian situations in a number of very significant ways. The most obvious of these is that although they are intended for religious purposes they are owned and operated by a secular institution....

Interfaith Function. A major difference between military and civilian facilities is that the former are nonsectarian and are designed to meet the needs of all military personnel and all faith groups within the same premises. The liturgical and theological understanding that is permanently reflected or given an image in these facilities must be that which is held in common by all religions. The implications of this for architecture are several: Architectural symbols, shapes, or configurations that are denominational or sectarian in character or association should not appear as exterior motifs. Neither should they be permanent elements of the interior within the spaces that are shared by the various faith groups. An exterior example is the spire; interior examples would include details suggestive of the Trinity, the Star of David, the cross, etc. Such symbolic devices may be appropriately among the portable and impermanent furnishings, but must not be fixed.&lt;ref name="Navychapel"/&gt;}}

Similarly, training manuals for religious program specialists prescribe that chapels should be set up with no religious symbols except when the spaces are prepared for religious services:
{{quote|When divine services or religious services are not in progress, the chapel facility should be configured to present a nonsectarian appearance. To do this, you should remove or cover all symbols, statues, or related objects which are characteristic of one particular faith group. How this is accomplished will vary according to the location and arrangement of the chapel. In some cases, items which have been permanently affixed within a chapel and do not present a nonsectarian appearance may be curtained, screened, covered, or possibly even removed. The command chaplain will instruct you as to what action should be taken in these circumstances. Once the facility has been rigged to reflect a nonsectarian appearance, it is a good practice to make and keep a diagram or photograph of the arrangement for future reference in the sacristy/vestry area. It may then be used by any RP who is assigned worship support functions in your facility. This practice may also be used to show the duty RP each arrangement used by each of the chaplains assigned to your facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/religion/14229/css/14229_156.htm Naval Education and Training Manual 14229, U.S. Navy Advancement, Religion Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Air force design policies include the statement, "Do not use religious symbols," in the section on "Exterior elements," and continue the theme in various sections that deal with interior elements as well.&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; For example, in the section on stained glass windows, instructions state "Use stained glass windows in the sanctuary, the blessed sacrament and reconciliation room, and the all faiths room. Ensure they do not contain religious symbols."&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; On the other hand, "The chapel should be easily identifiable with a high, steeply pitched roof over the primary worship space. The use of stained glass sets chapel facilities apart as places of beauty and spiritual inspiration."&lt;ref name="AFchapel"/&gt; The overall policy for religious symbols in air force chapels is summed up in the statement that "Because of their multi-faith use, these facilities must be religiously neutral in design, as well as flexible in their programming. Liturgical furnishings specific to individual faith groups must therefore be moveable and architectural form, images and permanent ornamentation acceptable to all users."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afcee.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070919-089.pdf USAF Religious Facilities Design Guide, Chapter 1, Section A]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Removing denominational symbols===
Policies vary among military services when it comes to removing permanent religious symbols from the building or grounds of military chapels that are inconsistent with these policies, and decisions to remove existing symbols have sometimes been met with controversy.

For example, there was some controversy in 2008 when the army announced plans to remove three wooden crosses outside the chapel serving military personnel in Kosovo’s "[[Camp Bondsteel]]," replacing them with a monument displaying the Chaplain Corps seal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2008/05/army-plans-to-remove-crosses-from.html "Army Plans to Remove Crosses from Kosovo Base Chapel Grounds"]. Retrieved May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Fox News Channel]], Lieutenant Colonel William D. Jenkins of the 35th Infantry Division's Kosovo Force 9 said that the Base Camp Planning Board approved the removal of the crosses in accordance with army regulations, which require the exterior to be free of any specific faith group symbols.&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,360004,00.html www.foxnews.com]. Retrieved June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins said that "The interior of each U.S. Army chapel reflects faith-specific signs, symbols, etc., during each faith group's service so that their faith is fully represented during their service...[but]The exterior of Army chapels is a different matter since the chapels are used by many different faith groups."&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"/&gt; He said that the crosses would still be used during special services, such as the Easter Sunrise Service.&lt;ref name="kosovochapel"/&gt;

Similarly, a cross was removed from a military chapel in Afghanistan in November 2011, at the "remote post" of Marmal, based on the army regulations prohibiting permanent symbols of any religion or faith group.

On the other hand, in June 1998, the [[National Naval Medical Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] added a crescent to the exterior wall of its chapel, where a cross and Star of David were already displayed, rather than removing all symbols and replacing them with a more inclusive symbol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paklinks.com/gs/religion-and-scripture/72204-first-muslim-chaplain-in-us-navy.html www.paklinks.com].

Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In at least one case a religious symbol has been removed from a chapel and then reinstated when local base leadership changed. In 1994, the commander of [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] in [[Groton, Connecticut]], at the recommendation of the base chaplain, had a cross removed from the top of the "Chapel on the Thames," also known as the "Sailors' Chapel" and the "Submarine Memorial Chapel." The cross, which was not part of the original chapel construction, but had been added some years later, was to be relocated within the chapel area where other religious symbols were kept.&lt;ref&gt;Messick, Sean, "Cross removal draws criticism," Norwich Bulletin, October 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; That action drew criticism from some individuals, including letters to the editor in the local civilian paper, and finally elicited an editorial in that paper defending the decision: "Men of many faiths lost their lives on submarines....The changes being made to Navy places of worship are part of a larger effort to become sensitive to the dignity of all people who serve in the military.... The Navy is a Navy not just of Christians, but of Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and others."&lt;ref&gt;"For everyone of faith," "The Day," October 15, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite positions articulated in statements such as this one, the next commanding officer had the cross replaced.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Based on conversations in 2008 regarding crosses outside the chapel at [[Naval Air Station Atsugi]] in [[Japan]], Navy policy sets a higher priority on removing permanent religious symbols from a chapel when it is the only chapel on a base.&lt;ref name="atsugi"&gt;Weaver, Teri, [http://www.stripes.com/news/atsugi-chapel-meeting-soothes-some-concerns-1.83242 "Atsugi chapel meeting soothes some concerns"], "Stars and Stripes, September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Where more than one chapel exists, Navy policy may be more lenient when it comes to existing symbols on one particular chapel.&lt;ref name="atsugi"/&gt; One example is Naval Station Norfolk's Frazier Hall, one of the Navy's oldest chapel complexes, where separate Catholic and Protestant chapels are co-located with Jewish and Muslim Chapels.&lt;ref name="bluestar"&gt;, Sternlicht, Stanford V., "Uriah Phillips Levy: The Blue Star Commodore," 1961, cited in Berent, Irwin M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=3onHPhlIR1MC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=commodore+levy+chapel+norfolk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YExc9lXKlG&amp;sig=L0ErDkO64G5zh2QdVrzYeaAKrag&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MZLeTZD6Oerz0gGp2IzgCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=commodore%20levy%20chapel%20norfolk&amp;f=false "Norfolk, Virginia: A Jewish History"], 2001.

====Erecting and removing religious symbols apart from chapels====
A slightly different issue involving a cross on a military base—but erected separately from a chapel as a memorial to marines killed in Afghanistan—involves a 13-foot cross erected on top of a hill at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, in California.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"&gt;Schapiro, Jeff, The Christian Post, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/aclj-veterans-cross-should-stay-62640 "ACLJ: Veterans Cross Should Stay," November 21, 2011]. Retrieved December 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Center for Law &amp; Justice]] is arguing on the part of those who erected the cross that it should be allowed to stay because "crosses are used as a widespread and universal symbol of remembrance," not just as religious symbols, while other groups, such as the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, are arguing that the cross should not be allowed to remain.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt; A similar cross was erected in 2003, but was destroyed in a fire, so the new cross has been created with "fire-retardant" material.&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt; A spokesman for Camp Pendleton was quoted as saying that the Camp Pendleton "legal staff is carefully researching and reviewing the topic in order to make a balanced and unbiased command recommendation that is ultimately supported by the law."&lt;ref name="pendletoncross"/&gt;

====Vandalism using religious symbols====
[[File:USAFA stone circle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dedication of the "Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle" at the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] for "Earth centered" worship]]
In 2010, vandals used a religious symbol in a negative way, adding a wooden cross to a non-Christian military worship area as an apparent attempt to make an anti-religious statement against the "[[Earth religion|Earth-centered"]] worship area ("stone circle") set aside at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] (USAFA) for the use of adherents of faith groups that identify themselves as "[[Paganism (contemporary religions)|Pagans]]," such as Wiccans or Druids.&lt;ref name="stonecircle"&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/crime-93686-hate-examples.html www.gazette.com].

Lieutenant General [[Michael C. Gould]], USAFA Superintendent, said that it was important that the academy support the religious needs of all cadets, and that [https://web.archive.org/web/20120303205729/http://www.adr.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070216-034.pdf USAF Instruction 36-2706] gives air force leaders guidance in terms of defining "religion" as "a personal set or institutional system of attitudes, moral or ethical beliefs and practices held with the strength of traditional religious views, characterized by ardor and faith and generally evidenced through specific religious observances."&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/02/05/cross-placed-air-force-pagan-circle-prompts-probe www.foxnews.com]. Retrieved June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gould said that the incident was being taken very seriously, because respect for the religious beliefs of others is an especially important lesson for USAFA cadets, who "learn that to succeed as an Air Force officer we must be able to support and respect the people who we lead, serve with and fight alongside even if they do not share our personal beliefs.... Cadets learn that every servicemember is charged with defending freedom for all Americans and that includes the freedom to practice a religion of their choice or to not practice any religion at all."&lt;ref name="gould"/&gt;

Academy officials took actions to send a clear message that the "Cadet Chapel Falcon Circle," the area set aside for Earth-centered worship, "is to be treated with respect and dignity, just as any other religious structure or location."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/academy-93565-longcrier-worship.html www.gazette.com].

===Lack of symbols as symbol===
It has been pointed out that in some ways the lack of permanent symbols itself becomes a symbol: "a visible symbol of how people of different beliefs can not only tolerate one another, they can live in the same house."

==Symbols in National Cemeteries==

Retrieved June 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the creation of the national army that was established at the beginning of the Civil War that army regulations (General Orders Number 75, September 11, 1861) assigned the national commanders of the military with the responsibility for burials and grave markings—and the Quartermaster General of the Army was tasked with providing the actual "headboards."&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt; Much later, following World War I, a board of officers approved the white marble headstone, slightly rounded at the top—and for the first time, two specific religious markings (the Latin Cross for Christians, and the Star of David for Jews) were authorized for use.&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt; Changes in construction and designed continued to be made, and in February 1951, he Secretary of the Army approved the addition of a Buddhist emblem in addition to the Cross and the Star.&lt;ref name="headstones"/&gt;

Today, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) establishes policies for religious symbols on headstones and markers in [[United States National Cemeteries]], although the [[United States Department of the Army|US Department of the Army]] continues to oversee two of them, including [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt; In contrast with the small number of religious symbols that have been approved by DOD over the years for chaplain insignia, the VA has approved over forty five separate religious symbols for use on cemetery headstones and markers (those used in national cemeteries and those issued to families of eligible veterans for use in private cemeteries) and has a process in place to consider and approve additional religious symbols based on requests by the next of kin of the deceased.&lt;ref name="VA"/&gt;

Although current procedures allow for speedy approvals of new religious symbols, the pentacle (the pentagram within a circle), the symbol now used for Wiccan headstones and markers, was approved only after ten years of efforts that concluded with a lawsuit against the VA, resulting in a settlement that accorded that symbol the same status as any other religious or belief system allowed.&lt;ref name="cemetery"&gt;Miller, Geralda [http://www.rgj.com/article/20070424/NEWS10/704240336/Wiccan-symbol-now-official-national-memorials "Wiccan symbols now official for national memorials], RGC.com. Retrieved May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] represented the plaintiffs, saying that "we uncovered evidence that the reason the pentagram hadn't been approved was straightforward religious bias....

===Flag folding===
[[File:USAF Honor Guard flag folding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|USAF personnel follow the traditional steps of folding the [[American flag]] during a ceremony at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany]]
Although no symbol incorporated into the design of the American flag has ever officially been given religious meaning by the United States government, there is a military ceremony of folding the flag into a triangle&lt;ref name="flaghistory"&gt;[http://usflagsupply.com/pages/FlagInfo.htm usflagsupply.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531041737/http://www.usflagsupply.com/pages/FlagInfo.htm# |date=2011-05-31 }}.

Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origin of the tradition or the words that accompany it is uncertain, although it is believed that it most likely began during World War I "when patriotism was high and the United States Flag was universally embraced as a national symbol".&lt;ref name="flaghistory"/&gt;

Over the years, various "scripts" have been developed for such ceremonies, to be read at each step of the folding, and some of these have linked the flag to religion in general or to a specific religious faith group in particular.&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt; Because such scripts can give the impression that either Congress or the military (or a specific branch of the military) had assigned a specific religious significance to the military tradition of folding the flag, military efforts have been made to ensure that any words recited during the ceremony avoid giving such an impression.&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt; So, for example, the Air Force issued an official flag folding script in 2006 which ends with these words:
{{quote|Since 1776 no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom... Today's Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us, for generations to come.

By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag, and express our gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their responsibility ... our responsibility ... to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today.

The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy, as a beacon of hope to one and all. Long may it wave."&lt;ref name="folding"/&gt;}}

Air Force Instruction 34-1201 includes the following guidance:
{{quote|The Air Force developed a script which provides an historical perspective on the flag. There are no ceremonies
in the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag is folded. However, when a flag folding ceremony is
desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script is the only one which may be used. This includes printing in programs and/or any handouts."&lt;ref name="AFI 34-1201"/&gt;}}

The Veterans Administration has published guidance that the reading of religious words to accompany the folding of the flags at burials within V.A. cemeteries will be allowed when requested by the family of the deceased.&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;[http://www.legion.org/flag/folding www.legion.org]. Retrieved June 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as the [[American Legion]] offer versions of the script that include religious meanings, and current V.A. policy is that "Volunteer honor guards will accept requests for recitations that reflect any or no religious traditions, on an equal basis."&lt;ref name="burial"/&gt; However, the volunteers should be relatives or friends, rather than "federal employees" of the Veterans Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,155003,00.html www.military.com].

===Flag "dipping"===
At the [[United States Naval Academy]], a tradition developed that included marching flags, including the American flag, up the aisle of the chapel during Protestant services, briefly dipping the flags toward the altar.&lt;ref name="dipping"&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewsContent/0,13319,162582,00.html www.military.com].

In the Fall of 2007, when complaints were made that dipping the flag toward a religious altar was inappropriate, then-academy Superintendent Vice Admiral [[Jeffrey Fowler]] directed that the practice be discontinued.&lt;ref name="dipping"/&gt; However, after some controversy, the practice was reinstated.&lt;ref name="dipping"/&gt;

===Bible verses on weapons===
{{See also|Trijicon biblical verses controversy}}
In January 2010 news reports revealed that [[Trijicon]], a [[Wixom, Michigan]]-based contractor used by the United States military, had been inscribing "secret codes" for [[New Testament]] Bible verses on rifle scopes used by United States Army and Marine Corps forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]].&lt;ref name="rifles"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-military-weapons-inscribed-secret-jesus-bible-codes/story?id=9575794 abcnews.go.com, January 18, 2010].

United States military leaders reacted with surprise, expressing concern based on the fact that "U.S. military rules specifically prohibit the proselytizing of any religion in Iraq or Afghanistan and were drawn up in order to prevent criticism that the U.S. was embarked on a religious 'Crusade' in its war against [[Al-Qaeda|al Qaeda]] and Iraqi insurgents."&lt;ref name="rifles"/&gt; Defense Department photos revealed that the rifles that included the verses were being used by Iraqi forces that included Muslims who had no knowledge of the Christian Bible verses on the sights.&lt;ref name="rifles3"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2010-01-19-Military-weapons_N.htm www.usatoday.com, January 20, 2010].

[[ABC News|ABC]] news consultant and retired army Major General William Nash was quoted by ABC news as saying he had "no problem" with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to United States troops.

For a number of reasons, including the fact that "one Bible does not fit all", and different chaplains and religious communities preferred different versions of the Bible, such items are no longer printed by the GPO, but "instead publishers may apply for a national stock number their items and chaplains can order the supplies they wish to use or have on hand for distribution to their service members."&lt;ref name="laing"/&gt; Through this process, "there are numerous versions of the Bible available for order through official channels with government funds."&lt;ref name="laing"/&gt;

June 2012 news sources announced that permission granted to use military emblems on Bibles had been revoked, with publishers notified in 2011 that the decision was made based on new military trademark licensing issues.&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/group-calls-military-bibles-threat-to-national-security.html# |title=Radio.foxnews.com, June 12, 2012 |access-date=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616003800/http://radio.foxnews.com/toddstarnes/top-stories/group-calls-military-bibles-threat-to-national-security.html# |archive-date=2012-06-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One navy spokesman quoted in a Fox News online report stated that the decision was a "trademark issue," and "not a matter of religion."&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"/&gt; Additionally, the Department of Defense announced that all Bibles with military emblems must be removed from military stores.&lt;ref name="citizenlinkbibles"&gt;[http://www.citizenlink.com/2012/06/14/defense-department-yanks-bibles-with-military-service-insignias-from-shelves citizenlink.com, June 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Religious Freedom Foundation had threatened to sue the government if permission to use military emblems on Bibles was not revoked, noting that the Bibles were both an "unconstitutional government endorsement of religion" and a "national security threat."&lt;ref name="foxnewsbibles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="citizenlinkbibles"/&gt;

===Prayer coins and military emblems===
The use of military emblems on "prayer coins" created by the "American Defenders of Freedom" (ADOF), distributed at no charge to military chaplains only if the chaplains clearly indicate on the order forms "how tracts/coins will be used for evangelism"
is another example of a controversy regarding military symbols and religious materials.&lt;ref name="coins"&gt;[http://pubrecord.org/religion/847/army-chief-of-chaplains-promotes-ministry-that-called-navy-secretary-satanic/ pubrecord.org].

Retrieved June 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ADOF materials state that: "To obtain our materials without charge the Chaplain must describe in his/her order how our materials will be used in an evangelism process to share the Gospel message of Jesus Christ. Chaplains will be required to pay for Prayer Coins used for other than ministry purposes, such as awards, recognitions, remembrances, etc."&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt; Additionally, ADOF notes that "Prayer Tracts and Prayer Reminder Coins are provided without charge to Chaplains for evangelistic Christian Ministry to troops, sailors, airmen and marines. Coins may also be purchased for special uses other than ministry…"&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt;

While coins had the emblems of the army, navy, and air force until 2008, Secretary of the Navy [[Donald C. Winter]] withdrew Navy permission to use its seal, necessitating a redesign of the coins to include army and air force emblems—announced in ADOF's January 2008 newsletter with the following statement: ""The Navy Prayer Reminder Coin was completely re-designed (an improvement) because the Secretary of the Navy would not give permission to use the official Navy seal on the Navy Prayer Reminder Coin – Satan is always at work."&lt;ref name="coins"/&gt;

===Female non-Muslim military personnel wearing Muslim religious apparel===

While most issues involving the military and religious apparel involve requests from service personnel for permission to wear apparel required by their own religions, in December 2001 air force Lieutenant Colonel [[Martha McSally]] (a graduate of the Air Force Academy, and then the highest-ranking female fighter pilot in the air force) sued the air force because of the policy that required female military personnel assigned to bases in Saudi Arabia to wear the Muslim [[abaya]], a "head-to-toe" robe, whenever they were off base.&lt;ref name="abaya"&gt;[http://www.armytimes.com/legacy/new/1-292925-725903.php www.armytimes.com].

Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; McSally's suit alleged that "the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men."&lt;ref name="now"/&gt; In addition to the issue of religious garb, McSally noted that policies also included other requirements:

{{quote|In a "60 Minutes" interview broadcast on CBS on Jan. 20, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy: "I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male . . . [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife," she said. "I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle.&lt;ref name="now"/&gt;}}

General [[Tommy Franks]], head of the United States [[United States Central Command|Central Command]], announced in 2002 that women would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be "encouraged" to do so as a show of respect for local customs.&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; Commenting on the change—which was strongly criticized by Saudi officials as both a violation of Islamic law and Saudi sovereignty—Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit, but had already been "under review" before the lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a [[court martial]] if she did not comply and wear the abaya.&lt;ref name="relents"&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Pentagon-relents-on-Arabic-dress-policy-for-women-1078347.php www.seattlepi.com]. Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for "women diplomats" assigned to the United States Embassy in [[Riyadh]], who were actually encouraged not to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, "because they are representing the United States."&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; Embassy officials stated that "in their personal time, embassy employees can choose how to dress."&lt;ref name="abaya"/&gt; According to these United States officials, "the Saudi government does not require non-Muslim women to wear a dark robe known as an abaya.... The official guidance, issued by the Saudi Embassy in Washington, says that foreigners should dress conservatively but they are not required to wear the robe."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-24-mcsally.htm www.usatoday.com]. Retrieved July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Congress "approved legislation that prohibited anyone in the military from requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers’ money to buy them."&lt;ref name="hijab"&gt;[http://themoderatevoice.com/102140/should-our-servicewomen-in-afghanistan-have-to-wear-headscarves themoderatevoice.com]. Retrieved July 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a decade after the abaya requirement was rescinded in Saudi Arabia, "strong encouragement" to wear the [[hijab]], a female headscarf, was the military policy in force for female personnel stationed in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; Some female personnel wear it over their helmets and some chose to wear the scarves in place of their helmets.&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; According to McSally, "Some servicewomen have taken off the regulation helmet and worn just the scarf, even when on patrol outside, in their combat uniforms and body armor, M-4s slung over their shoulders. The more common practice is to wear the scarf under one’s helmet or around the neck, pulling it on as the servicewoman removes her [[Kevlar]] [[Kevlar helmet|helmet]] upon entering a village or building."&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt;

While the military defends the policy of encouragement to wear the hijab as a "sign of respect" to the local culture that ""can help promote greater trust and a fuller interaction with the local population," McSally, who retired from the air force as a colonel, said that "especially in combat settings," when a superior tells a military subordinate that a practice is encouraged, "the very mention of the practice creates pressure to comply."&lt;ref name="hijab"/&gt; In a February 18, 2011 op-ed in "The Washington Post," she said that the policy of encouraging women to wear the "Muslim headscarves" is "appeasement, not respect" and that "American servicewomen will continue to be viewed as second-class warriors if leaders push them to take up the customs of countries where women are second-class citizens."&lt;ref name="mcsally"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021802446.html www.washingtonpost.com]. Retrieved July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote that "Top military leaders should issue guidance that U.S. servicewomen are not authorized to wear a Muslim headscarf while in their uniform conducting military duties. If they don't, Congress should intervene again, as they did on the abaya, and prohibit its wear."&lt;ref name="mcsally"/&gt;

==Chaplains as symbol==

The basic words "chaplain" and "chapel" are derived from an ancient story about symbols of religion and faith:

{{quote|The story is told about [[St. Martin of Tours]], a compassionate fourth century soldier, who encountered a shivering beggar on a cold winter night. Having no money in his purse, this soldier took off his cloak and slashed it with his sword to give half of it to the beggar. Later that night he saw a vision in which Jesus Christ was wearing the half-cloak. As a result of this experience he became a Christian and was baptized. Ultimately he left the army to devote his life to the church. In time he became the [[patron saint]] of the French kings of the Middle Ages. St. Martin's cloak (cappella) was carried into battle by the kings as a banner signifying "the presence of God." But since the cappella was a sacred [[relic]] of the church, a priest went along as custodian. This keeper of the cloak, or cappellanus, also tended the king's religious needs, and from his office was derived that of "chaplain." The depository for the cloak became the 'chapel,' the place of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iphc.org/chaplaincy/etymology-word-chaplain www.iphc.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055258/http://www.iphc.org/chaplaincy/etymology-word-chaplain# |date=2011-09-28 }}. Retrieved July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chaplains no longer guard a "relic" like St. Martin's cloak, but they themselves have been called symbols of service, faith, hope, and cooperation across faith lines, and even reminders of "the presence of God" in stories such as that of the "[[Four Chaplains]]" (sometimes referred to as the "Immortal Chaplains")&lt;ref&gt;[http://immortalchaplains.org/home.htm Immortal Chaplains website]. Retrieved July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;—two ministers, a Catholic priest, and a rabbi—who each gave up his life jacket to save others when the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} was torpedoed during WWII, and the four Army chaplains ministered to the wounded and dying until they themselves died.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;The Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation. [http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html The Saga of the Four Chaplains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302222606/http://www.fourchaplains.org/story.html |date=2000-03-02 }}. Retrieved May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; That story, told in print, art, and film has become a symbol of "interfaith in action," the phrase used by the Four Chaplains Memorial Foundation, and included on the 1948 postage stamp dedicated to their memory.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; [[Vassar College]] professor [[Deborah Dash Moore]] has referred to the story of the Four Chaplains by saying that "The symbolism of their deaths exemplified faith confronting diversity, the triumph of cooperation over religious competition, the ultimate sacrifice by officers for their men, the power of duty over death."&lt;ref name="ddm"&gt;Moore, Deborah Dash, "Worshipping together in uniform: Christians and Jews in World War II," The 2001 Swig Lecture, University of San Francisco, September 13, 2001, from a reprint published by the Swig Judaic Studies Program, University of San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Toronto]] professor Doris L. Bergen has written that because of the "chaos and terror" encountered during military service, the chaplain becomes "a symbol that somehow, even in the midst of death and fear, there is meaning," and a symbol of the ability to maintain "courage, hope, and steadfastness in the face of alienation and destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Doris L., "The Sword of the Lord: Military chaplains from the first to the twenty-first century," University of Notre Dame Press, 2010, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a letter from the three military Chiefs of Chaplains that was included in the 2003 edition of the American Bible Society's "Armed Forces Bible," chaplains are "a visible reminder of the Holy."&lt;ref name ="armedforcesbible2"&gt;American Bible Society Good News Translation, Armed Forces Bible, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an August 2011 Washington Post "Guest Voice" op-ed noted that:

{{quote|In both religion and the military, symbols carry powerful messages. For generations our armed forces chaplains, spiritual leaders in military uniforms, have themselves served as symbols: symbols of faith during times of chaos; of hope during times of despair; and of dreams during times of nightmares. Chaplains have symbolized for countless men and women in uniform that even in war we do not leave our dreams behind; that even during the worst of times we must continue to believe that better times—even the best of times—are yet to come.&lt;ref name="onfaithguestvoice"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/a-new-symbol-for-americas-military-chaplains/2011/08/09/gIQAmvEm5I_blog.html#pagebreak Washington Post "On Faith" Guest Voice, August 9, 2011]. Retrieved August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For both military personnel and civilians, the work of chaplains became a symbol of cooperation that crossed many lines, including racial lines at a time when such cooperation was considered noteworthy (and even newsworthy) in the civilian community—as evidenced by a 1943 newsreel of Army Chaplain School training (then at [[Harvard University]]) which featured captions such as "White and Negro chaplains come out of the school building and march," and "White and Negro Chaplains perform a drill at Harvard University Chaplain School in Cambridge, Massachusetts."&lt;ref name="whiteandnegro"&gt;[http://www.criticalpast.com/video/65675022031_Harvard-University_Chaplain-school_performing-a-drill_come-out-of-school www.criticalpast.com]. Retrieved July 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have noted that interfaith cooperation among chaplains in the military led to improved interfaith relations in America—to the point that, at least according to some, it actually "transformed religion in America in the postwar period"&lt;ref name="ddm"/&gt;
Civilian communities felt the impact where former chaplains left the military to take positions at civilian houses of worship, but even where that did not happen, citizens were affected by the stories of military personnel and their chaplains, which became symbols of both cooperation across faith lines and faith in the face of adversity.&lt;ref name="ddm"/&gt; Additionally, the military chaplain became a symbol in some religious communities (such as the Jewish community) for the kind of spiritual leader its members desired for themselves:
[[File:Reagan Speech Beirut Bombing.ogv|thumb|right|200px|President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s keynote speech to the Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]]'s "Baptist Fundamentalism '84" convention: the story of chaplains as "symbols of faith" in the wake of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|1983 Beirut barracks bombing]].]]

{{quote|Rabbi [[Wolfe Kelman]] has asserted that a whole generation of American Jews that served during World War II saw in the Jewish chaplain the model for rabbinic function, and in the all-inclusive Jewish chapel program the model for synagogue function, for post-war America. When they moved into the suburbs and left behind the complex of communal service agencies that had served them in the older Jewish neighborhoods, they carried with them a clear idea of what kind of synagogue they needed and what kind of rabbi they wanted to lead them in the enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kollin, Gilbert, "The impact of the military chaplaincy on the American Rabbinate: 1861–1976," published in Rosenthal, Gilbert (editor), "The American Rabbi," KTAV Publishing House, 1977."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When President Reagan quoted the words that the service of chaplains during and after the 1983 Beirut bombing symbolized that "we Americans still believed that we could be proud of our particular religions and yet work side by side when the time came to help others, to comfort, and to ease pain," that speech was one of many that saw the presence of military chaplains as both a symbol of faith and a symbol of interfaith cooperation and respect.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt; In the words of that report:

{{quote|To understand the role of the chaplain...is to understand that we try to remind others, and perhaps ourselves as well, to cling to our humanity even in the worst of times. We bring with us the wisdom of men and women whose faith has kept alive their dreams in ages past. We bring with us the images of what the world could be, of what we ourselves might be, drawn from the visions of prophets and the promises of our holy books. We bring with us the truth that faith not only reminds us of the holy in heaven, but also of the holiness we can create here on Earth. It brings not only a message of what is divine, but also of what it means to be truly human. It's too easy to give in to despair in a world sometimes seemingly filled with cruelty and brutality. But we must remember not just the depths to which humans might sink, but also the heights to which they may aspire.&lt;ref name="reagan"/&gt;}}

'''Sāssān''' ([[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] &gt; [[Persian language|Persian]] ساسان, also known as Sasan), considered the eponymous ancestor of the [[House of Sasan|Sasanian (or Sassanid) Dynasty]] (ruled 224-651) in [[Persian Empire | Persia]], was "a great warrior and hunter" and a [[Zoroastrian]] high priest in [[Fars province|Pars]]. He lived some time near the fall of the [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid (Parthian) Empire]] in the early 3rd century CE.

==Identity of Sasan==
===Medieval sources===
There are many slightly different stories concerning Sasan and his relation to [[Ardashir I]], the founder of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. The northern Iranian historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] mentions that Sasan married a princess of the [[Bazrangi|Bāzarangid]] family, the vassal dynasty of [[Fars province|Pārs]], and that Sasan was a grandfather of Ardashir I, while [[Papak]] is named as Ardashir I's father.{{sfn|Frye|1983|p=116-117}}

According to the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] book of [[Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan]], Sasan's wife was a daughter of a nobleman called Papak. The marriage was arranged by Papak after hearing that Sasan has "[[Achaemenid Empire|Achamenian (Achaemenid) blood in him]]". Their son was Ardashir I. Sasan vanishes shortly after Ardashir appears in the story and Papak is "considered the father of Ardashir".{{sfn|Frye|1983|p=116-117}}

These stories on different relations between Ardashir, Pāpak, and Sāsān have, according to Frye, a Zoroastrian explanation.{{sfn|Frye|1983|p=116-117}} Sasan was indeed the father of Ardashir and "disappears" from the story after the birth of Ardashir. Similar to the current Zoroastrian practices, Papak had then taken the responsibility of his daughter and her son Ardashir after Sasan "disappears" and is named afterwards as the father of Ardashir.{{sfn|Frye|1983|p=116-117}}

In the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht#Inscriptions|Kabe Zartosht inscription]] of Shapur I the Great, the four named persons "Sasan, Papak, Ardashir, Shapur" have different titles: Sasan is named as ''hwataw''{{sfn|Kohl et al|2008|p=114}} or ''xwadāy''{{sfn|Daryaee|2010|p=240}} ("the lord", usually given to sovereigns of small local principalities{{sfn|Kohl et al|2008|p=114}}), Papak as ''[[shah]]'', Ardashir as ''shāhanshāh'' ("King of Kings of the Sasanian Empire") and Shapur as "King of Kings of [[Iran]] and [[Aniran]]".{{sfn|Frye|1983|p=116-117}}

===Modern sources===
However, according to [[Touraj Daryaee]], Sasanian sources cannot be trusted because they were from the royal Sasanian archives, which were made by the court, in the words of Daryaee, "to fit the world-view of the late Sasanian world".{{sfn|Daryaee|2010}} Daryaee and several other scholars state that Sasan had his name from a deity who was known in many parts of [[Asia]] but not in Fars, the homeland of the Sasanians, which thus means that Sasan was an Iranian foreigner from the west or the east who had settled in Fars, whose inhabitants did not know about this deity he believed in.{{sfn|Daryaee|2010}} Sasan later managed to become the priest of the important Anahid temple in [[Estakhr]],{{sfn|Shahbazi|2005}} the capital of Fars. According to the [[Bundahishn]], which according to Daryaee was made independently and not by the Sasanian court, Sasan's daughter later married [[Papak]] and bore him Ardashir.{{sfn|Daryaee|2010}} Furthermore, the Bundahishn states that Sasan was the son of a certain Weh-afrid.{{sfn|Daryaee|2010}}

==Politics of the Sasanian family==
The political ambition of Sasan was evoked by the troubles and weakness of the [[Parthian empire#Fall|last years of the Parthian empire]]. According to [[Tabari]], Papak managed to consolidate his power with the help of his own sons Shapur and [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]].{{sfn|Shahbazi|2005}} This is considered the beginning of [[Sasanian Empire#Origins and early history (205–310)|the Sasanian dynasty]].

Sasan's family became the rulers of the second Persian Empire and ruled over a great portion of western Asia (the first Persian Empire having been ruled by the dynasty of [[Cyrus the Great]]). The three founders of this new empire – that is, Papak and his two sons – are depicted and mentioned on the wall of the harem of Xerxes at [[Persepolis]], a remnant site of the [[Achaemenids]], a representation suggested to be the evidence of a claim to Achaemenid heritage likely later added.{{sfn|Shahbazi|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Shaktism''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Śāktaḥ}}'', lit., "doctrine of energy, power, the Goddess") is a major tradition of [[Hinduism]], wherein the metaphysical reality is considered metaphorically feminine Adi Parashakti is supreme &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Parashakti|title=Adi Parashakti - Wikipedia|website=en.m.wikipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The [[Sruti]] and [[Smriti]] texts of Hinduism are an important historical framework of the Shaktism tradition. In addition, it reveres the texts ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]'', the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'', and [[Shakta Upanishads]] such as the [[Devi Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James Ryan|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZET2sSUVsgC|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0816054589|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Devi Mahatmya'' in particular, is considered in Shaktism to be as important as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ludo |last=Rocher| year= 1986| authorlink= Ludo Rocher| title= The Puranas| publisher= Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn= 978-3447025225|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaktism is known for its various sub-traditions of [[Tantra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katherine Anne Harper|author2=Robert L.

It consists of the Vidyapitha and [[Kulamārga]]. The pantheon of goddesses in Shaktism grew after the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], wherein [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] goddesses were combined to form the [[Mahavidya]], a list of ten goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis.

==Origins and history==
One of the earliest evidence of reverence for the feminine aspect of God in Hinduism appears in chapter 10.125 of the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', also called the Devi Suktam hymn:{{Sfn|June McDaniel|2004|p=90}}{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|p=26}}&lt;ref name="Hymn 125"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship.
     Thus gods have established me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in.
Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them, – each man who sees, breathes, hears the word outspoken.
     They know it not, yet I reside in the essence of the Universe. Hear, one and all, the truth as I declare it.
I, verily, myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome.
     I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him nourished, a sage, and one who knows [[Brahman]].
I bend the bow for Rudra [Shiva], that his arrow may strike, and slay the hater of devotion.
     I rouse and order battle for the people, I created Earth and Heaven and reside as their Inner Controller.
On the world's summit I bring forth sky the Father: my home is in the waters, in the ocean as Mother.
     Thence I pervade all existing creatures, as their Inner Supreme Self, and manifest them with my body.
I created all worlds at my will, without any higher being, and permeate and dwell within them.
     The eternal and infinite consciousness is I, it is my greatness dwelling in everything.
&lt;/poem&gt;
–[[Devi]] Sukta, ''Rigveda 10.125.3 – 10.125.8'',{{Sfn|June McDaniel|2004|p=90}}{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|p=26}}&lt;ref name="Hymn 125"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Rig_Veda/Mandala_10/Hymn_125 The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 125] Ralph T.H. Griffith (Translator); for Sanskrit original see: [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१२५ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.१२५]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Vedic literature reveres various goddesses, but far less frequently than gods [[Indra]], [[Agni]] and [[Soma (deity)|Soma]]. Yet, they are declared equivalent aspects of gender neutral [[Brahman]], of [[Prajapati]] and [[Purusha]]. The goddesses often mentioned in the Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vac (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (annihilator), Shraddha (faith, confidence).&lt;ref name="Melton2010p2600"/&gt; Goddesses such as Uma appear in the [[Upanishad]]s as another aspect of Brahman and the knower of ultimate knowledge, such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient ''[[Kena Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen34&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Part 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=207–208, 211–213 verses 14–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=charleskenaprose&gt;Charles Johnston, Kena Upanishad in The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, (1920–1931), The Mukhya Upanishads, Kshetra Books, {{ISBN|978-1-4959-4653-0}} (Reprinted in 2014), [http://www.universaltheosophy.com/pdf-library/Kena%20Upanishad_Johnston.pdf Archive of Kena Upanishad - Part 3 as published in Theosophical Quarterly, pages 229–232]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hymns to goddesses are in the ancient Hindu epic ''Mahabharata'', particularly in the later (100 to 300 CE) added ''Harivamsa'' section of it.&lt;ref name="FulkersonBriggs139"/&gt; The archaeological and textual evidence implies, states Thomas Coburn, that the Goddess had become as much a part of the Hindu tradition, as God, by about the third or fourth century.{{Sfn|Coburn|2002|p=7}} The literature on Shakti theology grew in ancient India, climaxing in one of the most important texts of Shaktism called the ''Devi Mahatmya''. This text, states C. Mackenzie Brown – a professor of Religion, is both a culmination of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine feminine, as well as a foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the feminine transcendence in centuries that followed.&lt;ref name="FulkersonBriggs139"&gt;{{cite book|author=NB Saxena|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theology (Editors: Mary McClintock Fulkerson, Sheila Briggs) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aBxZRMUHw0C |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-927388-1 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Devi-Mahatmya'' is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states [[Thomas B. Coburn]] – a professor of Religious Studies, but "it is surely the earliest in which the object of worship is conceptualized as Goddess, with a capital G".{{Sfn|Coburn|1991|p=16}}

Other important texts of Shaktism include the ''[[Shakta Upanishads]]'',{{sfn|Krishna Warrier|1999|pages=ix-x}} as well as Shakta-oriented [[Puranas|Upa Puranic literature]] such as the ''Devi Purana'' and ''[[Kalika Purana]]'',{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|1996|page=164}} the ''[[Lalita sahasranama|Lalita Sahasranama]]'' (from the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'').{{sfn|Dikshitar|1999|pages=1–36}}{{sfn|Brown|1998|pages=8, 17, 10, 21, 320}} The ''[[Tripura Upanishad]]'' is historically the most complete introduction to Shakta Tantrism,{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=xiii–xiv}} distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition.{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=xvi}} Along with the ''Tripura Upanishad'', the ''[[Tripuratapini Upanishad]]'' has attracted scholarly [[bhasya]] (commentary) in the second half of 2nd-millennium, such as by [[Bhaskararaya]],{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=37-38}} and by Ramanand.{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|p=221 with note 64}} These texts link the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute,{{Sfn|Dasgupta|1996|p=3}} however this link has been contested by scholars.{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=xiii–xiv, xvi, 21}}&lt;ref name=hughurban/&gt;

==Theology==
{{double image|right| Ardhanari.jpg |135| God marriage AS.jpg |160| In Shakta theology, the feminine and masculine are interdependent realities, represented with [[Ardhanarishvara]] icon. Left: A 5th century art work representing this idea at the [[Elephanta Caves]]; Right: a painting of Ardhanarishvara.}}
Shaktas conceive the Goddess as the supreme, ultimate, eternal reality of all existence, or same as the Brahman concept of Hinduism. She is considered to be simultaneously the source of all creation, its embodiment and the energy that animates and governs it, and that into which everything will ultimately dissolve.{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|1996|page=1}}&lt;ref name="Melton2010p2600"/&gt; According to V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar – a professor of Indian history, in Shaktism theology "Brahman is static Shakti and Shakti is dynamic Brahman."{{sfn|Dikshitar|1999|pages=77-78}}

Shaktism views the Devi as the source, essence and substance of everything in creation.&lt;ref name="Melton2010p2600"/&gt; Its texts such as the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'' states:

{{quote|I am Manifest Divinity, Unmanifest Divinity, and Transcendent Divinity. I am [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], as well as [[Saraswati]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Parvati]]. I am the Sun and I am the Stars, and I am also the Moon. I am all animals and birds, and I am the outcaste as well, and the thief. I am the low person of dreadful deeds, and the great person of excellent deeds. I am Female, I am Male in the form of Shiva.{{efn|''Srimad Devi Bhagavatam'', VII.33.13-15, cited in Brown 1991{{sfn|Brown|1991|page=186}}&lt;!-- retain as translation --&gt;}} }}

Shaktism's focus on the Divine Feminine does not imply a rejection of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi is considered to be the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Neela B Saxena| editor1=Mary McClintock Fulkerson|editor2=Sheila Briggs|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aBxZRMUHw0C |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927388-1|pages=134–138, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality.{{sfn|Brown|1991|page=217}} In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as [[Ardhanari]].{{sfn|Yadav|2001}}

The philosophical premises in many Shakta texts, states June McDaniel – a professor of Religious Studies, is syncretism of [[Samkhya]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], called ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti).{{Sfn|June McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}

===Devi Gita===
The seventh book of the ''Devi-Bhagavata Purana'' presents the theology of Shaktism.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=170}} This book is called ''Devi Gita'', or the "Song of the Goddess".{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=170}}{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|p=1-2, 85-98}} The Goddess explains she is the Brahman that created the world, asserting the Advaita premise that spiritual liberation occurs when one fully comprehends the identity of one's soul and the Brahman.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=170}}{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|p=12-17}} This knowledge, asserts the Goddess, comes from detaching self from the world and meditating on one's own soul.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|p=170}}{{Sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2015|pp=131-138}}

The ''Devi Gita'', like the ''Bhagavad Gita'', is a condensed philosophical treatise.{{Sfn|C Mackenzie Brown|1990|pp=179-198}} It presents the divine female as a powerful and compassionate creator, pervader and protector of the universe.{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|pp=1-3}} She is presented in the opening chapter of the ''Devi Gita'' as the benign and beautiful world-mother, called ''Bhuvaneshvari'' (literally, ruler of the universe).{{Sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2014|p=26-28}}{{Sfn|C Mackenzie Brown|1990|pp=179-198}} Thereafter, the text presents its theological and philosophical teachings.{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|pp=1-3}}

The ''Devi Gita'' describes the Devi (or Goddess) as "universal, cosmic energy" resident within each individual. It thus weaves in the terminology of [[Samkhya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|pp=1-3}} The text is suffused with [[Advaita Vedanta]] ideas, wherein nonduality is emphasized, all dualities are declared as incorrect, and interconnected oneness of all living being's soul with Brahman is held as the liberating knowledge.{{Sfn|Cheever Mackenzie Brown|1998|pp=1-3, 12-17}}{{Sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2015|pp=9, 34, 89-90, 131-138}}{{Sfn|Lynn Foulston|Stuart Abbott|2009|pp=15-16}} However, adds Tracy Pintchman – a professor of Religious Studies and Hinduism, ''Devi Gita'' incorporates Tantric ideas giving the Devi a form and motherly character rather than the gender-neutral concept of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta.{{Sfn|Tracy Pintchman|2014|p=9-10}}

===Tantra===
Sub-traditions of Shaktism include "Tantra", which refers to techniques, practices and ritual grammar involving ''[[mantra]]'', ''[[yantra]]'', ''nyasa'', ''[[mudra]]'' and certain elements of traditional [[kundalini yoga]], typically practiced under the guidance of a qualified [[guru]] after due initiation (''[[diksha]]'') and oral instruction to supplement various written sources.{{sfn|Brooks|1990|pages=47-72}} There has been a historic debate between Shakta theologians on whether its tantric practices are Vedic or non-Vedic.{{sfn|Brooks|1990|page=xii}}{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=xiii–xiv, xvi, 21}}&lt;ref name=hughurban/&gt;

The roots of Shakta Tantrism are unclear, probably ancient and independent of the Vedic tradition of Hinduism. The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century,{{Sfn|Brooks|1990|p=xii}} and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Samuel (2010), Tantric Revisionings, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120827523}}, pages 60–61, 87–88, 351–356&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaktas approach the Devi in many forms; however, they are all considered to be but diverse aspects of the one supreme goddess.{{sfn|Kinsley|1987}}{{sfn|Kali|2003|page=149}} The primary Devi form worshiped by a Shakta devotee is his or her ''[[Ishta-deva|ishta-devi]]'', that is a personally selected Devi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Monaghan|title=Goddesses in World Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qotjet-Hb0MC |year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35465-6|pages=26, 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of this deity can depend on many factors, such as family tradition, regional practice, guru lineage and personal resonance.{{sfn|Kinsley|1987|pp=102-104}}

Some forms of the goddess are widely known in the Hindu world. The common goddesses of Shaktism, popular in the Hindu thought at least by about mid 1st-millennium CE, include [[Parvati]], Durga, Kali, Amba, Tripurasundari, Lakshmi (and her avatars such as Radha, Sita), and Saraswati.{{sfn|Kinsley|1987|pp=1-5}}&lt;ref name="Melton2010p2600"/&gt; The rarer forms of Devi found among tantric Shakta are the Mahavidyas, particularly Tara, Bhairavi, Chhinnamasta, Kamala and Buvaneshwari.{{sfn|Kinsley|1987|pp=161-165}}{{sfn|Kinsley|1998}} Other major goddess groups include the ''[[Matrikas|Sapta-Matrika]]'' ("Seven Little Mothers"), "who are the energies of different major gods, and described as assisting the great Shakta Devi in her fight with demons", and the 64 ''[[Yogini]]s''.{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|1996|page=126}}

==Worship==
Shaktism encompasses a nearly endless variety of beliefs and practices – from animism to philosophical speculation of the highest order – that seek to access the Shakti (Divine Energy or Power) that is believed to be the Devi's nature and form.{{sfn|Subramuniyaswami|2002|page=1211}} Its two largest and most visible schools are the ''Srikula'' (family of ''[[Sri]]''), strongest in [[South India]], and the ''Kalikula'' (family of ''[[Kali]]''), which prevails in northern and eastern India.{{sfn|Subramuniyaswami|2002|page=1211}}

===Srikula: family of Sri===
[[File:Lalita sm.JPG|upright|thumb|Sri Lalita-Tripurasundari enthroned with her left foot upon the [[Sri Chakra]], holding her traditional symbols, the sugarcane bow, flower arrows, noose and goad.]]
The ''Srikula'' (family of ''Sri'') tradition (''[[sampradaya]]'') focuses worship on Devi in the form of the goddess ''[[Tripura Sundari|Lalita-Tripura Sundari]]'', who is regarded as the Great Goddess (''Mahadevi''). Rooted in first-millennium Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir Valley, Srikula became a force in South India no later than the seventh century, and is today the prevalent form of Shaktism practiced in South Indian regions such as [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and Tamil areas of [[Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Brooks|1992|page=back cover}}

The Srikula's best-known school is [[Shri Vidya|Srividya]], "one of Shakta Tantrism's most influential and theologically sophisticated movements." Its central symbol, the ''[[Sri Chakra]]'', is probably the most famous visual image in all of Hindu Tantric tradition. Its literature and practice is perhaps more systematic than that of any other Shakta sect.{{sfn|Brooks|1990|page=xiii}}

Srividya largely views the Goddess as "benign [''saumya''] and beautiful [''saundarya'']" (in contrast to Kalikula's focus on "terrifying [''ugra''] and horrifying [''ghora'']" goddess forms such as Kali or Durga). In Srikula practice, moreover, every aspect of the Goddess – whether malignant or gentle – is identified with Lalita.{{sfn|Brooks|1992|pages=59-60}}

Srikula adepts most often worship Lalita using the abstract ''Sri Chakra'' [[yantra]], which is regarded as her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily as part of the worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the ''Sri Meru''. It is not uncommon to find a ''Sri Chakra'' or ''Sri Meru'' installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But what you see in the temples is not the ''srichakra'' worship you see when it is done privately."{{efn|A senior member of Guru Mandali, Madurai, November 1984, cited in Brooks 1992.{{sfn|Brooks|1992|page=56}} }}

The Srividya ''[[parampara]]s'' can be further broadly subdivided into two streams, the ''[[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]]'' (a ''[[vamachara|vamamarga]]'' practice) and the ''Samaya'' (a ''[[dakshinachara|dakshinamarga]]'' practice). The ''Kaula'' or ''Kaulachara'', first appeared as a coherent ritual system in the 8th century in central India,{{sfn|White|2003|page=219}} and its most revered theorist is the 18th-century philosopher [[Bhaskararaya]], widely considered "the best exponent of Shakta philosophy."{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|1996|page=209}}

The ''Samaya'' or ''Samayacharya'' finds its roots in the work of the 16th-century commentator Lakshmidhara, and is "fiercely puritanical [in its] attempts to reform Tantric practice in ways that bring it in line with high-caste [[brahmin|brahmanical]] norms."{{sfn|Brooks|1990|page=28}} Many Samaya practitioners explicitly deny being either Shakta or Tantric, though scholars argues that their cult remains technically both.{{sfn|Brooks|1990|page=28}} The Samaya-Kaula division marks "an old dispute within Hindu Tantrism,"{{sfn|Brooks|1990|page=28}} and one that is vigorously debated to this day.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Kalikula: family of Kali===

[[File: Kali_lithograph.jpg|thumb|upright|Kali in her ''Dakshina Kali'' form]]

The ''Kalikula'' (family of ''Kali'') form of Shaktism is most dominant in [[Nepal]], northern and eastern India, and is most widely prevalent in [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]], as well as parts of [[Maharashtra]], [[Bangladesh]] and some parts of [[Kerala]]. ''Kalikula'' lineages focus upon the Devi as the source of wisdom (''vidya'') and liberation (''[[moksha]]''). They generally stand "in opposition to the brahmanic tradition," which they view as "overly conservative and denying the experiential part of religion."{{sfn|McDaniel|n.d.}}

The main deities of Kalikula are ''Kali'', ''[[Chandi]]'', ''[[Parvati]]'' and ''Durga''. Other goddesses that enjoy veneration are ''Tara'' and all the other ''[[Mahavidyas]]'' as well as regional goddesses such as ''[[Manasa]]'', the snake goddess, and ''[[Shitala|Sitala]]'', the smallpox goddess – all of them, again, considered aspects of the Divine Mother.{{sfn|McDaniel|n.d.}}

In [[Nepal]] devi is mainly worshipped as Kali, Bhawani, [[Matrika]] and [[Navadurga]].There are many shakti peeth in [[Nepal]] including the main shakti peeth [[Guhyeshwari Temple]] of Guhyeshwari Devi also called as Guhekali Bhagawati on the bank of holy [[Bagmati]] river.     She is one of the important deity in kalikula.
Two major centers of Shaktism in West Bengal are [[Kalighat]] in [[Calcutta]] and [[Tarapith]] in [[Birbhum district]]. In Calcutta, emphasis is on devotion (''bhakti'') to the goddess as ''Kali'':

{{quote|She is "the loving mother who protects her children and whose fierceness guards them. She is outwardly frightening – with dark skin, pointed teeth, and a necklace of skulls – but inwardly beautiful. She can guarantee a good rebirth or great religious insight, and her worship is often communal – especially at festivals, such as ''[[Kali Puja]]'' and ''[[Durga Puja]]''. Worship may involve contemplation of the devotee's union with or love of the goddess, visualization of her form, chanting [of her] ''mantras'', prayer before her image or ''yantra'', and giving [of] offerings."{{sfn|McDaniel|n.d.}} }}

At Tarapith, Devi's manifestation as ''Tara'' ("She Who Saves") or ''Ugratara'' ("Fierce Tara") is ascendant, as the goddess who gives liberation (''kaivalyadayini''). [...] The forms of ''sadhana'' performed here are more ''[[yogic]]'' and ''tantric'' than devotional, and they often involve sitting alone at the [cremation] ground, surrounded by ash and bone. There are [[shamanic]] elements associated with the Tarapith tradition, including "conquest of the goddess', exorcism, trance, and control of spirits."{{sfn|McDaniel|n.d.}}

The philosophical and devotional underpinning of all such ritual, however, remains a pervasive vision of the Devi as supreme, absolute divinity. As expressed by the nineteenth-century saint [[Ramakrishna]], one of the most influential figures in modern Bengali Shaktism:

{{quote|Kali is none other than Brahman. That which is called Brahman is really Kali. She is the Primal Energy. When that Energy remains inactive, I call It Brahman, and when It creates, preserves, or destroys, I call It Shakti or Kali. What you call Brahman I call Kali. Brahman and Kali are not different. They are like fire and its power to burn: if one thinks of fire one must think of its power to burn. If one recognizes Kali one must also recognize Brahman; again, if one recognizes Brahman one must recognize Kali. Brahman and Its Power are identical. It is Brahman whom I address as Shakti or Kali.{{sfn|Nikhilananda|2000|page=734}} }}

===Festivals===
Shaktas celebrate most major Hindu festivals, as well as a huge variety of local, temple- or deity-specific observances. A few of the more important events are listed below:{{sfn|Pattanaik|2000|pages=103-109}}

====Navratri====
{{Main|Navratri}}
The most important Shakta festival is ''[[Navratri]]'' (lit., "Festival of Nine Nights"), also known as "Sharad Navratri" because it falls during the Hindu month of [[Sharad]] (October/November). This is the festival that worships the [[Navadurgas]], forms of [[Parvati]]. This festival – often taken together with the following tenth day, known as ''Dusshera'' or ''[[Vijayadashami]]'' – celebrates the goddess Durga's victory over a series of powerful demons described in the ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]''.{{Sfn|Kinsley|1987|pp=95-115}}
In [[Bengal]], the last four days of Navaratri are called [[Durga Puja]], and mark one episode in particular: Durga's iconic slaying of [[Mahishasura]] (lit., the "Buffalo Demon").&lt;ref&gt;"Durga Puja," [http://www.durga-puja.org/ DurgaPuja.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hindus of all denominations celebrate the autumn Navratri festival, Shaktas also celebrate two additional Navratris – one in the spring and one in the summer. The spring festival is known as ''Vasanta Navaratri'' or ''Chaitra Navatri'', and celebrated in the Hindu month of [[Chaitra]] (March/April). Srividya lineages dedicate this festival to Devi's form as the goddess [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita]]. The summer festival is called ''Ashada Navaratri'', as it is held during the Hindu month of [[Ashadha]] (June/July). The [[Vaishno Devi]] temple in [[Jammu]], with Vaishno Devi considered an aspect of Durga, celebrates Navaratri.{{Sfn|Kinsley|1987|pp=95-115}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Snow Wadley|title=Raja Nal and the Goddess: The North Indian Epic Dhola in Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqcttdCbb9wC |year=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11127-7|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ashada Navaratri'', on the other hand, is considered particularly auspicious for devotees of the boar-headed goddess [[Varahi]], one of the seven Matrikas named in the ''Devi Mahatmya''.&lt;ref&gt;"Regaling Varahi with different 'alankarams' in 'Ashada Navaratri'," 24 July 2007, [http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/24/stories/2007072456270200.htm The Hindu].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vasant Panchami====
{{Main|Saraswati Pooja}}
Fifth day of Magha Gupta Navratri is very important for all branches of Shakta-pantha. Specially in Vindhyachal mahashakti peetham, thousands of chandipatha and other secret rituals performed this day to please Aadishakti. This is the festival of union of Shakti &amp; Shiv (Shiva-Shiv). On the same basis Shiva-Shiv Sammoh is formed by Awadhoot Kripanandnath at Awadhoot Ashram, Vindhyachal in 1980.

====Diwali and others====
{{Main|Diwali}}
[[Lakshmi Puja]] is a part of Durga Puja celebrations by Shaktas, where Laksmi symbolizes the goddess of abundance and autumn harvest.{{Sfn|Kinsley|1987|p=33}} Lakshmi's biggest festival, however, is ''[[Diwali]]'' (or ''Deepavali''; the "Festival of Lights"), a major Hindu holiday celebrated across India and in Nepal as Tihar. In North India, Diwali marks the beginning of the traditional New Year, and is held on the night of the new moon in the Hindu month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]] (usually October or November). Shaktas (and many non-Shaktas) celebrate it as another Lakshmi Puja, placing small oil lamps outside their homes and praying for the goddess's blessings.&lt;ref&gt;"Diwali Festival", [http://www.diwalifestival.org/ DiwaliFestival.org].&lt;/ref&gt;  Diwali coincides with the celebration of Kali Puja, popular in Bengal, and some Shakta traditions focus their worship on Devi as [[Parvati]] rather than Lakshmi.&lt;ref&gt;"Kali Pooja in Bengal," [http://www.diwalifestival.org/kali-pooja-in-bengal.html Diwali Festival.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India Meenakshi Temple.jpg|thumb|A [[gopuram]] (tower) of the Meenakshi Amman Temple, a Shakta temple at Madurai, Tamil Nadu, [[India]], which was nominated in the "[[New Seven Wonders of the World]]" competition in 2004.]]
''[[Jagaddhatri]] Puja'' is celebrated on the last four days of the Navaratis, following Kali Puja. It is very similar to Durga Puja in its details and observance, and is especially popular in Bengal and some other parts of Eastern India. ''[[Parvati|Gauri]] Puja'' is performed on the fifth day after [[Ganesh Chaturthi]], during [[Ganesha]] Puja in Western India, to celebrate the arrival of Gauri, Mother of Ganesha where she brings her son back home.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Major Shakta temple festivals are ''Meenakshi Kalyanam'' and ''[[Ambubachi Mela]]''. The ''Meenakshi Kalyanam'' is a part of the [[Chithirai Thiruvizha]] festival in [[Madurai]] around April/May, one of the largest festivals in South India, celebrating the wedding of goddess [[Minakshi|Meenakshi]] ([[Parvati]]) and Shiva. The festival is one where both the Vaishnava and Shaiva communities join the celebrations, because Vishnu gives away his sister [[Parvati]] in marriage to Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Constance Jones|author2=James D.

In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakti temples, particular to mark the legend of goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon.

Animal Sacrifice of a buffalo or goat, particularly during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced in parts of South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is [[Renuka]]. According to [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in [[Gilgamesh]] epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.&lt;ref name="Buffalo sacrifice"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hiltebeitel|first1=Alf|authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Rāma and Gilgamesh: the sacrifices of the water buffalo and the bull of heaven|journal=History of Religions|date=February 1980|volume=19|issue=3|pages=187–195, 211–214|jstor=1062467 |doi=10.1086/462845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th-century through the early 20th-century, Indian laborers were shipped by the [[British Empire]] into colonial mining and plantations operations in the Indian ocean and the Caribbean regions. These included significant number of Shakta devotees. While instances of Shakta animal sacrifice during Kali puja in the Caribbean islands were recorded between 1850s to 1920s, these were relatively uncommon when compared to other rituals such as temple prayers, community dancing and fire walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Taylor|author2=Frederick Case|title=The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions: Volume 1: A - L|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOyYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285 |year=2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09433-0|pages=285–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaktism versus other Hindu traditions==
[[File:1849 engraving of "the Hindoo Goddess Karle".JPG|thumb|upright|"The Hindoo Goddess Kali", an illustration from ''Dr. Scudder's Tales for Little Readers About the Heathen'', by Dr. John Scudder (London, 1849).]]
Shaktism has at times been dismissed as a superstitious, black magic-infested practice that hardly qualifies as a true religion at all.{{sfn|Urban|2003}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}{{sfn|White|2003}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}} A representative criticism of this sort issued from an Indian scholar in the 1920s:

{{quote|The Tantras are the Bible of Shaktism, identifying all Force with the female principle in nature and teaching an undue adoration of the wives of Shiva and Vishnu to the neglect of their male counterparts. It is certain that a vast number of the inhabitants of India are guided in their daily life by Tantrik [sic] teaching, and are in bondage to the gross superstitions inculcated in these writings. And indeed it can scarcely be doubted that Shaktism is Hinduism arrived at its worst and most corrupt stage of development."{{sfn|Kapoor|2002|page=157}} }}

The tantra practices are secretive, subject to speculations and criticism. Scholars variously attribute such criticism to ignorance, misunderstanding or sectarian bias on the part of some observers, as well as unscrupulous practices by some Shaktas. These are some of the reasons many Hindus question the relevance and historicity of Tantra to their tradition.{{sfn|White|2003|page=262}}&lt;ref name=hughurban&gt;Hugh Urban (1997), Elitism and Esotericism: Strategies of Secrecy and Power in South Indian Tantra and French Freemasonry, Journal: Numen, Volume 44, Issue 1, pages 1 – 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond tantra, the Shakta sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others. These traditions compare with Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism as follows:

==Demography==
There is no census data available on demographic history or trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-hindu/ The global religious landscape: Hindus], Pew Research (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary on the relative number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M |last2=Grim |first2= Brian J |title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SAzizViY30EC |year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118323038|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Galvin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|page=200}}, Quote: "it is often impossible to meaningfully distinguish between Saiva and Sakta traditions".&lt;/ref&gt; The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses [[henotheism|henotheistically]], with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati and other aspects of the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner]] (2009), Hindus: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-45677-7}}, pages 371-375&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples and influence==
{{Further2|[[:Category:Shakti temples|List of Shakti Temples]] and [[Shakti Peethas]]}}
{{Shakti Peethas Map}}
Shakta temples are found all over South Asia. Many towns, villages and geographic landmarks are named for various forms of the Devi.{{sfn|Pattanaik|2000|pages=110-114}} Major pilgrimage sites of Shaktism are called "[[Shakti Peethas]]", literally "Seats of the Devi". These vary from four to fifty one.{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|1996|page=171}}

Some Shakta temples are also found in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Fell McDermett|1998|pages=281-305}} Examples in the [[United States]] include the ''Kali Mandir'' in [[Laguna Beach, California]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalimandir.org Kali Mandir]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sri Rajarajeswari Peetam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srividya.org Sri Rajarajeshwari Peetham]&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[Srividya]]'' temple in rural [[Rush, New York]].{{sfn|Dempsey|2006}}

Some [[Feminism|feminists]] and participants in [[New Age]] spirituality who are attracted to goddess worship", suggest Shaktism is a "symbol of wholeness and healing, associated especially with repressed female power and sexuality." However, these are adaptions and do not share Shakta theology.{{sfn|Fell McDermett|1998|pages=281-305}}

===Buddhism===
There has been a significant sharing of ideas, ritual grammar and concepts between Tantric Buddhism ([[Vajrayana]] tradition) found in Nepal and Tibet and the Tantric Shakta tradition of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Gordon Melton|author2=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-204-3|page=2599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dalal332/&gt; Both movements cherish female deities,&lt;ref name="Keul2012p119"/&gt; view the female creativity as the power behind the universe, and the feminine as the ontological primary. According to Miranda Shaw, "the confluence of Buddhism and Shaktism is such that Tantric Buddhism could properly be called Shakta Buddhism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary McClintock Fulkerson|author2=Sheila Briggs|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aBxZRMUHw0C |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927388-1|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist [[Aurangabad Caves]] about 100 kilometers from the [[Ajanta Caves]], dated to the 6th to 7th-century CE, show Buddhist Matrikas (mother goddesses of Shaktism) next to the Buddha.&lt;ref name= Brancaccio203/&gt; Other goddesses in these caves include Durga. The goddess iconography in these Buddhist caves is close, but not identical to the Hindu Shakta tradition. The "seven goddess mothers" are found in other Buddhist caves and literature, such as their discussion in the Buddhist text ''Manjusrimulakalpa'' and ''Vairocanabhisambodhi''.&lt;ref name= Brancaccio203&gt;{{cite book|author=Pia Brancaccio|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA206 |year=2010| publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-18525-9|pages=21, 202–207}}, '''Quote:''' "To the right of the main Buddha image, carved out of the wall of the sanctum, is an ensemble of seven female images".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David B.

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], ideas similar to Shaktism tradition are found, such as the Vidyadevis and the Shasanadevis.&lt;ref name=dalal332&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&amp;pg=PA332|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
The secondary scripture of Sikhs, ''[[Dasam Granth]]'' attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]], includes numerous sections on Shakta goddesses, particularly [[Chandi]] – the fierce warrior form of the Hindu goddess.&lt;ref name="Rinehart2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Rinehart|title=Debating the Dasam Granth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe6WnpbT2BkC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-984247-6|pages=71, 107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh – a professor of Religious Studies, the stories about goddess Durga in the ''Dasam Granth'' are reworkings of ancient Shakti mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Waeber Elsberg|title=Graceful Women: Gender and Identity in an American Sikh Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU8rmpdIwWYC&amp;pg=PA37 |year=2003|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|isbn=978-1-57233-214-0|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant part of this Sikh scripture is based on the teachings in the Shakta text ''Devi Mahatmya'' found in the ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'' of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

===Other ancient religions===
Some Westerners{{who|date=October 2016}} believe that many central concepts of Shaktism – including aspects of kundalini yoga as well as goddess worship – were once "common to the Hindu, [[Babylonia|Chaldean]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations," but were largely superseded in the West, as well as the Near and Middle East, with the rise of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s:

{{quote|Of these four great ancient civilizations, working knowledge of the inner forces of enlightenment has survived on a mass scale only in India. Only in India has the inner tradition of the Goddess endured. This is the reason the teachings of India are so precious. They offer us a glimpse of what our own ancient wisdom must have been. The Indians have preserved our lost heritage. [...] Today it is up to us to locate and restore the tradition of the living Goddess. We would do well to begin our search in India, where for not one moment in all of human history have the children of the living Goddess forgotten their Divine Mother.|[[Linda Johnsen]]{{sfn|Johnsen|2002|pages=176, 181}} }}

A '''spiritualist church''' is a church affiliated with the informal [[Spiritualism|spiritualist movement]] which began in the [[United States]] in the 1840s. Spiritualist churches are now found around the world, but are most common in English-speaking countries, while in Latin America, where a form of spiritualism called [[spiritism]] is more popular, meetings are held in [[spiritist centre]]s, most of which are non-profit organizations rather than ecclesiastical bodies.

==History==
The origin of mediumship is usually linked to the [[Fox sisters]] at Hydesville, [[Arcadia, New York]] in 1848, but some believers date the unofficial beginning of modern American [[Spiritualism]] to the [[Shakers]] and similar religious groups. By 1853 the movement had reached San Francisco and London, and by 1860 was worldwide.  The Fox family remained very active in Spiritualism for many years. Other notable Spiritualists of that era were Mercy Cadwallader, who became a sort of missionary for the movement, and [[Emma Hardinge Britten]], who wrote for the first Spiritualist newspaper in Britain, ''The Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph''.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;

===Great Britain===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
By the 1870s there were numerous Spiritualist societies and churches throughout the US and Britain, but there was little in the way of national organization of mediums in Britain or the United States although some regions of Britain had organized ''Federations'' that might have up to thirty circles of similar beliefs. In 1891 the National Federation of Spiritualists (NFS) came into existence and grew quite large before its name change to the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] (SNU) in 1902.

British spiritualists of this time were often adherents of the [[temperance movement|temperance]] and anti-capital punishment lobbies, often held radical political views and were frequently [[vegetarianism|vegetarians]].  Some were active in the advocacy of women's rights and [[female suffrage]], and a minority espoused Free Love: the popular perception of Spiritualists was often of radicals in the Victorian period.

''[[Two Worlds (magazine)|Two Worlds]]'' was the major British magazine of spiritualism and had a fairly large circulation, and it advertised the existence of local circles.  [[Daniel Dunglas Home|D.D. Home]] one of the most renowned [[mediums]] of his era, did much to make spiritualism fashionable among the aristocracy by his high-profile activities. Trance mediumship flourished and table turning was a popular craze, reputedly even reaching [[Buckingham Palace]].

By 1924 there were 309 Spiritualist churches affiliated to the SNU or one of the many other organisations.  In 1932, a new magazine, ''[[Psychic News]]'',  joined ''[[Two Worlds (magazine)|Two Worlds]]'' on the newsstands of Britain and carried news of the doings in local Spiritualist churches.

From 1920 to 1938 there was the British College of Psychic Studies (1920 to 1947) led by Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie in London, but more successful was the [[Arthur Findlay College]] at [[Stansted]] which continues to today.

In 1957 Spiritualist churches in Britain divided between the Spiritualists' National Union, influenced by [[Arthur Findlay]]'s beliefs and holding spiritualism to be a religion, and the circles of Christian Spiritualism, who hold Spiritualism to be a denomination of Christianity.  Spiritualists National Union churches form the large majority and are affiliated to [[Spiritualist Association of Great Britain]] (SAGB), which is not a church per se, but rather an organization for mediums. The SNU also has some member churches in other English speaking countries. Christian Spiritualist churches are mainly affiliated to The Greater World Christian Spiritualist Association (GWCSA).

Other Spiritualist groups in the UK include [[the White Eagle Lodge]], founded by the medium Grace Cooke, the Institute of Spiritualist Mediums and the [[Noah's Ark Society]], that focuses on physical phenomena only.

===International===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
There are Spiritualist churches in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, The Republic of South Africa, Sweden and groups in many countries including Japan,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} the Scandinavian countries, Korea, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Iceland.  Many such groups and also individuals, are members of the [[International Spiritualist Federation]] (ISF) which was founded in Belgium in 1923 and is an umbrella organization for all spiritualists.  The ISF holds congresses every two years in different parts of the world.

In Australia, the Associated Christian Spiritual Churches of Australia (ACSCOA) and the Victorian Spiritualists' Union (VSU) co-exist alongside independent churches, and Canada has the [[Spiritualist Church of Canada]] (SCC) founded in 1974, along with a number of independent churches.

===United States===
[[File:Universal Hagar Spiritual Ch jeh.jpg|thumb|Universal Hagar's Spiritual Church, [[Manhattan]]]]

American spiritualism has long been more individualistic than its British counterpart. Many North America Spiritualist churches are denominationally affiliated with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] (NSAC), The National Spiritual Alliance (TNSA), or the United Spiritualist Church Association (USCA), but almost as many are independent churches with no national affiliation.

Spiritualist churches generally have, in addition to the church proper, an educational wing called a lyceum (the Greek word for "place of conversation"). These Spiritualist lyceums function as a support system for the teaching of Spiritualist history and doctrine outside of the liturgical services, and enable the booking of guest lecturers and visiting mediums.

A unique aspect of American Spiritualism, which sets it apart from British church tradition, was the nineteenth century development and institutionalization of Spiritualist Camps, organized by urban Spiritualist churches. These rural retreats, located in picturesque natural settings throughout the United States, allow Spiritualist families to spend their summer vacations boating, hiking, attending Spiritualist lectures, taking development classes in mediumship, and receiving messages from guest mediums. Among the best-known of the Spiritualist camps are Lily Dale Assembly in [[Lily Dale, New York]], Camp Cassadaga in [[Cassadaga, Florida]], On-I-Set-Wigwam Spiritualist Camp in Massachusetts, [[Camp Chesterfield]] in Indiana, Sunset Spiritualist Camp in Kansas, and [[Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp]] in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="wicker"&gt;

===African American Spiritualist church===

In 1922, during a time of rising [[Jim Crow]] laws and [[segregationism]], the NSAC expelled its African American members. The Black Spiritualists then formed  a national organization called the Colored Spiritualist Association of Churches (CSAC), which included churches in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=baer&gt;{{cite book| title=The Black Spiritual Movement: A Religious Response to Racism |last=Baer|first=Hans A. | publisher= University of Tennessee Press | year =1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSAC eventually fractured over leadership and doctrinal issues, and the historically [[African American]] Spiritualist churches, now loosely referred to as the [[spiritual church movement]], currently includes a variety of denominations such as the African Cultural Nationalist Universal Hagar's Spiritual Church&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhurley.com/universal-hagars-spiritual-church Universal Hagar's Spiritual Church]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Protestant]]-Christian-oriented Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ - International&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psac-intl.org/ Pentecostal Spiritual Assemblies of Christ - International]&lt;/ref&gt; and Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrospiritualchurch.com/index1.html Metropolitan Spiritual Churches of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804160522/http://www.metrospiritualchurch.com/index1.html |date=2008-08-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Churches of New Orleans are a diverse group of denominations that have schismed from the denomination founded by the [[Wisconsin]]-born Mother [[Leafy Anderson]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=nola&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Jacobs| first1 = Claude F.  | last2 = Kaslow | first2 = Andrew J.| year = 1991| title = The Spiritual Churches of New Orleans Origins, Beliefs, and Rituals of an African-American Religion| publisher = The University of Tennessee Press| ISBN = 1-57233-148-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their theology was grounded on a very original Black feminism, and particularly on the Gospel of John, 4 (the encounter of Jesus and the Samaritan woman).&lt;ref&gt;Dianteill, Erwan (2006), ''La Samaritaine noire - Les Eglises spirituelles Noires Américaines de La Nouvelle-Orléans'', Paris, France, Editions de l'EHESS, pp. 85-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Most spiritual church movement churches incorporate theological Spiritualism, including the utilization of traditional "Spirit Guides" in worship services, with a mixture of Protestant and Catholic iconography. The names of individual churches in these diverse denominations tend to indicate the  denominational Christian orientation of their founders or their congregations. Some, such as Divine Israel Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), recall typical Black [[Baptist]] churches, others, like Divine Harmony Spiritual Church (in [[Miami]]), have names evocative of the early twentieth century [[New Thought]] movement, and some, such as Infant of Prague Spiritual Church (in New Orleans), feature Catholic names and include statuary of Catholic saints on their altars.&lt;ref name=berry&gt;{{cite book| title=The Spirit of Blackhawk: a Mystery of Africans and Indians |author =Jason Berry | publisher= University Press of Mississippi | year =1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the NSAC Spiritualist churches, the denominations of the spiritual church movement generally do not maintain Spiritualist Camps or a Lyceum system of extra-liturgical education.

==Styles of worship==
Spiritualist churches are places of worship for the practitioners of Spiritualism. The Spiritualist service is usually conducted by a medium. Generally, there is an opening prayer, an address, the singing of hymns, and finally a demonstration of mediumship. Healing circles may also be part of the formal proceedings.

===Liturgical and iconographic variations===

Some Spiritualist churches maintain that Spiritualism is a religion in its own right, and has no relationship to any other religion.

Other Spiritualist churches draw inspiration from [[Christianity]].  African American Spiritualist churches tend to encourage ecstatic worship styles derived from African-American Protestant [[Baptist]] and [[Pentecostal]] practices.&lt;ref name=nola/&gt; The churches that directly descend from the teachings of [[Leafy Anderson]] are also distinguished by special services and hymns that honor the spirit of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] war chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], who lived in Illinois and  Wisconsin (Anderson's home state).&lt;ref name=berry/&gt;

A third group of Spiritualist churches propose the idea of the [[Universe]] as the creator, and does not necessarily follow any specific religious doctrine or dogma.

===Mediumship within the churches===

Spiritualists believe that when people die physically an aspect of the personality or mind survives this and continues to exist on a spirit plane, sometimes referred to as the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]]. Spiritualists use the word ''Spirit'' as a plural which describes all minds and entities who have entered into the spirit world. The purpose of the medium is to provide some evidence that a human has survived by describing the person to their surviving relatives. The degree of accuracy with which the deceased are described goes some way to convincing the living relatives and friends that the medium has some contact with the spirit.&lt;ref name="wicker"/&gt;&lt;ref
name="weisberg"&gt;
{{cite book|
last=Weisberg

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiritualists describe this as "survival evidence'".

There have been a number of famous practitioners of spirit communication connected to Spiritualist churches. One of the principal advocates of Spiritualism was the 20th century British writer [[Arthur Findlay]]. Findlay was a magistrate, farmer and businessman who left his mansion house as place for the study and advancement of psychic science. This has now become a psychic college in Stansted, England and is run by the SNU.

Mediums develop their ability by sitting regularly in ''development circles'' with other student psychics. [[Meditation]] usually plays a large role in Spiritualist practice. Meditation is used to calm the "voices" of modern, hectic life so that the practitioner can better hear his or her guide. Meditation often includes the breathing practices of Buddhist meditation ([[anapana|ānāpānasati]]) and may also include the idea of [[chakra]]s. The Spiritualist may also focus on the tenets of their chosen religion to help them attain a higher existence. These may include standard prayers ([[Hail Mary]], [[Shema Yisrael]] or [[salat]] etc.), focusing on the name of God ([[Jesus]], [[YHWH]] or [[Allah]] etc.) or other aspects of a holy nature. Like most meditation techniques, imaging (intensely imagining a place or situation) is common. There are specific imagings used to "meet" one's guide, connect with those who have died, receive protection or support from God or simply calming the mind.

Through engaging their intuition, they attempt to contact with the spirits of the dead. This is known as ''opening up''.  In Britain especially, such mediums are trained to produce clear evidence that the spirit contacted is the person they claim it to be before going on to give any "message" from the spirit.  Such evidence can be details of where they lived, including addresses sometimes, particulars of illnesses suffered and notable events in their lives, often known only to the person in the congregation being given the information.&lt;ref name="keeghan"&gt;

===Healing circles within the churches===

Spiritualist healing, as practiced in some Spiritualist churches during formal liturgical services, is a form of mediumship which involves a technique of directing healing energy to the patient from a higher source. The healer uses his or her hands to effect repair of damaged or diseased tissue and it is claimed all or part of the patient's good health is sometimes restored.&lt;ref&gt;Coats, Margaret, "Essential Guide to Using Hands-on Healing Energy", International Journal of Healing and Caring, Sterling publishing, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9219">'''Tell el-Qudeirat''' is an archaeological site in the [[Sinai]],&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; about five miles east of the Egyptian village of [[Quseima]].&lt;ref&gt;''Israel Journal of Botany'' 1975, pp. 23, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the map in Haiman (1994), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be the location of the biblical [[Kadesh Barnea]].&lt;ref name="MillsBullard1990"&gt;Drinkard (1990), p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, some authors have referred to it as '''Tel Kadesh-barnea.'''&lt;ref name="redmount 2001 67"&gt;Redmount (2001), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Moshe Dothan (1965) referred to it as '''Tel 'Ein el Qudeirat''',&lt;ref&gt;Dothan (1965), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the early twentieth century Woolley and Lawrence used the spelling '''Tell Ain el Guderat'''.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Lawrence (1914), pp. 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tell el-Qudeirat'' is the name of the archaeological mound (the "[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]") itself. It sits near ''Ain el-Qudeirat'', which Carol Redmount describes as "the most fertile oasis in northern Sinai".&lt;ref name="redmount 2001 67" /&gt; The ''Ain'' ("spring") flows out of the ground about 1.5 kilometers east of the tell, and the water from it flows west, becoming the ''Wadi el-Qudeirat''. The tell then sits along the northern bank of the wadi, which continues flowing west and then turns toward the north. The tell is located along the southern base of a hill known as ''Jebel el-Qudeirat''.&lt;ref&gt;See the map on page 2 of Cohen and Bernick-Greenberg (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Iron Age, Tell el-Qudeirat was a rectangular&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the title of Ussishkin (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; fortress, and multiple layers of fortifications have been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;Gilboa ''et al.'' (2009), p 82-94&lt;/ref&gt; The modern site is a ''tell'', an archaeological mound caused by long-term human habitation. At the lowest level, labelled 4c, are traces of human habitation dated by [[Israel Finkelstein]] to the twelfth to tenth centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein (2010), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Carol Redmount, on the other hand, claims that the oldest remains at the site date to the tenth century.&lt;ref name="redmount 2001 67" /&gt; Tell el-Qudeirat is one of scores of permanent settlements which existed in Iron Age II in the Negev Highlands. 

== Archaeological Surveys and Interpretation ==
The first archaeologists to notice the tell were [[T. E. Lawrence]] ("Lawrence of Arabia") and [[Leonard Woolley|C. L. Woolley]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1979), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Lawrence (1914).&lt;/ref&gt; They described is as "little mound about 200 feet long and 120 feet broad ... in a heap from twelve to fiteen feet high above the corn-fields."&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; They considered their initial work insufficient to accurately date the remains, but suggested a date somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 BCE for it and the nearby fortresses at Qasr er-Ruheibeh and Bir Birein.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1979), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that Tell el-Qudeirat was the biblical Kadesh-Barnea.&lt;ref&gt;Dothan (1965), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolley and Lawrence (1914), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Further work on a limited scale ("soundings") was carried out at the tell by Moshe Dothan in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 118,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Glueck]] (published in 1959), and [[Yohanan Aharoni]] (1967) discovered that a large number of other fortresses from the Iron Age also existed in the area, and proposed that these fortresses were built by Israelite kings to increase their influence over this area toward the southern edge of their dominions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1979), p.  61).&lt;/ref&gt; Dothan concluded that the fortress itself existed in the eighth to sixth centuries, with evidence of human settlement at the site both before and after the existence of the fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudolph Cohen conducted work on a much larger scale in 1976-1982.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen concluded that the site in fact contained remains of three fortresses. The first was built in the tenth century, in an oval shape. The second and third were rectangular. The second was built in the 700's BCE and destroyed in the 600's. The third seemed to have been built in the second half of the sixth century, during the reign of king [[Josiah]], and was destroyed in 586 BCE when the Babylonians destroyed the kingdom of Judah.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the destruction of this last fortress, people continued to occupy the site approximately two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mordechai Haiman (1994) argued that these settlements were installed by the Israelite [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] between about 1000 and 925 BCE.&lt;ref name="haiman 1994 5961"&gt;Haiman (1994), pp. 59, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Haiman held that these sites were abandoned after the kingdom of Israel split and Egypt invaded it around 925 BC. Of these sites, Haiman maintains that only Tell el-Qudeirat and two others were again settled in the eighth century, with Tell el-Qudeirat serving as an outpost of the [[kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref name="haiman 1994 5961" /&gt;

[[David Ussishkin]] (1995), on the other hand, argued that Cohen's "second" and "third" fortresses in fact constituted a single fort. While Cohen interpreted the fort as an outpost of the kingdom of Judah, Ussishkin suggested, following Nadav Na'aman, that it was not a project of the Judahite government but was perhaps constructed by Assyrians, later falling into Egyptian hands.&lt;ref&gt;Ussishkin (1995), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel Finkelstein]] has extended the lines of thinking found in Cohen and Ussishkin, while modifying some of their conclusions. What Cohen saw as an "oval fortress", Finkelstein sees as simply the remains of settlement between the tenth and eighth centuries, prior to any fortress construction.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein (2010), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the rectangular remains, Finkelstein holds these to have been a single fortress operating from the mid-eighth century to about 600.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein (2010), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Later human occupation at the site likely continued into the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein (2010), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pfärrich Pfarrkirche Marienstatue aus Fatima.jpg|thumb|220px|A religious statue depicting the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] as described by [[Lúcia Santos|Sister Lúcia of Fátima]].]]
{{Christian mysticism}}

The '''Three Secrets of Fátima''' consist of a series of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and [[prophecies]] which were supposedly given to three young Portuguese [[shepherd]]s, [[Lúcia Santos]] and her cousins [[Jacinta and Francisco Marto]], by a [[Marian apparition]], starting on May 13, 1917. The three children claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary six times between May and October 1917. The apparition is now popularly known as [[Our Lady of Fátima]].

According to Lucia, on July 13, 1917, around noon, the Virgin Mary entrusted the children with three secrets. Two of the secrets were revealed in 1941 in a document written by Lúcia, at the request of [[José Alves Correia da Silva]], [[Bishop of Leiria]], to assist with the publication of a new edition of a book on Jacinta.&lt;ref&gt;Zimdars-Swartz, Sandra L., ''Encountering Mary'' (1991), pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by the Bishop in 1943 to reveal the third secret, Lúcia struggled for a short period, being "not yet convinced that God had clearly authorized her to act."&lt;ref&gt;Zimdars-Swartz, Sandra L., ''Encountering Mary'' (1991), pg. 203&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 1943 the Bishop ordered her to put it in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Zimdars-Swartz, Sandra L., ''Encountering Mary'' (1991), pg. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Lúcia then wrote the secret down and sealed it in an envelope not to be opened until 1960, when "it will appear clearer".&lt;ref&gt;Zimdars-Swartz, Sandra L., ''Encountering Mary'' (1991), pgs. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the third secret was officially released by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2000, although some claim that it was not the entire secret revealed by Lúcia, despite repeated assertions from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to the contrary.

According to various Catholic interpretations, the three secrets involve [[Hell]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and 20th century persecutions of Christians.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Background==
Of the hundreds of alleged [[Marian apparition|apparition]]s the Catholic Church has investigated, only twelve have received ecclesiastical approval, and nine of them occurred between 1830 and 1933. Cultural anthropologists [[Victor Turner|Victor]] and [[Edith Turner (anthropologist)|Edith Turner]], who converted to Catholicism in 1958, at one time viewed the increase in Marian apparition "cults" as a post-industrial reaction of a "disenfranchised lower middle class to a rapidly changing culture."&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

At the age of fourteen, Lúcia was sent to the school of the [[Dorothea of Caesarea|Sisters of Saint Dorothy]] in Vilar, near [[Porto]]. In 1928, she became a postulant at the Dorothean convent in [[Tui, Pontevedra|Tui]], just across the border in Spain. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (now Sister María Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, in the event that she might disclose further details of the 1917 apparitions.

As early as July 1917, mention was made that the Lady of the apparitions had entrusted to the children a secret, "that was good for some and bad for others".&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bennett|first=Jeffrey S.|title=When the Sun Danced: Myth, Miracles, and Modernity in Early Twentieth-Century Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AaCA1qA0QAC&amp;pg=PT5|year=2012|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=978-0-8139-3250-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Walsh, 83}} It was not until her third memoir, written in 1941, that Lúcia indicated that the secret had three parts. In this she follows [[Mélanie Calvat]] of [[Our Lady of La Salette|La Salette]], whose secrets were written down almost twenty years after the event.&lt;ref name=Maunder/&gt;

== First secret ==
In her third memoir, written in 1941, Lúcia said that the first secret, a vision of Hell, was disclosed to the children on July 13, 1917.
{{quote|Our Lady showed us a great sea of fire which seemed to be under the earth. Plunged in this fire were [[demon]]s and [[soul]]s in human form, like transparent burning embers, all blackened or burnished [[bronze]], floating about in the conflagration, now raised into the air by the flames that issued from within themselves together with great clouds of smoke, now falling back on every side like sparks in a huge fire, without weight or equilibrium, and amid shrieks and groans of pain and despair, which horrified us and made us tremble with fear. The demons could be distinguished by their terrifying and repulsive likeness to frightful and unknown animals, all black and transparent. This vision lasted but an instant. How can we ever be grateful enough to our kind heavenly Mother, who had already prepared us by promising, in the first Apparition, to take us to heaven. Otherwise, I think we would have died of fear and terror.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words I'' (2003), pg. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Second secret ==
{{See also|Pontevedra apparitions}}
The second secret was a statement that World War I would end, along with a prediction of another war during the reign of [[Pope Pius XI]], should men continue offending God and should Russia not convert. The second half requests that Russia be consecrated to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]]:
{{quote|You have seen hell where the souls of poor sinners go. To save them, God wishes to establish in the world devotion to my Immaculate Heart. If what I say to you is done, many souls will be saved and there will be peace. The war is going to end: but if people do not cease offending God, a worse one will break out during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI. When you see a night illumined by an unknown light, know that this is the great sign given you by God that he is about to punish the world for its crimes, by means of war, famine, and persecutions of the Church and of the Holy Father. To prevent this, I shall come to ask for the [[Consecration of Russia]] to my Immaculate Heart, and the [[Eucharist|Communion]] of [[Acts of Reparation|reparation]] on the [[First Saturday Devotions|First Saturdays]]. If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred; the Holy Father will have much to suffer; various nations will be annihilated. In the end, my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me, and she shall be converted, and a period of peace will be granted to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words I'' (2003), pgs. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1925 Sister Lucia reported an apparition of the Virgin Mary at the [[Convent of Saint Dorothea]] at [[Pontevedra]], Galicia. She said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturday Devotions. By her account a subsequent vision of the Child Jesus reiterated this request. In 1930, she wrote to her confessor that in 1929 she had a vision of both Mary and the Holy Trinity in which God had asked for the Consecration of Russia to the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary by the Pope in communion with all the bishops of the world. The message regarding the establishment of the Devotion of the Five First Saturdays is reminiscent of that reported by [[Margaret Mary Alacoque]] in the seventeenth century, which led to the [[First Friday Devotion]].&lt;ref name=Maunder/&gt;

It is unlikely that this message was conveyed to the Pope, but the Bishop of Leiria suggested that she write her memoirs in the event that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions.&lt;ref name=Maunder&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Maunder|first=Chris|title=Our Lady of the Nations: Apparitions of Mary in 20th-Century Catholic Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTs6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-871838-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her third memoir, written in 1941, Sister Lucia recalled that at the apparition of July 13, 1917, the Virgin Mary had first mentioned the consecration of Russia, and said that she would return to give particulars.

Skeptics have noted that the second prophecy was not disclosed until August 1941, after World War II had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. ''Looking for a Miracle'' (1998), pg. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also questioned whether Mary, in 1917, referred explicitly to [[Pope Pius XI]], as Ambrogio Ratti did not choose that regnal name until after his election in 1922. Further, the European portion of World War II is generally held to have begun on September 1, 1939, and by then, [[Pope Pius XII]] had succeeded Pius XI.  As for the "conversion" of Russia, to what was Mary making reference on July 13, 1917?  The [[Bolshevik Revolution]] did not come until November, 1917. 

Some proponents of the Fatima prophecies argue that the secret did not say that the war must begin in Europe, and during the pontificate of Pius XI [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan had already invaded China in 1937]], which is generally seen by historians of China and other parts of Asia as when the Second World War actually began,&lt;ref Name=Mitter-01&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bqc_YkuyaCIC&amp;dq=Forgotten+Ally:+China%E2%80%99s+World+War+II,+1937-1945&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Rana Mitter|title=Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II, 1937-1945|page=1|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2013|isbn=054784056X|accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=Prologue : City On Fire - In the spring of 1939, Europe was still, albeit uneasily, at peace. But some seven thousand kilometres to the east, the Second World War was already well under way.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a view which also has qualified support from some Western historians. Some critics argue that the Russian Civil War (1918-1921), the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), the Chinese Civil War (1927-1937), the war between Italy and Ethiopia (1935-1936), and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), serve to illustrate that the prediction that one war will end and that another will start is not necessarily an indication of divine inspiration. Proponents of the prophecy will point out that the second secret called for a war worse than World War I, not simply any armed conflict. In addition, with regards to the conversion of Russia, there was already, at the time, strong revolutionary ferment in Russia before the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] as witnessed by the earlier [[February Revolution]] in 1917 and the active [[Communism in Russia|communist]] and [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchist]] movements, which would explain Mary's reference to the conversion Russia on July 13, 1917

On January 25, 1938, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported "[[Aurora Borealis]] Startles Europe; People Flee in Fear, Call Firemen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aurora Borealis Startles Europe; People Flee in Fear, Call Firemen.|url=http://www.defendingthebride.com/ss/day/1938h74.jpg|work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 1938|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celestial display was seen from Canada to Bermuda to Austria to Scotland, and short-wave radio transmissions were shut down for almost 12 hours in Canada.&lt;ref Name=1937-02&gt;{{Cite web|author=Witherow, Greg |title=Our Lady of Fatima |url=http://www.holytrinityparish.net/Links/OurLadyOfFatima.pdf |publisher=Holy Trinity Catholic Church, [[Gainesville, Virginia]] |page=6 |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=Mary predicted “a worse [war] will break out during the Pontificate of Pius XI”. There is no doubt the prediction of a greater war was accurate. But skeptics will point out Pope Pius XI died on February 1939 and World War II is considered to have begun on September 1, 1939 (during the Pontificate of Pius XII). Was Mary wrong? In fact, a case can be made that the War was set in motion long before September 1, 1939. Japan invaded China in 1937, then the USSR and Mongolia in 1938. Hitler invaded the Saarland in 1935, Austria in 1938, Sudetenland in 1938 and the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. War raged in the Spanish Civil War and Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Poland was carved up in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. In fact, the Axis powers had started their wars of conquest long before the Chamberlains of the world acknowledged them. Mary was right, Chamberlain’s peace was Fiction. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131215409/http://www.holytrinityparish.net/Links/OurLadyOfFatima.pdf |archivedate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that during the final hour of this aurora, [[Christian Rakovsky]] was undergoing interrogation in the Soviet Union, giving information to Stalin about Western involvement in Hitler's rise, suggesting an alliance with the Western powers against Germany.&lt;ref name="landowsky"&gt;Landowsky, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=P5YLAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Josif%20Maksimovitch%20Landowsky%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Рипол Классик (Red Symphony)]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third secret ==

Sister Lúcia chose not to disclose the third secret in her memoir of August 1941. In 1943, Lúcia fell seriously ill with [[influenza]] and [[pleurisy]]. Bishop Silva, visiting her on 15 September 1943, suggested that she write the third secret down to ensure that it would be recorded in the event of her death. Lúcia was hesitant to do so, however. At the time she received the secret, she had heard Mary say not to reveal it, but because Carmelite obedience requires that orders from superiors be regarded as coming directly from God, she was in a [[wikt:quandary|quandary]] as to whose orders took precedence. Finally, in mid-October, Bishop Silva sent her a letter containing a direct order to record the secret, and Lúcia obeyed.
 
The third part of the secret was written down "by order of His Excellency the Bishop of Leiria and the Most Holy Mother" on January 3, 1944.&lt;ref name="OfficialText"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html "The Message of Fatima" from the Vatican]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1944, the sealed envelope containing the third secret was delivered to Silva, where it stayed until 1957, when it was finally delivered to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Zimdars-Swartz, Sandra L., ''Encountering Mary'' (1991), pgs. 203–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced by Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] on May 13, 2000, 83 years after the first apparition of the Lady to the children in the [[Cova da Iria]], and 19 years after the assassination attempt on [[Pope John Paul II]] that the Third Secret would finally be released. In his announcement, Cardinal Sodano implied that the secret was about the 20th century persecution of Christians that culminated in the failed [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt]] on May 13, 1981, the 64th anniversary of the first apparition of the Lady at Fátima.&lt;ref name="SodanoAnnouncemnet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/travels/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000513_sodano-fatima.html |title=Address of Cardinal Sodano Regarding the 'Third Part' of the Secret of Fatima at the Conclusion of the Solemn Mass |date= 13 May 2000 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The text of the Third Secret, according to the Vatican, was published on June 26, 2000:
{{quote|[[Holy Family#Patronages and customs|J.M.J.]]
&lt;br/&gt;
The third part of the secret revealed at the Cova da Iria-Fátima, on 13 July 1917.
&lt;br/&gt;
I write in obedience to you, my God, who command me to do so through his Excellency the Bishop of Leiria and through your Most Holy Mother and mine.
&lt;br/&gt;
After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!'. And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a [[mirror]] when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, men and women Religious, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal [[aspersorium]] in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God.

Tuy-3-1-1944.&lt;ref name="OfficialText"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santos, ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words I'' (2003), pg. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Along with the text of the secret, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], (the future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), published a theological commentary in which he states: "A careful reading of the text of the so-called third 'secret' of Fatima ... will probably prove disappointing or surprising after all the speculation it has stirred. No great mystery is revealed; nor is the future unveiled." After explaining the differences between public and private revelations, he cautions people not to see in the message a determined future event:
{{quote|The purpose of the vision is not to show a film of an irrevocably fixed future. Its meaning is exactly the opposite: it is meant to mobilize the forces of change in the right direction. Therefore we must totally discount fatalistic explanations of the “secret”, such as, for example, the claim that the would-be assassin of 13 May 1981 was merely an instrument of the divine plan guided by [[divine providence|Providence]] and could not therefore have acted freely, or other similar ideas in circulation. Rather, the vision speaks of dangers and how we might be saved from them.&lt;ref name="OfficialText"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words I'' (2003), pgs. 221–233.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then moves on to talk about the symbolic nature of the images, noting: "The concluding part of the 'secret' uses images which Lucia may have seen in devotional books and which draw their inspiration from long-standing intuitions of faith." As for the meaning of the message: "What remains was already evident when we began our reflections on the text of the 'secret': the exhortation to prayer as the path of 'salvation for souls' and, likewise, the summons to penance and conversion."

Despite this statement, on [[May 11]] 2010, during the flight to Fatima, answering to a question about the Third Secret, pope Benedict XVI told that ''"we would be mistaken to think that Fatima's prophetic message has been completely realized"''&lt;ref name="Chiesa viva" /&gt;. Then, he expressed the hope the centenary of the apparitions of 1917 may hasten the fulfillment of the ''"prophecy of the triumph of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]], for the glory of the [[Blessed Trinity]]"'', specifying that
the suffering inside the Church ''"would have originated not from external enemies, but from within the same Church".''&lt;ref name="Chiesa viva"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chiesaviva.com/terzo%20segreto%20ing.|website=|title=The true Third Secret of Fatima|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate= April 30, 2018|author= dr.

==Third Secret controversy==
Prior to the 1930s the main focus of devotion to Our Lady of Fatima (which was at that time not widely known outside Portugal and Spain) was on the need to pray the rosary for an end to [[World War I]] and for world peace. After the publication of Sister Lucia's memoirs, starting in 1935, Fatima came to be seen as presenting the victory of the Blessed Virgin over Communism.

In 1960 the Vatican issued a press release stating that it was "most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frere Michel de la Sainte Trinite|title=The Whole Truth About Fatima, Volume III|year=1990|pages=578–579|location=Buffalo, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This announcement produced considerable speculation over the content of the secret. According to the ''New York Times'', speculation ranged from "worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E7DA133BF937A25756C0A9669C8B63 Stanley, Alexandra. "Vatican Discloses the 'Third Secret' of Fatima", ''New York Times'', May 14, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 May 1981, [[Aer Lingus Flight 164|Laurence James Downey hijacked an airplane]] and demanded that Pope John Paul II make public the Third Secret of Fatima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vltOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4474%2C366604 |title=Former monk hijacks Irish airliner |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=2 May 1981 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the text sparked criticism from the Catholic Church in Portugal. Clergy as well as laypeople were offended that the text had been read in Rome and not at the Fátima shrine in Portugal where the reported events took place. ''[[The Times]]'' for June 29, 2000 reported that "The revelation on Monday that there were no doomsday predictions has provoked angry reactions from the Portuguese church over the decision to keep the prophecy secret for half a century."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Critics such as Italian journalist and media personality [[Antonio Socci]] claim that the four-page, handwritten text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican in 2000 is not the real secret, or at least not the full secret.&lt;ref name="SocciBook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fourth Secret of Fatima|last=Socci |first=Antonio |year=2009 |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is based on the following:

*Written on one sheet of paper: the text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican is handwritten on four sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="OfficialText" /&gt; Father Joaquin Alonso, official Fátima archivist for sixteen years, reports in his book that, "Lucy tells us that she wrote it on a sheet of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Alonso, Father Joaquin |title=La Verdad sobre el Secreto de Fatima |year=1976 |page=60 |location=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a taped interview, Charles Fiore quoted [[Malachi Martin]] as saying the following regarding the text of the Third Secret: "I cooled my heels in the corridor outside the Holy Father's apartments, while my boss, [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Bea]], was inside debating with the Holy Father, and with a group of other bishops and priests, and two young Portuguese seminarians, who translated the letter, a single page, written in Portuguese, for all those in the room."&lt;ref name="GodsMessenger"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Malachi Martin: God's Messenger – In the Words of Those Who Knew Him Best |first=Brian |last=Doran |id=Audio Cassette |date= 11 August 2000 |isbn=1-885692-08-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Written in the form of a letter: another reason why critics argue the full Third Secret has not been released is because of indications that the Third Secret was written in the form of a signed letter to the Bishop of Leiria and the text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican is not written in the form of a letter.&lt;ref name="OfficialText" /&gt; Lúcia was interviewed by Father Jongen on February 3, 1946. When Fr. Jongen asked Lúcia when the time would arrive for the Third Secret, Lúcia responded, "I communicated the third part in a letter to the Bishop of Leiria." Also, Canon Galamba, an advisor to the Bishop of Leiria, is quoted as saying, "When the bishop refused to open the letter, Lucy made him promise that it would definitely be opened and read to the world either at her death or in 1960, whichever came first."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Alonso, Father Joaquin |title=La Verdad sobre el Secreto de Fatima |year=1976 |pages=46–47 |location=Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contains words attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary: the text of the Third Secret released by the Vatican contains no words attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="OfficialText" /&gt; Socci asserts that the Third Secret likely begins with the words, "In Portugal the dogma of the Faith will always be preserved etc", words which Lúcia included in her Fourth Memoir, but which are included only as a footnote to the text released by the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretstillhidden.com/book.html Socci, Antonio. ''The Secret Still Hidden''](Good Counsel, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contains information about the Apocalypse, apostasy, Satanic infiltration of the Church: in an interview published in the November 11, 1984 edition of ''Jesus'' Magazine, Cardinal Ratzinger was asked whether he had read the text of the Third Secret and why it had not been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Jesus Magazine |date= 11 November 1984|title=Here is Why the Faith is in Crisis|id=(Original Article in Italian) p. 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzinger acknowledged that he had read the Third Secret, and stated in part that the Third Secret involves the "importance of the [[End time|novissimi]]", and "dangers threatening the faith and the life of the Christian and therefore (the life) of the world." Ratzinger also commented that, "If it is not made public – at least for the time being – it is in order to prevent religious prophecy from being mistaken for a quest for the sensational."&lt;ref name="Ratzinger1984"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Frère Michel de la Sainte Trinité |title=The Whole Truth About Fatima – Volume III |year=1990 |location=Buffalo, New York CityA. |pages=822–823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a news article quoted former Philippine ambassador to the Vatican, Howard Dee, as saying that Cardinal Ratzinger had personally confirmed to him that the messages of [[Our Lady of Akita|Akita]] and Fátima are "essentially the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?id=20583 |title=Full Text of the Third Secret Revealed |date= 11 October 2001 |journal=Catholic World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Akita prophecy, in part, contains the following: "The work of the devil will infiltrate even into the Church in such a way that one will see cardinals opposing cardinals, bishops against bishops. … churches and altars sacked ...."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Akita, Japan|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/akita.htm |journal=Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Akita |last=Haffert |first=John M. |page=8 |date= 1 July 1989 |publisher=One Hundred One Foundation, Incorporated |isbn=1-890137-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2000, Cardinal Sodano announced that the Third Secret would be released, during which he implied the secret was about the persecution of Christians in the 20th century that culminated in the failed assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II on 13 May 1981.&lt;ref name="SodanoAnnouncemnet"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/travels/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000513_sodano-fatima.html |title=Address of Cardinal Sodano Regarding the 'Third Part' of the Secret of Fatima at the Conclusion of the Solemn Mass |date= 13 May 2000 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a syndicated radio broadcast, Malachi Martin stated that the Third Secret "doesn't make any sense unless we accept that there will be, or that there is in progress, a wholesale apostasy amongst clerics, and laity in the Catholic Church ...".&lt;ref&gt;Father Malachi Martin on Coast to Coast AM, with interviewer Art Bell. 4 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

:In a 1980 interview for the German magazine ''Stimme des Glaubens'' published in October 1981, John Paul II was asked explicitly to speak about the third secret. He said:
{{quote|Because of the seriousness of its contents, in order not to encourage the world wide power of Communism to carry out certain coups, my predecessors in the chair of Peter have diplomatically preferred to withhold its publication. On the other hand, it should be sufficient for all Christians to know this much: if there is a message in which it is said that the oceans will flood entire sections of the earth; that, from one moment to the other, millions of people will perish... there is no longer any point in really wanting to publish this secret message. Many want to know merely out of curiosity, or because of their taste for sensationalism, but they forget that 'to know' implies for them a responsibility. It is dangerous to want to satisfy one's curiosity only, if one is convinced that we can do nothing against a catastrophe that has been predicted." He held up his rosary and stated "Here is the remedy against this evil. Pray, pray and ask for nothing else. Put everything in the hands of the Mother of God." Asked what would happen in the Church, he said: "We must be prepared to undergo great trials in the not-too-distant future; trials that will require us to be ready to give up even our lives, and a total gift of self to Christ and for Christ. Through your prayers and mine, it is possible to alleviate this tribulation, but it is no longer possible to avert it, because it is only in this way that the Church can be effectively renewed. How many times, indeed, has the renewal of the Church been effected in blood? This time, again, it will not be otherwise. We must be strong, ... we must entrust ourselves to Christ and to His holy Mother, and we must be attentive, very attentive, to the prayer of the Rosary."&lt;ref&gt;English translation from Daniel J. Lynch, ''The Call to Total Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary'' (St. Albans, Vermont: Missions of the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pub., 1991), pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to one source, when Lúcia was asked about the Third Secret, she said it was "in the Gospels and in the Apocalypse", and at one point she had even specified Apocalypse chapters 8 to 13, a range that includes the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:4, the chapter and verse cited by Pope John Paul II in his homily in Fátima on May 13, 2000.&lt;ref name="Trinite533"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Frere Michel de la Sainte Trinite |title=The Whole Truth About Fatima, Volume III |year=1990 |page=533 |location=Buffalo, New York CityA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardinal Bertone's response==
The Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published in June 2000. A report from the Zenit ''Daily Dispatch'' dated December 20, 2001 based on a Vatican press release, reported that Lúcia told then-Archbishop [[Tarcisio Bertone]], in an interview conducted the previous month, that the secret has been completely revealed and published, and that no secrets remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ZFATIMA.HTM No More Fatima Secrets]&lt;/ref&gt; Bertone, along with Cardinal Ratzinger, co-authored ''The Message of Fatima'',&lt;ref name="OfficialText"/&gt; the document published in June 2000 by the Vatican that contains a scanned copy of the original text of the Third Secret. [[File:Cardinal tarcisio bertone.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Cardinal Bertone.]]

Bertone, who was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2003 and held the position of [[Vatican Secretary of State]] until September 2013, wrote a book in 2007 titled, ''The Last Secret of Fatima''.&lt;ref name="BertoneBook"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bertone|first=Tarcisio |title=The Last Secret of Fatima: The Revelation of One of the Most Controversial Events in Catholic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81nF3iyA640C|year=2008|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-385-52695-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains a transcribed interview between journalist Giuseppe De Carli and Bertone in which Bertone responds to various criticisms and accusations regarding the content and disclosure of the Third Secret. At one point in the interview, De Carli comments on an unsourced accusation that the Vatican is concealing a one-page text of the Third Secret which predicts a great apostasy where Rome will "lose the faith and become the throne of the Antichrist." Bertone responds as follows:
{{quote|That's absolutely crazy. Look, are you claiming that the prophecy of Fatima is about the apostasy of the Church of Rome? That Fatima is a prediction of Rome's transformation into the throne of the Antichrist? Despite the love Our Lady has for the Pope and the Popes for Our Lady? Anyone can write books based on conspiracy theories, on biased interpretations. Anybody can take sentences out of context and present them as clues to some supposed plot to avoid divulging the truth and to transmit it in a code that only the initiates can understand. No, the whole theory you allude to is a fabrication. And this supposedly factual account is actually the sort of device the Masons used to invent to discredit the Church. I'm surprised that journalists and writers who claim to be Catholic let themselves be taken in.{{sfn|Bertone, pp. 65–66}}}}
At another point in the interview, De Carli mentions that Cardinal Ottaviani had once stated that the Third Secret was written on a single sheet of paper. He also mentions that one of Lúcia's memoirs contains the words, "In Portugal, the dogma of the faith will always be preserved etc", words which some believe introduce the real Third Secret. Describing these observations as "feeble bits of evidence that neither prove nor disprove anything", De Carli asks Cardinal Bertone about the possibility of there being two texts, where the "first document" contains the words of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the other contains the description of the vision published by the Vatican. Bertone answers in part, "There is no first document. There never was any such text in the archives of the Holy Office." Bertone also says, "So I'm not sure what Cardinal Ottaviani was talking about." Bertone also states that, "We have the word, better, the official confirmation of Sister Lúcia: 'Is this the Third Secret, and is this the only text of it?' 'Yes, this is the Third Secret, and I never wrote any other'."{{sfn|Bertone, pp. 63–64}}

Later on in the interview, Bertone again addresses the question as to whether a text exists with words attributed to the Blessed Virgin that was censored: "The part of the text where the Virgin speaks in the first person wasn't censored, for the simple reason that it never existed. ...I'm basing my statement on Sister Lucia's own direct confirmation that the Third Secret is none other than the text that was published in the year 2000."{{sfn|Bertone, p. 66}}

In early September 2007, archbishop [[Loris Francesco Capovilla]], private secretary to Pope John XXIII, who witnessed Pope John open the envelope of the third secret, said there was no truth in the rumor that the Vatican was suppressing a vision of the end of the world. "There are not two truths from Fatima and nor is there any fourth secret. The text which I read in 1959 is the same that was distributed by the Vatican." Capovilla is also quoted as saying, "I have had enough of these conspiracy theories. It just isn't true. I read it, I presented it to the Pope and we resealed the envelope."&lt;ref name=last&gt;{{cite journal |title=Last Surviving Witness Says Third Fatima Secret is Fully Revealed |date= 12 September 2007 |agency=Catholic News Agency |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=10363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2007 writers Antonio Socci and Solideo Paolini, who have competing books on Fatima, attempted to crash a reception at the Pontifical Urbanianum University where Bertone was to introduce his book ''The Last Fatima Visionary: My Meetings with Sister Lucia''. They stated that they wished to participate in the question and answer part of the reception. When told that the cardinal would not be taking questions, they then tried to confront Bertone, who is the Vatican Secretary of State. Security guards hustled them. In talking to reporters afterwards, Socci and Paolini produced a tape recording in which they claimed Archbishop [[Loris Francesco Capovilla]], revealed that there were two texts of the Third Secret,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Italian Journalists Protest Exclusion from Fatima Discussion |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=53798&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=1&amp;searchid=541772 |date= 27 September 2007 |journal= Catholic World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Capovilla had stated otherwise less than two weeks before.&lt;ref name=last/&gt;

==Pope John Paul I==
The Catholic Counter-Reformation group, founded by theologian [[:fr:Georges de Nantes|Abbé George de Nantes]], takes the position that the released text is the complete Third Secret, but refers to [[Pope John Paul I]] rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the Third Secret did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crc-internet.org/JP1/Fatima4.htm Whole Truth About Fatima, Chapter 4] from the CCR website, chapters 7, 8 and 9, page found 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter to a colleague after his election, he vowed to perform the [[Consecration of Russia]] which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.&lt;ref&gt;The letter is quoted in Camillo Bassotto's biography of John Paul I, ''My Heart Is Still in Venice'' (Krinon, 1990), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
Michael Cuneo notes, "Secret messages, apocalyptic countdowns, cloak-and-dagger intrigue within the highest echelons of the Vatican: not even Hollywood could ask for better material than this".&lt;ref name=Cuneo&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cuneo|first=Michael W.|title=The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OL9tyvN5YcC&amp;pg=PA135|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"To understand and appreciate Fatima is to understand and appreciate Portuguese Catholicism".&lt;ref name=Maunder/&gt; Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, starting in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fatima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon are more important than its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates not only how seriously Catholics took "the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation.&lt;ref name=Maunder/&gt; Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at [[Necedah Shrine|Necedah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3166">'''Vincible ignorance''' is, in [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic ethics]], ignorance that a person could remove by applying reasonable diligence in the given set of circumstances.  It contrasts with '''invincible ignorance''', which a person is either entirely incapable of removing, or could only do so by [[supererogatory]] efforts (''i.e.'', efforts above and beyond normal duty).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231929/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1999/9907chap.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of vincible ignorance would be a person who is unsure about certain Catholic teachings, but refrains from seeking an explanation of those teachings.

While invincible ignorance eliminates culpability, vincible ignorance at most mitigates it, and may even aggravate guilt. The guilt of an action performed in vincible ignorance ought to be measured by the degree of diligence or negligence shown in performing the act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  If some insufficient diligence was shown in dispelling ignorance, it is termed ''merely'' vincible; it may diminish culpability to the point of rendering a sin [[Venial sin|venial]].  When little or no effort is made to remove ignorance, the ignorance is termed ''crass'' or ''supine''; it removes little or no guilt.  Deliberately fostered ignorance is ''affected'' or ''studied''; it can increase guilt.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231929/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1999/9907chap.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignorance ought to be distinguished from mere nescience.  Ignorance is a lack of knowledge that a person has a duty or obligation to know, whereas nescience refers to a lack of knowledge about things one is not bound to know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2076.htm (ST I-II 76, 2)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus vincible and invincible ignorance only can be applied to matters that a person has a duty to know about.  For example, if a doctor did not know the name of a certain artery in the body, he would be ignorant of that information, but the rest of the population who has no duty to know that information would be nescient of it.

Ignorance may be 
* Of law, when one is unaware of the existence of the law itself, or at least that a particular case is comprised under its provisions.
* Of fact, when not the relation of something to the law but the thing itself or some circumstance is unknown.
* Of penalty, when a person is not cognizant that a sanction has been attached to a particular crime. This is especially to be considered when there is question of more serious punishment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07648a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waiting for Armageddon''''' is an American documentary film that studies [[Armageddon]] theology and [[Christian eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/waitingforarmageddon?q=Waiting%20for%20Armageddon MetaCritic.com – Waiting for Armageddon]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]]  in the United States believe that [[bible prophecy]] predicts events including the [[Rapture]] and the Battle of Armageddon. The documentary raises questions regarding how this theology shapes United States and Middle East relations and how it may encourage an [[international]] [[Religious war|holy war]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">'''Xelhua''' is one of the seven giants in [[Aztec mythology]] who escaped the flood by ascending the mountain of [[Tlaloc]] in the terrestrial paradise, and afterwards built the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula]]. A [[Dominican monk]] wrote this account:

{{quote|Before the great inundation which took place 4,800 years after the erection of the world, the country of Anahuac was inhabited by giants, all of whom either perished in the inundation or were transformed into fishes, save seven who fled into caverns.

When the waters subsided, one of the giants, called Xelhua, surnamed the 'Architect,' went to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], where, as a memorial of the [[Tlaloc]] which had served for an asylum to himself and his six brethren, he built an artificial hill in the form of a pyramid. He ordered bricks to be made in the province of [[Tlalmanalco]], at the foot of the Sierra of [[Cecotl]], and in order to convey them to Cholula he placed a file of men who passed them from hand to hand. The gods beheld, with wrath, an edifice the top of which was to reach the clouds. Irritated at the daring attempt of Xelhua, they hurled fire on the pyramid. Numbers of the workmen perished. The work was discontinued, and the monument was afterwards dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]].|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/etc/oph/oph06.htm|title=Ophiolatreia|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Jainism}}
'''Yati''' ("Jati" in vernaculars) historically was the general term for a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]]. In the late medieval period it came to represent a stationary monk, who lived in one place rather than wandering as required for a Jain monk.&lt;ref&gt;Jain Yati Parampara, Agarchand Nahta, Kesarimalji Surana Abhinandan Granth, 1982, p. 71-78&lt;/ref&gt; The term was more common for the [[Śvētāmbara]] monastics, but was also used by the [[Digambara]]s. The term has also been occasionally for ascetics from other traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/91233/yati  Buddhist Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars married and were termed ''Sansari yati''&lt;ref&gt;The A to Z of Jainism
Kristi L. Wiley, Scarecrow Press, Jul 16, 2009, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; or [[mahātmā]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages21and22.html#content Ramayana - Pages 21 and 22, The colophon in red states that the text was written by the Mahatma Hirananda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dabistán: Or, School of Manners: The Religious Beliefs, Observances, Philosophic Opinions and Social Customs of the Nations of the East, Fānī Muḣsin, Translated by David Shea, Anthony Troyer, M. Walter Dunne, 1901, p. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ruling dynasties in [[Rajasthan]] had a close relationship with yatis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignca.nic.in/coilnet/rj002.htm पुरालेखा स्रोत, राहुल तनेगारिया, कतिपय जैन यति भी राज परिवारों की वंशावलियां रखते थे। खरतरगच्छ के जैन यति मारवाड़ राजवंश के कुलगुरु माने जाते थे।]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] mentions that yatis were invited to participate in the discussion on religions.&lt;ref&gt;,अकबर और तत्कालीन भारत, Ed. [[Irfan Habib]], Rajkamal Prakashan Pvt Ltd, 2009 p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The stationary yatis often managed institutions and properties. Some of their residences are termed ''Jatiji'' in their memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dainiktribuneonline.com/2012/08/भाग्योदय-संस्कार-शिविर-व/   भाग्योदय संस्कार शिविर व रक्षाबंधन पर्व आयोजित, August - 2 - 2012, रोहतक, 2 अगस्त (हप्र)। झज्जर रोड पर स्थित जैन जतीजी में जैनाचार्य गुप्तिनन्दी जी गुरुदेव ने रक्षाबंधन के  पर्व पर 15 वर्ष से ऊपर की आयु के सैकड़ों गुरुभक्तों को भाग्योदय के संस्कारों से संस्कारित किया]&lt;/ref&gt;

With reestablishment of orders of wandering (''samvegi'') monks since late 19th and early 20th century, the number of yatis have declined significantly.&lt;ref&gt;The Penguin Handbook of the World's Living Religions, Penguin UK, Mar 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;People of India: Rajasthan, K. S. Singh, Popular Prakashan, Jan 1, 1998
p. 991-994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shripujya==
The heads of the institutions of Śhwētāmbara Yatis were often termed Shripujya,&lt;ref&gt;Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Volume 9, Part 1,
Bombay (India : State), Government Central Press, 1901, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Digambara institutions headed by the [[Bhattaraka]]s. Only a celibate yati could become a Shripujya. They have now been replaced by [[Acharya]]s who head orders of wandering monks.

==Prominent Yatis==
* [[Yativṛṣabha]], 500-570
* [[Rajendrasuri]] who was initiated as a Yati and later helped transform  the tradition in 1880.
* Yati Lavaji, the founder of the [[Sthānakavāsī]] sect about 1653
* Yati Yatanlal, (1894-1967) freedom fighter. There is an award named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhaskar.com/article/MAT-CHH-OTH-c-16-556869-NOR.html महासमुंद में बनने लगा जयपुर कृत्रिम हाथ,, Matrix News, Aug 05, 2013, मुख्य अतिथि श्री मालू ने कहा के यति यतनलाल समाज सेवी होने के साथ साथ एक स'चे देशभक्त थे. बचपन से समाज सेवा, देश सेवा में रूचि रखने वाले यति जी ने १७ जुलाई १९७६ में श्री विवेकवर्धन सेवा आश्रम की स्थापना कर आश्रम परिसर में सर्व सुविधायुक्त निशुल्क अस्पताल का शुभारंभ किया]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Yatis==

Many Yatis were very influential. One of the greatest Marwari trading firm [[Tarachand Ghanshyamdas]] was founded as the result of the blessings of a Jain Yati at Churu. The founder, Chaterbhuj, an Aggarwal Poddar, was a devotee of a Jain Yati. The Yati inspired him to go to Bhatinda.&lt;ref&gt;[Poddarji ka Gharana aur Poddarji, Jhavarmall Sharma, in  Poddar Abhinandan Granth, Ed. Vasudevsharan Agrawal, Mathura Sam. 2010 (1953), Akhil Bharatiya Braj Sahitya Mandal, p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in establishment of a India-wide trading empire. Tarachand Ghanshyamdas is considered to have spawned numerous Marwari trading houses, established by its clerks.
