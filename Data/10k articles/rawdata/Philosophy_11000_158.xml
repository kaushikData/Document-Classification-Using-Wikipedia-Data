'''African philosophy''' is [[philosophy]] produced by [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods.&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"&gt;Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009), pp. 74-79, Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682&lt;/ref&gt; African philosophers may be found in the various academic fields of philosophy, such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics|moral philosophy]], and [[political philosophy]]. African philosophy can also be defined as any epistemic endeavor that attempts to understand the world from an African perspective. It is therefore not just about Africa but about the world even if the location of the subject is Africa.

==Definition==
Much of modern African philosophy has been concerned with defining the [[ethnophilosophy|ethnophilosophical]] parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions.&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"/&gt; One of the implicit assumptions of ethnophilosophy is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world, however this concept is disputed by traditional philosophers.&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"&gt;Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998), pp. 38-39, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0847688410&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, in [https://www.amazon.com/Discourse-African-Philosophy-Transitional-Perspectives/dp/1498512259/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me= ''A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on'' Ubuntu ''and Transitional Justice in South Africa''], Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ''ubuntu'' presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy ("collective" in the sense that it does not focus on any individual in particular) that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. 

The Nigerian philosopher Uzodinma Nwala, prior to his employment to teach at UNN, said that there was no African philosophy available as a course of study in universities. "All we were taught as students were Western philosophy. Nothing like African philosophy existed anywhere. In fact, many years after the introduction of the courses, there still remained arguments among experts, whether there was really African Philosophy". He was awarded the Aimé Césaire award in 2013 at the University of Abuja for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutsindikwa|first=Joel|title="The phrase African Philosophy"|url=https://www.academia.edu/24590479/The_phrase_African_philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"/&gt;

African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as "that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=R.S.|title=Authority, Responsibility and Education|date=1959|publisher=G. Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, African philosophy is a critical reflection on African leaderships in the administration of their duties towards their citizens; the morally blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of it. It will also provide possible solutions to the problems experienced in African governance. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

One of the most basic disagreements concerns what exactly the term 'African' qualifies: the content of the philosophy and the distinctive methods employed, or the identities of the philosophers.&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"/&gt; On the former view, philosophy counts as African if it involves African themes such as perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects, or uses methods that are defined as distinctively African.&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"/&gt; In the latter view, African philosophy is any philosophy produced by Africans or by people of African descent, and others engaged in critiques or analysis of their works.&lt;ref name="Bruce B. Janz, Philosophy in an African Place (2009)"/&gt;

Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world's phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of [[natural philosophy]] is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Muhatia Makumba, An Introduction to African Philosophy: Past and Present (2007), p. 25, https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9966082964&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, dating at least as far back to the [[ancient Egyptian philosophy]] identified in pre-dynastic Egyptian thought and culture, and continuing through the development of the major regional philosophical traditions of [[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[Central Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]].

In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct African [[political philosophy]] that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. There was also notable engagement in the pre-colonial and early post-colonial era with the [[Marxist]] and [[Communist]] philosophical traditions developing throughout the twentieth century, resulting in the flourishing of a distinctive African [[Economic Philosophy|economic philosoph]]ical tradition. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the [[African socialist]] philosophy of [[Ujamaa]] propounded in Tanzania and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]]. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world.

==Pre-modern==
===North Africa===
In [[North Africa]], arguably central to the development of the [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|ancient Egyptian philosoph]]ical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of "[[ma'at]]", which roughly translated refers to "justice", "truth", or simply "that which is right". One of the earliest works of political philosophy was [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]], which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries.

Ancient Egyptian philosophers also made important contributions to [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]]. In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of [[Neoplatonism]] was founded by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century CE.

====Christian====
{{further|Christian philosophy}}
In the Christian tradition, [[Augustine of Hippo]] was a cornerstone of Christian philosophy and theology. He lived from 354 to 430 CE, and wrote his best-known work, ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]], [[Algeria]]). He challenged a number of ideas of his age including [[Arianism]], and established the notions of [[original sin]] and [[divine grace]] in Christian philosophy and theology.

====Islamic====
{{Further|Islamic philosophy}}
In the Islamic tradition, [[Ibn Bajjah]] philosophized along [[neo-Platonist]] lines in the 12th century C.E. The purpose of human life, according to Bajja, was to gain true happiness, and true happiness is attained by grasping the [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]] through reason and philosophy, often outside the framework of organized religion.

[[Ibn Rushd]] philosophised along more Aristotelian lines, establishing the philosophical school of [[Averroism]]. Notably, he argued that there was no conflict between religion and philosophy, and instead that there are a variety of routes to God, all equally valid, and that the philosopher was free to take the route of reason while the commoners were unable to take that route, and only able to take the route of teachings passed on to them.

[[Mohammad Ibn Abd-al-Haq Ibn Sab'in|Ibn Sab'in]] challenged the above view, arguing that Aristotelian methods of philosophy were useless in attempting to understand the universe, because those ideas failed to mirror the basic unity of the universe with itself and with God, so that true understanding required a different method of reasoning.

===West Africa===
The most prominent of [[West Africa]]'s pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as [[Omoluabi]] were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the [[Yoruba mythology|Itan]]. The cosmologies and philosophies of the [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and [[Dahomey]] were also significant.

====Islamic====
Historically the [[West Africa]]n philosophical traditions have had a significant impact on [[Islamic philosophy]] as a whole as much of the Islamic philosophical tradition was subject to the influence of scholars born or working in the African continent in centres of learning such as [[Djenne]] and [[Timbuktu]] in [[Mali]]. Many of these intellectuals and scholars created a philosophical tradition in these cities.

===Horn of Africa===
In the [[Horn of Africa]], there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct [[Ethiopian philosophy]] from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher [[Zera Yacob]], and that of his disciples.

===Southern Africa===
In [[Southern Africa]] and [[Southeast Africa]] the development of a distinctive [[Bantu Philosophy|Bantu philosophy]] addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind's relation to the world following the [[Bantu migration]] has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as one notable example emerging from this worldview.

===Central Africa===
Many [[Central Africa]]n philosophical traditions before the [[Bantu migration]] into southern [[Central Africa]] have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] and [[Sudanic languages|Sudanic]] peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in [[Dinka mythology]], [[Maasai mythology]] and similar traditions.

===African Diaspora===
Some pre-Modern [[African Diaspora|African diaspor]]ic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was [[Anthony William Amo]], who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now [[Ghana]], and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of Halle Halle and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in Germany.

==Modern==
[[Kenya]]n philosopher [[Henry Odera Oruka]] has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic&amp;ndash;ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy.&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/&gt; In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Okot p'Bitek]], and [[Taban Lo Liyong]], and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher [[Maulana Karenga]] has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources.

===Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity&lt;!--'Sage philosophy' redirects here--&gt;===
Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African [[worldview]]. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual.

One proponent of this form, [[Placide Tempels]], argued in ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]'' that the metaphysical categories of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa.

Another example of this sort of approach is the work of E. J. Algoa of the [[University of Port Harcourt]] in [[Nigeria]], who argues for the existence of an African [[philosophy of history]] stemming from traditional proverbs from the [[Niger Delta]] in his paper "An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition." Algoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as "More days, more wisdom", and "What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing." Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging ("Truth never rots"), but people are subject to error ("Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls"). It is dangerous to judge by appearances ("A large eye does not mean keen vision"), but first-hand observation can be trusted ("He who sees does not err"). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history ("A storyteller does not tell of a different season"). The future remains beyond knowledge ("Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future"). Nevertheless, it is said, "God will outlive eternity." History is seen as vitally important ("One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman"), and historians (known as "sons of the soil") are highly revered ("The son of the soil has the python's keen eyes"). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be construed to the whole of Africa.

Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of [[Negritude]]. [[Leopold Senghor]], a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[architecture]], and [[philosophy]] were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly [[reductionist]] due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa.

Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Algoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought.

Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures' worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning&amp;mdash;these become the targets of philosophical sagacity.

Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African [[anthropology]] or [[ethnology]] and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher.

Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the [[history of ideas]], although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=uWOnYFyGZcMC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=ethnophilosophy+philosophy+history+of+ideas+the+same+or+not&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnophilosophy%20philosophy%20history%20of%20ideas%20the%20same%20or%20not&amp;f=false "OVERVIEW AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY"], p. 172, ''One Hundred Philosophers'', Peter J. King, Zebra, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] or the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, such as in "my philosophy is live and let live.

===Professional philosophy===
Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/&gt; Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/&gt; This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ.&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/&gt; Some African philosophers classified in this category are Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita.&lt;ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/&gt;

===Nationalist and ideological philosophy===
Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include [[African socialism]], [[Nkrumaism]], [[Harambee]] and [[Authenticite]]

==African ethics==
Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person's character, and saying "he has no morals" translates as something like "he has no character".&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; A person's character reflects the accumulation of her deeds and her habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person's life.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; In some African cultures, "personhood" refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gyekye|first1=Kwame|editor1-link=Edward N. Zalta|title=African Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=9 Sep 2010|volume=Fall 2011 Edition|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many traditional African societies are highly religious, their religions are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; Instead, ethics is [[humanistic]] and [[utilitarian]]: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective "social good" embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt; African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics.&lt;ref name=Gyekye2010 /&gt;

==Africana philosophy==
{{Main|Africana philosophy}}
Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the [[African diaspora]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of [[Western philosophy]], post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, [[black existentialism]] in the United States, and the meaning of "blackness" in the modern world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Amelia Valcarcel''' (November 16, 1950) is a Spanish philosopher and feminist.  She is considered within the “philosophic feminism” as part of the “[[equality feminism]]” approach. In 2015 she is a Professor in Moral and Political Philosophy at the [[National University of Distance Education]] and since 2006 is member of the [[Spanish Council of State]].

==Early life and education==
Valcárcel was born in Madrid. She studied Philosophy at the Universities of Oviedo and Valencia, in Spain.

== Professional life ==
Valcárcel worked at the University of Oviedo for three decades, before becoming Professor in Moral and Political Philosophy at the [[National University of Distance Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El debate. Amelia Valcarcel|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/10/07/biografiaeldebate/1318008224_747547.html|website=El País|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/spanish-stereotypes-we-have-mondays-too "Spanish stereotypes: statistics tell us they have Mondays, too"]. ''Europa''.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has participated and organized numerous seminars and conferences in the fields of Philosophy, [[moral values]] and [[women’s rights]]. She has been also taken part in national and international panels and boards, as well as playing an advisory role at editorial and journal boards. She was the director of the magazine ''Leviatán''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lechuza.org/rev/r34a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Valcárcel is actively engaged in public affairs in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amelia Valcárcel analiza en Valencia la relación entre religión y democracia|url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2014/11/19/valencia/1416436931_074274.html|website=El País|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has performed various public roles, including State Counsellor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web oficial|url=http://www.consejo-estado.es/directorio.htm|website=Consejo de Estado - España|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice-President of the Real Patronage of the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enciclopedia on line|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/valcarcel-y-bernaldo-de-quiros-amelia/|website=Museo Nacional del Prado|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1993 and 1995, she was Counsellor for Education, Culture, Sports and Youth in the regional government of [[Asturias]].

== Philosophy and feminism ==

Valcárcel’s academic life has been mainly devoted to two academic fields: philosophy and feminist studies.

Within the subject area of Feminist Philosophy, Valcárcel is considered to be part of the ''[[equality feminism]]'' approach. Her most distinctive contribution to the field of feminist thinking has been to place feminism within the canonic history of political philosophy, especially in her monograph ''Feminismo en el mundo global'' (2008). She has written several manuscripts, some of them translated into other languages. Her theoretical thinking is close to that of the equally well-known Spanish philosophers [[Celia Amorós]] and [[Victoria Camps]].

Valcárcel takes the philosophical position that the nexus between women is not the nature or essence of themselves, opposite to the difference feminism arguments, it is however the patriarchal and hetero-designation, the role which patriarchal assigns to women (mother, daughter, espouse and prostitute…) and especially the role women occupy in society which has been depicted by men. Likewise, the role and common denominator that all women share is their functional status (submission) different from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Una filósofa en Combate|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2006/11/26/eps/1164526007_850215.html|website=Diario El País|accessdate=1 March 2015|language=ES|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr Aref Ali Nayed''' ([[Arabic]]: عارف علي النايض; born in 1962) is a Libyan Islamic scholar and the Libyan Ambassador to the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocAnews&amp;cid=1289994646755&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWAM_A_Layout&amp;parent=Collection&amp;parentid=1135099399897 |title=وكيل وزارة الخارجية يتسلم نسخة من أوراق اعتماد سفير الدولة الليبية |publisher=WAM Emirates News Agency |place=UAE |date=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929200819/http://www.wam.org.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocAnews&amp;cid=1289994646755&amp;pagename=WAM%2FWAM_A_Layout&amp;parent=Collection&amp;parentid=1135099399897 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nayed is the founder and director of Kalam Research &amp; Media (KRM), based in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]] and [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalamresearch.com/documents/krmbr.pdf kalamresearch.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324105956/http://www.kalamresearch.com/documents/krmbr.pdf |date=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the outbreak of the revolution in Libya, he lectured on Islamic theology, logic, and spirituality at the restored Uthman Pasha Madrassa in Tripoli, and supervised graduate students at the Islamic Call College there.

Before the liberation of Tripoli in 2011, he was appointed by the [[National Transitional Council]] as the coordinator of the Tripoli Taskforce. When Tripoli was liberated in late August 2011, the remit was broadened and he was made the lead coordinator of  the Libya Stabilization Team. Earlier in the year, he was the coordinator for the Support Offices of the [[Mahmoud Jibril|Executive Team]] of the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) of Libya. He is also the secretary of the [[Network of Free Ulema – Libya]].

According to [[the Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought]], Nayed is ranked 50th among the top 500 most influential Muslims in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themuslim500.com/profile/dr-aref-ali-nayed|title=Dr Aref Ali Nayed - The Muslim 500|website=Themuslim500.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Aref Ali Nayed was born in Benghazi in 1962 and raised in Tripoli. In 1978, the Nayed family property and businesses were confiscated by Gaddafi and the family fled Libya, relocating to Costa Rica, Hong Kong, and finally the United States. He later went to Canada, to study at the insistence of his father, and received his BSc in Engineering from the [[University of Guelph]] in Ontario. At Guelph, he became deeply interested in philosophy and science and stayed on to complete an MA in the Philosophy of Science, and then a PhD in [[Hermeneutics]]. His doctoral work on operational hermeneutics was published in 2011 by Kalam Research and Media. Pursuing further his academic interests he studied [[Islamic philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and then specialised in Christian theology at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oOb6HttUR0|title=لقاء الدكتور عارف النايض مع نبيل الحاج قناة ليبيا الأحرار (الجزء الأول)أمين|date=2 March 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to take up several academic positions and was Professor at the [[Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies]] in Rome, and the International Institute for Islamic Thought and Civilization in Malaysia.

In the 1990s, he returned to Libya and headed an IT company with offices in Tripoli, Benghazi, Sharjah and Hyderabad.

As the former Libyan government began lifting restrictions on religious teaching, helped restore and reopen the famous Othman Pasha [[Madrasa]] in the Old Madina of Tripoli. This madrasa was a renowned centre for theological and spiritual instructions and many leading Tripolitanian scholars of the past were associated with it. Nayed taught theology, logic and spirituality there, until February 2011, when the political unrest in Tripoli escalated and the former regime's forces committed widespread violence, killings and summary arrests of those supporting the Free Libyan movement.

Nayed is also Senior Advisor to the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme; Fellow of the [[Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought|Royal Aal Al-Bayt Institute]] in Jordan; and was appointed to the Board of Advisors of the prestigious [[Templeton Foundation]].

==Career==
From 1984 to 1998 Nayed was an educator, teaching in universities in North America, Europe, North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In 1998, Nayed interrupted his academic career at the behest of his father and founded Agathon Systems Limited/Alada, an engineering and technology enterprise focused on building data centers, networking, and banking infrastructures across Libya. Prior to the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Revolution]] in 2011, Agathon represented 33 global technology companies in Libya, including [[IBM]], CITRIX, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Nortel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[APC by Schneider Electric|APC]]. Nayed directly oversaw the implementation of projects across Libya and deployed some of the earliest projects in the automation of both the oil and banking sectors of Libya. Nayed's companies introduced ATM systems across the country and was responsible for the national payment system for the Central Bank of Libya. The company has worked with every bank in Libya and built data networks for Libya's National Oil (NOC) and National Utility (GECOL) companies, and created data centers in Libya for [[Schlumberger]], [[British Petroleum]], and WesternGECO. Alada built the company-wide network for [[Total Oil]]. Through Alada's projects, NAted trained over 200 young Libyan engineers and helped incubate over seven IT and communications businesses on behalf of former employees.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
From 1990 Nayed devoted himself and his resources to philanthropy and social activism in Libya and abroad. He has worked to preserve traditional knowledge, promote learning and build capacities of young Libyans. Nayed endowed libraries in Libya, Mali, Turkey, and Tajikistan. With his own funds, Nayed restored the historic Uthman Pasha Madrassa and its library in Tripoli. Nayed established the first university library in Bani Walid and another 25,000 volume library in Tripoli. Nayed worked on the publication and dissemination of writings promoting the restoration of Libya's cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Nayed also funded the restoration of the Al Ahly Sports, Cultural, and Social Club in Benghazi, as well as other sports clubs across Libya. Nayed serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Al Ahly SC in Benghazi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahly.ly/ab/ahly.asp?Ses=kit2013142013-2014team201314]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623130108/http://ahly.ly/ab/ahly.asp?Ses=kit2013142013-2014team201314 |date=23 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalam Research &amp; Media==
In, 2009 Nayed founded Kalam Research &amp; Media based in Tripoli, Tobruk, and Bayda in Libya and Dubai, UAE. Kalam Research &amp; Media was formed as a collegial think tank and training center dedicated to research, education, content development and capacity building in Islamic theology, philosophy, and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kalamresearch.com/~kalamres/about-us.php]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828082150/http://www.kalamresearch.com/~kalamres/about-us.php |date=28 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libyan Revolution==
Nayed joined the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Revolution]] on 19 February 2011, after joining in popular demonstrations in Tripoli. He formed the Network of Free Ulema composed of Libyan scholars, which called for the immediate end to killings by the regime. When the regime ignored the call and continued killing protestors, the Network of Free Ulema sanctioned open rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeulema.org/|title=Free business profile for FREEULEMA.ORG provided by Network Solutions|website=Freeulema.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the National Transition Council (NTC), Free Libya's de facto government, was established in Benghazi on 27 February, Nayed was called upon to set up and supervise the Support Team to the NTC Executive Office. During the early days of the revolution, Nayed was instrumental in securing regional and international support and played a major role in convincing the United Arab Emirates to become the first country to recognize the new Libyan government.

Nayed subsequently was appointed to form and lead the Tripoli Task Force for the liberation of the capital, a role that was broadened by the NTC and Stabilization Team to secure the nation's critical infrastructure and ensure that civilians were safe and secured and had access to essential utilities and services. In this role, Nayed led efforts to unfreeze Libyan assets and gain international humanitarian assistance to meet the immediate food, water, and healthcare needs of Libyans most affected by conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbCgUlUvAU|title=لقاء الدكتور عارف النايض (نبيل الحاج ليبيا الأحرار) الجزء الخامس والأخير|date=4 March 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambassador==
[[File:LibyanPM.jpg|thumb|Ministerial visit to the UAE]] [[File:LibyaMinisterofCulture.jpg|thumb|left|Libyan Minister of Culture at the Abu Dhabi Book Fair]]
In August 2011 Nayed was the first diplomat appointed by the post-Qaddafi Libyan government, serving as Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. When elections were held in 2012, Nayed submitted his resignation, a condition he insisted on at his appointment. His resignation was rejected by the Libyan government. Since that time, Nayed has resigned five times, each resignation being rejected by successive Libyan governments. During his tenure as Ambassador, Nayed has never taken a salary nor exercised diplomatic privileges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPC6nNuIIUU|title=ليبيا الأحرار - نبيل الحاج في لقاء خاص مع د. عارف النايض سفير ليبيا لدى دولة الإمارات جزء ٢|date=1 March 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Nayed brought together a selection of major international universities and training establishments to set up the [[Libyan Institute for Advanced Studies]]. The Institute is focused in building capacity among Libya's young people in areas that would benefit the country's future.

==Theological==
As a Muslim theologian educated in [[Maliki]] jurisprudence and classical [[Sufi]] doctrine, Nayed studied [[Christian]] theology at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome and served as professor at the [[Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies]] in Rome, and the International Institute for Islamic Thought and Civilization in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkf5Hacz13g|title=لقاء الدكتور عارف النايض مع نبيل الحاج  ليبيا الأحرار (الجزء الثالث)|date=2 March 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nayed is one of the leading Muslim figures in the field of inter-faith relations, and has been involved in various inter-faith initiatives since 1987, including [[A Common Word Between Us and You]], of which he was one of the original signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acommonword.com/signatories/|title=Signatories - A Common Word Between Us and You|website=Acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nayed was part of the Muslim delegation at the seminal Common Word bilateral meetings between Muslims and Christians at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[Lambeth Palace]], [[Cambridge]], [[Yale]], and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]. In 2006 when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] made controversial comments on Islam in Regensburg, Germany, Nayed was one of the 138 Muslim scholars who drafted a letter inviting Catholic-Muslim dialogue. Nayed also took part in a conference of clerics who reinterpreted the 14th-century scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]]'s celebrated [[fatwa]] on [[jihad]], arguing radical Islamists who use it to justify killing are misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/world/africa/aref-nayed-man-of-god-and-technology-tries-to-steady-libya.html?_r=0|title=Aref Nayed, Man of God and Technology, Tries to Steady Libya|first=Anne|last=Barnard|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the outbreak of the Libyan Revolution, Nayed lectured on Islamic theology, logic, and spirituality at the restored Uthman Pasha Madrassa in Tripoli, and supervised graduate students at the Islamic Call College. In addition, Nayed has written extensively on Islamic theology.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Nayed is a Senior Advisor to the Cambridge Inter-Faith Programme, a Fellow of the [[Royal Aal Al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought]] in Jordan, and was appointed to the board of advisers at the [[Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Libyan Institute for Advanced Studies==
In 2012, Nayed founded the [[Libyan Institute for Advanced Studies]] (LIAS), the first private research, advisory, and education institute established after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lias.ly/en/main/About|title=About LIAS|website=Lias.ly}}&lt;/ref&gt; LIAS has offices in Tripoli, Bayda, and Tobruk as well as Dubai. LIAS is focused on building capacity among Libya's young people to help them contribute to their communities and country. LIAS has eight specialized faculties and an affiliated business incubator. It offers advisory services and courses ranging from professional education to degree programs for professional and personal development.

LIAS departments include Libyan Studies, Stabilization Studies, Strategic Studies, Youth and Gender, Government, Management, Media, and Sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lias.ly/en/main/departments|title=Academics|website=Lias.ly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countering violent extremism in Libya==
As an internationally respected theologian, Nayed has been one of the most outspoken critics of Islamist ideologues and extremists. Nayed was among the first public figures to identify Islamists as the main destabilizing force in post-revolution Libya and as the primary enablers of the [[ISIL]] and other extremist groups. Nayed has written and lectured extensively against extremist ideologies and cooperates with global initiatives to repudiate extremism and educate Muslims on Islam as a compassionate and tolerant religion. Nayed has supported the initiatives led by Sheikh [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah]].

In February 2015, Nayed visited Washington D.C. to warn American lawmakers against the threat of the [[ISIL]] in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Pecquet, [http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/libya-islamic-state-aumf-terror-base-aref-ali-nayed.html# "Islamic State covets Libya as global terror base, envoy warns"], ''Al-Monitor'', 2 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nayed is married to Nadia Hashani from [[Misrata]]; they have three children.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Barzillai Quaife''' (29 December 1798 &amp;ndash; 3 March 1873) was an [[England|English]]-born [[editing|editor]], [[Congregational church|Congregational]] and [[Presbyterian]] minister, bookseller and teacher active in both [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/quaife-barzillai-2567 Australian Dictionary of Biography - Quaife, Barzillai (1798–1873) by G. L. Lockley]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a fierce advocate for the rights of the [[Māori people|Māori]].

== Life ==

Born at [[Lenham]] in [[Kent]], Quaife was the son of a farmer, Thomas Quaife, and his wife, Amelia Austin.&lt;ref name=DNZB&gt;{{cite web

In 1835 Quaife submitted a "Plan to provide the New Settlement of South Australia with the means of Religious instruction on the Congregational principle" to the South Australian Colonization Commissioners; he was not, however, appointed under this plan, nor was he allowed to serve when he applied again in 1836.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  He did finally reach [[Adelaide]] in September 1839, with the assistance of [[George Fife Angas]]; here he established a Bible and tract depot and spent six months writing for [[Archibald Macdougall]]'s ''Southern Australian''.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; before being persuaded to establish his own paper in New Zealand&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;

Quaife and his family arrived at Kororareka (today [[Russell, New Zealand|Russell]]) on the ''Agenoria'' in May 1840.  On 15 June of that year the first issue of the ''New Zealand Advertiser and Bay of Islands Gazette'' was published.  It was the second newspaper to be printed in the colony, and contained government-issued material; nevertheless, Quaife exercised an editorial policy directly contrary to, and critical of, government policy.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;  He voiced strong support for the rights of the Māori, and was displeased by poorly-performing public servants; most of his focus was on indigenous rights - especially regarding land - and [[criminal justice]].  He has been called "New Zealand's first public anti-racist";&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt; among his harshest statements on the issue was one that "when…the Governor…lays it down as an axiom…that the natives have no independent right over their own property…we see no end - looking at the Cape as an example - of the catalogue of miseries which may be entailed on this inoffensive people".&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;  He further argued that the land act of August 1840, supported by governor [[George Gipps]] and allowing the governor of [[New South Wales]] to appoint commissioners to investigate land-related issues in New Zealand, was unenforceable and would lead to trouble.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;

It has been suggested that Quaife's personality, combined with a liberal education and experience with both a free colony and an unencumbered, openly critical press, meant that he was destined for problems with authority.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;  In the event he came into conflict with the chief police magistrate and acting colonial secretary, [[Willoughby Shortland]].  Shortland was fresh from New South Wales, where the press was controlled, and in December 1840, recalling an old ordinance from that colony, he ordered Quaife to post several hundred pounds' [[surety]] and pay a fine.  Should he do neither, he would face [[penal transportation]] for publishing "tending to bring the Government into hatred or contempt".&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;  Consequently, the last edition of the ''Advertiser'' appeared on 10 December.  Undeterred, Quaife returned to publishing in 1842, launching the ''Bay of Islands Observer''.  His platform was much the same as before.  Foolishly, however, he printed some gossip about [[George Cooper (treasurer)|George Cooper]], a former colonial treasurer.  He apologized publicly, but was still dismissed by the paper's owners.  From that time forward he devoted himself to the Kororareka Congregational Church, which he had founded as New Zealand's first Congregational church in 1840.  He also taught and ran a bookshop.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;

May 1844 found Quaife financially exhausted and intending to return to England.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;  He left for Sydney, intending to spend a short time there, and began preaching in [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]], where he stayed to form a Congregational church and build a [[chapel]].  He knew the Rev. Dr. [[Robert Ross (minister)|Robert Ross]] of the Pitt Street Congregational Church, but their relationship was never a very easy one, and all connections between them were severed when Quaife was offered a temporary appointment to replace [[John Dunmore Lang]] at the [[Scots Church, Sydney|Scots Church]] while the latter was away.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  He then continued as [[pastor]] at the Parramatta church until its closure in 1850; meanwhile, he kept up his service at the Scots Church until February 1847, when it received a Presbyterian minister.  Some of the congregation wished to retain Quaife's services, and chose to leave their church and found a new one under him.  This organization first met in the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] Chapel on Macquarie Street before moving to the old City Theatre in Market Street.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Quaife ministered to this group until 1850, in which year Dr. Lang reopened the [[Australian College]] and appointed him to the faculty as a professor of mental philosophy and [[divinity]].  He became a foundation member of two [[synod]]s, that of New South Wales in 1850 and of the reunited ones in 1865.  The college's work was restricted in 1852, at which point his teaching position lapsed.  He lived again in Parramatta between 1853 and 1855.  In the latter year Quaife went to [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] teaching school while ministering to a congregation at home.  1863 saw reconciliation with Congregational leaders, from whom he had become estranged, and he was invited to train three of their students for the ministry.  He closed his school and brought his congregation into the Ocean Street Congregational Church in [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]].  He tutored his three students until September 1864; in October they were transferred to the then-new [[Camden College (Congregational Church school)|Camden College]].  Quaife did not receive a teaching position at the school, which omission hurt him deeply.  Ill health at this point forced him to withdraw from professional work until his death.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Quaife died in Woollahra in 1873.&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt;

== Personal life ==

On 4 November 1834, Quaife married Maria Smith in [[Westminster]];&lt;ref name=DNZB/&gt; they would have four sons, two of whom were to survive infancy.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  Maria Quaife died in January 1857, and on 29 May of that year Quaife married Eliza Buttrey, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter.  Two of his sons, Frederick Harrison Quaife and William Francis Quaife, went on to become noted physicians in the Sydney area. A granddaughter, Viola Austral Quaife, married [[Sydney Ure Smith]] in 1909.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

== Selected publications ==

*''A condensed view of the proper design and uses of the Lord's Supper'' (1845)
*''The Rules of the Final Judgment'' (1846)
*''Lectures on Prophecy and the Kingdom of Christ'' (1848)
*''The Intellectual Sciences, vols 1-2'' (1872)

This last was composed of lectures from the Australian College, and has been claimed as the first serious work of philosophy to be published in Australia.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  Quaife also contributed articles to many publications, including the ''Atlas'', the ''People's Advocate'', the ''Press'', the ''Empire'', and the ''Illawarra Mercury''; he edited the ''Christian Standard'' in 1849 and both forms of the ''Christian Pleader'' between 1858 and 1864.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Biodynamic wine production uses [[organic farming]] methods (e.g. employing compost as [[fertilizer]] and avoiding most [[pesticides]]) while also employing soil supplements prepared according to [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s formulas, following a planting calendar that depends upon astronomical configurations,&lt;ref&gt;Per and Britt Karlsson, ''Biodynamic, Organic and Natural Winemaking'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and treating the earth as "a ''living and receptive'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Joly]], ''Wine from Sky to Earth'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodynamic viticulture==
[[File:Clairette de Die bio.jpg|thumb|Bottle of biodynamic [[Clairette de Die AOC|Clairette de Die]].]]
Biodynamic methods are used in [[viticulture]] (grape growing) in a variety of countries, including France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Australia, Chile, South Africa, Canada, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gregutt, "Not Woo-Woo Anymore: More and more wineries are tasting the benefits of saving the soil", ''The Seattle Times'', November 20, 2005.

Accessed 2008-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 over 700 vineyards worldwide comprising more than 10,000 ha/24,710 acres were certified biodynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Wine 4th Edition 2016 edited by Jancis Robinson MW.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of very high-end, high-profile commercial growers have converted recently to biodynamic practices. According to an article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', many of the top estates in France, "including Domaine Leroy in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Château de la Roche-aux-Moines]] in the [[Loire Valley|Loire]], [[Maison Chapoutier]] in the [[Rhône wine|Rhone Valley]], and [[Domaine Zind-Humbrecht]] in [[Alsace]]," follow biodynamic viticulture.&lt;ref name=Reilly1&gt;Jean K. Reilly, "Moonshine, Part 1: Why are top winemakers burying cow horns filled with manure on the equinox? Because it seems to help make great wine", ''Fortune'', August 9, 2004.

Accessed 2008-07-11.&lt;/ref&gt; For a wine to be labeled “biodynamic” it has to meet standards laid down by the Demeter Association,&lt;ref&gt;Demeter Calls, Biodynamic Wines: An Expression of Terroir? published by [http://www.novusvinum.com/features/biodynamicwines.html novusvinum.com]&lt;/ref&gt; an internationally recognized certifying body.

[[Biodynamic agriculture]] is based on the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925), who gave ''Agriculture Course'' in 1924, predating most of the organic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924|journal=European Journal of Social Sciences|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=64–70|url=http://orgprints.org/18809/1/Paull2011KoberwitzEJSS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes ecological principles, emphasizing [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] perspectives. Biodynamics aims at the ecological self-sufficiency of farms as cohesive, interconnected living systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/wine-party-461009 "Eco-Friendly Wines," ''The Daily Green'',October 1, 2009] [https://web.archive.org/web/20091004133548/http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/wine-party-461009 archived 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Some grape growers who have adopted biodynamic methods claim to have achieved improvements in the health of their [[vineyard]]s, specifically in the areas of [[biodiversity]], soil fertility, crop nutrition, and pest, weed, and disease management. For example, the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of [[Domaine Leflaive]] estate in [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] claimed that the use of biodynamic methods saved a badly diseased vineyard, to the point that it now produces some of her most highly prized wines.&lt;ref name=Reilly1/&gt; A long-term study of one [[California wine]]ry  found that improved quality for both biodynamic and organic could not be explained. This study in different vineyard blocks at a commercial vineyard in [[Ukiah, California]] found no difference between biodynamic methods with general organic farming methods with respect to soil quality, nor in the yield per vine, clusters per vine, and cluster and berry weight. However, one of the authors, Leo McCloskey has made the case that consumer quality scores, 100-point scores, are expected to be higher for both biodynamic and organic over traditional farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reeve, Jennifer R. |author2=Lynne Carpenter-Boggs |author3=John P. Reganold |author4=Alan L. York |author5=Glenn McGourty |author6=Leo P. McCloskey |date=1 December 2005|title=Soil and Winegrape Quality in Biodynamically and Organically Managed Vineyards |url=http://www.ajevonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/4/367 |journal=American Journal of Enology and Viticulture |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=367&amp;ndash;376 |publisher=American Society for Enology and Viticulture |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodynamic winemakers claim to have noted stronger, clearer, more vibrant tastes, as well as wines that remain drinkable [[aging wine|longer]]. Biodynamic wines are more "floral", according to Spanish biodynamic vintner Pérez Palacios.&lt;ref&gt;Beppi Crosariol, "Converted: I'm a biodynamic believer", ''Globe and Mail'', February 13, 2008.

In a [[blind tasting]] of 10 pairs of biodynamic and conventionally made wines, conducted by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and judged by seven wine experts including a [[Master of Wine]] and head [[sommelier]]s, nine of the biodynamic wines were judged superior to their conventional counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Jean K.

"'''Buddhism, the Fulfilment of Hinduism'''" is a lecture delivered by Indian Hindu monk and expounder [[Swami Vivekananda]] on 26 September 1893 at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions#1893 Parliament|Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago. In this lecture, he expressed his opinion that "Buddhism was the fulfilment of Hinduism."{{sfn|Amore|1979|p=74}}

== Background ==
{{Main|Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of the World's Religions (1893)}}
In 1893, Swami Vivekananda went to the United States and joined the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] as a delegate of Hinduism and India which ran from 11 to 27 September in that year in Chicago. This event also marked the first world conference of the representatives of Eastern and Western religions. After his introductory speech to the Parliament of religions on 11 September 1893, which was of a general nature stating no religion was superior or inferior to the other, his subsequent lectures were on 15th, 19, 20 and 26 September were on specific issues of religion.{{sfn|Ghosh|2003|page=81}}

== Lecture ==
{{Wikisource|The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 1/Addresses at The Parliament of Religions/Buddhism, the Fulfilment of Hinduism|"Buddhism, the Fulfilment of Hinduism"}}

This lecture was delivered on 26 September 1893.{{sfn|Vivekananda||page=28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagovedanta.org/1893.html|title=The 1893 World's Fair|publisher=Vivekananda Vedanta Society of Chicago|accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Vivekananda, also known as "neo-Vedanti",{{sfn|King|2013|p=97}} in his lecture at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|Parliament]], highlighted the fact that the Buddha is worshipped as one of the incarnations of God where as in China, Japan and [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) Buddhism is the religious practice. He particularly said that Buddhism was a rebel child of Hinduism. Buddha's teachings were a "Gift to the World" and could be traced to Christianity. {{sfn|King|2013|p=97}} He stated that the two religious practices — [[Hinduism]], a [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], and Buddhism of the [[Shakyamuni]], a [[Hindu]] who "expanded on the truths from the hidden Vedas" — are mutually inclusive. The teachings of Buddha were not new but were rooted in Vedic scriptures and he was the first monk who initiated the [[proselytisation]] of his ethos all over the world; the other religious preachers came much later. However, one distinction he pointed out in his lecture was a comparison with other religions of the world such as Christianity in which [[Jews]] who opposed [[Jesus Christ]] crucified him, while in India in contrast Buddha was worshipped as God. He was also critical of the way Buddhism was practised in the world now.{{sfn|Vivekananda||page=28}}{{sfn|King|2013|p=97}}

Swamiji elaborated on the reasons for the near total elimination of the Buddhist religion ([[Mahayana Buddhism]]) from India. He said that "At the present day there is not one who calls oneself a Buddhist in India, the land of its birth." This was because Buddha's philosophy clashed with the "eternal rocks of the Vedas" to which people, Brahmin's in particular, were wedded and did not want to accept change. Thus Buddhism could not survive in India. When Buddha was asked by his Brahmin disciples to translate his works, which were in the local language of the people, to Sanskrit, his reply was "I am for the poor, for the people; let me speak in the tongue of the people." Swamiji also mentioned in his speech the loss to India was the "reforming zeal, that wonderful sympathy and charity for everybody, that wonderful leaven which Buddhism had brought to the masses." {{sfn|Vivekananda||page=28}}{{sfn|King|2013|p=97}}

Swamiji also stated that Buddhism should not be confused with [[Vedanta]], in the same way as the [[Salvation Army]] is not to be confused with Christianity.{{sfn|King|2013|p=97}} Swamiji also opined that Buddhism was the "fulfillment of Hinduism" and thus Buddhists were wedded to the "brains and philosophy of the Brahmins" and similarly the Buddhists were the heart of the Hinduism.{{sfn|Amore|1979|p=74}}

== Significance ==
According to Rabindra Kumar Dasgupta, the author of ''Swami Vivekananda on Indian philosophy and literature'', it was his "historic address on Buddhism".&lt;ref name="Dasgupta 1996 p103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dasgupta|1996|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the lecture was published ''The Indian Mirror'' on 29 June 1895, which emphasised the concluding words of the lecture—&lt;ref name="Indian Mirror"&gt;{{cite news|title=A summary of Buddhism, the Fulfilment of Hinduism|url=http://cwsv.belurmath.org/volume_9/newspaper_reports/part_iii_indian_newspaper_reports/07_the_indian_mirror_jun_29_1895.htm|accessdate=13 September 2013|newspaper=The Indian Mirror|date=29 June 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot live without you, nor you without us. Then believe that separation has shown to us, that you cannot stand without the brain and the philosophy of the Brahman [sic], nor we without your heart. This separation between the Buddhist and the Brahman [Brahmin] is the cause of the downfall of India. That is why India has been the slave of conquerors for the past 1000 years. Let us then join the wonderful intellect of the Brahman [Brahmin] with the heart, the noble soul, the wonderful humanising power of the Great Master.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Srilankan Buddhist Dharmapala who equally spoke at this gathering, did not contest Vivekananda's conception of Buddhism as part of Hinduïsm, rather he stressed on Buddha's word as a universal Teaching&lt;ref&gt;https://parliamentofreligions.org/sites/default/files/Dharmapala_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence especially the Western world, raised in dialectics, did not question Vivekananda's speech which eventually led to the first lecture on Buddhism on BBC radio, spoken by an Indian gentleman who repeated Vivekananda's dream of Hinduïsm and Buddhism as one.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4748">:''To be distinguished from [[Diego López de Zúñiga (theologian)]] (d.1531)''
'''Diego de Zúñiga''' of Salamanca (sometimes [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinized]] as Didacus a Stunica) (1536–1597) was an [[Augustinian Hermit]] and academic. He is known for publishing an early acceptance of the [[Copernican theory]].

==Life==
A student of [[Luis de León]], he taught at the [[University of Osuna]] and the [[University of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Westman, ''The Copernicans and the Churches'', p. 92-3 in David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers (editors), ''God and Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''In Job commentaria'' (Commentary on Job, 1584) addressed Job 9:6, in such a way as to assert that the Copernican heliocentric theory was an acceptable interpretation of Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.student.utwente.nl/j.w.dijkshoorn/grotedenkers/faraday/appendix.html Online translation of passage]&lt;/ref&gt; This publication made him one of a very small number of Catholic scholars of the sixteenth century who set out an explicit accommodation with the ideas of Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;John Hedley Brooke, ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'' (1991), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, subsequently change his views, on another front, philosophical rather than theological. In ''Philosophia prima pars'', written at the end of his life, he rejected Copernicanism as incompatible with Aristotelian theory on [[natural philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gaukroger]], ''The Emergence of a Scientific Culture: Science and the Shaping of Modernity, 1210-1685'' (2006), p. 126,&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Philosophia prima pars'' was a large-scale work on metaphysics, structured in accordance with current university practice, and aimed at a reform in the university teaching of philosophy. Written from an Aristotelian point of view, it aimed to fortify the Peripatetic philosophy, fending off sceptics and arguing for it as scientific. Against the sceptical attack, truth was treated under metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990), p. 611 and p. 616.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Zúñiga was placed on the Church's [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]], together with Copernicus' ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De revolutionibus]]'', by a decree of the Sacred Congregation from March 5, 1616:

{{cquote|''(...) This Holy Congregation has also learned about the spreading and acceptance by many of the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture, that the earth moves and the sun is motionless, which is also taught by Nicholaus Copernicus's 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres' and by Diego de Zúñiga's 'On Job'. (...) Therefore, in order that this opinion may not creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Congregation has decided that the books by Nicolaus Copernicus ('On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres') and Diego de Zúñiga ('On Job') be suspended until corrected.''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?MODO=PAGINA&amp;VOLPAG=19-323 original Latin text] and an {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree |date=September 30, 2007 |title=English translation }}.

The '''efficacy of prayer''' is about the outcome of prayer requests. This topic has been discussed in many fields such as theology, philosophy, history, medicine, and psychology. Numerous religious traditions have complex understandings of the nature, function and expectations of prayer. For instance, within Jewish and Christian traditions there are diverse interpretations of prayers as requests for miraculous outcomes and also requests for relatively mundane outcomes. Some religious communities question whether the efficacy of prayer can be reliably measured or be meaningful since sacred texts such as the Bible have diverse situations and teachings such as stating that God shall not be coerced (Deuteronomy 6:16 - "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test"), some prayers for healing have been  purposely rejected by God before (2 Corinthians 12:7-9 - Apostle Paul's thorn in the flesh), or specific conditions would have to be met before prayers can be heard (having guidance by the Holy Spirit). In Christianity, there is an emphasis for the need for guidance from the [[Holy Spirit]] as to what needs to be prayed for and have taught that "God can not be coerced."&lt;ref name="Intercessory Prayer page 24-27"&gt;''Intercessory Prayer: Modern Theology, Biblical Teaching And Philosophical Thought'' by Philip Clements-Jewery 2005 {{ISBN|0-7546-3828-6}} page 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Tillotson pages 99-105"&gt;''The works of Dr. John Tillotson'', Volume 10 by John Tillotson, Thomas Birch 2009 {{ISBN|0-217-76300-6}} pages 99-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="God pages 58-61"&gt;''Talking to God: the theology of prayer'' by Wayne R. Spear 2002 {{ISBN|1-884527-13-2}} pages 58-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically, there is controversy on this topic which involving basic issues like statistical inference and [[falsifiability]] as to what it may mean to "prove" or "disprove" something, and the [[Demarcation problem|problem of demarcation]], i.e., as to whether this topic is even within the realm of science at all.

The efficacy of prayer has been the topic of various scientific studies since [[Francis Galton]] first addressed it in 1872. In recent decades, studies on prayer have become notable in medicine. According to the ''Washington Post'', "...prayer is the most common complement to mainstream medicine, far outpacing acupuncture, herbs, vitamins and other alternative remedies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/23/AR2006032302177.html Researchers Look at Prayer and Healing], ''Washington Post'', March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Recent medical studies on prayer have generally shown mixed results when it comes to healing from illnesses.&lt;ref name="Carey NYT" /&gt; The largest study, from the 2006 [[Studies on intercessory prayer#The STEP project|STEP project]], found no significant differences in patients recovering from heart surgery whether the patients were prayed for or not. The patients who knew they were receiving prayers did experience slightly higher recovery complications, possibly due to chance and the added anxiety or pressure caused from the expectations from the prayers. However, one of the authors of the study emphasized that this study did not say anything about the power of prayer itself.&lt;ref name="Carey NYT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=Long-Awaited Medical Study Questions the Power of Prayer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 November 2013|date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Fred Rosner]], an authority on [[Jewish medical ethics]], and others have expressed doubt that prayer could ever be subject to empirical analysis.&lt;ref name=Theo33&gt;''Realized religion: research on the relationship between religion and health'' Theodore J. Chamberlain, Christopher Alan Hall 2007 {{ISBN|1-890151-53-X}} pages 33-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carey NYT" /&gt;

Some studies on subjective well-being and personal effects of prayer have shown positive effects on the individual who prays.&lt;ref name="Jankowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambert2" /&gt;

In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html|title=Study of Health and Religiosity Growing Despite Criticism|first=Michelle|last=Boorstein|date=6 December 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of this, the number of courses on prayer and medicine have increased in medical curriculum.&lt;ref name="titleDr. Larry Dossey's Official Website" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-56023-113-0" /&gt;

==Studies on the efficacy of prayer==
A number of studies have been performed to scientifically measure the impact of prayer, often within a medical setting. The studies performed have used different structural methods and measured both hard data (such as blood pressure variations) and soft data such as anxiety levels and number of doctor visits. They have measured ''first-person effects'' (where the beneficiary performs the prayer), ''second-person effects'' (where someone with a personal connection to the beneficiary performs the prayer), and ''third-party effects'' where a group of unknown people pray for the beneficiary.

===What can be measured?===
Almost all second- and third-party studies have focused on ''[[intercessory prayers]]'' or ''[[Prayer#Direct petitions to God|direct petitions to God]]'', while first-person studies have measured ''meditative'' prayers as well. In general, the requested outcome for a ''prayer as petition'' may be either an event in the physical world, e.g. the recovery of a person from an ailment, or an event in the spiritual world, e.g., the repose of a [[soul]] via a [[prayer for the dead]]. There are, of course, also certain types of prayer whose efficacy can not (by definition) be measured in the physical world, e.g. [[RCTerm|Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins of others'', e.g., for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study parameters===
[[File:Meditation in Wat Khung Taphao.jpg|thumb|A man in meditation]]
In most cases, the parameters measured within the medical studies cited here have not been all-encompassing from scientific or religious viewpoints. Mental attributes such as reverence, which are emphasized by religious figures such as popes and saints, have not been measured. The studies have also not measured whether meditation prior to prayer affects the outcome.

The studies cited here have also generally not measured physical parameters, such as "proximity to the nearest place of common worship", e.g., does a prayer by a Christian within a church have more effect than outside a church? Does it vary by the size of church? Does the effect increase or decrease if the Christian prays inside a Buddhist temple? What about a Buddhist praying in a church? Do prayers during Christmas have more or less effect than at other times of the year? And the distance between the beneficiary and the location of the prayer has not been clarified in the studies, e.g., does prayer for a person who is a continent away have the same effect as prayers for a person who is inches away? Does the "skill level" of the person praying have an effect on the outcome as stipulated by Wisneski and Anderson in their book ''The Scientific Basis of Integrative Medicine''?&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Wisneski, 2004, ''The Scientific Basis of Integrative Medicine'', Taylor &amp; Francis Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8493-2081-1}} pp 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisneski and Anderson also hypothesize that different individuals have varying "prayer aptitude levels," just as different people have varying levels of athletic ability, and that the effect of prayer is the combined effects of ability and training. [[Pope John Paul II]] echoed that sentiment when he said: "We have to learn to pray: as it were learning this art ever anew..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20010106_novo-millennio-ineunte_en.html Vatican Message of Pope John Paul II on Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt; And he opposed "mechanical prayer" and emphasized the need for self-reflection before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II "''The Way to Christ''"  {{ISBN|978-0060642167}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The familiarity of the person praying with the words and method of praying, and their distraction level before they start to pray is not measured as a parameter in some{{Which|date=June 2012}} studies.

The ''reverence'' with which the prayer is recited has been emphasized by other religious writers, such as St. [[Louis de Montfort]] in his book ''[[Secret of the Rosary]]''. In section 41, he emphasized the "purity of intention" and stated that it is not the length of a prayer that matters, but the fervor, purity, and respect with which it is said, e.g., a single properly said [[Hail Mary]] is worth many that are badly said. Sections 42 and 43 of Montfort's book are devoted to "Attention" and "Fighting Distractions".&lt;ref&gt;Saint Louis de Montfort, The Secret of the Rosary, Tan Books &amp; Publisher, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-89555-056-9}} .{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes of studies==

===First person studies===
[[File:Bolivia aymara praying loc.jpg|thumb|A Bolivian [[Aymara people|aymara]] woman praying]]
An example of a study on ''meditative prayer'' was the Bernardi study in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bernardi L, Sleight P, Bandinelli G |title=Effect of rosary prayer and yoga mantras on autonomic cardiovascular rhythms: comparative study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7327 |pages=1446–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11751348 |pmc=61046 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1446|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that by praying the rosary or reciting yoga mantras at specific rates, [[baroreflex]] sensitivity increased significantly in cardiovascular patients.

A study published in 2008 used [[Eysenck]]'s dimensional model of [[Personality psychology|personality]] based on [[neuroticism]] and [[psychoticism]] to assess the mental health of high school students based on their self-reported frequency of prayer. For students both in Catholic and Protestant schools, higher levels of prayer were associated with better mental health as measured by lower psychoticism scores. However, among pupils attending Catholic schools, higher levels of prayer were also associated with higher neuroticism scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/13674670701709055 |title=Prayer and psychological health: A study among sixth-form pupils attending Catholic and Protestant schools in Northern Ireland |year=2008 |last1=Francis |first1=Leslie |last2=Robbins |first2=Mandy |last3=Lewis |first3=Christopher Alan |last4=Barnes |first4=L. Philip |journal=[[Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture]] |volume=11 |pages=85–92 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many accept that prayer can aid in recovery due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201075605/http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=%2FAtoz%2Fdc%2Fcen%2Fcanc%2Fgen%2Fmindspirit.html |date=2009-02-01 }} ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.  &lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[Yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[Meditation]] may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

A 2001 study by Meisenhelder and Chandler analyzed data obtained from 1,421 Presbyterian pastors surveyed by mail and found that their self-reported frequency of prayer was well-correlated with their self-perception of health and vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00059 |title=Frequency of Prayer and Functional Health in Presbyterian Pastors |year=2001 |last1=Meisenhelder |first1=Janice Bell |last2=Chandler |first2=Emily N. |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=40 |pages=323–330|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research methodology has inherent problems with [[self-selection]], [[selection bias]], and [[residual confounding]], and the authors admitted that the direction of perceived prayer and health relationships "remains inconclusive due to the limits of the correlational research design".

A 2008 study by Bhutkar, et al. considered only 78 subjects, but concluded that the regular practice of [[Surya Namaskar]] had a positive impact on cardio-respiratory health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Pratima M. |last1=Bhutkar |first2=Milind V. |last2=Bhutkar |first3=Govind B. |last3=Taware |first4=Vinayak

===Second person studies===
One condition that may affect the efficacy of intercessory prayer is whether the person praying has a connection to the person prayed for. A 2005 study published by ''The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' alleges evidence that eleven healers in a variety of "distant intentionality" (defined as "sending thoughts at a distance") modalities were able to remotely influence the [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]-measurable brain activity in chosen partners who were physically and electrically isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Achterberg J, Cooke K, Richards T, Standish LJ, Kozak L, Lake J |title=Evidence for correlations between distant intentionality and brain function in recipients: a functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=965–71 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16398587 |doi=10.1089/acm.2005.11.965}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the authors explained, "the study is not about healing per se, but whether there is some correlation in the intention to connect at a distance with a person." The experiment has not yet been reproduced by the authors or by others.

===Third party studies===
{{Main|Studies on intercessory prayer}}
[[File:Physical examination.jpg|thumb|A medical examination]]
The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scientist [[Francis Galton]] made the first [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of third-party prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galton|first1=Francis|title=Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer|url=http://glynsbox.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/does-prayer-work.html|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer was effective, members of the [[British Royal Family]] would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well-being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see if the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case.&lt;ref name="galton"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Galton |first= Francis |authorlink= Francis Galton |title= Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer |journal= Fortnightly Review |year= 1872 |issue= 68 |pages= 125–35}}  As found in {{cite book |title= The Prayer-Gauge Debate |year= 1876 |place= Boston |publisher= Congregational Publishing Society |lccn= 39018081 |oclc= 1809220 |url= https://archive.org/details/prayergaugedebat00tynd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins, 2006, "[[The God Delusion]]", Bantam Press: {{ISBN|0-618-68000-4}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of formal research performed on intercessory prayer is quite small, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research each year.&lt;ref name="WashPostOne"&gt;Boorstein, Michelle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery.

The third party studies reported either [[null result|null]] results, correlated results, or contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. For instance, a [[meta-analysis]] of several studies related to distant intercessory healing published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' in 2000 looked at 2774 patients in 23 studies, and found that 13 studies showed statistically significant positive results, 9 studies showed no effect, and 1 study showed a negative result.&lt;ref name="astin"&gt;John A. Astin, et al. ''The Efficacy of "Distant Healing" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials'' [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 [http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 [[levels of evidence]] review found evidence for the hypothesis that "Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Powell LH, Shahabi L, Thoresen CE |title=Religion and spirituality. Linkages to physical health |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=36–52 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12674817 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that although "a number of studies" have tested this hypothesis, "only three have sufficient rigor for review here" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, "the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively, raising concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes' assessors. Other [[meta-study|meta-studies]] of the broader literature have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the three most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=DRHodge &gt;David R.

Apart from whether prayer affects other beneficiaries, research has suggested that prayer has benefits on the person performing the prayer, e.g. in May 2011 a study was conducted that suggested a "significant specific indirect effect" between meditative prayer and hope, adult attachment, and forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Jankowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jankowski|first=Peter|author2=Sandage, Steven|title=Meditative Prayer, Hope, Adult Attachment, and Forgiveness: A Proposed Model|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|date=May 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1037/a0021601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also suggested that prayer has a direct relation to a sense of overall gratitude in life.&lt;ref name="Lambert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Nathaniel|author2=Fincham, Frank |author3=Braithwaite, Scott |author4=Graham, Steven |author5= Beach, Steven |title=Can Prayer Increase Gratitude|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|date=August 2009|volume=1|issue=3|pages=139–149|doi=10.1037/a0016731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer may also aid those dealing with alcoholism, e.g. a 2010 study suggested that there is a strong correlation between prayer and reduction of alcohol consumption. Those who actively pray during the week reported half as many consumed alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name="Lambert2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Nathaniel|author2=Fincham, Frank |author3=Marks, Loren |author4= Stillman, Tyler |title=Invocations and Intoxication: Does Prayer Decrease Alcohol Consumption|journal=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors|date=June 2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=209–219|doi=10.1037/a0018746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasingly more researched area within [[psychology of religion]] has been the relational implications of prayer, e.g. a study in 2011 conducted by Lambert et al. stated that when compared to a control group that experienced positive interactions with their significant other those in the prayer condition reported much higher feelings of unity and trust toward their significant other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Nathaniel|author2=Fincham, Frank |author3=LaVallee, Dana |author4= Brantley, Cicely |title=Praying Together and Staying Together: Couple Prayer and Trust|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have also shown that there are increased feelings of marital enrichment through prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beach|first=Steven|author2=Hurt, Tera |author3=Fincham, Frank |author4=Franklin, Kameron |author5=McNair, LIly |author6= Stanley, Scott |title=Enhancing Marital Enrichment Through Spirituality: Efficacy Data for Prayer Focused Relationship Enhancement|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|date=August 2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=201–216|doi=10.1037/a0022207}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 2010 has also shown a correlation between prayer within relationships and reduction of infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finchanm|first=Frank|author2=Lambert, Nathaniel |author3=Beach, Steven |title=Faith and Unfaithfulness: Can Praying for Your Partner Reduce Infidelity?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=October 2011|volume=99|issue=4|pages=649–659|doi=10.1037/a0019628|pmid=20718545}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other areas of research about prayer, some debate whether these effects are a result of the prayer or a "placebo effect." However, Dr. [[Herbert Benson]], a professor of medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]], suggests that they may not be mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|M_ACJB_HDxk|Dr. Herbert Benson on the mind/body relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief and skepticism==

===Medical views===

====Medical skepticism====
An article in the ''Medical Journal of Australia'' says that "One common criticism of prayer research is that prayer has become a popular therapeutic method for which there is no known plausible mechanism."&lt;ref name="titleeMJA: Prayer as medicine: how much have we learned?"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/186_10_210507/jan11101_fm.html |title=eMJA: Prayer as medicine: how much have we learned? |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical professionals are skeptical of new claims by studies until they have been experimentally reproduced and corroborated. For instance, a 2001 study by researchers associated with Columbia University has been associated with controversy, following claims of success in the popular media.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://csicop.org/si/2004-09/miracle-study.html Skeptical Inquirer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229051336/http://csicop.org/si/2004-09/miracle-study.html |date=2008-02-29 }}'', Sept/Oct 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=21868 Reproductive Medicine] Nov 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical hopes====
In the early 20th century, [[Florence Nightingale]], a pioneer of modern nursing, was a believer in the effects of prayer. She wrote, "Often when people seem unconscious, a word of prayer reaches them".&lt;ref&gt;''The collected works of Florence Nightingale'' http://www.sociology.uoguelph.ca/fnightingale&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, although different medical studies have been at odds with one another, physicians have not stopped studying or recommending prayer. This may be partly because prayer is increasingly used as a coping mechanism for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wacholtz|first=Amy|author2=Sambamoorthi, Usha|title=National Trends in Prayer Use as a Coping Mechanism for Health Concerns: Changes from 2002 to 2007|journal=Psychology of Religion and Spirituality|date=May 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=67–77|doi=10.1037/a0021598}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December  2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Larry Dossey]] M.D.: "In 1993, only three U.S. medical schools had courses devoted to exploring the role of religious practice and prayer in health; currently, nearly 80 medical schools have instituted such courses",&lt;ref name="titleDr. Larry Dossey's Official Website"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dosseydossey.com/larry/default.html |title=Dr. Larry Dossey's Official Website |accessdate=2007-12-21 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-56023-113-0"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=VandeCreek |first1=Larry |last2=Dossey |first2=Larry |authorlink2=Larry Dossey |title=Scientific and pastoral perspectives on intercessory prayer: an exchange between Larry Dossey, M.

====Different approaches to medicine====
Apart from traditional medicine, alternative approaches based on prayer have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Medical Physiology'' by R.L. Bijlani 2004 {{ISBN|81-8061-221-X}} page 916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alternate &gt;''Alternative Medicine'' by Dónal O'Mathúna 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-310-26999-1}} pages 236-239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mosby's complementary and alternative medicine'' by Lynda W. Freeman 2004 {{ISBN|0-323-02626-5}} page 544&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer is becoming increasingly used in approaches to healing.&lt;ref&gt;''Health, the individual, and integrated medicine'' by David Aldridge 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-84310-232-8}} pages 120-122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism on scope of prayer===
[[File:Prayer before leaving.jpg|thumb|A family at prayer]]
{{Synthesis|date=March 2012|reason=You can't use a source from hundreds of years prior as a rebuttal}}
In a debate/interview in [[Newsweek]] with Christian evangelical [[Rick Warren]], atheist [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] commented that most lay perceptions of the efficacy of prayer (personal impressions as opposed to empirical studies) were related to [[sampling error]] because "we know that humans have a terrible sense of probability." That is, humans are more inclined to recognize confirmations of their faith than they are to recognize disconfirmations.

Harris also criticized existing empirical studies for limiting themselves to prayers for relatively unmiraculous events, such as recovery from heart surgery. He suggested a simple experiment to settle the issue: &lt;blockquote&gt;Get a billion Christians to pray for a single amputee. Get them to pray that God regrow that missing limb. This happens to [[salamanders]] every day, presumably without prayer; this is within the capacity of God. I find it interesting that people of faith only tend to pray for conditions that are self-limiting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,825,The-God-Debate,Sam-Harris-Rick-Warren-Newsweek 'The God Debate' by Sam Harris, Rick Warren, Newsweek - RichardDawkins.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Christian teachings, the comment by Harris regarding what he called the self-limiting nature of prayer had been addressed years before by multiple authors. For instance, in the 19th century William Peabody discussed the efficacy of prayer in the face of what he called the ''immutability of the laws of nature''. He said:&lt;ref&gt;
William Bourn Oliver Peabody, ''Efficacy of prayer'', in "Sermons" B.H. Greene Press, Boston, 1849, pages 252-255&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Night follows day, and day night. The seasons preserve their succession... We may not hope to suspend their operation by our prayers... And yet notwithstanding all of this, we hold in an undoubting faith the doctrine of the efficacy of our prayers, or to use the language of another, "of an influence from above as diversified and unceasing as are the requests from below".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peabody then argued at length that prayers may have efficacy in a form that does not interfere with the arrangement of the laws of nature, and that God may respond in ways that are not anticipated, without changing the arrangement of nature. George Burnap echoed the same concept when he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;George Burnap, ''The efficacy of prayer'' in "Christianity, its essence and evidence" Crosby, Nichols and Co. Boston, 1855 page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
God governs the universe by fixed and uniform laws, not only for the sake of order, but for
human good... The fulfillment of ''every'' human desire would break up this order, and
bring everything into disorder and confusion.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prayers and miracles===
{{POV section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:Priere.jpg|thumb|A group of women praying]]
The view expressed by Harris above regarding the "relatively unmiraculous" petitions used in prayers has been addressed in religious circles{{Which|date=December 2017}} in the context of miraculous outcomes for prayer. There are different theological classifications of miracles, one of the most common{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} being the three categories: "''surpassing nature''" (Latin ''supra naturam''), "''against nature''" (Latin ''contra naturam'') and "''alongside nature''" (Latin ''praeter naturam'').&lt;ref&gt;Francois Leuret, 2006 ''Modern Miraculous Cures - A Documented Account Of Miracles And Medicine In The 20th Century'' {{ISBN|1-4067-9918-1}} pages 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The raising of the dead is considered a "supra naturam" event and is not reported
in theological writings beyond the Christian Bible,{{Contradict-inline|reason=See the whole article of [[Resurrection]]|article=Resurrection|date=December 2017}} where ten resurrection events are recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stronginfaith.org/article.php?page=114|title=People raised from the dead in the Bible (Resurrected)|first=|last=stronginfaith.org|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/illustration/accounts-people-raised-dead|title=Accounts of People Raised from the Dead|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better citation|date=December 2017}} ''Contra naturam'' events require significant changes to the "order of the world" (e.g. regrowth of limbs) and are also hardly ever reported. ''Praeter naturam'' events can proceed along the laws of nature. They have been reported in a number of cases, and have been subject to a large amount of debate. Examples include the claims of miraculous cures at pilgrimage site such as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Many of these claims have been analyzed and only a few have been accepted by the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]].

===Massive prayer===
The scientific measurement of the efficacy of massive prayer requires the coordination of the activities of a large number of people, and no direct citations for the existence of such studies appear in the scientific literature. However, non-scientific instructions for massive prayer have been issued in the past, and conclusions about the effects of the prayer have been drawn by a large number of believers, outside a scientific framework.

In a historical context, in 1571 [[Pope Pius V]] called for all of Europe to pray the [[Rosary]] for victory at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], in which the Christian belligerents included the [[Papal States]]. Trophies from the battle are now enshrined in various Christian churches which attribute the victory to the massive prayers.&lt;ref&gt;[[EWTN]] on [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] [http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/olislam.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Chesterton, 2004, ''Lepanto'', Ignatius Press {{ISBN|1586170309}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directions for even more massive, long term prayers were provided by the messages of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] reported by [[Lucia Santos]], who stated that the [[Virgin Mary]] specifically asked believers to pray for the conversion of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Santos, 1995, ''Fatima In Lucia's Own words'', The Ravengate Press, {{ISBN|0-911218-10-6}} p104&lt;/ref&gt; The 9-day Fatima [[Novena prayer]] includes a petition for the [[Consecration of Russia|conversion of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prayerbook.com/Novenas/fatinove.htm|title=Prayerbook, Nine Day Novenas, Our Lady of Fatima|first=Geo.

==Religious and philosophical issues==
[[File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 067.jpg|thumb|Praying to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Madonna]] of the [[Rosary]], by [[Caravaggio]], 1606-1607]]
{{See also|Relationship between religion and science}}
Religious and philosophical objections to the very study of prayer's efficacy exist. Many interpret ''[[Deuteronomy]]'' (6:16 "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%206:16;&amp;version=49;|title=Bible Gateway passage: Deuteronomy 6:16 - New American Standard Bible|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to mean that prayer cannot, or should not, be examined.

The religious viewpoint objects to the claim that prayer is susceptible to experimental designs or statistical analysis, and other assumptions in many experiments, e.g. that a thousand prayers are statistically different from one. The objections also include the complaint that religion generally deals with unique, uncontrollable events; statistics, and science in general, deal with recurring phenomena which are possible to sample or control and are susceptible to general laws.

Religious objections also include the complaint that as prayer starts to be measured, it is no longer real prayer once it gets involved in an experiment and that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The 2006 STEP experiment indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benson H, Dusek JA, Sherwood JB |title= Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: a multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer |journal= [[American Heart Journal]] |volume= 151 |issue= 4 |pages= 934–42 |date= April 2006 |pmid= 16569567 |doi= 10.1016/j.ahj.2005.05.028 |laysummary= http://www.templeton.org/pdfs/press_releases/060407STEP.pdf |laysource= [[John Templeton Foundation]] |laydate= April 5, 2006 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient's age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

With respect to expectation of a response to prayer, the 18th-century philosopher [[William Paley]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;William Paley, 1835, ''Paley's moral and political philosophy'' Uriah Hunt Press, Philadelphia page 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To pray for particular favors is to dictate to Divine Wisdom, and savors of presumption; and to intercede for other individuals or for nations, is to presume that their happiness depends upon our choice, and that the prosperity of communities hangs upon our interest.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 20th-century, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] believed that religion and science "have long been at war, claiming for themselves the same territory, ideas and allegiances". And Russell believed that the war had been decisively won
by science.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''Religion and science'' Oxford University Press, 1997
{{ISBN|0-19-511551-1}} page xi&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 40 years earlier, a 22-year-old Russell also wrote: "For although I had long ceased to believe in the efficacy of prayer, I was so lonely and so in need of some supporter such as the Christian God, that I took to saying prayers again when I ceased to believe in their efficacy."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell: Cambridge Essays'' Published by Routledge, 1983 {{ISBN|0-04-920067-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 21st-century evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], describing how [[Richard Swinburne]] explained away the STEP experiment's negative results "on the grounds that God answers prayers only if they are offered up for good reasons",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swinburne, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~orie0087/framesetpdfs.shtml Response to a Statistical Study of the Effect of Petitionary Prayer], originally in ''Science and Theology News'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; says that some{{Which|date=June 2012}} elements of religion are testable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Other theologians joined [[Non-overlapping magisteria|NOMA]]-inspired sceptics in contending that studying prayer in this way is a waste of money because supernatural influences are by definition beyond the reach of science. But as the Templeton Foundation correctly recognized when it financed the study, the alleged power of intercessory prayer is at least in principle within the reach of science. A double-blind experiment can be done and was done. It could have yielded a positive result. And if it had, can you imagine that a single religious apologist would have dismissed it on the grounds that scientific research has no bearing on religious matters? Of course not.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, "The God Delusion", p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Holy Spirit and Christian teaching===
Some Christian authors have contended for long that the efficacy of prayer involves the action of the [[Holy Spirit]], e.g. referring to the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:13|NIV}},

[[John Tillotson]], the 17th-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] argued that the efficacy of prayer depends on the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="John Tillotson pages 99-105"/&gt; [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian]] scholar Wayne R. Spear argues that the person praying needs to be "guided by the Holy Spirit" as to what needs to be prayed for and that given the "right petition" the Holy Spirit will then intercede for the prayer.&lt;ref name="God pages 58-61"/&gt;

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that:

:"Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and man in Christ. It is the action of God and of man, springing forth from both the Holy Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to the Father, in union with the human will of the Son of God made man." &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2564&lt;/ref&gt; "The Holy Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls to her all that Jesus said also instructs her in the life of prayer, inspiring new expressions of the prayer: blessing, petition, intercession, thanksgiving and praise."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2644&lt;/ref&gt; "Christian prayer is a communion of love with the Father, not only through Christ but also ''in him''". "The father gives us when our prayer is united with that of Jesus 'another Counselor, to be with [us] for ever', the Spirit of Truth." &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2615&lt;/ref&gt; "The [Holy] Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with sighs too deep for words." &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 741&lt;/ref&gt;

:"One enters into prayer by the narrow gate of faith. It is the face of the Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to hear and keep"&lt;ref&gt;from Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2656&lt;/ref&gt; "Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in ''faith''. Faith is a filial adherence to God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible because the Son gives us access to the Father. He can ask us to 'seek' and to 'knock', since he himself is the door and the way.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2609&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] philosopher and theologian [[Paul Tillich]] argued that prayer is not possible in a [[Subject–object problem|subject-object dichotomy]] in which the person is separated from God, for God cannot be the object of a prayer without being at the same time the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tillich]], ''Courage to Be''. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evald Vassilievich Ilyenkov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Э́вальд Васи́льевич Илье́нков}}; 18 February 1924 – 21 March 1979) was a [[Marxist]] author and [[Philosophy in the Soviet Union|Soviet philosopher]].

== Biography ==
Evald Ilyenkov did original work on the materialist development of [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectics]], notable for his account of concrete universals. His works include ''Dialectical Logic'' (Russian, 1974; English trans. 1977), ''Leninist Dialectics and the Metaphysics of Positivism'' (Russian, 1980 (posthum.); English trans. 1982) and ''The Dialectics of the Abstract and Concrete in Marx's Capital'' (Russian, 1960; English trans. 1982). Ilyenkov committed suicide in 1979.

David Bakhurst wrote in his article; "Meaning, Normativity and the Life of Mind":

{{quote|Ilyenkov was important in the revival of Russian Marxist philosophy after the dark days of Stalinism. In the early 1960s, he produced significant work in two main areas. First he wrote at length on Marx's dialectical method (‘the method of ascent from the abstract to concrete’). This work, though it now seems obscure, has an important political sub-text: its critique of empiricism is aimed at the positivism and scientism that Ilyenkov thought prevalent in Soviet political and intellectual culture.

Second, Ilyenkov developed a distinct solution to what he called ‘the problem of the ideal;’ that is, the problem of the place of the non-material in the natural world. The latter involves a resolute defence of the objectivity of ideal phenomena, which are said to exist as aspects of our spiritual culture, embodied in our environment. ... there are important continuities between Ilyenkov’s ideas and controversies in Soviet philosophy and psychology in the 1920s and ‘30s, particularly ... with [[Vygotsky]]’s socio-historical psychology... After the insightful writings of the early 1960s, his inspiration diminished as the political climate became more oppressive. ... He died in 1979, by his own hand.|David Bakhurst|''Language and Communication'', 17 (1), 33–51}}

An abridged version of his article, "Marx and the Western World," was published in English in a book of the same name in 1967, but this work is little known.

On the other hand, Ilyenkov's work (especially his masterpiece, the study on ''Dialectics of the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx's Capital'' from 1960, and the collection of essays entitled ''Dialectical Logic'' from 1974) deeply influenced the reception of Marx' economic writings from the 1960s onwards, in the Soviet Union and the GDR as well as in the West. His influence can be witnessed in the international research effort concerned with the publication of Marx' economic manuscripts (in Marx/Engels: ''Gesamtausgabe'', or MEGA, section II, 1976 ff.). His influence is also evident in the intense debates on economic reform that was going on in the Soviet Union in the 1970s (e.g., in the works of A. K. Pokrytan).

Ilyenkov's works have been published in about 20 languages. His ''Dialectical Logic'' (1974) was published in English by Progress Publishers in Moscow in 1977. A German translation of his ''Dialectics of the Abstract and the Concrete in Marx’s Capital'' (1960), was published by the same publisher in 1979 (and simultaneously by ''Das europäische Buch'', [[West Berlin]]); an English translation of the book was published by Progress Publishers in Moscow in 1982. ''Leninist Dialectics and the Metaphysics of Positivism'' (first published in Russian in 1980) was published by New Park Publications in 1982.

'''George Sotiros Pappas''' (born 1942) is a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.osu.edu/people/person.cfm?ID=1292 Departmental profile at OSU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914084237/http://philosophy.osu.edu/people/person.cfm?ID=1292 |date=2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pappas specializes in [[epistemology]], the history of [[early modern philosophy]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[metaphysics]]. He is of Greek and English origin.

He is the author of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [[Internalism and externalism|Internalist versus Externalist]] conceptions of [[Theory of justification|epistemic justification]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-intext/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was co-editor (with [[Marshall Swain]]) of ''Essays on Knowledge and Justification'' (1978), regarded as a key anthology of essays relating to the [[Gettier problem]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/gettier.htm#H15 Gettier Problem bibliography at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; and used as a core text in undergraduate [[epistemology]] courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/clay/morris1.html Suggested epistemology reading list]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies in Berkeley's philosophy ==
George S. Pappas is known to be a leading Berkeley scholar; his essay "Berkeley and Scepticism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pappas |first=G.S. |title=Berkeley and Scepticism |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=133–149 |year=1999 |doi= 10.2307/2653461|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in 1993 awarded the International Berkeley Prize.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.rochester.edu/college/PHL/Berkeleywinners.html Berkeley Prize Winners]. &lt;br&gt; The annual International Berkeley Essay Prize competition was established by [[Colin Murray Turbayne]] and his wife in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Pappas is a regular participant of International Berkeley Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgeberkeley.tamu.edu/conferences.html International Berkeley Conferences] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518110950/http://georgeberkeley.tamu.edu/conferences.html |date=2016-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one such conference, celebrating the 300th anniversary of George Berkeley's birth, Mr. Pappas propounded a new approach to the relationship between Berkeley's anti-abstractionism and "esse est percipi"&lt;ref&gt;To be is to be perceived. A core proposition of Berkeley's ontology.&lt;/ref&gt;  principle. On Pappas reading, Berkeley's two theses — that there are no abstract ideas and that sensible objects must be perceived in order to exist — entail one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Pappas |first=G.S. |chapter=Abstract ideas and the 'esse is percipi' thesis |editor-first=D. |editor-last=Berman |title=George Berkeley: Essays and replies |publisher=Irish Academic Press |location=Dublin |year=1985 |isbn=0-7165-2395-7 |pages=47–62 |conference=Proceedings of International Berkeley Conference in Dublin, 1985 |ref={{harvid|Essays and replies|1985}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text = Pappas' formulation of the relationship between these two propositions is ingenious and merits his verdict that it is a 'very exciting result' ... So far as I know, his thesis is original. Some writers, to be sure, have some close to suggesting that the first proposition is a necessary condition for the truth of the second, but I cannot think of a commentator who holds that it is both a necessary and sufficient condition.

Pappas' interpretation of Berkeley's '''esse'' is ''percipi''' thesis has sparked much discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Stroll |first=Avrum |title=Two lines of argumentation in Berkeley's Principles: a reply to George S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;That account is put forward to answer an extremely perplexing question in the history of philosophy: Why did Berkeley embrace idealism, i. e., why did he hold that esse est percipi, that to be is to be perceived? {{harv|Hausman|1984|pp=421–2}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After emerging in the early 1960s, the "inherence account" attracted numerous proponents and became an influential element of contemporary Berkeley scholarship. In his paper "Ideas, minds, and Berkeley"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pappas |first=G.S. |title=Ideas, minds, and Berkeley |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly|Am. Phil. Q.]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=181–194 |year=1980 |doi= |url=http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6145_Pappas_Ideas%2C_Minds%2C_and_Berkeley.djvu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306000509/http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6145_Pappas_Ideas,_Minds,_and_Berkeley.djvu |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pappas revealed some discrepancies between fountain-head evidences and Allaire's approach to a reconstruction of Berkeley's idealism. Pappas' critical examination of the "inherence account" is greatly appreciated by Berkeley scholars. Pappas' penetrating remarks compelled Edwin B. Allaire  to revise and improve his conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allaire |first=Edwin B. |chapter=Berkeley's Idealism Revisited |editor-first=Colin M. |editor-last=Turbayne |title=Berkeley: Critical and Interpretive Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RExF10reT9wC |year=1982 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-1066-2 |pages=197–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those who share Allaire's account of Berkeley's idealism acknowledge Pappas' article to be "an excellent review and critique of the IA [inherence account]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hausman|1984|p=422 (note 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 George Pappas published his monograph ''Berkeley's thought'' in which some parts were based on earlier papers of his. While writings by [[A. A. Luce]] or [[Geoffrey Warnock]] are long out dated, the book ''Berkeley's thought'' written by Dr Pappas is often included in lists of recommended literature on [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;As examples, take:

'''Gustavo Bueno Martínez''' (1 September 1924 – 7 August 2016) was a Spanish [[philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fgbueno.es/ing/gbm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustavo Bueno is the main proponent of the philosophical system known as [[philosophical materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filosofia.org/aut/gbm/index.htm |title=Gustavo Bueno: textos en formato digital |publisher=Filosofia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical materialism excludes any possibility of spiritual life without reference to organic life. Its ontology and theories of knowledge are not based on mechanic materialism or dualistic historical materialism, but on the reality of current sciences and on a rich interpretation of the main systems defended by the different traditions available in the History of Philosophy.
 
The founder of academic (scholar) philosophy, [[Plato]], defended in [[Sophist (dialogue)|''Sophist'']] the principle of [[Symploce|Symploké]]  that Bueno uses to support both determinism and pluralism: "nothing is isolated from everything else, but not everything is connected to everything else; otherwise, nothing could be known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://symploke.trujaman.org/index.php?title=Gustavo_Bueno |title=Gustavo Bueno - Enciclopedia Symploké |language=es |publisher=Symploke.trujaman.org |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Bueno opposes both monism and skepticism. Some of Bueno's works have been translated into English, German and Chinese.

In [[parasitology]] and [[epidemiology]], a '''host switch''' (or '''host shift''') is an evolutionary change of host specificity. All [[symbiotic]] species, such as [[parasites]], [[pathogens]] and [[mutualists]] exhibit a certain degree of host specificity. They occur in the body (or on the body surface) of a single host species or – more often – on a limited set of host species. In the latter case, the suitable host species tend to be taxonomically related, sharing similar morphology and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (2006) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8336.html Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites] ''Princeton University Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] used to occur in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and have switched to humans in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Orgin2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faria2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = The early spread and epidemic ignition of HIV-1 in human populations | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6205 | pages = 56–61 | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1126/science.1256739 | pmid=25278604 | pmc=4254776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Switch&amp;shift.png|thumb|A host area (green) withdrawing in the South and advancing forward in the North. Cylinders represent host populations with a stable or changing population size. Parasite populations are represented by red arrows. Host switch more often occurs targeting host populations of increasing size, such as the pioneer populations of an [[invasive species]] (above). Contrarily, host shift more often occurs to move away from shrinking host populations, such as [[Relict (biology)|relict]] populations left behind by a regressing host area (below).&lt;ref name=chapter2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE /&gt;]]

Recent studies proposed to discriminate between two different types of evolutionary changes in host specificity.&lt;ref name=chapter2015&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Rozsa|first1=L|last2=Tryjanowski|first2=P |last3=Vas|first3=Z|year=2015|chapter-url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/chapter4.pdf|chapter= Under the changing climate: how shifting geographic distributions and sexual selection shape parasite diversification|title=Parasite diversity and diversification: evolutionary ecology meets phylogenetics|editor=Morand S |editor2=Krasnov B |editor3=Littlewood T (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107037656|pages=58–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FB-EE&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forró B, Eszterbauer E | url=http://folia.paru.cas.cz/pdfs/fol/2016/01/19.pdf | title = Correlation between host specificity and genetic diversity for the muscle-dwelling fish parasite Myxobolus pseudodispar: examples of myxozoan host-shift? | journal = Folia Parasitologica | volume = 63 | pages = 019 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.14411/fp.2016.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this view, host switch is a sudden and accidental colonization of a new host species by a few parasite individuals that are capable to establish a new and viable population there. After the switch, the new population is more-or-less isolated from the parasite population on the donor host species. It does not affect the further fate of the conspecific parasites on the donor host, and it may finally lead to parasite speciation. It is more likely to target an increasing host population that harbours a relatively poor parasite/pathogen fauna, such as the pioneer populations of invasive species.

Contrarily, host-shift is a gradual change of the relative role of a particular host species as primary versus secondary host, in case of a multi-host parasite species. The former primary host slowly becomes a secondary host or even becomes totally abandoned, while the former secondary host becomes a new primary host species. This process is slower and more predictable, and it does not increase parasite diversity. Predictably, it more often occurs in shrinking host populations that harbours a relatively (considering the small host population size) rich parasite/pathogen fauna.

==Synopsis==

The report is believed to be the first comparative international analysis of the human rights of intersex people.&lt;ref name="oii-au" /&gt; It found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

Ghattas states:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

Ghattas found that:&lt;ref name="oii-au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/24360/human-rights-between-the-sexes-a-study/|title=Human rights between the sexes, a study|work=oii.org.au|publisher=[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/nano/medizin/173068/index.html|language=de|title=Nicht Mann, niche Frau. Intersexuelle müssen sich nicht mehr festlegen|work=3sat.de|publisher=[[3sat]]|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Genital "normalization" surgeries are widespread: "Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order. Therefore, genital surgery is performed from infancy to adolescence and adulthood in all examined countries."
*Gonadal tissue is removed in most countries, between childhood and adolescence. Hormone treatments are administered.
*There is minimal aftercare.
*Birth registrations, with a sex assignment, is required in most countries, within 4 weeks of birth.
*Intersex is treated as a taboo subject in all countries studied. Intersex people experience prejudice, often due to gender non-conforming behaviour and appearance.
*Human rights-based activism is only recently established, and the number of NGOs small and volunteer-based.

{{quotation|Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order.}}

Ghattas makes five conclusions for human rights organisations:
#Raise awareness of the existence of intersex individuals.
#Increase visibility of intersex individuals and life situations.
#Encourage intersex people to self-organise and voice needs.
#Promote collaboration with NGOs.
#Take account of the needs of intersex people in all areas of human rights work.

'''illumos''' is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[Unix]] [[operating system]]. It derives from [[OpenSolaris]], which in turn derives from [[SVR4]] UNIX and [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD). illumos comprises a [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], [[device driver]]s, system [[Library (computing)|libraries]], and [[utility software]] for [[system administrator|system administration]].  This core is now the base for many different open-sourced [[Illumos#Current distributions|OpenSolaris distributions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/Distributions|title=Distributions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar way in which the [[Linux kernel]] is used in different [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-illumos-is-and-is-not/ What Illumos is and is not | ZDNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The maintainers write ''illumos'' in lowercase since some [[computer font]]s do not clearly distinguish a lowercase ''L'' from an uppercase ''i'' (see [[homoglyph]]). The name is derived from the Latin ''illuminare'' meaning "[[Age of Enlightenment|to enlighten]]", and "OS" for "[[operating system]]".

== Overview ==
[[File:OpenIndiana-b147-pkg-mgr.png|thumb|The [[OpenIndiana]] operating system is based on illumos]]
illumos was announced via [[webinar]]&lt;ref name=webinarslides&gt;{{cite web |author=Garrett D'Amore |title=Illumos - Hope and Light Springs Anew - Presented by Garrett D'Amore |date=3 August 2010 |url=http://www.illumos.org/attachments/download/3/illumos.pdf |publisher=illumos.org |accessdate = 3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Thursday, 3 August 2010, as a community effort of some core Solaris engineers to create a truly open source Solaris by swapping closed source bits of [[OpenSolaris]] with open implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/76669.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926053916/http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/76669.html|title=Whither OpenSolaris? Illumos Takes Up the Mantle|archivedate=26 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original plan explicitly stated that illumos would not be a distribution or a fork. However, after Oracle announced discontinuing OpenSolaris, plans were made to fork the final version of the Solaris ON kernel allowing illumos to evolve into a kernel of its own.&lt;ref name="forking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gdamore.blogspot.com/2010/08/hand-may-be-forced.html |title=The Hand May Be Forced |author=Garrett D'Amore |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010}}, efforts focused on libc, the [[NFSv4|NFS]] lock manager, the crypto module and many device drivers to create a Solaris-like OS with no closed, proprietary code. {{As of|2012}}, development emphasis includes transitioning from the historical compiler, [[Oracle Solaris Studio|Studio]], to [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.openindiana.org/documentation/faq/#how-does-openindiana-differ-from-opensolaris "Oracle’s Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler."&lt;/ref&gt; The "userland" software is now built with GNU make&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland|title=OpenIndiana/oi-userland|author=|date=|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains many GNU utilities such as GNU tar.

illumos is lightly led by founder Garrett D'Amore and other community members/developers such as [[Bryan Cantrill]] and [[Adam Leventhal (programmer)|Adam Leventhal]], via a Developers' Council.&lt;ref name= "Illumos Dev Council"&gt;
{{cite web
 |author    =Deirdré Straughan

 |accessdate=13 August 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumos Foundation has been incorporated in the State of California as a [[501(c)6]] trade association, with founding board members Jason Hoffman (formerly at [[Joyent]]), Evan Powell ([[Nexenta]]), and Garrett D'Amore.  As of August 2012 the foundation was in the process of formalizing its by-laws and organizational development.

At OpenStorage Summit 2010, the new logo for illumos was revealed, with official type and branding to follow over.&lt;ref name="newlogo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gdamore.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-illumos-logo.html |title=New Illumos logo |author=Garrett D'Amore |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Its primary development project, illumos-gate, derives from OS/Net (aka ON), which is a [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] kernel with the bulk of the drivers, core libraries, and basic utilities, similar to what is delivered by a [[BSD]] "src" tree. It was originally dependent on [[OpenSolaris]] OS/Net, but a fork was made after [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] silently decided to close the development of Solaris and unofficially killed the OpenSolaris project.

== Features ==
* [[ZFS]], a combined file system and logical volume manager providing a high level of data integrity for very large storage capacities.
* [[Solaris Containers]], (or Zones) a low overhead implementation of [[operating-system-level virtualization]] technology for x86 and SPARC systems.
* [[DTrace]], a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time.
* [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine]], (or KVM) a virtualization infrastructure. KVM supports native virtualization on processors with hardware virtualization extensions.
* [[OpenSolaris Network Virtualization and Resource Control]], (or Crossbow) a set of features that provides an internal network virtualization and quality of service including: Virtual NIC (VNIC) pseudo-network interface technology, Exclusive IP zones, Bandwidth management, and flow control on a per interface and per VNIC basis.

The '''Invisible Pink Unicorn''' ('''IPU''') is the [[goddess]] of a [[parody religion]] used to [[Satire|satirize]] [[Theism|theistic]] beliefs, taking the form of a [[unicorn]] that is [[paradox]]ically both [[Invisibility|invisible]] and [[pink]].&lt;ref name=Angeles1992/&gt; She is a rhetorical illustration used by [[Atheism|atheists]] and other [[religious skepticism|religious skeptics]] as a contemporary version of [[Russell's teapot]], sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name=Maartens2006/&gt;

The IPU is used to argue that [[supernatural]] beliefs are arbitrary by, for example, replacing the word ''[[God]]'' in any theistic statement with ''Invisible Pink Unicorn''.&lt;ref name=Narciso2004/&gt; The mutually exclusive attributes of pinkness and invisibility, coupled with the inability to disprove the IPU's existence, satirize properties that some theists attribute to a theistic [[deity]].&lt;ref name=AbelSchaefer2010/&gt;

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Invisible pink unicorn.svg|thumb|The Invisible Pink Unicorn logo]] --&gt;
[[Russell's teapot]] is an [[analogy]] first coined by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making scientifically [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote that, if he claims that a [[teapot]] orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the ground that they cannot prove him wrong. Russell's teapot is still referred to in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]].

The IPU seems to have become notable primarily through online culture: in addition to [[alt.atheism]], where IPU still frequently{{Citation needed|reason=Still as of when? How frequently?|date=October 2018}} comes up in discussions, there are now a number of web sites dedicated to her. An early documented reference to the IPU was on July 7, 1990, on the [[Usenet]] discussion group alt.atheism.&lt;ref name=Gibson1990/&gt; Other sources concerning IPU state that she was "revealed to us" on alt.atheism.

The concept was further developed by a group of college students from 1994 to 1995 on the [[ISCABBS|ISCA]] [[Telnet]]-based [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]. The students created a [[manifesto]] that detailed a nonsensical (yet internally consistent) religion based on a multitude of invisible pink unicorns.&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt; It is from this document that the most famous quotation concerning IPUs originated:

{{quote|
Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of great spiritual power. We know this because they are capable of being invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them.|Serah Eley&lt;ref name=PolingPoolePoling2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huberman2006/&gt;
}}

== Concepts ==
[[File:Ipu.png|thumb|This image features a pink unicorn but it has an [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] that makes the unicorn transparent, thus approximating the appearance of the Invisible Pink Unicorn. Blank images have been humorously presented as depictions of the Invisible Pink Unicorn in order to highlight her invisibility.&lt;ref name=klog2005/&gt;]]

It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can [[Falsifiability|prove]] that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink). This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God—that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity's existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (e.g., [[color]]) is reflected in some [[East Asia]]n cultures, wherein an [[Red string of fate|invisible red string]] is said to connect people who have a shared or linked [[destiny]].

There are humorous mock debates amongst her "followers" concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible, or invisible to most, but visible to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]").&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt; Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions.&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt;

The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way: 
{{quote|In the beginning the Invisible Pink Unicorn created the heavens and the earth...and the Spirit of the Invisible Pink Unicorn was hovering over the waters. And the Invisible Pink Unicorn said, "Let there be light," and there was light. The Invisible Pink Unicorn saw that the light was good, and she separated the light from the darkness.|[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1 (modified)&lt;ref name=PolingPoolePoling2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huberman2006/&gt;}}

In 1996, a unicorn that no one can see was adapted as a teaching device at [[Camp Quest]], the first free-thought summer camp for children established in the [[United States]], by Dr. L. Wilson. As reported years later in the July 21, 2006 ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', "Campers must try to prove that imaginary unicorns—as a metaphor for God—don't exist."&lt;ref name=Clark2006/&gt;
[[Richard Dawkins]] alluded to unicorns in this connection in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', writing that "[[Russell's teapot]], of course, stands for an infinite number of things whose existence is conceivable and cannot be disproved. [...] A philosophical favorite is the invisible, intangible, inaudible unicorn."&lt;ref name=Dawkins2006/&gt;

In the essay ''The Dragon in my Garage'' from the book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle In the Dark]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] uses the example of an invisible dragon breathing heatless fire that someone claims lives in his garage. The supposed dragon cannot be seen, heard, or sensed in any way, nor does it leave footprints. There is no reason to believe this purported dragon exists.&lt;ref name=Sagan1997/&gt;

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[The Poor Kid]]", a strict agnostic couple tell their foster children that God ''might'' exist, but then again, it's equally possible that there might be a "giant reptilian bird in charge of everything". At the end of the episode, the bird actually does appear and eats [[Kenny (South Park)|Kenny]].

==Religious commentary==
The Church of the Invisible Pink Unicorn often faces criticism from monotheistic religions for comparing their sacred beings with a fantastic invented character as well as trying to masquerade it as a religion while lacking the scripture, principles, ideologies, and broader social community necessary to be considered a legitimate religion. Many followers have responded to these critiques by improvising new literature, rituals, and customs, frequently written as farcical narrative that parodies not only scripture and rites itself but also the perceived importance or relevance of such scripture and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinvisiblepinkunicorn.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124080122/http://www.theinvisiblepinkunicorn.com/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Pink Unicorn scripture and customs seek to evoke the mysticism of the unicorn and to simultaneously lampoon similar literature in [[Christianity|other faiths]] per the IPU's main tenet.

'''José Acacio de Barros''' (born 1967, Barra Mansa, RJ, Brazil) is a Brazilian-American physicist and philosopher with contributions to the foundations of [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum cosmology]], and [[quantum cognition]]. Dr. de Barros received his PhD in Physics from the [[Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas]] (CBPF) in 1991 under the supervision of [[Francisco Antonio Doria]] and [[Antonio Fernandes da Fonseca Teixeira]] (he was also informally under the supervision of [[Newton da Costa]]). Since 2007 he has been in the Liberal Studies faculty of [[San Francisco State University]]. Before going to San Francisco, he was an Associate Professor of Physics at the Federal University at Juiz de Fora, Brazil, and he was a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for the Study of Language and Information at [[Stanford University]], and has also held visiting positions at the [[Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas]]. Dr. de Barros has been a long-term collaborator of Philosopher [[Patrick Suppes]], with whom he published extensively on the foundations of quantum mechanics and joint probabilities. Among his most influential work is his joint research with [[Nelson Pinto-Neto]], in which [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics]] was applied to [[quantum cosmology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The causal interpretation of dust and radiation fluid non-singular quantum cosmologies | year = 1998 | first = J.

'''''Kali's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna''''' is a book on the Indian [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Ramakrishna]] by [[Hindu studies]] scholar [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]], published in 1995 by the University of Chicago press.&lt;ref name="jf"&gt;Jeffrey J. Kripal (1995), ''Kali's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna''.  First edition. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pkur" /&gt; It argues for a [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] strain in Ramakrishna's life, [[sadhana|rituals]], and teachings.

The book won the [[American Academy of Religion]]'s History of Religions Prize for the Best First Book of 1995.&lt;ref name="pkur" /&gt; It has been criticised by Ramakrishna's followers and several scholars, and became the object of an intense controversy among both Western and Indian audiences.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book was developed from Kripal's Ph.D. [[dissertation]] on [[Ramakrishna]] at the [[University of Chicago]], advised by [[Wendy Doniger]]. According to Kripal, he adopted a [[Freudian]] approach to uncover the connections between [[tantra|tantric]] and [[psychoanalytic]] [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] traditions.  In the preface, Kripal writes that he was fascinated and interested in the relation between "human sexuality and mystical experience".&lt;ref&gt;''Kali's Child'', Preface, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions that ''Kali's Child'' was influenced by [[Wendy Doniger]] whose, "voluminous work, both in its rhetoric style and its erotic content provided me with a scholarly context, a genre if you will, in which I could write and defend my own ideas."&lt;ref&gt;''Kali's Child'', Preface, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary thesis of ''Kali's Child'' is that a Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were generated by the lingering results of [[psychological trauma|childhood traumas]], and [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]] [[homosexuality|homoerotic]] and [[pedophilia]]c passions; and that "Ramakrishna’s mystical experiences...were in actual fact profoundly, provocatively, scandalously erotic."&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;{{rp|p.2}}  Kripal has argued&lt;ref name="jf98secret"/&gt; that the same view was expressed 12 years earlier by Malcolm McLean, in his English translation of the ''[[Kathamrita]]''.&lt;ref name=mclean&gt;
  Malcolm McLean (1983), ''A Translation of Sri-Sri-Ramakrsna-Kathamrta with Explanatory Notes and Critical Introduction''. Ph.D.dissertation, Otago University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kripal examines a series of remarks made by [[Ramakrishna]] to some of his intimate disciples regarding his mystical experiences and visions which, following Ramakrishna, he calls "secret talks" (''guhya katha'').&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heehs_28"/&gt; Kripal argues that Ramakrishna's attitudes and orientations were well known to some of his contemporaries (though not to Ramakrishna himself) and were hidden and suppressed, initially by his own disciples and later by members of the [[Ramakrishna Order]].&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt; He argues a systematic whitewashing of details and a general cover-up carried out by the biographers and translators of [[Ramakrishna]].&lt;ref name="atma"&gt;

==Reviews and reaction==

===Scholarly reviews, 1995–1997===

The book won the [[American Academy of Religion]]'s History of Religions Prize for the Best First Book of 1995.&lt;ref name="pkur"/&gt;  In the following years, the book was reviewed in several Western academic journals of religion and  South Asian culture. In 1999, the Bengali scholar Brian Hatcher wrote&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;Brian A. Hatcher (1999), ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/lt711m70323r2w60/ Kali's problem child: Another look at Jeffrey Kripal's study of Ramakrishna]''. International Journal of Hindu Studies, volume 3 issue 2, pages 165–182. World Heritage Press. {{doi|10.1007/s11407-999-0002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; that while several reviewers expressed some misgivings, their overall evaluation of ''Kali's Child'' was positive, and at times highly laudatory,&lt;ref&gt;

"This analysis will be controversial particularly among the followers of Ramakrishna, who have sought over the years to deny, or at least to downplay, the Tantric elements. But Kripal's treatment of it is very thorough, his case is very well documented, and I find his argument convincing."
&lt;/ref&gt; Hatcher cited a sample Bengali text from the Kathāmṛta in his own article, arguing that Kripal accurately translated the passage in a way that Swami Nikhilananda's translation did not.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;Brian A. Hatcher (1999), ''[http://www.springerlink.com/content/lt711m70323r2w60/ Kali's problem child: Another look at Jeffrey Kripal's study of Ramakrishna]''. International Journal of Hindu Studies, volume 3 issue 2, pages 165–182. World Heritage Press. {{doi|10.1007/s11407-999-0002-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in 1995 Cambridge scholar [[Jean Openshaw]] criticized Kripal's book for what she saw as "sleight of hand by which strained or confessedly speculative arguments are subsequently transformed into a firm base for further such arguments".  She also faulted the book for "slippage between an entirely appropriate scepticism towards the sources, and an unthinking acceptance of them when it suits the argument".&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"/&gt; In her opinion, Ramakrishna could not be regarded as a misogynist.&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"/&gt; She found Kripal's familiarity with a variety of Bengali texts "impressive", but noted several translation slips.  For example, Kripal wrote that the faith of an associate of Ramakrishna had "homoerotic dimensions" on the grounds that he "liked to look at pictures of men, for they aroused in him feelings of 'tenderness' and 'love'". Openshaw wrote that the word ''manus'' which Kripal had translated as "men" actually means "human being" without gender specificity. She also noted that Kripal had taken "body" (''ga-'' or ''an''+''ga'') and "lap" (''kol'') to mean "genitals" and "a normally defiled sexual space",&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"/&gt; whereas in Bengali culture the lap has a strong maternal association. In her view, Kripal had fallen "into a reductionist trap by sexualising his language in a way quite inappropriate to the material."  She wrote that Kripal's disclaimer "certainly many of my conclusions are speculative", but did not agree with his statement that "taken together their combined weight adds up to a convincing argument".&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rajat Kanta Ray]], a Bengali scholar in his 1997 review wrote that the historical evidence Kripal offers in favour of Ramakrishna’s homosexuality is "shaky" and some of Kripal's own evidence "seems to contradict it, and opens up the possibility of an alternative interpretation. A number of his translations from the primary text-Ramakrishna Kathamrita-are wrong; his psychoanalytical proceedings with the text, without the verifications psychoanalysts derive from patients under the ’free-association method’, fills me with doubt, especially as regards his identifications of some Tantrik symbols." Ray writes that "here and there" in the Kathamrita, he comes across "evidence which does not fit", and which ought to have made Kripal "rethink his formulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Rajat|title=Book Reviews : JEFFREY J. KRIPAL, Kali's Child:|journal=Indian Economic &amp; Social History Review|date=March 1997|volume=34|issue=1|pages=101–104|url=http://ier.sagepub.com/content/34/1/101.extract|doi=10.1177/001946469703400108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1997 review, Bhaskar Mukhopadhyay of [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] begins by describing Kali's Child's as an "invigorating read" and an "iconoclastic thesis ... supported by solid textual scholarship". Despite this initial impression, Mukhopadhyay found Kirpals's method of 'reading' Ramakrishna's life to be problematic. Mukhopadhyay criticizes Kripal’s method of "sexualisation" of Ramakrishna’s body and writes that Kripal does not take culture into consideration. Mukhopadhyay writes, "I demand that Ramakrishna’s visions be taken at their face value and not interpreted as some kind of a confused expression of his sexuality." Criticizing the "obvious glee in Kripal's tone which sometimes verges on flippancy", Mukhopadhyay continues, "Ramakrishna is a very serious matter and real theoretical sophistication is needed to deal with this enigmatic character. With his pop psychoanalysis, bop prose and a crude sense of humour, Kripal is nowhere near those serious scholars...". Towards the end, he writes that the book has "enough nuisance value to perturb
those who are at the helm of affairs at Ramakrishna Mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Bhaskar|title=Review : Kali's Child|journal=South Asia Research|date=April 1997|volume=17|issue=1|pages=102–104|doi=10.1177/026272809701700107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Gerald James Larson|Gerald Larson]] of Indiana University wrote that Kripal's book lacked balance and proper contextualization, and considered that it fell into the trap of monocausal [[reductionism]]. In his opinion, the book would have been much more balanced if Kripal had sought a review outside the context of his teachers and colleagues, including the Swamis of the Ramakrishna Mission (but not allow them to censor) and professionals within the psychoanalytic community.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Larson attributed the problem of reductionism to the attitude pervading the [[American Academy of Religion]] on the relation between modern secular intellectuals and believing communities. He wrote that psychoanalytic interpretations are "exceedingly problematic even with the extensive and current evidence of daily psychoanalytic therapy" and that psychoanalysts would be very cautious about asserting relationships between sexual fantasies and mystical or religious experience. On the whole, Larson argued that Kripal's thesis, of "Ramakrishna's homosexual tendencies" having determined the manner in which he created his self-defined states, was "thoroughly implausible" and that a psychoanalyst would be unlikely to say that Ramakrishna's "homoerotic energies" ''were'' his mysticism.  Larson wrote that the evidence presented in the book did not support "a cause-effect relation between the erotic and the mystical (or the religious), much less an identity".&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

In a 1997 review, [[Pravrajika Vrajaprana]] discussed Kripal reliance on unreliable sources, such as a report of "a particularly bizarre method Ramakrishna supposedly used to control lust", which Kripal at one point "doubt[ed] seriously" the incident ever occurred, but which he later used to confirm his conclusion.&lt;ref name="prav_vraj"&gt;
  [[Pravrajika Vrajaprana]] (1997), Review of ''Kali's Child'', by Jeffrey Kripal. Hindu-Christian studies bulletin, volume 10, pages 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Radice]] wrote in early 1998 that "[Ramakrishna's] homosexual leanings and his horror of women as lovers should not be the issue: there was plenty of evidence before the exposure of the ''guhya katha'' ["secret talk"].&lt;ref name="jf98pref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radice"/&gt; Radice compared the book to a ''majar kuti'' ("mansion of fun"), wrote that "occasionally one stops to ask if one has not been hoodwinked by the charm of [Kripal's] arguments", and wondered whether the book could be a game "no more playful than Ramakrishna's own earthy banter".&lt;ref name="radice"/&gt;

Reviewer [[Hugh B. Urban|Hugh Urban]] criticized Kripal for ignoring the social and historical context of late nineteenth-century Bengal.&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chatt"&gt;
  Partha Chatterjee on Ramakrishna and his relation to the middle-class society of colonial Calcutta. Cited by Urban (1998).
&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban also criticized Kripal for what he saw as a "tendency toward sensationalism and at times an almost journalistic delight in playing on the "sexy," "seedy," "scandalous," and shocking nature of his material".&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt;

===Sil's 1997 review===
Controversy over the book left the bounds of [[academia]] in January 1997, when ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'', Calcutta's leading English-language newspaper, published a full-page review of the book by historian [[Narasingha Sil]] (whom Kripal had thanked in the preface of ''Kali's Child'')&lt;ref name=sil97&gt;
  Narasingha Sil (31 January 1987) "The Question of Ramakrishna's Homosexuality," in ''The Statesman''
&lt;/ref&gt; that ended with the words "plain shit".&lt;ref name="jf98secret"&gt;
  Jeffrey J. Kripal (1998?), ''Secret Talk: Sexual Identity and the Politics of Scholarship in the Study of Hindu Tantrism''. [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/secret.html Online essay] at Kripal's Rice University website.  Accessed in 2010-01-13
&lt;/ref&gt; Sil himself had previously written a psychoanalytic study of Ramakrishna, which suggested that Ramakrishna's mystical experiences were pathological and originated from alleged childhood sexual trauma.&lt;ref name=silbook&gt;
  Narasingha Sil (1995), ''Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. A Psychological Profile''.
&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Hugh Urban]], Sil's ''Statesman'' review of ''Kali's Child'' presented Kripal as "a shoddy scholar with a perverse imagination who has thoughtlessly 'ransacked' another culture".&lt;ref&gt;
  Hugh Urban (1998), Review of Kripal's ''Kālī's Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna''. The Journal of Religion, volume 78 issue 2, pages 318–320. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1205982 Online version] at JStor.org accessed on 2008-03-18. {{doi|10.1086/490220}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Asian Age]]'' also published a negative review by its editor, Tapti Roy, in the same year.

In a 1997 letter to a Ramakrishna Mission official (published in 2001), Narasingha Sil added a negative view of Kripal's scholarship and proficiency in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref&gt;
  Narasingha P. Sil (February 25, 1997).  Letter to Swami Atmajnanananda. Published in the Harvard Divinity Bulletin, Spring 2001.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Sil argued that Kripal translated Bengali terms through Bengali-English dictionaries by picking the meanings that would be most appropriate to make his point, disregarding the primary, secondary, tertiary meanings.  He also argued that  Kripal was unable even to converse in Bengali.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;  In another 1997 article, Sil charged Kripal with "willful distortion and manipulation of sources", and with, while criticising [[Swami Nikhilananda]]'s translation of the ''Kathamrita'', having "committed similar crime[s] of omission and commission to suit his thesis."&lt;ref name="sil_review"&gt;
  Narasingha Sil (1997), ''Is Ramakrishna a Vedantin, a Tantrika or a Vaishnava? An examination''. Asian Studies Review, volume 21, issue 2–3, pages = 212–224
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sil's review in the ''Statesman'' provoked a flurry of angry letters to the editors.  The daily published 38 of them and then decided to close the issue,&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt; apparently an unprecedented decision in the newspaper's history.&lt;ref name="jf98pref"/&gt; Kripal wrote that Willian Radice twice tried to publish a defence of the book in the ''Statesman'', but the editors refused to do so.&lt;ref name="jf98pref"/&gt; Kripal soon found himself and the book embroiled in a long-running dispute. Censoring the book was even debated (unsuccessfully) in the [[Parliament of India]]. Kripal claimed, however, that less than 100 copies had been sold in India and only a few thousands in the US; and that few of its "opponents" had actually read the book.&lt;ref name=kriapo/&gt;

===Atmajnanananda's criticisms, 1997===
A critical review of Kripal's book was published in 1997 by Ramakrishna Mission's [[Swami Atmajnanananda]].  He argued that Kripal's book contained many translation and interpretation errors,&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt; such as translating ''māgi'' as "bitch" instead of "woman". Atmajnananda argued that Kripal had mis-interpreted many of the passages that he had cited, sometimes interpolating words in the translation that were not present in the original.  He wrote, for example, that Krishna's traditional depiction in Hindu iconography, the ''tribhanga'' pose, "bent in three places" (i.e., bent at the knee, waist and elbow, with flute in hand) which is sacred to [[Hindus]], had been translated by Kripal as ''cocked hips''.  He wrote that Kripal's thesis was "nothing more than smoke and mirrors, a house of cards which collapses at the merest touch".&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;

Atmajnananda also disputed Kripal's arguments of concealment of sources by the Ramakrishna Order.&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;

===Second edition, 1998===
Kripal published a second edition of ''Kali's Child'' in 1998.  In its preface he claimed to have corrected the translation errors pointed out by Atmajnananda.&lt;ref name=kaltex/&gt; Kripal called the corrections "a set of minor errors" which he "happily corrected", since they did not contradict his main thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Kripal, "The Sadhana of Controversy: Some Personal Responses to the Quest(ion)" [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kripal's response to Larson, 1998 and Larson's rejoinder===
In a 1998 response to Gerald Larson's review, Kripal denied the critic's claims that his final conclusions were monocausally reductive, saying that Larson had seriously misunderstood him, as in ''Kali's Child'' he had adopted a "nondual methodology" and expressed "consistent rejection of Freudian reductionism". Kripal argued that Larson lifted a few lines out of context to show that Kripal's concluding analysis was a "reductionistic reading". for Larson's suggestion that he should have "vetted" the text to the Ramakrishna Mission before publishing it, Kripal cited [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote in 1981 that "there were limits" to what he could say in ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples''&lt;ref name="ramdis"&gt;Christopher Isherwood (1965), ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples''. Simon and Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; once the book became a project of the Order.&lt;ref name="criguru"&gt;Christopher Isherwood (1981), ''My Guru and His Disciple''. Penguin Books.  Quoted by Kripal.&lt;/ref&gt; Kripal wrote about other similar incidents and argued to have avoided submitting is book to the Mission in order to protect his own intellectual freedom.&lt;ref name="replar"&gt;
  Jeffrey J. Kripal (1998), [http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/66/3/627.pdf ''Mystical Homoeroticism, Reductionism, and the Reality of Censorship: A Response to Gerald James Larson.''] Journal of the American Academy of Religion, volume 66, number 3, pages 627–635.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Kripal argued that if he had done so, he "indeed would not, ''could not'', have written [Kali's Child], but not because of some idealized balance" but because he "would have been too afraid".&lt;ref name=replar/&gt;

In a rejoinder Larson added that by "vetting", he did not mean any sort of "public" debate or confrontation. Larson maintained that reductionism would have been avoided if Kripal has selected one or two Swamis within the Ramakrishna order and one or two practising psychoanalysts for some "critical feedback" prior to the publication of the manuscript and  they would have alerted him to the "serious problems of lack of balance and reductionism that are readily apparent in his 'Conclusion: Analyzing the Secret.'"&lt;ref name="Larson-rejoinder" /&gt;  Larson also disagreed with Kripal that he had lifted a few lines out of context to indicate "reductionistic reading", wrote that he "invite[d] any reader to read the book's conclusion in order to determine whether the final analysis is reductionist or not", and argued that the conclusions were "doubly reductionist."&lt;ref name="Larson-rejoinder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=Gerald James |date=Autumn 1998|title=Polymorphic Sexuality, Homoeroticism, and the Study of Religion Revisited: A Rejoinder|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=66|issue=6|pages=637–639|jstor=1466138|doi=10.1093/jaarel/66.3.637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Swami Tyagananda]], minister of the [[Ramakrishna Mission|Ramakrishna-Vedanta Society]] in [[Boston]] and a Hindu chaplain at [[Harvard University]] produced a tract entitled ''“Kali’s Child Revisited or Didn’t Anyone Check the Documentation,”'' which was distributed at the 2000 annual meeting of AAR&lt;ref name="pkur"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurien|first=Prema A. |authorlink=Prema Kurien |title=A place at the multicultural table|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2007|pages=201–202|chapter=Challenging American Pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arvnds"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Arvind |date=Spring 2004|title=Hindus and Scholars|journal=Religion in the news|publisher=[[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]]|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/csrpl/RINVol7No1/Hindus%20and%20Scholars.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later published in journal ''Evam''.&lt;ref name="pkur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KCR"&gt;Swami Tyagananda and Pravrajika Vrajaprana (2002), ''Kali's Child Revisited or Didn't Anyone Check the Documentation?''.

&lt;/ref&gt; In the long, meticulously argued tract,&lt;ref name="pkur" /&gt; Tyagananda questioned Kripal's linguistic competence of the Bengali language on which the thesis was built and argued that Kripal had distorted the meaning of passages throughout  the ''[[Kathamrita]]''.&lt;ref name="hawley2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arvnds" /&gt; Tyagananda also argued about other alleged errors by Kripal.  For example, Kripal had called "boy" a devotee Kedar who, according to Tyaganada, was actually a fifty-year-old accountant; "boy of fifteen" a person of thirty-four or thirty-five years; and "boy disciples" a group of people in their forties. He asserted that Kripal's claims of child eroticism had been built on these mistranslations.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|note 62}}

In 2010, [[Swami Tyagananda]] and [[Pravrajika Vrajaprana]] wrote ''[[Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali's Child Revisited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this book, the authors argued with cross-references to the source texts that Kripal had a "piecemeal" knowledge of the Bengali language and lack of understanding of the Bengali culture, which led him to misinterpret the texts and fabricate a Ramakrishna conforming to his own "feels like" factor rather than a historical figure preserved well through honest documentation. They disputed positive reviews by Western academics writing that the "great majority of those who accepted the latter thesis were not in a position to assess the translation since most of the reviewers were not Bengali readers." They wrote that its "extremely unlikely" that any reviewer did a "close or extensive comparison" of the ''Kathamrita'' with that of Nikhilananda and Kripal's translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tyagananda | last2=Vrajaprana | chapter=History of debate | title=Interpreting Ramakrishna: Kali's Child Revisited | year=2010 | publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] | page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kripal's reply to Tyagananda, 2000–2002===
Responding to Swami Tyagananda's ''Kali's Child Revisited'', Kripal wrote:&lt;ref name=kaltex&gt;
  Jeffrey J. Kripal (&lt;!--WHAT YEAR?--&gt;), ''Textuality, Sexuality, and the Future of the Past: A Response to Swami Tyagananda''.  [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/textuality.html Online version] accessed on 2008-08-25.
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|"I read with a mixture of embarrassment, sadness, and hope Swami Tyagananda’s Kali’s Child Revisited. I will pretend no full response here. That can only come with a third edition of the book, for which there are no immediate plans. Until such an opportunity arises, however, I can say that I am eager to resolve these issues in a friendly and open-hearted spirit that can be as faithful as possible both to academic standards of free inquiry and intellectual honesty and to the felt needs of significant segments of the Hindu community, whose religious sensibilities I am all too painfully aware I have offended."}}

Kripal complained that Tyagananda's questioning of his personal motives for writing the book turned the critique into an ''[[ad hominem]]'' attack, and denied Tyagananda's charges of "willful distortion and manipulation of sources" and "purposefully deceitful use of citations."  He wrote to "deeply regret" the fact that his book has offended many Hindus, but claimed that this fact says nothing about the historical Ramakrishna, "just as the offended responses of innumerable pious Christians [to academic investigations of [[Jesus]]] tell us absolutely nothing about the historical Jesus".  He also denied having any negative attitude about homosexuality or Ramakrishna, and suggested that Tyagananda's reading of his book "as an ill-intentioned condemnation of Ramakrishna" was not shared by "numerous reviewers and readers (with Hindus among them)".  He argued that he had never called Ramakrishna "a homosexual" and "never argued something as simplistic as that Ramakrishna 'sexually abused children' or that he was a 'pederast'", and that "these are other people’s words" but not his.  He also charged Tyagananda with misquoting his words (such as claiming that Kripal had used "sodomy" when he in fact had not) and argued that he had omitting from his own citations of the ''Kathamrita'' parts that would support Kripal's thesis.&lt;ref name=kaltex/&gt;

As for the alleged translation errors, Kripal argued that he had corrected many of them in the second edition,&lt;ref name=kaltex/&gt; acknowledged that others still needed to be corrected (such as those about the ages of some persons) and that he would "be happy to make any appropriate corrections in any future printings".  He denied that any of those errors had been intentional, and argued that all of them could be easily corrected without altering the substance or conclusions of the book, as they amounted to a very small part of the material he had used to demonstrate his thesis. On the other hand, he argued that many of them were not "errors" but simply different interpretations, and that he still stood by them.  He counter-charged Tyagananda and other critics with "textual literalism" by sticking only with the primary meanings of words like ''uddipana'', ''tribhanga'', ''tana'', ''vyakulata'', ''rati'', and ''ramana'', not recognizing their alternate meanings; so that his was not "mistranslation" but rather "good translation". Additionally, Kripal argued (following modern [[literary theory]]) that all [[hermeneutics|interpretations]], his own included, are products of the interaction of the reader’s horizon of understanding with that of the author’s.&lt;ref name=kaltex/&gt;

Concerning the charge that he does not understand Tantra, he argued that Tyagananda’s version of Tantra is the "right-handed" ascetic path, as expounded by neo-[[Vedanta]], while the Tantra of Ramakrishna's milieu was the "left-handed" path, which integrates the sexual with the spiritual. In the second edition of ''Kali's Child'', Kripal argued that the "philosophical expositions" of Tantra are inauthentic that are "designed to rid Tantra of everything that smacked of superstition, magic, or scandal".&lt;ref name="jf98"/&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

===Further reviews===

In 2001, [[Huston Smith]] wrote in a letter to the editor of the ''Harvard Divinity School Bulletin'' that, "I doubt that any other book—not even those of early, polemical, poorly informed, and bigoted missionaries — has offended Hindu sensibilities so grossly. And understandably, despite Kripal's protestations to the contrary in ''Secret Talk: The Politics of Scholarship in Hindu Tantrism'', ''Kali's Child'' is colonialism updated."&lt;ref name="hsmith"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|.36}}

In 2002, religious scholar [[Peter Heehs]] wrote that there is no direct evidence of homosexuality in the ''Kathamrta'' or "anywhere else", and Kripal himself admits that his interpretations are often "speculative". Heehs wrote that the "sensationalism" of Kripal's approach "vitiates the overall value of his book", which does "make a number of interesting points".&lt;ref name="heehs_28"&gt;
  {{cite book|last=Heehs|first=Peter|title=Indian religions: a historical reader of spiritual expression and experience  |publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co|year=2002|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xYglQ5ossEkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=kripal | isbn=978-1-85065-496-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2001 review, Renuka Sharma of Melbourne University and a psychoanalyst disputed ''Kali's Child'' as being built upon "veneer of psychoanalysis and symbolic deconstruction....The imperialistic use of some outdated dogmas of psychoanalysis..." She writes that psychoanalysis employed by Kripal is "doubtful ... as a science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Renuka|journal=Sophia|year=2001|volume=40|issue=2|pages=77–82|doi=10.1007/BF02782387|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gp1740jmu0836788/|title=Book reviews|last2=Foster|first2=Patrick M.|last3=Sharma|first3=Renuka|last4=Belle|first4=Carl Vadivella|last5=Collins|first5=Elizabeth Fuller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[John Stratton Hawley|John Hawley]] revised his initial positive evaluation of ''Kali's Child'',&lt;ref name=hawley1998/&gt; and wrote in his study ''The Damage of Separation''&lt;ref name=hawley2004/&gt; that neither the [[gopi]]s’ torment nor Ramakrishna's must be allowed to devolve to a bodily level. He also argued that communities of people who respond to different sexual orientations should not indiscriminately impose their thoughts on religious communities.&lt;ref name=hawley2004/&gt;

Somnath Bhattacharyya argued that Ramakrishna cannot be regarded as a misogynist, since he spoke about "''indriya sukha'' (sense pleasures), ''deha sukha'' (bodily pleasures), ''vishaya sukha'' (object gratification), ''kama'' (lust), and ''bhoga'' (enjoyment) as impediments to spiritual growth" and not because of fear of women.&lt;ref name="som_bhat"/&gt; Bhattacharyya also argues that Ramakrishna's lifelong love and devotion for the Goddess Kali does not fit into the homoerotic thesis.&lt;ref name="som_bhat"/&gt;

In their 2007 book  [[Invading the Sacred]], [[Krishnan Ramaswamy]] and [[Antonio de Nicolas]], argued that the [[American Academy of Religion]] does not have a well-informed understanding of Hinduism. Ramaswamy and de Nicolas argue that translation errors continued into the second edition of ''Kali's Child''.&lt;ref name=rawnic&gt;
  Krishnan Ramaswamy and Antonio de Nicolas (2007), ''Invading the Sacred''. Rupa &amp; Co., Delhi, India&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.23}} They argued that instead of winning a prize, Kripal's book should have been reviewed as a possible violation of academic due process and ethical norms.&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|p.29}}

==Specific criticisms==

===Translation and interpretation===
The main faults that critics have argued in ''Kali's Child'' are:
* faulty translations due to a lack of understanding of [[Bengali language]] and culture&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|p.30}}
* willful distortion and manipulation of sources and suppressing the facts&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|p.35}}
* misunderstanding of tantra
* misuses of psychoanalysis  and [[hermeneutics]], and
* false accusations of source suppression by the Ramakrishna Mission.

The alleged translation errors include:

*''vyakulata'' or ''vyaakula'', which means "anxiety" from the context, was translated by Kripal as "erotic torment". J. S. Hawley wrote that the Ramakrishna ''vyakulata'' must not "be allowed to devolve to a bodily level that could be indiscriminately shared".&lt;ref name=hawley2004/&gt;
*''uddipana'', which means "enkindling" or "lighting up" was translated as "homoerotic excitement",&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|p.34}} and thus translating a sentence that meant "looking at pictures of ''sadhus''" into "getting erotically aroused by looking at picture of holy men".&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;
*''[[Vrindavana lila]]'', "the play in [[Vrindavan]]" was translated as "Krishna's sexual exploits with the milkmaids."&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;
*''hrt-padma'', which means "lotus of the heart", was translated as "vagina".&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.110}}
*''raman karo'' was translated as "have sex" instead of "unite", so what should have been "Unite with Satchidananda" became "Have sex with Saccidananda".&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.42}}
*''milan'', commonly used to mean "meeting", was translated as "sexual union".&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.100}}

Critics have argued that several instances where Kripal allegedly had misquotes or misinterpretations:

*Adding phrases such as "his near naked body" and "instead of lusting after woman", which did not exist in the original [[Bengali language|Bengali]] sources.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;
*Representing Ramakrishna's teachers [[Bhairavi Brahmini]], [[Totapuri]], and the temple manager Mathur babu as his ''sexual predators'', without evidence.&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;

[[Gayatri Spivak]] argued that Kripal has misinterpreted "Ramakrishna's life as a ''bhakta'', as tantric practice" and "unfortunately the book is so full of cultural and linguistic mis-translations that the general premise cannot be taken seriously."&lt;ref name="spivak"&gt;
  {{cite book|last=Spivak|first=Gayatri Chakravorty |title=Other Asias|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|date=December 28, 2007|page=343|isbn=978-1-4051-0207-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2000 extensive review,&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt; Swami Tyagananda argued that Kripal had misquoted Ramakrishna's disciple [[Christopher Isherwood]] as confirming the master's homosexuality, when Isherwood had said in fact said that he "couldn't honestly claim him [Ramakrishna] as a homosexual, even a sublimated one", even though he "would have liked to be able to do so."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Isherwood (1980), ''My Guru and His Disciple'', p. 249
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tyagananda, [[Sumit Sarkar|Sarkar]]'s statement that Tantric worship (''upasana'') is "looking upon a woman as mother" (''janani ramani'') was misquoted by Kripal to mean the opposite, that the mother is the lover.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.73}}

=== Tantra ===
Several critics — including Tyagananda, Sil, Urban, and Radice — argue that Kripal misrepresents Tantra to support the thesis.
In a 1997 article, Sil wrote that Kripal had tried "to fit the [[square peg in a round hole|square peg of a Tantrika Ramakrishna into the round hole of a homosexual Paramahamsa]]".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Urban argued that Kripal has a prejudiced view of [[Tantra]] as "something scandalous, seedy, sexy, and dangerous".&lt;ref name="urban"/&gt; Tyagananda argues that Kripal dismisses the "philosophical expositions" of Tantra as inauthentic, to support his thesis.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt; Tyagananda argued that the Kripal's view that Ramakrishna's world was a "Tantric world"&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;{{rp|p.27}} overlooks other religious practices undertook by Ramakrishna, such as ''[[Vaishnava]]'', ''[[Shakti]]'', ''[[Vedanta]]'', Islamism and the Christianity.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amiya Prosad Sen]] writes about Kripal's "confusion" over chronology. Sen writes that arguments made by Kripal that some of Ramakrishna's mystic visions are but subconscious revelations of his actual Tantric experiences with Bhairavi are chronologically not possible. For instance Ramakrishna's vision describing a probing human tongue exploring—what Kripal translates as—"vagina shaped lotuses" as alleged sexual encounter with Bahiravi. Sen writes that this vision (around 1855–1858) was before his first meeting of Bhairavi (1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Nature of the "secret talk"===
Kripal labeled some of Ramakrishna's words "secret talk" and believed them to be "too troubling or important to reveal to any but [Ramakrishna's] most intimate disciples"&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Several critics, including Tyagananda, Openshaw, Larson, and Radice object to Kripal use of the word ''secret'', which did not exist in the original source.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.55}} In a 1997 review, Colin Robinson noted that the texts "exposed" by Kripal had been readily available in Bengali since 1932, when the final volume of the ''Kathamrita'' was published; and that Kripal used the thirty-first edition of the Kathamrita (1987).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Openshaw argued that it was highly unlikely that any act considered "homosexual" would have been defended by the disciples (homosexuality was rigorously repressed in Indian society of the time), let alone immortalised in print by a devotee.&lt;ref name="mystic_rustic"/&gt;&lt;!--What is this quote supposed to imply?--&gt;

Larson wrote that "Even Freud, with all of his reductionist tendencies, would have been highly suspicious and critical" about [[Mahendranath Gupta]]'s so-called "secret" material, if for no other reasons than the temporal distance between his notes and the publication of the ''Kathamrita''.&lt;ref name="larson"/&gt;

Radice wrote of the discrepancy between the small amount of "secret talk" cited by Kripal (18 occurrences) and the amount of analysis he derived from them, and asked "Has Kripal made a mountain out of molehill?" He then quoted Kripal's claim that those passages, plus other non-"secret" passages that touch on similar themes, are the key to Ramakrishna's mysticism and a lens through which one can validly read the whole ''Kathamrta''.&lt;ref name="radice"/&gt;

In his extensive 2000 review, Tyagananda wrote that Ramakrishna's "secret" talks were neither troubling nor secret, having been said in the presence of a large number of visitors, with the doors open. According to Tyagananda, Kripal's "secret talks" is a mistranslation of ''guhya katha'', which in the context means the "esoteric" or "deeper meaning" of a scripture.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;{{rp|n.59,107}}&lt;ref&gt;
  [http://vedabase.net/g/guhyam Occurrences of the word ''guhya'' in Indian Scriptures], from vedabase.net.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalysis and hermeneutics===
Kripal's understanding and application of psychological theory has been criticized by several experts, such as psychoanalyst [[Alan Roland]], author of books and articles on applying psychoanalysis to eastern cultures,&lt;ref name="alan_roland"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerald Larson argued that neither Kripal nor his advisor Wendy Doniger were trained as [[psychologists]] and in [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Invading the Sacred', p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  These critics observe that neither Kripal nor [[Wendy Doniger]] are trained in psychoanalysis or psychology.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Roland argued that Freudian approaches are not applicable to Asian cultures. Other critics questioned the propriety of applying Freudian analysis to third parties via native informants or posthumously.&lt;ref name=rawnic/&gt;{{rp|p.39}}

===Claims about hiding of sources===
In the 1995 edition of the book,&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt; Kripal argued that the Ramakrishna Mission was hiding or "bowdlerizing" key biographical sources on Ramakrishna, in order to hide inconvenient secrets. These views were denied by the Mission, and some of them were retracted by Kripal shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=kriapo/&gt;

====The ''Kathamrita''====
According to Kripal, the unusual five-volume, non-chronological structure of Mahendranath Gupta's ''Kathamrita'' was designed to "conceal a secret", and Gupta "held back" the secret in the first volume, "hinted at" it in the second, "toyed with" it in the third, "revealed it" in the fourth and found that he had hardly any material left for the fifth.&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;{{rp|p.4}}

However, Tyagananda wrote that portions from Gupta's diaries (which are in the possession of his descendants) were published in various Bengali journals long before they appeared in book form as the ''Kathamrita''.&lt;ref&gt;The journals were ''Anusandhan'', ''Arati'', ''Alochana'', ''Utsah'', ''Udbodhan'', ''Rishi'', ''Janmabhumi'', ''Tattwamanjari'', ''Navyabharat'', ''Punya'', ''Pradip'', ''Pravasi'', ''Prayas'', ''Bamabodhini'', ''Sahitya'', ''Sahitya-samhita'', and ''Hindu Patrika''.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tyagananda, there was no textual evidence that Gupta was thinking of writing a book when he began writing his diaries. He pointed out that at least four generations of Bengalis had read the ''Kathamrita'', and he wrote that their perception of Ramakrishna was in most respects diametrically opposite to the picture presented in ''Kali's Child''.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;  Furthermore, Tyagananda wrote that [[Ramakrishna Mission]] had published a two-volume edition of the ''Kathamrita'' rearranged in chronological order, after the copyright which rested with Gupta's descendants expired.&lt;ref name="KCR" /&gt;

Disputing the idea that Mahendranath Gupta ran out of material, [[Amiya Prosad Sen]] writes that the fifth volume (published posthumously) had "no note of finality" and ended "abruptly". Amiya Sen writes that "M." was contemplating at least six to seven volumes and after which he hoped to rearrange the entire material chronologically, within a single volume.&lt;ref name="sen-47"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen further writes that maintaining a "strictly chronological order" have meant postponing publication, and alternatively Gupta "sacrificed" chronological order to accommodate the short notice period. Sen also writes that Gupta faced other practical problems like finding a willing publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna''====
In his book, Kripal also wrote that [[Swami Nikhilananda]]'s ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'',&lt;ref name=gospel&gt;Swami Nikhilananda (1942), ''The Gospel of Ramakrishna.'' Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai. [http://www.belurmath.org/gospel/ Online version] at belurmath.org.&lt;/ref&gt; which purports to be "a literal translation" of the ''Kathamrita'', contains in fact substantial alterations from Gupta's text. Besides combining the five parallel narratives into a single volume (which is often sold as a two-volume set),  Nikhilananda would also have deleted some passages ("only a few pages"&lt;ref&gt;Nikhilananda's ''Gospel'', vii.  Quoted by Swami Tyagananda in ''Kali's Child Revisited''.&lt;/ref&gt;) which supposedly were "of no particular interest to English-speaking readers".&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;{{rp|p.329–336}}

Examples of missing passages quoted by Kripal include a declaration of Ramakrishna to a disciple: "In that state [during a Tantric ritual with a female guru] I couldn't help but worship the little penises [''dhan''] of boys with flowers and sandal-paste".&lt;ref name=kritant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kathamrita'', volume 4 page 232. Translation by Kripal.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the description by Ramakrishna of one of his visions, which in the Bengali original, according to Kripal, read "This is very secret talk! I saw a boy of twenty-three exactly like me, going up the subtle channel, erotically playing [''ramana kara''] with the vagina-shaped [''yoni-rupa''] lotuses with his tongue!&lt;ref name=kritant/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kathamrita'', volume 4 page 238. Translation by Kripal.&lt;/ref&gt; but was translated by Nikhilananda as "[...] communing with lotuses with his tongue".

In his 1997 review, Swami Atmajnanananda wrote that "there are some other instances which, at first, seem to substantiate Kripal's cover-up theory" but he too believed that they were all motivated by respect the Western decorum. He argued that, had Nikhilananda been fearful of revealing hidden secrets, "he certainly would have eliminated far more of Ramakrishna's remarks than he did". Atmajnanananda also argued that Kripal's translation of the missing parts was more misleading than Nikhilananda's omissions.&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt; In 2000, Swami Tyagananda added that Nikhilananda had attempted to faithfully convey the ideas, which might have been misunderstood if he had opted for a literal translation; and that the ''Gospel'' was translated in the 1940s and one should consider the Western sense of decorum as it existed then.&lt;ref name="KCR"/&gt;  [[Somnath Bhattacharya]] wrote that anybody with knowledge of Bengali could check that an overwhelming majority of the passages marked ''guhya-katha'' had been translated by Nikhilananda faithfully to the letter as well as to the spirit of the original.&lt;ref name="som_bhat"/&gt;

====''Jivanvrittanta''====
Kripal also described the book ''[[Sri Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsadever Jivanvrittanta]]'' by [[Ramchandra Dutta]] as a scandalous biography of Ramakrishna that was suppressed by Ramakrishna's followers.

In response, [[Pravrajika Vrajaprana]] and Swami Atmajnanananda wrote that the book had been published in nine Bengali editions as of 1995.&lt;ref name="atma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prav_vraj"/&gt;  In 1998 Kripal wrote that he had "overplayed the degree" of his alleged suppression, noting that "to my wonder (and embarrassment), the Ramakrishna Order reprinted Datta's text the very same summer Kali's Child appeared, rendering my original claims of a conscious concealment untenable."&lt;ref name=kriapo&gt;Jeffery Kripal (January 1998), ''Correspondence, Corrections and Confirmations.''  [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/pale.html Online version] at Rice University, accessed on 2010-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kripal's responses==

===To Malhotra===
Kripal also wrote a long response&lt;ref name=kritant&gt;
  Jeffrey J. Kripal (), ''The Tantric Truth of the Matter: A Forthright Response to Rajiv Malhotra''. [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kalischi/tantrictruth.html Online essay] in Kripal's website at Rice University, accessed on 2010-01-13.
&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Rajiv Malhotra]]'s essay ''RISA LILA—I:Wendy's Child Syndrome'' which argued that the Freudian psychoanalytical approach had been discredited even among Western psychologists.&lt;ref name="pkur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arvnds"/&gt;  Kripal lamented the "angry tone and ''ad hominem'' nature" of the text, and charged Rajiv of spreading "a number of falsehoods" over the internet that involved his person and reputation, and of having got "just about everything wrong" about his ideas and translations, claiming that his criticisms were merely a repeat of Tyagananda's.&lt;ref name=kritant/&gt;

===Final remarks===
By late 2002, Kripal combined his primary replies on his website, and wrote:&lt;ref name=kaltex/&gt;
{{Quote| "But there comes a time when it is time to move on. After eight years of almost constant thinking, eight published essays, a second monograph, and literally thousands of paper and virtual letters, that time has arrived for me. Accordingly, I plan no future formal responses and have long since moved on to other intellectual projects and topics."}}

Kripal argued that gender and spirituality are intricately linked, and that the history of mysticism in all the world's religions is erotic. Kripal argued that the mysticism of [[Teresa of Ávila]], [[John of the Cross]] and other European [[Roman Catholic]]s were erotic and similar to Ramakrishna's ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;''Kali's Child'' (1995) p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  Kripal strongly denied that ''Kali's Child'' was intended as a slur either against Ramakrishna specifically or Hinduism in general. Kripal later published his second book, ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom'' which studied the alleged eroticism in  Western mysticism.&lt;ref name=kripal2002&gt;Jeffrey J. Kripal (2002), ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hrob Karla Sabiny.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Tomb of Karel Sabina on Olšany Cemetery in Prague]]
'''Karel Sabina''' (pen names include '''Arian Želinský''' and '''Leo Blass''') (29 December 1813 – 8 November 1877) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] writer and journalist.

== Life ==
Karel Sabina grew up in poverty as an extramarital child of a daughter of a sugar producing factory's director in the family of a bricklayer and a washerwoman. Sabina later claimed that he was an illegitimate son of a Polish noble. Studied philosophy and law, but did not graduate. In [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848]] Sabina became one of the leaders of the Czech radical democrats, the founder of a secret radical political circle "Repeal" (the name inspired by Irish revolutionaries),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t63.html 1844]&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the National Committee and the Czech congress. Sabina published many articles (several of which were [[Censorship|censored]]) to magazines during this period.

== Imprisonment ==
In 1849 he was arrested for taking part in the "May Coup" (a plan to make an uprising, inspired by [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], then present in Prague)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t66.html#18490300 1849]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1851 sentenced [[capital punishment|to death]] together with 24 other men; but these sentences were changed by the [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor]] to 18 years in the [[Olomouc]] prison; in 1857 he was released, following the Emperor's general [[amnesty]] of May 8. He came back to [[Prague]] and lived as a [[freelance]] writer.

== Allegations of Betrayal ==
In 1870 the newspaper ''Vaterland'' accused Sabina of being a police [[informant]]. Sabina successfully sued the newspaper for a libel.  In 1872, in an unofficial trial by a self-appointed jury of eight Czech intellectuals (including [[Jan Neruda]] and [[Vítězslav Hálek]]), Karel Sabina was found guilty of being an informant.  Sabina, unable to find [[exile]] abroad, was forced to live in hiding in Prague. For the rest of his life, Karel Sabina denied the accusations.&lt;ref name="Karel Sabina"&gt;[http://ireferaty.lidovky.cz/100/570/Sabina-Karel Karel Sabina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506121410/http://ireferaty.lidovky.cz/100/570/Sabina-Karel |date=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons of Sabina's alleged cooperation with the police are not quite clear; if it happened, it might have been a combination of disillusion with the failed revolution which resulted in his long imprisonment, constant police pressure afterwards and his extreme poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spisovatele.cz/karel-sabina Karel Sabina]&lt;/ref&gt; Being an outcast - his books were no longer sold, on posters (such as the one for the ''[[The Bartered Bride|Prodaná nevěsta]]'' - whose [[libretto]] was seen by some people as Sabina's refutation of the accusations until [[Miroslav Ivanov (writer)|Miroslav Ivanov]]'s investigation in 1971 published in Ivanov's book ''Labyrint'' proved them incorrect) his name was replaced by his initials, and he risked physical attacks whenever he appeared on the streets. However, he continued to write under pen names, some of which are unknown today, thus greatly complicating the historians' effort to make Sabina's [[bibliography]] of articles complete.

== Death ==
Sabina died in poverty and scorn in 1877, the general exhaustion being given as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="Karel Sabina"/&gt;

== Selected works ==
As a journalist, he wrote mainly for ''Květy'', ''Moravský Týdenník'', ''Humorist'', ''Lípa'', ''Pražské noviny'' and ''Wčela'' (he was an editor in the last two, replacing [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]] in both of them).

'''Klaus Döring''' (born 5 April 1938 in Hamburg) is a German [[classical philologist]] and [[History of philosophy|philosophical historian]].

== Life and work ==
Döring studied Classical philology, philosophy and [[musicology]] at the Universities of [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] from 1957 to 1964. In 1964 he took the first state examination in Greek and Latin. From 1966, he wrked at the University of Freiburg, initially in an assistant position. After he received his doctorate in 1970, he became an Academic Assistant. In 1976 he achieved his [[habilitation]] in classical philology at Freiburg. From 1978 to 1980 he completed a clerkship at the [[South Baden]] higher education authority. In 1980 he was appointed to the academic council of the University of Freiburg.

In 1981, Döring became Professor of Classical Philology (Greek) at the University of Bamberg. In 2003 he retired.

Döring's research focus was ancient [[Greek philology]] and its contemporary reception. He focussed on the various philosophical schools and movements ([[Sophism]], [[Socrates]], the [[Socratics (group)|Socratics]], [[Plato]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]]). Until 1999 he was editor of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Antike Naturwissenschaft und ihre Rezeption|de}} (AKAN) series with [[Bernard Herzhoff]] and [[Georg Wöhrle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19255">The '''language of thought hypothesis''' ('''LOTH'''),&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as '''thought ordered mental expression''' ('''TOME'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language as grist to the mill of cognition.|author=Tillas A.|journal=Cogn Process|date=2015-08-16|doi=10.1007/s10339-015-0656-2|pmid=25976728}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a view in [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[cognitive science]], forwarded by American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]. It describes the nature of thought as possessing "language-like" or compositional structure (sometimes known as ''mentalese''). On this view, simple concepts combine in systematic ways (akin to the rules of grammar in language) to build thoughts. In its most basic form, the theory states that thought, like language, has syntax.

Using empirical data drawn from linguistics and cognitive science to describe [[mental representation]] from a philosophical vantage-point, the hypothesis states that thinking takes place in a language of thought (LOT): [[cognition]] and cognitive processes are only 'remotely plausible' when expressed as a system of representations that is "tokened" by a linguistic or semantic structure and operated upon by means of a combinatorial syntax.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Linguistic tokens used in mental language describe elementary concepts which are operated upon by logical rules establishing causal connections to allow for complex thought. Syntax as well as semantics have a causal effect on the properties of this system of mental representations.

These mental representations are not present in the [[Human brain|brain]] in the same way as symbols are present on paper; rather, the LOT is supposed to exist at the cognitive level, the level of thoughts and concepts. The LOTH has wide-ranging significance for a number of domains in [[cognitive science]]. It relies on a version of functionalist materialism, which holds that mental representations are actualized and modified by the individual holding the propositional attitude, and it challenges [[eliminative materialism]] and [[connectionism]]. It implies a strongly [[rationalism|rationalist]] model of cognition in which many of the fundamentals of cognition are innate.&lt;ref name="murataydede" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Language of Thought|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XZwGLBYLbg4C|publisher = Harvard University Press|date = 1975-01-01|isbn = 9780674510302|language = en|first = Jerry A.|last = Fodor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentation ==
The hypothesis applies to thoughts that have propositional content, and is not meant to describe everything that goes on in the mind. It appeals to the representational theory of thought to explain what those tokens actually are and how they behave. There must be a mental representation that stands in some unique relationship with the subject of the representation and has specific content. Complex thoughts get their semantic content from the content of the basic thoughts and the relations that they hold to each other. Thoughts can only relate to each other in ways that do not violate the syntax of thought. The syntax by means of which these two sub-parts are combined can be expressed in [[first-order predicate calculus]].

The thought "John is tall" is clearly composed of two sub-parts, the concept of John and the concept of tallness, combined in a manner that may be expressed in first-order predicate calculus as a predicate 'T' ("is tall") that holds of the entity 'j' (John). A fully articulated proposal for what a LOT would have to take into account greater complexities such as [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantification]] and [[propositional attitudes]] (the various attitudes people can have towards statements; for example I might ''believe'' or ''see'' or merely ''suspect'' that John is tall).

===Precepts===
# There can be no higher cognitive processes without mental representation. The only plausible psychological models represent higher cognitive processes as representational and computational thought needs a representational system as an object upon which to compute. We must therefore attribute a representational system to organisms for cognition and thought to occur.
# There is causal relationship between our intentions and our actions. Because mental states are structured in a way that causes our intentions to manifest themselves by what we do, there is a connection between how we view the world and ourselves and what we do.

== Reception ==

The language of thought hypothesis has been both controversial and groundbreaking. Some philosophers reject the LOTH, arguing that our public language ''is'' our mental language—a person who speaks English ''thinks'' in English. But others contend that complex thought is present even in those who do not possess a public language (e.g. babies, [[aphasia|aphasics]], and even higher-order primates), and therefore some form of mentalese must be innate. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The notion that mental states are causally efficacious diverges from [[behaviorists]] like [[Gilbert Ryle]], who held that there is no break between the cause of mental state and effect of behavior. Rather, Ryle proposed that people act in some way because they are in a disposition to act in that way, that these causal mental states are representational. An objection to this point comes from [[John Searle]] in the form of [[biological naturalism]], a non-representational theory of mind that accepts the causal efficacy of mental states. Searle divides intentional states into low-level brain activity and high-level mental activity. The lower-level, nonrepresentational neurophysiological processes have causal power in intention and behavior rather than some higher-level mental representation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Tim Crane]], in his book ''The Mechanical Mind'',&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crane|first=Tim|title=The mechanical mind : a philosophical introduction to minds, machines and mental representation|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-29031-9|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415290319/|edition=2nd, repr.|authorlink=Tim Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that, while he agrees with Fodor, his reason is very different. A logical objection challenges LOTH’s explanation of how sentences in natural languages get their meaning. That is the view that “Snow is white” is TRUE if and only if ''P'' is TRUE in the LOT, where ''P'' means the same thing in LOT as “Snow is white” means in the natural language. Any symbol manipulation is in need of some way of deriving what those symbols mean.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; If the meaning of sentences is explained regarding sentences in the LOT, then the meaning of sentences in LOT must get their meaning from somewhere else. There seems to be an infinite regress of sentences getting their meaning. Sentences in natural languages get their meaning from their users (speakers, writers).&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Therefore, sentences in mentalese must get their meaning from the way in which they are used by thinkers and so on ''ad infinitum''. This regress is often called the [[homunculus]] regress.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] accepts that homunculi may be explained by other homunculi and denies that this would yield an infinite regress of homunculi. Each explanatory homunculus is “stupider” or more basic than the homunculus it explains, but this regress is not infinite but bottoms out at a basic level that is so simple that it does not need interpretation.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; John Searle points out that it still follows that the bottom-level homunculi are manipulating some sorts of symbols.

LOTH implies that the mind has some [[tacit knowledge]] of the logical [[rules of inference]] and the linguistic rules of [[syntax]] (sentence structure) and [[semantics]] (concept or word meaning).&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; If LOTH cannot show that the mind knows that it is following the particular set of rules in question, then the mind is not computational because it is not governed by computational rules.&lt;ref name="murataydede"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ |title=The Language of Thought Hypothesis |author=Murat Aydede |date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Also, the apparent incompleteness of this set of rules in explaining behavior is pointed out. Many conscious beings behave in ways that are contrary to the rules of logic. Yet this irrational behavior is not accounted for by any rules, showing that there is at least some behavior that does not act by this set of rules.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt;

Another objection within representational theory of mind has to do with the relationship between propositional attitudes and representation. Dennett points out that a chess program can have the attitude of “wanting to get its queen out early,” without having representation or rule that explicitly states this. A multiplication program on a computer computes in the computer language of 1’s and 0’s, yielding representations that do not correspond with any propositional attitude.&lt;ref name="murataydede"/&gt;

[[Susan Schneider (philosopher)|Susan Schneider]] has recently developed a version of LOT that departs from Fodor's approach in numerous ways. In her book, The Language of Thought: a New Philosophical Direction, Schneider argues that Fodor's pessimism about the success of cognitive science is misguided, and she outlines an approach to LOT that integrates LOT with neuroscience. She also stresses that LOT that is not wedded to the extreme view that all concepts are innate. She fashions a new theory of mental symbols, and a related two-tiered theory of concepts, in which a concept's nature is determined by its LOT symbol type and its meaning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=The Language of Thought: a New Direction|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Boston: Mass|url=https://www.amazon.com/Language-Thought-New-Philosophical-Direction-ebook/dp/B006QTGAC6/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399489463&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=susan+schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to connectionism==
Connectionism is an approach to [[artificial intelligence]] that often accepts a lot of the same theoretical framework that LOTH accepts, namely that mental states are computational and causally efficacious and very often that they are representational. However, connectionism stresses the possibility of thinking machines, most often realized as [[artificial neural networks]], an inter-connectional set of nodes, and describes mental states as able to create memory by modifying the strength of these connections over time. Some popular types of neural networks are interpretations of units, and learning algorithm. "Units" can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons. A learning algorithm is such that, over time, a change in connection weight is possible, allowing networks to modify their connections. Connectionist neural networks are able to change over time via their activation.  An activation is a numerical value that represents any aspect of a unit that a neural network has at any time. Activation spreading is the spreading or taking over of other  over time of the activation to all other units connected to the activated unit.

Since connectionist models can change over time, supporters of connectionism claim that it can solve the problems that LOTH brings to classical AI. These problems are those that show that machines with a LOT syntactical framework very often are much better at solving problems and storing data than human minds, yet much worse at things that the human mind is quite adept at such as recognizing facial expressions and objects in photographs and understanding nuanced gestures.&lt;ref name="mechanicalmind"/&gt; Fodor defends LOTH by arguing that a connectionist model is just some realization or implementation of the classical [[computational theory of mind]] and therein necessarily employs a symbol-manipulating LOT.

Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] use the notion of [[cognitive architecture]] in their defense. Cognitive architecture is the set of basic functions of an organism with representational input and output. They argue that it is a law of nature that cognitive capacities are productive, systematic and inferentially coherent—they have the ability to produce and understand sentences of a certain structure if they can understand one sentence of that structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/ |title=Connectionism |author=James Garson |date=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cognitive model must have a cognitive architecture that explains these laws and properties in some way that is compatible with the scientific method. Fodor and Pylyshyn say that cognitive architecture can only explain the property of systematicity by appealing to a system of representations and that connectionism either employs a cognitive architecture of representations or else does not. If it does, then connectionism uses LOT. If it does not then it is empirically false.&lt;ref name="murataydede"/&gt;

Connectionists have responded to Fodor and Pylyshyn by denying that connectionism uses LOT, by denying that cognition is essentially a function that uses representational input and output or denying that systematicity is a law of nature that rests on representation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Empirical testing ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Since LOTH came to be it has been empirically tested.  Not all experiments have confirmed the hypothesis;

*In 1971, Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler tested Pylyshyn's particular hypothesis that all symbols are understood by the mind in virtue of their fundamental mathematical descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|journal=Science|date=1971-02-19|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shepard and Metzler's experiment consisted of showing a group of subjects a 2-D line drawing of a 3-D object, and then that same object at some rotation. According to Shepard and Metzler, if Pylyshyn were correct, then the amount of time it took to identify the object as the same object would not depend on the degree of rotation of the object. Their finding that the time taken to recognize the object was proportional to its rotation contradicts this hypothesis.
*There may be a connection between prior knowledge of what relations hold between objects in the world and the time it takes subjects to recognize the same objects. For example, it is more likely that subjects will not recognize a hand that is rotated in such a way that it would be physically impossible for an actual hand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} It has since also been empirically tested and supported that the mind might better manipulate mathematical descriptions in topographical wholes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These findings have illuminated what the mind is not doing in terms of how it manipulates symbols.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*Certain deaf adults who neither have capability to learn a spoken language nor have access to a sign language, known as home signers, in fact communicate with both others like them and the outside world using gestures and self-created signing. Although they have no experience in language or how it works, they are able to conceptualize more than iconic words but move into the abstract, suggesting that they could understand that before creating a gesture to show it.&lt;ref&gt;Coppola, M., &amp; Brentari, D. (2014). From iconic handshapes to grammatical contrasts: longitudinal evidence from a child homesigner. Frontiers in Psychology, 5, 830. [http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00830]&lt;/ref&gt; Ildefonso, a homesigner who learned a main sign language at twenty-seven years of age, found that although his thinking became easier to communicate, he had lost his ability to communicate with other homesigners as well as recall how his thinking worked without language.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G. (2010, July 21). Life without language. Retrieved December 19, 2015, from [http://neuroanthropology.net/2010/07/21/life-without-language/]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other studies that have been done to discover what thought processes could be non-lingual include a study done in 1969 by Berlin and Kay which indicated that the color spectrum was perceived the same no matter how many words a language had for different colors, and a study done in 1981 and fixed 1983 which alluded, that counterfactuals are processed at the same rate, ease of conveying through words notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, P., &amp; Keil, F. (2001, September 1). Thinking Through Language. Retrieved December 19, 2015, from [http://www.yale.edu/minddevlab/papers/bloom.keil.thinking.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maurits (2011) describes an experiment to measure the [[word order]] of the language of thought by the relative time needed to recall the verb, agent, and patient of an event. It turned out that the agent was recalled most quickly and the verb least quickly, leading to a conclusion of a [[subject–object–verb]] language of thought (SOVLOT).&lt;ref name="Maurits"&gt;Luke Maurits.

'''Legal ethics''', principles of conduct that members of the legal profession are expected to observe in their practice. They are an outgrowth of the development of the legal profession itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/legal-ethics|title=Legal Ethics, Encyclopedia Britannica|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In the United States==
In the U.S., each state or territory has a code of [[professional conduct]] dictating rules of ethics. These may be adopted by the respective state legislatures and/or judicial systems. The [[American Bar Association]] has promulgated the [[Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] which, while formally only a recommendation by a private body, have been influential in many jurisdictions.  The Model Rules address many topics which are found in state ethics rules, including the ''client-lawyer relationship'', duties of a [[lawyer]] as ''advocate'' in adversary proceedings, dealings ''with persons other than clients'', ''[[law firms]] and associations'', ''public service'', ''advertising'', and ''maintaining the integrity of the profession''.  Respect of client confidences, candor toward the tribunal, truthfulness in statements to others, and professional independence are some of the defining features of legal ethics.

The [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination]] (MPRE) is used to measure examinees' knowledge and understanding of established standards related to the professional conduct of lawyers. The MPRE is a prerequisite or corequisite to the [[bar examination]] for admission as an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney at law]] in 48 of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]], as well as the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]]. Of the 56 jurisdictions within the United States, only [[Maryland]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Wisconsin]] do not use the MPRE; however, these jurisdictions still incorporate local ethics rules in their respective bar examinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre/|title=Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination|website=NCBE|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maynard Pirsig]], published one of the first course books on legal ethics, ''Cases and Materials on Legal Ethics'', 1949. [[Maynard Pirsig]] also published the definition of ''Legal Ethics,'' in ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 1974.

Some U.S. states, including [[New York (state)|New York]], require applicants seeking to become attorneys to have taken a course in [[professional responsibility]] during law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bar Exam Eligibility|url=http://www.nybarexam.org/Eligible/Eligibility.htm#B|publisher=New York Board of Law Examiners|accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==

===United States===
Every state in the United States has a regulatory body (usually called a state [[bar association]]) that polices lawyer conduct. When lawyers are licensed to practice in a state, those lawyers subject themselves to this authority.  Overall responsibility often lies with the highest court in a state (such as [[state supreme court]]).  The state bar associations, often in consultation with the court,  adopt a set of rules that set forth the applicable ethical duties.  As of 2013, 48 states have adopted a version of the American Bar Association's model rules. [[California]] is the only state that has not adopted either—instead [http://ethics.calbar.ca.gov/ these states have written their own rules from scratch]. There was once some debate over whether state ethical rules apply to federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice has held differing opinions through different administrations, with the [[Thornburgh Memo]] suggesting these rules do not apply, and the [[Reno Rules]] asserting that they do apply. Now,  28 U.S.C. § 530B provides that government attorneys are subject to the state ethics laws in the state in which they practice.

Lawyers who fail to comply with local rules of ethics may be subjected to discipline ranging from private (non-public) reprimand to [[disbarment]].

===India===
In India, under the Advocates Act of 1961, the Bar Council of India is responsible for creating rules for registering advocates, regulation of legal ethics, and for administering disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ADVOCATES ACT, 1961|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Advocates-Act1961.pdf|publisher=Bar Council of India|accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In New South Wales, reforms commencing from July 1, 2015 brought a uniform regulatory system to the legal profession regarding billing arrangements, discipline procedures and complaints handling processing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/subordleg+244+2015+cd+0+N&lt;/ref&gt; An inter jurisdictional Legal Services Council was established in order to regulate the legal profession and its delivery of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/sr/2015-243.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the creation of the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/lpulascr2015658/ Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/lpulascr2015658/|title=Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors' Conduct Rules 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Austlii|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/lpucr2015509/ Legal Profession Uniform Conduct Barristers' Rules 2015].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/lpucr2015509/|title=Legal Profession Uniform Conduct Barristers' Rules 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Austlii|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">'''Levi Hedge''' (April 19, 1766 – January 3, 1844) was an [[United States|American]] [[educator]].

==Biography==
Levi Hedge was born in [[Hardwick, Massachusetts]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1792. His independent stand against [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]] while still a student was instrumental in ridding Harvard of the injustice associated with its "hat law".&lt;ref&gt;See Thwing (1879).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a Teacher at Westford Academy in Westford, MA from 1792 - 1794 (3)

He was appointed a tutor at Harvard in 1795. In 1801, he married Mary Kneeland, with whom he had eight children, including [[Frederic Henry Hedge]], who became a clergyman, transcendentalist, scholar of German literature, and also a Harvard professor. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1805.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810, Hedge became professor of logic and metaphysics.  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlisth American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; He published ''Elements of Logick'' (Cambridge, 1816), which went through many editions, and was translated into German. In 1827 he moved to the Alford professorship of natural religion, moral philosophy, and civil polity. That year, also prepared an abridgment of [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]]'s ''Mental Philosophy'' (1827). An attack of paralysis compelled him to resign from Harvard in 1830. He died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1844.

'''Martial Gueroult'''&lt;ref&gt;The proper spelling is without an accent mark; however the spelling ''Guéroult'' has also been propagated.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|ɡeʁu|lang}}; 15 December 1891 –  13 August 1976) was a [[French philosopher]] of the early and mid- 20th Century. His primary areas of research were in [[17th-century philosophy|17th-]] and [[18th-century philosophy]] as well as the [[history of philosophy]].

== Biography ==
Gueroult was born on 15 December 1891 in the city of [[Le Havre]] in northwestern [[France]]. A [[veteran]] of both the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, he was awarded the [[Légion d’Honneur]] [Legion of Honour] and twice with the [[Croix de Guerre]] [Cross of War]. It was during his time as a [[prisoner of war]] in [[Germany]] that Gueroult began drafting his first philosophical work on [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], later to become ''L’Évolution et la structure de la doctrine de la science chez Fichte'' [''The Evolution and Structure of Fichte’s Doctrine of Science''].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Vuillemin, "Martial Gueroult † 13. 8. 1976," ''Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie'' [''Archive for the History of Philosophy''] 59 (1977): 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gueroult’s first academic appointment was to the [[University of Strasbourg]]. In the 1930s, Gueroult spent some time at the [[University of São Paulo]] in [[Brazil]] where he worked along with other French intellectuals such as [[Roger Bastide]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Pierre Monbeig]] and [[Ferdinand Braudel]] to develop the newly founded university’s [[social science]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Henrique Cardoso, ''Charting A New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation'', ed. Mauricio Font (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2001), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He would return to France to accept a position at the [[Sorbonne]] but in 1951, was named successor to [[Étienne Gilson]] at the [[Collège de France]]. Gueroult re-titled his position as "Histoire et technologie des systèmes philosophiques" ["History and Technology of Philosophical Systems"] and it is here he would remain until his retirement in 1962.

== Thought ==
Gueroult's work was characterized by a close attention to the History of Philosophy---which he considered as noble as philosophy itself—as well as a strong demand for systematicity. He also refused philosophical recourse to [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. A polemical debate opposed him to [[Ferdinand Alquié]] concerning [[Descartes]], as Gueroult was studying him "according to the order of reasons" (synchronically), while Alquié was more interested in his historical evolution, studying him diachronically. Gueroult was interested in the "conditions of possibility of a history of philosophy" in general. He died before completing his opus titled ''Dianoématique'', which was composed of two books, the first one being titled ''History of the history of philosophy'' and the second one ''Philosophy of the history of philosophy''. The second volume asked the question: how is a history of philosophy possible, given that philosophy aims as studying eternal truths, and that history is a school of [[skepticism]]?

== Significance ==
Gueroult's influence has primarily been confined to France where his works have come to be seen as classics in the history of philosophy. He was highly influential on the thought of 20th-century French thinkers such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jules Vuillemin]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Geneviève Rodis-Lewis]].

'''Michael Ruse''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}} (born 21 June 1940) is a British-born Canadian [[philosopher of science]] who specializes in the [[philosophy of biology]] and works on the [[relationship between science and religion]], the [[creation–evolution controversy]], and the [[demarcation problem]] within [[science]]. Ruse currently teaches at [[Florida State University]].

==Career==
Ruse was born in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], attending [[Bootham School]], York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association |title=Bootham School Register |place=York, England |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Bristol]] (1962), his master's degree at [[McMaster University]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]] (1964), and Ph.D. at the University of Bristol (1970).

Ruse taught at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada for 35 years. Since his retirement from Guelph, he has taught at [[Florida State University]] and is the Lucyle T. Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy (2000–present). In 1986, he was elected as a Fellow of both the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. He has received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Bergen]], Norway (1990), [[McMaster University]], Ontario, Canada (2003) and the [[University of New Brunswick]], Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada (2007). In September 2014 he was made an Honorary Doctor of Science by University College London.

Ruse was a key witness for the [[plaintiff]] in the 1981 test case (''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'') of the state law permitting the teaching of "[[creation science]]" in the [[Arkansas]] school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antievolution.org/projects/mclean/new_site/pf_trans/mva_tt_p_ruse.html| title=Testimony of Dr. Michael Ruse| publisher=AntiEvolution.org| year=1981| accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal judge ruled that the state law was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

His 1996 book on [[orthogenesis|the idea of progress in biology (orthogenesis)]], ''[[Monad to Man]]'', had a mixed reception from other philosophers of biology. 
[[Peter J. Bowler]] described it as an important and controversial book on the status of evolutionism.&lt;ref name=Amundson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amundson |first1=Ron |title=Reviewed Work: Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology by Michael Ruse |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=September 1998 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=515–521 |jstor=688089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ron Amundson called Ruse an analytic and empiricist philosopher, but found Ruse's handling of [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]] "less satisfactory" than of the [[adaptation]]ist, Darwinian traditions.&lt;ref name=Amundson/&gt; He called Ruse's writing style "bluff, unselfconscious, and opinionated" and finds Ruse sarcastic, "scarcely a neutral observer".&lt;ref name=Amundson/&gt; 
[[Michael Ghiselin]] criticised Ruse as a "politically correct" "academic bigot", disagreed with Ruse's narrative about phylogenetics, and accused him of "completely ignor[ing] recent work such as by [[Carl Woese]], "neglect[ing] data" that contradict his thesis. Ironically, in Ghiselin's view, Ruse's own epistemological ideal for science relied on the idea of Progress.&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |title=Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology. Michael Ruse |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=72 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=452–452 |doi=10.1086/419959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruse delivered some of the 2001 [[Gifford Lectures]] in Natural Theology at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His lectures on Evolutionary Naturalism, "A Darwinian Understanding of Epistemology" and "A Darwinian Understanding of Ethics," are collected in ''The Nature and Limits of Human Understanding'' (ed. Anthony Sanford, T &amp; T Clark, 2003). Ruse debates regularly with [[William A. Dembski]], a proponent of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stewart| first=R.B.| title=Intelligent Design: William A. Dembski &amp; Michael Ruse in Dialogue| publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| location=New York| year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse takes the position that it is possible to reconcile the Christian faith with evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Can a Darwinian be a Christian?| last=Ruse| first=Michael| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse founded the journal ''[[Biology and Philosophy]]'', of which he is now Emeritus Editor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Editorial Board| journal=Biology and Philosophy| url=https://www.springer.com/philosophy/epistemology+and+philosophy+of+science/journal/10539?detailsPage=editorialBoard| publisher=[[Springer Netherlands]]| ISSN=0169-3867}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has published numerous books and articles. He cites the influence of his late colleague [[Ernan McMullin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2012.01287.x | volume=47 | title=Science and Values: My debt to Ernan McMullin | journal=Zygon | pages=666–685 | last1=Ruse | first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neoplatonism}}
{{Platonism}}
'''Neoplatonism''' is a term{{refn|group=note|name="modern"}} used to designate a strand of [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[philosophy]] that emerged in the third century AD against the background of Hellenistic philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Remes"}} The term does not encapsulate a set of ideas as much as it encapsulates a chain of thinkers which began with [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonious Saccas]] and his student [[Plotinus]] (&lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; 204/5 – 270 AD) and which stretches to the sixth century AD. Even though Neoplatonism primarily circumscribes the thinkers who are now labeled Neoplatonists and not their ideas, there are some ideas that are common to Neoplatonic systems, for example, the [[Monism|monistic]] idea that all of reality can be derived from a single principle, "the One". 

After Plotinus there were three distinct periods in the history of Neoplatonism: the work of his student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]; that of [[Iamblichus]] and his school in Syria; and the period in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the Academies in [[Alexandria]] and [[Athens]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0201.xml oxfordbibliographies.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoplatonism had an enduring influence on the subsequent history of philosophy. In the [[Middle Ages]], Neoplatonic ideas were studied and discussed by Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thinkers. In the Islamic cultural sphere, Neoplatonic texts were available in Arabic translations, and notable thinkers such as [[al-Farabi]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (''Avicebron''), [[Avicenna]], and [[Moses Maimonides]] incorporated neoplatonic elements into their own thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-415-08064-4 | pages = 245–280 | editor1-last = Frank | editor1-first=Daniel H. Frank | editor2-last=Leaman | editor2-first=Oliver | last = Kreisel | first = Howard | title = History of Jewish Philosophy | chapter = Moses Maimonides | location = London and New York | series = Routledge history of world philosophies | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin translations of late ancient neoplatonic texts were first available in the Christian West in the ninth century, and became influential from the twelfth century onward. [[Thomas Aquinas]] had direct access to works by [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], and he knew about other Neoplatonists, such as [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], through secondhand sources.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/fass/Classics/Hankey/Aquinas%20Plato%20and%20Neo-Platonism%20for%20Oxford.pdf Wayne Hankey, "Aquinas, Plato, and Neo-Platonism"]&lt;/ref&gt; The mystic [[Meister Eckhart]] (c. 1260 – c. 1328) was also influenced by Neoplatonism, propagating a contemplative way of life which points to the Godhead beyond the nameable God. 

Neoplatonism also had a strong influence on the [[Perennial philosophy]] of the Italian Renaissance thinkers [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], and continues through nineteenth-century [[Universalism]] and modern-day [[spirituality]] and [[nondualism]].

== Origins of the term ==
''Neoplatonism'' is a modern term.{{refn|group=note|name="modern"|The term first appeared in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Neoplatonism etymonline.com, ''Neoplatonism''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "The term 'Neoplatonism' is an invention of early 19th century European scholarship and indicates the penchant of historians for dividing 'periods' in history. In this case, the term was intended to indicate that Plotinus initiated a new phase in the development of the Platonic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ ''Plotinus'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} The term ''neoplatonism'' has a double function as a historical category. On the one hand, it differentiates the philosophical doctrines of [[Plotinus]] and his successors from those of the historical [[Plato]]. On the other, the term makes an assumption about the novelty of Plotinus's interpretation of Plato. In the nearly six centuries from Plato's time to Plotinus', there had been an uninterrupted tradition of interpreting Plato which had begun with [[Aristotle]] and with the immediate successors of [[Plato's academy]] and continued on through a period of Platonism which is now referred to as [[Middle Platonism]]. The term ''neoplatonism'' implies that Plotinus' interpretation of Plato was so distinct from those of his predecessors that it should be thought to introduce a new period in the history of Platonism. Some contemporary scholars, however, have taken issue with this assumption and have doubted that ''neoplatonism'' constitutes a useful label. They claim that merely marginal differences separate Plotinus' teachings from those of his immediate predecessors.

Whether neoplatonism is a meaningful or useful historical category is itself a central question concerning the history of the interpretation of Plato. For much of the history of Platonism, it was commonly accepted that the doctrines of the neoplatonists were essentially the same as those of Plato. The Renaissance Platonist [[Marsilio Ficino]], for instance, thought that the neoplatonic interpretation of Plato was an authentic and accurate representation of Plato's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Michael J.B.|title=Ficino's Lecture on the Good?|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Summer 1977|volume=30|issue=2|page=162|doi=10.2307/2860654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is unclear precisely when scholars began to disassociate the philosophy of the historical Plato from the philosophy of his neoplatonic interpreters, they had clearly begun to do so at least as early as the first decade of the nineteenth century. Contemporary scholars often identify the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] as an early thinker who took Plato's philosophy to be separate from that of his neoplatonic interpreters. However, others have argued that the differentiation of Plato from neoplatonism was the result of a protracted historical development that preceded Schleiermacher's scholarly work on Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Tigerstedt, E.&amp;nbsp;N. The Decline and Fall of the Neoplatonic Interpretation of Plato. 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and history of classical neoplatonism==
{{See also|Plato's unwritten doctrines}}

Neoplatonism started with [[Plotinus]] in the third century.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/ ''IEP'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Remes"|Pauline Remes: "'Neoplatonism' refers to a school of thought that began in approximately 245 CE, when a man called Plotinus moved [to] the capital of the Roman Empire [and] began teaching his interpretation of Plato's philosophy. Out of the association of people in Rome [...] emerged a school of philosophy that displays enough originality to be considered a new phase of Platonism".&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Remes (2008), ''Neoplatonism''. Acumen publishing, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Three distinct phases in classical neoplatonism after Plotinus can be distinguished: the work of his student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]; that of [[Iamblichus]] and his school in Syria; and the period in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the Academies in [[Alexandria]] and [[Athens]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0201.xml oxfordbibliographies.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenism===
Neoplatonism synthesized ideas from various philosophical and religious cultural spheres. The most important forerunners from Greek philosophy were the [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], such as [[Plutarch]], and the [[neopythagorean]]s, especially [[Numenius of Apamea]]. [[Philo]], a Hellenized Jew, translated [[Judaism]] into terms of [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Platonism|Platonic]] and neopythagorean elements, and held that God is "supra rational" and can be reached only through "ecstasy". Philo also held that the [[oracles]] of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge. The earliest [[Christian]] philosophers, such as [[Justin Martyr|Justin]] and [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], who attempted to connect Christianity with [[Platonism]], and the Christian [[Gnostics]] of [[Alexandria]], especially [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] and the followers of [[Basilides]], also mirrored elements of neoplatonism,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; albeit without its rigorous self-consistency.

=== Saccas ===
[[Ammonius Saccas]] (died {{circa|AD 265}}; Greek: Ἀμμώνιος Σακκᾶς) was a teacher of Plotinus. Through Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus may have been influenced by Indian thought. The similarities between neoplatonism and the Vedanta philosophies of [[Hinduism]] have led several authors to suggest an Indian influence in its founding, particularly on [[Ammonius Saccas]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bussanich. The roots of Platonism and Vedanta. International Journal of Hindu Studies. January 2005, Volume 9, Issue 1, pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. Baine (ed.), Neoplatonism and Indian Thought, Norfolk Va., 1982: The International Society for Neoplatonic Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Staal, Advaita and Neoplatonism. A Critical Study in Comparative Philosophy. University of Madras, Madras 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Christians (see [[Eusebius]], [[Jerome]], and [[Origen]]) and pagans (see [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Plotinus]]) claimed him a teacher and founder of the neoplatonic system.{{source?|date=July 2017}} Porphyry stated in ''On the One School of Plato and Aristotle'', that Ammonius' view was that the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle were in harmony. [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]] claimed him as a Christian until his death, whereas Porphyry claimed he had renounced Christianity and embraced pagan philosophy.

=== Plotinus===

[[Plotinus]] ({{circa|205}}&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|270}}; Greek: Πλωτῖνος), born in upper Egypt, was a major [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]]&lt;ref name=Sarton&gt;[[George Sarton]] (1936). "The Unity and Diversity of the Mediterranean World", ''Osiris'' '''2''', pp. 406–463 [429–430].&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher of the ancient world who is widely considered the father of neoplatonism. Much of our biographical information about him comes from Porphyry's preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''Enneads''. While he was himself influenced by the teachings of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Iranian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian theology]],&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (Armstrong's Loeb translation).
{{quote|"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians"}}&lt;/ref&gt; his metaphysical writings later inspired numerous [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] metaphysicians and mystics over the centuries.

Plotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent "One", containing no division, multiplicity, nor distinction; likewise, it is beyond all categories of being and non-being. The concept of "being" is derived by us from the objects of human experience and is an attribute of such objects, but the infinite, transcendent One is beyond all such objects and, therefore, is beyond the concepts which we can derive from them. The One "cannot be any existing thing" and cannot be merely the sum of all such things (compare the Stoic doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence) but "is prior to all existents".

=== Porphyry ===
[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (Greek: Πορφύριος, c. 233–c. 309) was a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]]&lt;ref name=Sarton/&gt; neoplatonist philosopher. He wrote widely on astrology, religion, philosophy, and musical theory. He produced a biography of his teacher, Plotinus. He is important in the history of mathematics because of his Life of Pythagoras and his commentary on Euclid's Elements, which Pappus used when he wrote his own commentary. Porphyry is also known as an opponent of Christianity and as a defender of Paganism; of his Adversus Christianos (Against the Christians) in 15 books, only fragments remain. He famously said, "The gods have proclaimed Christ to have been most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect."

=== Iamblichus ===
[[Iamblichus]], also known as Iamblichus Chalcidensis ({{circa|245}}&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|325}}; Greek: Ἰάμβλιχος), was a [[History of Syria|Syrian]]&lt;ref name=Sarton/&gt; neoplatonist philosopher who determined the direction taken by later neoplatonic philosophy and, perhaps, by western philosophical religions themselves. He is perhaps best known for his compendium on Pythagorean philosophy.
In Iamblichus' system, the realm of divinities stretched from the original One down to material nature itself, where soul, in fact, descended into matter and became "embodied" as human beings. The world is thus peopled by a crowd of superhuman beings influencing natural events and possessing and communicating knowledge of the future, and who are all accessible to prayers and offerings.
Iamblichus had salvation as his final goal (see [[henosis]]). The embodied soul was to return to divinity by performing certain rites, or [[theurgy]], literally, 'divine-working'.

===Academies===
After [[Plotinus]]' (around 205–270) and his student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (around 232–309) [[Aristotle]]'s (non-biological) works entered the [[curriculum]] of [[Plato]]nic thought. Porphyry's introduction ([[Isagoge]]) to Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categoria]]'' was important as an introduction to [[logic]], and the study of Aristotle became an introduction to the study of Plato in the late Platonism of [[Athens]] and [[Alexandria]]. The commentaries of this group seek to harmonise Plato, Aristotle, and, often, the [[Stoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Frans de Haas&lt;/ref&gt; Some works of neoplatonism were attributed to Plato or Aristotle. ''[[On the Universe|De Mundo]]'', for instance, is thought not to be the work of a '[[pseudo-Aristotle]]' though this remains debatable.&lt;ref&gt;De Mundo, Loeb Classical Library, Introductory Note, D.&amp;nbsp;J. Furley&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hypatia]] ({{circa|360}}&amp;nbsp;– 415) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who served as head of the Platonist school in Alexandria, Egypt, where she taught philosophy, mathematics and astronomy prior to her murder by a fanatical mob of [[Copts|Coptic]] [[Parabalani]] [[Coptic monasticism|monks]] because she had been advising the Christian prefect of Egypt [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] during his feud with [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], Alexandria's dynastic archbishop.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UCkgLBCh2m0C&amp;pg=PA38 Hypatia of Alexandria (Revealing Antiquity)]'' by [[Maria Dzielska]]  (author), F. Lyra (translator), Harvard University Press; reprint edition (October 1, 1996),  {{ISBN|978-0674437760}}, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Cyril's personal involvement in her murder remains a matter of scholarly debate.

[[Proclus]] Lycaeus (February 8, 412&amp;nbsp;– April 17, 485), surnamed "The Successor" or "diadochos" (Greek Πρόκλος ὁ Διάδοχος Próklos ho Diádokhos), was a Greek neoplatonist philosopher, one of the last major Greek philosophers (see Damascius). He set forth one of the most elaborate, complex, and fully developed neoplatonic systems, providing also an allegorical way of reading the dialogues of Plato. The particular characteristic of Proclus' system is his insertion of a level of individual ones, called henads between the One itself and the divine Intellect, which is the second principle. The henads are beyond being, like the One itself, but they stand at the head of chains of causation (seirai or taxeis) and in some manner give to these chains their particular character. They are also identified with the traditional Greek gods, so one henad might be Apollo and be the cause of all things apollonian, while another might be Helios and be the cause of all sunny things. The henads serve both to protect the One itself from any hint of multiplicity and to draw up the rest of the universe towards the One, by being a connecting, intermediate stage between absolute unity and determinate multiplicity.

==Teachings==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maximus the Confessor]] --&gt;
The ''[[Enneads]]'' of [[Plotinus]] are the primary and classical document of neoplatonism. As a form of mysticism, it contains theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical parts deal with the high origin of the human [[soul]], showing how it has departed from its first estate. The practical parts show the way by which the soul may again return to the Eternal and Supreme.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The system can be divided between the invisible world and the phenomenal world, the former containing the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Absolute (philosophy)|One]] from which [[emanationism|emanates]] an eternal, perfect, essence (''[[nous]]''), which, in turn, produces the [[Anima mundi|world-soul]].

=== The One&lt;!--linked from 'Plotinus'--&gt; ===
For Plotinus, the first principle of reality is "the One", an utterly simple, ineffable, unknowable subsistence which is both the creative source and the [[teleological]] end of all existing things. Although, properly speaking, there is no name appropriate for the first principle, the most adequate names are "the One" or "the Good". The One is so simple that it cannot even be said to exist or to be a being. Rather, the creative principle of all things is ''beyond'' being, a notion which is derived from Book VI of the ''Republic'',&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, E.R. "The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic 'One'". ''The Classical Quarterly'', Jul–Oct 1928, vol. 22, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; when, in the course of his famous [[analogy of the sun]], Plato says that the Good is beyond being (ἐπέκεινα τῆς οὐσίας) in power and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Republic 509b&lt;/ref&gt; In Plotinus' model of reality, the One is the cause of the rest of reality, which takes the form of two subsequent "hypostases", Nous and Soul. Although neoplatonists after Plotinus adhered to his cosmological scheme in its most general outline, later developments in the tradition also departed substantively from Plotinus' teachings in regards to significant philosophical issues, such as the nature of evil.

===Emanations===
{{main|Emanationism}}
From the One [[emanation|emanated]] the rest of the universe as a sequence of lesser beings. 

==== Demiurge or Nous ====
The original Being initially [[Emanationism|emanates]], or throws out, the ''[[nous]]'', which is a perfect image of the One and the archetype of all existing things. It is simultaneously both being and thought, idea and ideal world. As image, the ''nous'' corresponds perfectly to the One, but as derivative, it is entirely different. What Plotinus understands by the ''nous'' is the highest sphere accessible to the human ''mind'',&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; while also being pure ''intellect'' itself.  ''Nous'' is the most critical component of [[idealism]], Neoplatonism being a pure form of idealism.{{refn|group=note|[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this neoplatonist philosopher: "With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, professor Ludwig Noiré wrote: "For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (''Enneads'', iii, 7, 10), where he says, "The only space or place of the world is the soul," and "Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul."&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Noiré, Historical Introduction to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting, however, that, like Plato, but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas in order to know external objects.}} The [[demiurge]] (the ''nous'') is the energy, or ''ergon'' (does the work), which manifests or organises the material world into [[perception|perceivability]].

==== The world-soul ====
The image and product of the motionless nous is the ''[[Anima mundi|world-soul]]'', which, according to Plotinus, is immaterial like the ''nous''. Its relation to the ''nous'' is the same as that of the ''nous'' to the One. It stands between the ''nous'' and the phenomenal world, and it is permeated and illuminated by the former, but it is also in contact with the latter. The ''nous/spirit'' is indivisible; the world-soul may preserve its unity and remain in the ''nous'', but, at the same time, it has the power of uniting with the corporeal world and thus being disintegrated. It therefore occupies an intermediate position. As a single world-soul, it belongs in essence and destination to the intelligible world; but it also embraces innumerable individual souls; and these can either allow themselves to be informed by the ''nous'', or turn aside from the nous and choose the phenomenal world and lose themselves in the realm of the senses and the finite.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==== The phenomenal world ====
The soul, as a moving essence, generates the corporeal or phenomenal world. This world ought to be so pervaded by the soul that its various parts should remain in perfect harmony. Plotinus is no dualist in the same sense as sects like the [[Gnostics]]; in contrast, he admires the beauty and splendour of the world. So long as idea governs matter, or the soul governs the body, the world is fair and good. It is an image – though a shadowy image – of the upper world, and the degrees of better and worse in it are essential to the harmony of the whole. But, in the actual phenomenal world, unity and harmony are replaced by strife or discord; the result is a conflict, a [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] and vanishing, an illusive existence. And the reason for this state of things is that bodies rest on a substratum of matter. Matter is the indeterminate: that with no qualities. If destitute of form and idea, it is evil; as capable of form, it is neutral.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Neoplatonism|author=[[Adolf Harnack]]; John Malcolm Mitchell|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil here is understood as a parasite, having no-existence of its own (parahypostasis), an unavoidable outcome of the Universe, having an "other" necessity, as a harmonizing factor.&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Wallis and Jay Bregman (1992), ''Neoplatonism and Gnosticism'', SUNY Press, pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celestial hierarchy ===
Later neoplatonic philosophers, especially [[Iamblichus (philosopher)|Iamblichus]], added hundreds of intermediate beings such as gods, angels, demons, and other beings as mediators between the One and humanity. The neoplatonist gods are omni-perfect beings and do not display the usual amoral behaviour associated with their representations in the myths.
* The One: God, The Good. Transcendent and ineffable.
* The Hypercosmic Gods: those that make Essence, Life, and Soul
* [[Demiurge|The Demiurge]]: the Creator
* The Cosmic Gods: those who make Being, Nature, and Matter—including the gods known to us from classical religion.

===Evil===
Neoplatonists did not believe in an independent existence of [[evil]]. They compared it to darkness, which does not exist in itself but only as the absence of light. So, too, evil is simply the absence of good. Things are good insofar as they exist; they are evil only insofar as they are imperfect, lacking some good which they should have. 

=== Return to the One ===
Neoplatonists believed human perfection and happiness were attainable in this world, without awaiting an [[afterlife]]. Perfection and happiness— seen as synonymous— could be achieved through philosophical [[contemplation]].

All people return to the One, from which they emanated.&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Leahy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrB53l4wNK0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=plotinus+energy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=rbnlnnwui5&amp;sig=84RfXY8ErxUowZm2xT21Nuk8_II#PPA6,M1 ''Faith and Philosophy: The Historical Impact'', pages 5–6]. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enneads VI 9.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Wallis and Jay Bregman (1992), SUNY Press, page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoplatonists believed in the pre-existence, and [[immortality]] of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, iv. 7, "''On the immortality of the Soul.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowersock1"&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Brown, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar, 1999, ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'', page 40. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The human soul consists of a lower irrational soul and a higher rational soul ([[mind]]), both of which can be regarded as different powers of the one soul. It was widely held that the soul possesses a "vehicle",&lt;ref&gt;See Plato's ''Timaeus'', 41d, 44e, 69c, for the origin of this idea.&lt;/ref&gt; accounting for the human soul's immortality and allowing for its return to the One after death.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. MacDonald, 2003, ''History of the Concept of Mind: Speculations About Soul, Mind and Spirit from Homer to Hume'', page 122. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; After bodily death, the soul takes up a level in the [[afterlife]] corresponding with the level at which it lived during its earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, iii.4.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Smith, 1974, ''Porphyry's Place in the Neoplatonic Tradition: A Study in Post-Plotinian Neoplatonism'', page 43. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The neoplatonists believed in the principle of [[reincarnation]]. Although the most pure and holy souls would dwell in the highest regions, the impure soul would undergo a purification,&lt;ref name="bowersock1"/&gt; before descending again,&lt;ref name="smith1"&gt;Andrew Smith, 1974, ''Porphyry's Place in the Neoplatonic Tradition: A Study in Post-Plotinian Neoplatonism'', page 58. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; to be reincarnated into a new body, perhaps into animal form.&lt;ref&gt;"Whether human souls could be reborn into animals seems to have become quite a problematical topic to the later neoplatonists." – Andrew Smith, (1987), ''Porphyrian Studies since 1913'', ANRW II 36, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Plotinus believed that a soul may be reincarnated into another human or even a different sort of animal. However, Porphyry maintained, instead, that human souls were only reincarnated into other humans.&lt;ref&gt;Remes, Pauliina, ''Neoplatonism'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; A soul which has returned to the One achieves union with the cosmic universal soul&lt;ref&gt;James A. Arieti, ''Philosophy in the Ancient World: An Introduction'', page 336. Rowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt; and does not descend again, at least, not in this world period.&lt;ref name="smith1"/&gt;

==Influence==

=== Early Christianity ===
{{Main|Neoplatonism and Christianity}}

====Augustine====
Certain central tenets of neoplatonism served as a philosophical interim for the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] on his journey from [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] [[Manichaeism]] to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Confessions Book 7&lt;/ref&gt;  As a Manichee hearer, Augustine had held that evil has substantial being and that God is made of matter; when he became a neoplatonist, he changed his views on these things. As a neoplatonist, and later a Christian, Augustine believed that evil is a privation of good&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Confessions, Book 7.12.18&lt;/ref&gt; and that God is not material.&lt;ref&gt; Augustine, Confessions, Book 7.1.1-2&lt;/ref&gt; When writing his treatise 'On True Religion' several years after his 387 baptism, Augustine's [[Christianity]] was still tempered by neoplatonism.

The term "[[Logos]]" was interpreted variously in neoplatonism. [[Plotinus]] refers to [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, the interrelationship between the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|Hypostases]]&lt;ref&gt;The journal of neoplatonic studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, P 16&lt;/ref&gt; (Soul, Spirit (nous) and the 'One'). [[John the Evangelist|St. John]] introduces a relation between 'Logos' and the Son, [[Christ]],&lt;ref name="Trinity P25"&gt;Theological treatises on the Trinity, By Marius Victorinus, Mary T. Clark, P25&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] calls it 'Son', 'Image', and 'Form'.&lt;ref name="Trinity P25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Col. 1:15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil. 2:5-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] subsequently differentiated the Logos interior to God from the Logos related to the world by creation and salvation.&lt;ref name="Trinity P25"/&gt;

For Augustine, the Logos "took on flesh" in Christ, in whom the logos was present as in no other man.&lt;ref&gt; Augustine, Confessions, Book 7.9.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De immortalitate animae of Augustine: text, translation and commentary, By Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.), C. W. Wolfskeel, introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 John 1:14&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly influenced [[Medieval philosophy#Early medieval Christian philosophy|Early Medieval Christian Philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Douwe Runia&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the key subject in this was Logos.

====Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius====
Some early Christians, influenced by neoplatonism, identified the Neoplatonic One, or God, with [[Yahweh]]. The most influential of these would be [[Origen]], the pupil of [[Ammonius Saccas]]; and the fifth-century author known as [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], whose works were translated by [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus]] in the ninth century for the West. Both authors had a lasting influence on [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Western Christianity, and the development of contemplative and mystical practices and theology. 

====Gnosticism====
{{Main|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}

Neoplatonism also had links with [[Gnosticism]], which Plotinus rebuked in his ninth tractate of the second ''[[Enneads]]'': "Against Those That Affirm The Creator of The Cosmos and The Cosmos Itself to Be Evil" (generally known as "Against The Gnostics").

Due to their belief being grounded in Platonic thought, the neoplatonists rejected Gnosticism's vilification of Plato's [[demiurge]], the creator of the material world or cosmos discussed in the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]. Neoplatonism has been referred to as orthodox Platonic philosophy by scholars like [[John D. Turner]]; this reference may be due, in part, to Plotinus' attempt to refute certain interpretations of Platonic philosophy, through his [[Enneads]]. Plotinus believed the followers of Gnosticism had corrupted the original teachings of Plato and often argued against likes of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] who, according to Plotinus, had given rise to doctrines of [[dogmatic theology]] with ideas such as that the Spirit of Christ was brought forth by a conscious god after the fall from [[Pleroma]]. According to Plotinus, The One is not a conscious god with intent nor a [[Divinity|godhead]] nor a conditioned existing entity of any kind, rather a requisite principle of totality which is also the source of ultimate wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL440/1969/pb_LCL440.xvii.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine education===
{{See also|Platonic Academy#Neoplatonic Academy}}

After the [[Platonic Academy]] was destroyed in the first century BC, philosophers continued to teach [[Middle Platonism|Platonism]], but it was not until the early 5th century (c. 410) that a revived academy (which had no connection with the original Academy) was established in [[Athens]] by some leading Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cameron, "The last days of the Academy at Athens," in ''Proceedings of the Cambridge Philological Society'' vol 195 (n.s. 15), 1969, pp 7–29.&lt;/ref&gt; It persisted until 529 AD when it was finally closed by [[Justinian I]] because of active [[paganism]] of its professors. Other schools continued in [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]] and [[Alexandria]] which were the centers of Justinian's empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C. "The Beginnings of Western Science", page 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Higher Education in the Byzantine Empire, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the closure of the Neoplatonic academy, neoplatonic and/or secular philosophical studies continued in publicly funded schools in Alexandria. In the early seventh century, the neoplatonist Stephanus brought this Alexandrian tradition to Constantinople, where it would remain influential, albeit as a form of secular education.&lt;ref name=BritA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Higher Education in the Byzantine Empire, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The university maintained an active philosophical tradition of [[Platonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]], with the former being the longest unbroken Platonic school, running for close to two millennia until the fifteenth century&lt;ref name=BritA/&gt;

[[Michael Psellos]] (1018–1078) a Byzantine monk, writer, philosopher, politician, and historian. He wrote many philosophical treatises such as ''De omnifaria doctrina''. He wrote most of his philosophy during his time as a court politician at Constantinople in the 1030s and 1040s.

[[Gemistus Pletho]] ({{circa|1355}}&amp;nbsp;– 1452; Greek: Πλήθων Γεμιστός) remained the preeminent scholar of neoplatonic philosophy in the late Byzantine Empire. He introduced his understanding and insight into the works of neoplatonism during the failed attempt to reconcile the [[East–West Schism]] at the [[council of Florence]]. At Florence, Pletho met [[Cosimo de' Medici]] and influenced the latter's decision to found a new [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] there. Cosimo subsequently appointed as head [[Marsilio Ficino]], who proceeded to translate all Plato's works, the [[Enneads]] of Plotinus, and various other neoplatonist works into Latin.

=== Islamic neoplatonism ===
There were three major reasons for the prominence of neoplatonic influences in the Islamic world:  
#Availability of neoplatonic texts: Arabic translations and paraphrases of neoplatonic works were readily available to Moslem scholars greatly due to the availability of the Greek copies, in part, because the Muslims came to rule over some of the more important centres of Greek civilisation (Egypt and Syria).
#Spatial and temporal proximity: "Plotinus and other Neoplatonists lived only a few centuries before the rise of Islam, and many of them were Egyptian Greeks."
#Neoplatonism's mystical perspectives: Plotinus' system has similar content to Islamic mysticism, like Islamic [[Sufism]]. This eased the acceptance of neoplatonic doctrines by Islamic philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morewedge|first=edited by Parviz|title=Neoplatonism and Islamic thought|year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-1335-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Arabic scholars and philosophers, including [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina), [[Ibn Arabi]], [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]], and [[al-Himsi]], adapted neoplatonism to conform to the monotheistic constraints of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleary|first=edited by John J.|title=The perennial tradition of Neoplatonism|year=1997|publisher=Univ. Press|location=Leuven|isbn=90-6186-847-5|pages=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The translations of the works which extrapolate the tenets of God in neoplatonism present no major modification from their original Greek sources, showing the doctrinal shift towards [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="Cleary"/&gt; Islamic adapted the concepts of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|the One]] and the [[First Principle]] to Islamic theology, attributing the First Principle to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleary|first=edited by John J.|title=The perennial tradition of Neoplatonism|year=1997|publisher=Univ. Press|location=Leuven|isbn=90-6186-847-5|pages=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; God is a transcendent being, omnipresent and inalterable to the effects of creation.&lt;ref name="Cleary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleary|first=edited by John J.|title=The perennial tradition of Neoplatonism|year=1997|publisher=Univ. Press|location=Leuven|isbn=90-6186-847-5|pages=420–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic philosophers used the framework of Islamic mysticism in their interpretation of Neoplatonic writings and concepts.{{refn|group=note|Morewedge: "The greatest cluster of Neoplatonic themes is found in religious mystical writings, which in fact transform purely orthodox doctrines such as creation into doctrines such as [[emanationism]], which allow for a better framework for the expression of Neoplatonic themes and the emergence of the mystical themes of the ascent and mystical union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morewedge|first=edited by Parviz|title=Neoplatonism and Islamic thought|year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-1335-7|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The translation and interpretation of Islamic neoplatonists had lasting effects on Western philosophers, affecting [[Descartes]]' view on the conception of being.

===Jewish thought===
In the Middle Ages, neoplatonist ideas influenced Jewish thinkers, such as the Kabbalist [[Isaac the Blind]], and the Jewish neoplatonic philosopher [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (''Avicebron''), who modified it in the light of their own monotheism. Neoplatonist ideas also influenced [[Islamic]] and [[Sufi]] thinkers such as [[al Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]].

===Western mysticism===
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}

The works of Pseudo-Dionysius were instrumental in the flowering of western medieval mysticism, most notably [[Meister Eckhart]].

=== Western Renaissance ===
{{Main article|Platonism in the Renaissance}}

Neoplatonism ostensibly survived in the Eastern Christian Church as an independent tradition and was reintroduced to the West by [[Gemistus Pletho|Pletho]] ({{circa|1355}}&amp;nbsp;– 1452/1454), an avowed pagan and opponent of the Byzantine Church, inasmuch as the latter, under Western scholastic influence, relied heavily upon Aristotelian methodology. [[Plethon]]'s Platonic revival, following the Council of Florence (1438–1439), largely accounts for the renewed interest in Platonic philosophy which accompanied the [[Renaissance]].

"Of all the students of Greek in Renaissance Italy, the best-known are the Neoplatonists who studied in and around Florence" (Hole). Neoplatonism was not just a revival of Plato's ideas, it is all based on Plotinus' created synthesis, which incorporated the works and teachings of Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and other Greek philosophers.
The Renaissance in Italy was the revival of classic antiquity, and this started at the fall of the Byzantine empire, who were considered the "librarians of the world", because of their great collection of classical manuscripts and the number of humanist scholars that resided in Constantinople (Hole).

Neoplatonism in the Renaissance combined the ideas of Christianity and a new awareness of the writings of Plato.

[[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–99) was "chiefly responsible for packaging and presenting Plato to the Renaissance" (Hole). In 1462, Cosimo I de' Medici, patron of arts, who had an interest in humanism and Platonism, provided Ficino with all 36 of Plato's dialogues in Greek for him to translate. Between 1462 and 1469, Ficino translated these works into Latin, making them widely accessible, as only a minority of people could read Greek. And, between 1484 and 1492, he translated the works of Plotinus, making them available for the first time to the West.

[[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) was another excelling neoplatonist during the Italian Renaissance. He could not only speak and write in Latin and Greek, but he also had immense knowledge on the Hebrew and Arabic languages. The pope banned his works because they were viewed as heretical – unlike Ficino, who managed to stay on the right side of the church.

The efforts of Ficino and Pico to introduce neoplatonic and Hermetic doctrines into the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church has recently been evaluated in terms of an attempted "Hermetic Reformation".&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Repristination Press: Texas, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge Platonists (17th century)===
{{Main article|Cambridge Platonists}}
In the seventeenth century in England, neoplatonism was fundamental to the school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], whose luminaries included [[Henry More]], [[Ralph Cudworth]], [[Benjamin Whichcote]] and [[John Smith (Platonist)|John Smith]], all graduates of the [[University of Cambridge]]. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] claimed that they were not really Platonists, but "more truly Plotinists": "divine Plotinus", as More called him.

Later, [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (not a Cambridge Platonist) was the first to translate Plotinus' works into English.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ entry for Plotinus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 458067|title = Shelley and Thomas Taylor|journal = Proceedings of the Modern Language Association of America|volume = 51|issue = 2|pages = 502–517|last1 = Notopoulos|first1 = James A.|year = 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendentalism and Perennial Philosophy===

{{empty section|date=July 2017}}

=== Modern neoplatonism ===
Notable modern neoplatonists include [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]], "the English Platonist", who wrote extensively on Platonism and translated almost the entire Platonic and Plotinian corpora into English, and the Belgian writer [[Suzanne Lilar]].

The science fiction writer [[Philip K. Dick]] identified as a neoplatonist and explores related mystical experiences and religious concepts in his theoretical work, compiled in [[The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Often synonymous to [[anti-foundationalism]], '''non-essentialism''' in [[philosophy]] is the non-belief in an [[essence]] (from Latin ''esse'') of any given thing, idea, or metaphysical [[entity]] (e.g. God). Non-essentialism might also be defined cataphatically as the belief that for any entity, there are no specific traits or [[Absolute (philosophy)|ground of being]] which entities of that kind must possess in order to be considered "that entity."

Non-essentialism is not restricted to simple philosophical speculation. It is also found in academic disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[God is dead|theology]], [[history]]/[[historiography]] and [[science]]. How non-essentialism is used in these discourses varies a bit given their different content and subject matter.

'''Odoardo Gualandi'''&lt;ref&gt;His first name is also written as Edoardo, Adoardo, Adoardus, Odoardus, Aduardus, Adouardus, Eduardus and Oduardus.  As for his last name he is also referred to as Gualando, Gualandius and Gualandinus.&lt;/ref&gt; descended from an old and famous patrician family from Pisa.&lt;ref&gt;In the Middle Ages the Gualandi family supported the Ghibellines and it was one of the families that the Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini incited against Ugolino della Gherardesca. The Gualandi family is also cited by Dante Alighieri in the ''Inferno'' (XXXIII, 33). (https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gualandi) See also  Grassi, Ranieri - ''Descrizione storica e artistica di Pisa. Parte storica''. Pisa. 1836.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[university of Bologna]] he graduated summa cum laude in civil and canon law.&lt;ref&gt;See Braschio, J.B. ''Memoriae Caesenates sacrae et profanae''. Romae. 1728, pp. 375-378&lt;/ref&gt; From 1557 till 1588 he was [[Bishop of Cesena]] in northern Italy. In that capacity Gualandi organized several synods. The synod in 1582 resulted in his first publication, ''Constitutiones, et decreta condita ab illustri...Adoardo Gualando...Caesenae''. 1584. In 1588 Gualandi retired and was succeeded as Bishop of Cesena by his nephew [[Camillo Gualandi]]. During his retirement he wrote his only known philosophical treatise, ''De civili facultate Libri XVI''. It was published by his nephew in 1598, i.e. a year after his death in Rome, 17 March 1597.&lt;ref&gt;Gualandi, Adoardi   ''De civili facultate libri XVI... In quibus doctissimè, ac luculenter universa de moribus Philosophia explicatur''. Romae. apud Aloysium Zannettum. 1598. In some sources Gualandi is said to have written also a ''Tractatus de philosophia''. (See for example  ''Discorso Accademico Sull' Istoria Letteraria Pisana''. Ranieri Prosperi. Pisa. 1787, p. 119)&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise shows Gualandi as an eclectic Aristotelian who attracted attention not so much as an original thinker as well as for the way he organized the material in his explanation of ethics and politics. Gualandi was reputed for his clear explanation of moral philosophy in general and that of Aristotle in particular.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Gabrielis Naudaei   Bibliographia politica''. Venetiis. 1633, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  His fame as a teacher  lasted till the beginning of the eighteenth century. Since then his name and work passed into forgetfulness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11651">The '''Osborne effect''' is a [[social phenomenon]] of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current soon-to-be-obsolete product as an [[unintended consequences|unexpected drawback]] of a company's announcing a future product prematurely.

The term was coined after the [[Osborne Computer Corporation]], in which the company took more than a year to make its next product available and eventually ran out of cash and went bankrupt in 1985.&lt;ref name="hyper"&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-918347-00-9 | last1=Osborne |first1= Adam | first2=John C. | last2=Dvorak| author2-link=John C. Dvorak | year=1984 | title=Hypergrowth: the rise and fall of Osborne Computer Corporation | publisher=Idthekkethan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-19-828807-7 | title=Standards, strategy and policy: cases and stories | first=Peter | last=Grindley | year=1985 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, as the revenue drop for the current product is offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by either discounting or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.

==Description==
&lt;!-- This section is directly linked from other articles. Do not change the title without finding and fixing all articles that link to it first. --&gt;
The Osborne Effect states that prematurely discussing future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the [[Osborne 1]], an early personal computer first sold by the [[Osborne Computer Corporation]] in 1981. In 1983, founder [[Adam Osborne]] pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the "[[Osborne Executive]]" and "[[Osborne Vixen]]"), which had not yet been built, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company's September 1983 bankruptcy:{{r|ahl198403}}

{{quote|To give the jazzy $2495 Osborne Executive a running start, Adam began orchestrating publicity early in 1983. We, along with many other magazines, were shown the machine in locked hotel rooms. We were required not to have anything in print about it until the planned release date in mid-April. As far as we know, nothing did appear in print, but dealers heard about the plans and cancelled orders for the Osborne 1 in droves.

In early April, Osborne told dealers he would be showing them the machine on a one-week tour the week of 17 April, and emphasized that the new machine was not a competitor for the Osborne 1. But dealers didn't react the way Osborne expected; said Osborne, "All of them just cancelled their orders for the Osborne 1."}}

Osborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.&lt;ref name="ahl198403"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n3/24_Osborne_Comptuer_Corporat.php | title=Osborne Computer Corporation | accessdate=4 April 2011 | author=Ahl, David H. | date=March 1984 | work=Creative Computing | publisher=Ziff-Davis | pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Osborne myth==
Interviews with former employees cast doubt on the idea that Osborne's downfall was caused solely by announcement ahead of availability.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Osborne Effect|work=The Osborne Effect: Sometimes What Everyone Remembers Is Wrong | url=https://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2005/pulpit_20050616_000856.html | accessdate=25 November 2009 | date=16 June 2005 | publisher=PBS | last=Cringely | first=Robert X. | authorlink=Robert X.

Cringely]] interviewed ex-Osborne employee Mike McCarthy and clarified the story behind the "Osborne effect". Purportedly, the new Executive model from Osborne Computer was priced at US$2,195 and came with a {{convert|7|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen, while competitor [[Kaypro]] was selling a computer with a {{convert|9|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen for US$400 less. The Kaypro machine had already begun to cut into sales of the Osborne 1, a computer with a {{convert|5|in|mm|sigfig=3|adj=on}} screen for US$1,995. After inventories of the Osborne 1 cleared out, monthly sales of the Executive were less than a tenth of the previous model, as customers switched to Kaypro.

On 20 June 2005, ''[[The Register]]'' quoted Osborne's memoirs and interviewed Osborne repairman Charles Eicher to tell a tale of corporate decisions that led to the company's demise.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; Apparently, while sales of the new model were relatively slow, they were starting to show a profit. Then, a vice president discovered that there was an inventory of fully equipped motherboards for the older models, worth US$150,000. Rather than discard the motherboards, the vice president sold Osborne leadership on the idea of building them into complete units and selling them. Soon US$2 million, far more money than anybody anticipated, and more than the company could afford at that time, was spent to turn the motherboards into completed units: for CRTs, RAM, floppy disk drives, and to restore production and fabricate the molded cases. In his autobiography, Osborne described this as a case of "throwing good money after bad".&lt;ref name="register"/&gt; It was then that the company folded due to debt.

==Other examples==
In 1978, [[North Star Computers]] announced a new version of their floppy disk controller, which had double the capacity, to be sold at the same price as their existing range. Sales of the existing products plummeted and the company almost went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Orlowski, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/20/no_osborne_effect_at_osborne/ "Taking Osborne out of the Osborne Effect"], ''The Register'', 20 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other consumer electronics products have been continually been plagued by Osborne Effect as well.  In the early 1990's TV set sales were depressed by talk of the imminent release of HDTV, which did not actually become widespread for another 10 years. 

When [[Sega]] began publicly discussing their next-generation system (eventually released as the [[Dreamcast]]), barely two years after launching the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], it became a [[self-defeating prophecy]]. This move, combined with Sega's recent history of short-lived consoles, particularly the [[Sega Mega-CD]] and [[Sega 32X|32X]] which were considered ill-conceived "stopgaps" that turned off gamers and developers alike, led to a chain reaction that quickly caused the Saturn's future to collapse. Immediately following the announcement, sales of the console and software substantially tapered off in the second half of 1997, while many planned games were canceled, causing the console's life expectancy to shorten substantially. While this let Sega focus on bringing out its successor, premature demise of the Saturn caused customers and developers to be skeptical and hold out, which led to the Dreamcast's demise as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Perlow, [http://www.zdnet.com/photos/osborne-effects-death-by-pre-announcement_p4/6370842 "Osborne effects: Death by pre-announcement"], ''ZDNet'', 21 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the Osborne Effect took place as a result of [[Nokia]] CEO [[Stephen Elop]]'s implementation of the plan to shift away from [[Symbian]] to [[Windows Phone]] for its mobile software platform. On top of this, criticism of existing products was compared to the [[Gerald Ratner|Ratner Effect]]. These two together led to the coining of the term "Elop Effect", to describe the combination of both premature announcement and negative comments on existing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahonen |first=Tomi T. |title=Coining Term: "Elop Effect" when you combine Osborne Effect and Ratner Effect |work=Communities Dominate Brands |date=2011-08-11 |url= http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2011/08/coining-term-elop-effect-when-you-combine-osborne-effect-and-ratner-effect.html |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2011/08/coining-term-elop-effect-when-you-combine-osborne-effect-and-ratner-effect.html Communities Dominate Brands: Coining Term: "Elop Effect" when you combine Osborne Effect and Ratner Effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was known for some time that Nokia's Symbian phones were no longer competitive against [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], they still generated significant profit thanks to Nokia's brand recognition until Elop's announcement "effectively transformed the Symbian cash-cow into a dead duck". At the same time, Nokia's first Windows Phone devices would not be ready for a year, and once they were released their sales were not enough to replace the volume and profit of Symbian devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/nokias-windows-phone-bear-hug-is-choking-the-mighty-finn-50007750/ Nokia's Windows Phone "bear hug" is choking the Mighty Finn - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the announcement that [[Windows Phone 7]] devices would not be able to upgrade to [[Windows Phone 8]] hurt sales of Nokia's WP7 phones, plus it was a risky move for [[Microsoft]] which "can ill afford to alienate people when there are scores of highly capable and affordable Android phones up for grabs. Or years-old Apple [[iPhone]]s which aren't being prematurely shut out of the iOS playground."&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Lomas, "[http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/windows-phone-8-sucker-punches-windows-phone-fans-50008345/ Windows Phone 8 sucker punches Windows Phone fans]" [[CNET]], 21 June 2012.

[[MakerBot]] appears to have fallen victim to the Osborne effect: talking openly about a future product significantly reduced the sales of their current product.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Huggins (April 2015), ''[http://www.hugs.io/2015/04/18/makerbot-and-the-osborne-effect.html What Doomed MakerBot?

The '''problem of Hell''' is an [[ethics|ethical]] problem in [[religion]] in which the existence of [[Hell]] for the punishment of [[soul]]s is regarded as inconsistent with the notion of a [[justice|just]], [[morality|moral]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] [[God]]. It derives from four key propositions: that Hell exists; that it is for the punishment of people whose lives on Earth [[Divine judgment|are judged]] to have sinned against God; that some people go there; and there is no escape.&lt;ref name="Kvanvig p.24-25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kvanvig |first=Jonathan L. |title=The Problem of Hell |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |year=1994 |pages=24–25 |isbn=0-19-508487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
There are several major issues to the problem of Hell. The first is its definition, as there are several words in the original languages of the Bible that are translated into the word "hell" in English. A second issue is whether the existence of Hell is compatible with justice. A third is whether Hell is compatible with God's mercy, especially as articulated in Christianity. An issue particular to Christianity is whether Hell is actually populated forever or they perish, or if God will ultimately restore all [[immortal soul]]s ([[universal reconciliation]]) in the [[World to Come]].

In some aspects, the problem of Hell is similar to the [[problem of evil]], assuming the suffering of Hell is caused by [[free will]] and something God could have prevented. The discussion regarding the problem of evil may thus also be of interest for the problem of Hell. The problem of Hell can be viewed as the worst and most intractable instance of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Criticisms of the doctrines of Hell===

Criticisms of the doctrines of Hell can focus on the intensity or eternity of its torments, and arguments surrounding all these issues can invoke appeals to the [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], and [[omnibenevolence]] of God.

If one believes in the idea of eternal Hell, unending suffering, or the idea that some souls will perish (whether destroyed by God or otherwise), author [[Thomas Talbott]] says that one has to either let go of the idea that God wishes to save all beings, or accept the idea that God wants to save all, but will not "successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter." &lt;ref&gt;Talbott, Thomas, "Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL= &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/heaven-hell/&gt;. "Theists who accept the traditional idea of everlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation from God, must either reject the idea that God wills or desires to save all humans and thus desires to reconcile them all to himself (see proposition (1) in section 1 above) or reject the idea that God will successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{See also|Sheol|Gehenna|Jewish eschatology}}
Almost no forms of Judaism share the traditional majority Christian belief in the [[immortality of the soul]], therefore [[Sheol]] ([[Hades]] in the Septuagint, "the grave" in many instances in the [[King James Bible]]) is simply the destination for all the dead, and no "problem of Sheol" exists. [[Gehenna]], found in the Mishnah, is the [[Lake of fire]] or destination of the living sinners and raised wicked at [[Judgement Day]], and the place of either of destruction, in the Mishnah or, in some rabbinical texts, eternal torment,&lt;ref&gt;Mercer dictionary of the Bible p. 319 Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard. 1990 "In extracanonical Jewish literature and in the NT, Gehenna was used to designate the place/state of torment of torment of the wicked."&lt;/ref&gt; which would potentially create a "problem of Gehenna."

[[Judaism|Jewish religious thinking]] has traditionally held, even among different schools ranging from [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] teachings to [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] thinking to [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] thinking and more, that "The righteous of all peoples have a place in the World-To-Come", in the words of [[the Talmud]], with humanity as a whole being 'saved'. Thus, rabbinical scholars have broadly held the [[inclusivism|inclusive]] view that the vast majority of people in existence, both Jewish and gentile, will be reconciled with God in the [[afterlife]] given the power of his grace and the fundamental goodness of mankind.&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite book|pages=18|title=Supreme God: Body, Will, Wisdom, and Work|author=Jitendra Dhoj Khand|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|ISBN=9781434946140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{See also|Christian views on hell}}
In Christianity, [[Hell]] has traditionally been regarded as a place of [[punishment]] for wrongdoing or [[sin]] in the mortal life, as a manifestation of divine justice. Nonetheless, the extreme severity and/or infinite duration of the punishment might be seen as incompatible with justice. However, [[Hell]] is not seen as strictly a matter of [[retributive justice]] even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] see it as a condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Christian Homepage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |title=Orthodox Christian Homepage |publisher=Home.it.net.au |accessdate=2013-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020901031115/http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |archivedate=2002-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that Hell is a place of punishment&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', 1035, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}}, 1994 – the revised version issued 1997 has no changes in this section&lt;/ref&gt; brought about by a person's self-exclusion from communion with God.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1033, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}}, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ancient Eastern Christian traditions,{{Which|date=February 2012}} Hell and [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a person to God's love.
{{quote|I also maintain that those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. Nay, what is so bitter and vehement as the torment of love?...It would be improper for a man to think that sinners in Gehenna are deprived of the love of God...it torments sinners...Thus I say that this is the torment of Gehenna: bitter regret.|St. [[Isaac of Syria]], Ascetical Homilies 28, Page 141&lt;ref name="Orthodox Christian Homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theandros.com/restoration.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127014824/http://www.theandros.com/restoration.html|date=November 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of the Bible itself, issues of [[salvation]] and access to heaven or to hell are mentioned frequently. Examples include  [[Gospel of John|John 3:16]] 
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." which tends to show the wicked perish and the saints have everlasting life or  [[Gospel of John|John 3:36]] ([[New International Version|NIV]]), "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:36&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians|2 Thessalonians 1:8–9]] ([[New International Version|NIV]]), "Those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus, they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+1%3A7-9&amp;version=NIV&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority Christian doctrine that sinners perish and are destroyed rather than punished eternally such as is found in [[Gospel of John|John 3:15]] "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.", is referred to as [[Christian mortalism]]; [[annihilationism|annihilation]] for those not awarded [[immortal life]], [[conditional immortality]] for those who are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterlife.co.nz/free-resources/what-is-conditional-immortality/ |title=What is Conditional Immortality? |publisher=Afterlife |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Christian view is found in very early Christianity, resurfaced in the Reformation, and since 1800 has found increasing support among Protestant theologians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bauckham]] "[http://www.theologicalstudies.org.uk/article_universalism_bauckham.html Universalism: a historical survey]" (@ theologicalstudies.org.uk), ''[[Themelios]]'' 4.2 (September 1978): 47–54. "Here and there, outside the theological mainstream, were some who believed that the wicked would be finally annihilated (in its commonest form. this is the doctrine of 'conditional immortality')." "Since 1800 this situation has entirely changed, and no traditional Christian doctrine has been so widely abandoned as that of eternal punishment.3 Its advocates among theologians today must be fewer than ever before. The alternative interpretation of hell as annihilation seems to have prevailed even among many of the more conservative theologians."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice===

Some opponents of the traditional doctrine of Hell claim that the punishment is disproportionate to any crimes that could be committed. Because human beings have a finite lifespan, they can commit only a finite number of sins, yet Hell is an infinite punishment. In this vein, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] suggests in his essay ''La duración del Infierno''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|title=Discusión|year=1999|publisher=Alianza Editorial, S.A.|location=Madrid, España|isbn=84-206-3331-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; that no transgression can warrant an infinite punishment on the grounds that there is no such thing as an "infinite transgression". Philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] argued in 1793 in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason]]'' that since morality lies ultimately in a person's disposition, and as disposition is concerned with the adoption of universal principles, or as he called them: "maxims", every human being is guilty of, in one sense, an infinite amount of violations of the law, and so consequently an infinite punishment is not unjustified.&lt;ref name="Kant1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Immanuel Kant|title=Kant: Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: And Other Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDRrfrtpJv4C|accessdate=23 December 2012|date=26 November 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59964-1|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists, particularly in the [[Thomistic]] tradition, have argued that God's [[infinity|infinite]] dignity requires that any transgression against him warrants an infinite punishment,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and the correct punishment for a crime is proportional to the status of the wronged individual. Opponents of this view object, citing that the severity of a crime is determined by the amount of harm done to the victim, not by their lifespan or scope of being. An omnipotent being, by definition, cannot be harmed. Therefore, by condemning souls to an ''eternal'' damnation, God would be punishing souls for actions that had no effect on him.

Another apparent injustice is in being punished for something one does not know exists, as some denominations{{who|date=February 2012}} of Christianity believe that only by accepting Jesus can one be saved from Hell.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} However a few branches of Christianity teach that one cannot sin unless one performs an action knowing it is wrong, or performs an action knowing it could result in harm. Catholics say that as far as strict necessity is concerned, faith in Christ may suffice in implicit form, though explicit faith is better, and implicit faith in Christ may even be compatible with misled rejection of appearing Christendom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}

The eternity of Hell has also been justified in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition by appeal to the irrevocability of the reprobate's decision to oppose God after death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Eternity is perceived not as an infinite stretch of time, but as an unchanging present (though these may not be qualitatively different). This argument however, could be challenged by the view that if wrongdoers are to be punished in Hell they must suffer, and for this they must retain their sentience in order to experience suffering. If this sentience is retained it follows that the wrongdoers would be aware of their transgressions and capable of repenting them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Consistent with the Thomistic mode of disputation, one might also question whether a being finite in intelligence can justly be condemned to a punishment infinite/eternal in extent.

Another argument against the justice of Hell is that humans are not culpable for their sins, since sinning is unavoidable to them. ''For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God'' ([[Epistle to the Romans]], 3:23). However, the statement "all have sinned" does not necessarily indicate that sin is unavoidable (Hebrews 4:15). Also, if God is omniscient/prescient, he is aware of the outcome before anyone enters into Heaven or Hell. From the reasoning that God created them in the first place, some go so far as to ascribe to Him the culpability for a person's eternal fate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The question is all the more burning if one states exactly this ([[positive reprobation]], [[Calvinism]]). However, the (theoretically distinct) doctrine of [[negative reprobation]] without consideration of future demerits ([[Domingo Báñez]])—God elects some, the others fall into sin on their own, but of necessity, and are then judged for their sins—will be felt not so much distinct "in practice". If the angels and the blessed without inconvenience to their free will partake of an irresistible [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] (which is thus shown possible), even who holds an at least conditional election of every human being ([[Molinism]] and, despite notable academic success of Thomist grace theology within the [[Catholic]] pale, in practice the stand of Catholics) needs to say that God could have rescued some and did not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Here, again, the discussion shades into that on the [[problem of evil]].

===Divine mercy===
Another issue is the problem of harmonizing the existence of Hell with God's infinite mercy or omnibenevolence which is found in scripture.

As in the [[problem of evil]], some apologists{{who|date=February 2012}} argue that the traditional view of the torments of Hell are attributable not to a defect in God's benevolence, but in human [[free will]]. Although a benevolent God would prefer to see everyone saved, he would also allow humans to control their own destinies. This view opens the possibility of seeing Hell not as retributive punishment, but rather as an option that God allows, so that people who do not wish to be with God are not forced to be. [[C. S. Lewis|C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Lewis]] most famously proposed this view in his book ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', saying: "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'"

Two problems remain regarding Christian theological teachings about grace, the first which grants that God could indeed convert the heart of every sinner and yet leave the freedom of will in its integrity.&lt;ref&gt;"Hell", Catholic Dictionary, Addis &amp; Arnold (rev. P.E Hallet), Virtue, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Thomistic tradition, God grants sufficient grace for [[salvation]] to all people, yet it only [[wikt:effect|effects]] salvation for some. The early modern controversies on grace among the [[Jansenist]]s, [[Jesuit]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] focused in part on the question of sufficient and efficient grace, and whether these differed in kind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Secondly, an omniscient God would be aware of the future choice of the individual human's free will, to accept or reject God, prior to the creation of the individual human. This omniscient God would then exercise his/her own free will in choosing to create a human that he/she knows, a priori, would be condemned to eternal torture. God could, in this circumstance, simply choose not to create the human. Such a choice would be incompatible with God's infinite mercy or omnibenevolence.

Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as [[Marilyn McCord Adams]]) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as ourselves the responsibility of our eternal destinies.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beck. "[http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2007/03/christ-and-horrors-part-3-horror-defeat.html Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation]". ''Experimental Theology.'' March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kvanvig]], in ''The Problem of Hell'' (1993), agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kvanvig]], ''The Problem of Hell'', New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-508487-0}}, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; One should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while [[depression (mood)|depressed]] or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.

==Islam==
{{See also|Jahannam}}
In Islam, [[Jahannam]] is the final destiny of evildoers and is regarded as necessary for [[God in Islam|God]]'s divine justice. God's punishments are by definition considered to be justified, since God holds absolute sovereignty.  Furthermore, with regard to [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]], one of [[Iman (concept)#The Six Articles of Faith|six articles of faith]] in Islam, the question of how creatures be punished for their deeds arises.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===The inhabitants of Hell===
The inhabitants of [[Afterlife|afterlife places]] are not [[dogma]]tically determined in Islam, thus it is up to individual and [[tafsir|critical interpretation of the Qur'an]] as to who enters Hell. A common concern is the fate of non-Muslims and if they will be punished for not belonging to the ''right'' religion. An often-recited [[quran]]ic verse implies that righteous non-Muslims will be saved on [[Islamic eschatology|Judgement Day]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans—those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness—will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.&amp;nbsp;{{cite quran|2|62|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However some scholars hold this verse may be set aside as only applying before the arrival of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;David Marshall ''Communicating the Word: Revelation, Translation, and Interpretation in Christianity and Islam'' Georgetown University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-589-01803-7}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
Some non-pluraist scholars like [[Ibn Arabi]] state that every human will receive a proper message and will not be doomed for ignorance, while others claim non-Muslims are judged by their own moral standards, because of God's all-embracing mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Adis Duderija ''The Imperatives of Progressive Islam'' Adis Duderija {{ISBN|978-1-315-43883-2}} p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criteria to determine the justice of Hell's punishment derives from its duration, on which Islamic scholars disagree. Some scholars state that Hell is eternal, others hold that Hell exists to purify rather than inflict pain,&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-316-41205-3}} p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and others state that Hell itself will cease to exist.

With the increasing urgency of [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], modern writers such as [[Edip Yüksel]] and [[Mouhanad Khorchide]] hold Hell to be finite rather than eternal: Yüksel argues that evildoers will be punished in Hell for an appropriate period then cease to exist, so that their suffering (which is described in the [[Quran]] and is balanced with descriptions of heaven) will be only a [[justice|just]] amount.&lt;ref name=Yuksel&gt;[http://19.org/blog/hell/ Eternal Hell and a Merciful God] Edip Yüksel, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other universalist-leaning scholars include Tariq Ramadan, Sayyid Qutb and possibly Ibn Qayyim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/5611020/The_Inclusive_Dynamics_of_Islamic_Universalism_From_the_Vantage_Point_of_Sayyid_Qutbs_Critical_Philosophy |title=The Inclusive Dynamics of Islamic Universalism: From the Vantage Point of Sayyid Qutb's Critical Philosophy |last=Mura |first=Andrea |journal=Comparative Philosophy |year=2014 |volume=5 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who some argue, like his teacher Ibn Taymiyya, was not a universalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reply to Accusations Against Ibn Taymiyyah|url=http://sunnahonline.com/library/biographies/381-reply-to-accusations-against-ibn-taymiyyah#h9-the-accusation-that-ibn-taymiyyah-held-the-hellfire-to-come-to-an-end|website=SunnahOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{relevance inline|date=July 2018|It seems tangental to state this about Qayyim and Taymiyya who are not mentioned elsewhere in the article.}}

===Concerning predestination===
The degree of free will differs in Islamic thought. Based on [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] traditions, God wrote everything that will happen on a [[Tablet (religious)|''tablet'']] before creating the world, therefore human [[free will]] is not beyond God's influence. This results in the problem: how punishment is justified since God made humans the way they will sin. In this tradition, in [[Ashari]] thought, God created good and evil deeds, which humans decide upon&amp;mdash;humans have their own possibility to choose, but God retains sovereignty of all possibilities. This still leaves the question of why God set out those people's lives (or the negative choice of deeds) which result in Hell, and why God created the possibility to become evil. In Islamic thought, evil is considered to be movement away from good, and God created this possibility so that humans are able to recognize good.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Loeffler ''Islam in Practice: Religious Beliefs in a Persian Village'' SUNY Press {{ISBN|978-0-887-06679-5}} p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; (In contrast, [[angels in Islam|angels]] are unable to move away from good, therefore angels generally rank lower than humans as they have reached heaven because they lack the ability to perceive the world as humans do.)&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Haj Yousef ''The Single Monad Model of the Cosmos: Ibn Arabi's Concept of Time and Creation'' ibnalarabi 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-499-77984-4}} p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed answers==

===Annihilationism===
{{Main|Annihilationism}}
As with other Jewish writings of the [[Second Temple]] period, the New Testament text distinguishes two words, both translated "Hell" in older English Bibles: ''[[Hades]]'', "the grave", and ''[[Gehenna]]'' where God "can destroy both body and soul". A minority of Christians read this to mean that neither [[Hades]] nor [[Gehenna]] are eternal but refer to the ultimate destruction of the wicked in the [[Lake of Fire]] in a consuming fire, but which because of the Greek words used in translating from the Hebrew text has become confused with Greek myths and ideas. From the sixth century BC onward, the Greeks developed pagan ideas for the dead, and of reincarnation and even transmigration of souls. Christians picked up these pagan beliefs inferred by the Greek of immortality of the soul, or spirit being of a mortal individual, which survives the death of the body of this world and this lifetime, which is at odds and in contrast to the scriptural teaching that the dead go to the grave and know nothing and then at the end, an eternal oblivion of the wicked and an eternal life for the saints. Scripture makes clear that the dead are awaiting resurrection at the last judgment, when Christ comes and also when each person will receive his reward or are part of those lost with the wicked.

The Greek words used for those Bibles written in Greek, came loaded with ideas not in line with the original Hebrew, but since at the time, Greek was used as basically English is used today to communicate between people across the world, it was translated into these Greek words, and giving an incorrect understanding of the penalty of sin. In the Hebrew text when people died they went to [[Sheol]], the grave and the wicked ultimately went to Gehenna which is the consuming by fire. So when the grave or the eternal oblivion of the wicked was translated into Greek, the word Hades was sometimes used, which is a Greek term for the realm of the dead. Nevertheless, the meaning depending on context was the grave, death, or the end of the wicked in which they are ultimately destroyed or perish. So we see where the grave or death or eventual destruction of the wicked, was translated using Greek words that since they had no exact ones to use, became a mix of mistranslation, pagan influence, and Greek myth associated with the word, but its original meaning was simple death or the destruction of the wicked at the end.

[[Christian mortalism]] is the doctrine that all men and women, including Christians, must die, and do not continue and are not conscious after death. Therefore, [[annihilationism]] includes the doctrine that "the wicked" are also destroyed rather than [[tortured|tormented]] [[eternity|forever]] in traditional "Hell" or the [[lake of fire]]. Christian mortalism and annihilationism are directly related to the doctrine of [[Christian conditionalism|conditional immortality]], the idea that a human [[soul]] is not immortal unless it is given eternal life at the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the [[resurrection of the dead]]. Such a belief is based on the many texts which state that the wicked perish:
:"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16 (KJV).
:"For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been." Obadiah 1:15–16 (KJV).

Annihilationism asserts that God will eventually destroy or annihilate the wicked when they are consumed in the [[Lake of fire|Lake of Fire]] at the end, leaving only the righteous to live on in [[immortality]].
[[Christian conditionalism|Conditional immortality]] asserts that souls are naturally mortal, and those who reject Christ are separated from the sustaining power of God, thus dying off on their own.

This is seen in the texts making clear the alternatives at the end are to perish or to have eternal, everlasting life:
:"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Romans 6:23 (KJV)

And that the consequence for sin at the day of judgment when God will judge both the living and the dead when He appears is death, not burning forever. God's gift is eternal life, very different from the penalty of sin:
:"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." 2 Peter 2:9. (KJV).
:"As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world." Matthew 13:40 (KJV).
:"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 13:49–50 (KJV).

The mortality of the soul has been held throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote= In the first place, there have not been a few, both in ancient and modern times, who have maintained the truth of a 'Conditional Immortality'. |last= McConnell |title= The Evolution of Immortality |page= 84 |year= 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |quote= At the same time there have always been isolated voices raised in support of other views.

One of the most notable English opponents of the immortality of the soul was [[Thomas Hobbes]] who describes the idea as a Greek "contagion" in Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. State ''Thomas Hobbes and the Debate Over Natural Law and Religion'' 2013 "The natural immortality of the soul is in fact a pagan presumption: "For men being generally possessed before the time of our Saviour, by contagion of the Daemonology of the Greeks, of an opinion, that the Souls of men were substances distinct from their Bodies, and therefore that when the Body was dead"&lt;/ref&gt; Modern proponents of conditional immortality include as denominations the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and some other [[Protestant]] [[Christians]].

===Free will===
Some apologists argue that Hell exists because of free will, and that Hell is a choice rather than an imposed punishment. Jonathan L. Kvanvig writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|[[C.S.Lewis|[C.S.] Lewis]] believes that the doors of hell are locked from the inside rather than from the outside. Thus, according to Lewis, if escape from hell never happens, it is not because God is not willing that it should happen. Instead, residence in hell is eternal because that is just what persons in hell have chosen for themselves.}}

Similarly, [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]] (1996) writes:

{{quote|We may rest assured that no one will suffer in hell who could by any means have been won to Christ in this life. God leaves no stone unturned to rescue all who would respond to the convicting and wooing of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Hunt ''In Defense of Faith'' Harvest House Publishers, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An example from popular culture can be found in the [[graphic novel]] series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''. In it, souls go to Hell because they '''''believe''''' that they deserve to, rather than being condemned to it by God or Satan.&lt;ref&gt;Gaiman, Neil ''Season of Mists'' DC Comics/Vertigo, 1990 p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal reconciliation===
{{Main|Christian Universalism|Universal reconciliation}}
Universal reconciliation is the doctrine or belief of some Christians that all will receive [[salvation]] because of the love and mercy of God. Universal reconciliation does not commit one to the position that one can be saved apart from Christ. It only commits one to the position that all will eventually be saved through Christ. Neither does universal reconciliation commit one to the position that there is no Hell or damnation—Hell can well be the consuming fire through which Christ refines those who turn from him. Universal reconciliation only claims that one day Death and Hades themselves will be destroyed and all immortal souls will be reconciled to Him.

It was traditionally claimed by some western scholars such as the Universalist historian [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] (1911) and [[Pierre Batiffol]] (English translation 1914) that a form of universal salvation could be found among some theologians in early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Knight claims that in the first five or six centuries of Christianity, there were six known theological schools, of which four (Alexandria, Antioch, Cesarea, and Edessa or Nisibis) were Universalist, one (Ephesus) accepted conditional immortality, and one (Carthage or Rome) taught the endless punishment of the lost. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12.u.ii.html The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, 1953, vol. 12, p. 96; retrieved 30/04/09]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] interpreted the New Testament's reference (Acts 3:21) to a "restoration of all things", (Greek: [[apocatastasis]] of all things), as meaning that sinners ''might'' be restored to God and released from Hell, returning the universe to a state identical to its pure beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Origen Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of apocatastasis could be easily interpreted{{who|date=December 2010}} to imply that even devils would be saved, as was the case during the later Origenist controversies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Greek orthodox scholars do not count [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (AD 331–395) as a believer in Universal Salvation.&lt;ref&gt;"We know well that all evil that happens admits of being annihilated by its opposite (Against Eunomius, Book I). Then he affirms apocatastasis stating that "The Son has accomplished the Father's will, and this, in the language of the Apostle, is 'that all men should be saved, '" (Against Eunomius, Book XII).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, a belief in [[Christian universalism]] appeared in England and traveled over to what has become the present-day US Christian Universalists such as [[Hosea Ballou]] argued that Jesus taught Universalist principles including universal reconciliation and the divine origin and destiny of all souls. Ballou also argued that some Universalist principles were taught or foreshadowed in the [[Old Testament]]. Critics of universalism maintain that the Bible does not teach universal salvation,&lt;ref&gt;Robin A. Parry ''Universal salvation?: the current debate'' p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; while proponents insist that it does.

Recent examples of advocates for the position are [[Kallistos Ware]], a [[Greek Orthodox]] bishop and retired [[University of Oxford]] [[theologian]] who states that many of the 'Fathers of Church' postulated the idea of salvation for all, and [[Saint Silouan]] of [[Mt. Athos]], who argued that the compassion and love of those in heaven and on earth will extend to eliminating suffering even in hell. In terms of Biblical citations, Father David A. Fisher, Pastor of St. Anthony of Padua
Maronite Church and professor of philosophy at [[Ohio Central State University]], has argued that total reconciliation seems to arise from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] such as 1 Corinthians 15:22, "As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ", and 1 Corinthians 15:28, "God will be all in all."&lt;ref name=stmaron&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stmaron.org/The_Maronite_Voice_for_December_2011.pdf|accessdate=July 2, 2014|title=The Question of Universal Salvation: Will All Be Saved?|first=David A.|last=Fisher|publisher=''The Maronite Voice'', Volume VII, Issue No. XI.|date=December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508152506/http://www.stmaron.org/The_Maronite_Voice_for_December_2011.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations 3:31–33]] (NIV), "For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3%3A31-33&amp;version=NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and [[First Epistle to Timothy|1 Timothy 4:10]] (NIV), "We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+4%3A10&amp;version=NIV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theodicy ===
With regards to the problem of hell, as one that can be traced to the more fundamental theological dilemma of God and the existence of good and evil, [[theodicy]] offers its own answers. The main issue holds that if God is all good, powerful, and perfect, then how can he allow evil and, by extension, hell to exist? For some thinkers, the existence of evil and hell could mean that God is not perfectly good and powerful or that there is no God at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plato-philosophy.org/teachertoolkit/the-problem-of-evil/|title=The Problem of Evil {{!}} PLATO - Philosophy Learning and Teaching Organization|work=PLATO|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy tries to address this dilemma by reconciling an all-knowing, all-powerful, and omnibenevelont God with the existence of evil and suffering, outlining the possibility that God and evil can coexist. There are several thoughts or theodicies such as biblical theodicy, the theodicy attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]], Plotinian, Irenean, and Augustinian, among others. These differ in their respective arguments but, overall, these theodicies - as opposed to a defense that demonstrates the existence of God and evil or hell - seek to demonstrate a framework where God's existence is plausible. It is, therefore, a logical instead of evidential answer to the problem. A theodicy explains God's reason for allowing evil, that there is a greater good that justifies such permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Calvinism and the Problem of Evil|last=Alexander|first=David|last2=Johnson|first2=Daniel|publisher=Pickwick Publication|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4982-8476-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empty Hell theory==
Some Catholic theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]], Gisbert Greshake, and Cardinal [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans Urs von Balthasar «Hoffnung auf das Heil aller?». ''Dare we hope: "that all men be saved"?; with, A short discourse on hell''&lt;/ref&gt; have at length discussed the possibility that any man may be led by a final grace to freely willed repentance if necessary at least at some point in the process of dying. This possible process is described thus by the late Munich dogmatic Prof. [[Michael Schmaus]]: "If in terms of theology death is a meeting of a man with God in so far as God calls man and he answers obedience, readiness and love, it would be surprising if in the moment of dying the chances of taking position never were given, even contrary to the outward look. [...] One cannot apply to experience as counter-argument, because [...] what happens then in the interior and behind the physiological processes is only known by someone who experiences dying itself, and this unto its very end. We may assume that in the dissolving process of the earthly union of body and soul and with the progressing breakaway from earthly entanglements, a special awakeness accrues to man [...] in which he can say yea or nay to God."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schmaus, ''Der Glaube der Kirche'' ("The Faith of the Church") VI/II p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Balthasar was careful to describe his opinion that Hell might be empty as merely a hope, but even this claim was rejected by most conservative Catholics, including Cardinal [[Avery Dulles]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Schindler ''Hans Urs von Balthasar: his life and work'' "Until then he had not published very much about obedience and marriage in paradise. The controversy about Hell was left entirely to the final years of von Balthasar's life. At the time no one could have known how much these themes owed to the inspiration of Adrienne von Speyr".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syllabus of Errors|Syllabus]] says in no. 17 that we may not (even) hope for the salvation of all non-Catholics;{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} this seems to mean conversely that there is at least one non-Catholic in all history who will not be saved. Matthew 7:21–23 seems to say that "many" will be reproved, which may imply hell (not some lesser [[purgatory]]). On the other hand, error no. 17 in question only speaks of those "in the true Church of Christ," which need not imply the visible Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=THE SYLLABUS|last=THE SYLLABUS Pope Pius IX|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholicism allows for the possibility that non-Catholics can be saved, and rejected the view known as [[Feeneyism]], which held that only people in visible communion with the Catholic Church could be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicity.com/commentary/shea/00059.html|title=Can Non-Catholics Be Saved?|last=Shea|first=Mark|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joris-Karl Huysmans.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Joris-Karl Huysmans]]

'''Spiritual naturalism''', or '''naturalistic spirituality''' combines mundane and spiritual ways of looking at the world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Periodical and Literature Index'' - Catholic Library Association, 1956, page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual naturalism may have first been proposed by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] in 1895 in his book ''En Route'' – "In 'En Route' Huysmans started upon the creation of what he called 'Spiritual Naturalism,' that is, realism applied to the story of a soul. ...".&lt;ref&gt;''The Yale Review'' - Yale University, Blackwell, 1915, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coming into prominence as a writer during the 1870s, Huysmans quickly established himself among a rising group of writers, the so-called [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist school]], of whom [[Émile Zola]] was the acknowledged head...With Là-bas (1891), a novel which reflected the aesthetics of the spiritualist revival and the contemporary interest in the occult, Huysmans formulated for the first time an aesthetic theory which sought to synthesize the mundane and the transcendent: "spiritual Naturalism". &lt;/blockquote&gt;Long before the term spiritual naturalism was coined by Huysmans, there is evidence of the value system of spiritual naturalism in the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. "Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Western Philosophy|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Spirituality ===
[[Spirituality]] (from the [[Latin]] root ''spiritus'' 'breath, spirit', from ''spirare'' 'breathe'&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''. 3rd ed. Edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015. DOI: 10.1093/acref/9780195392883.001.0001&lt;/ref&gt;) is an overarching concept related to [[religion]] and "affecting the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;"Definition of Naturalism in English." ''Oxford Dictionary (American English) (US)''. Oxford University Press, n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; With many different definitions as scholars try to pin down exactly what it is they are defining, it has tended to have a more positive connotation than religion broadly in recent years because of its "association with personal experiences of the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spilka, Β. and D. N. Mcintosh. 1996. August. ''Religion and spirituality: The known and the unknown.'' Paper presented at the American Psychological Association annual conference, Toronto, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinnbauer, Brian J. et al.. "Religion and Spirituality: Unfuzzying the Fuzzy". ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 36.4 (1997): 549–564. Web. doi:10.2307/1387689.&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as more positive because of trends toward privileging individuality, and so many different definitions are given it by many different people, any one of them unlikely to satisfy everyone.

In fact, the term is so broad and so dependent on who is using how, why, when, and in what context, that some have given up on trying to give it a comprehensive definition and just say that it means something different to all who use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology Today|url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/spirituality|website = www.psychologytoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps a less necessarily contextual definition is found in the words of K. I. Pargament, who sees spirituality as a "search for the sacred" of each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I., &amp; Mahoney, A. (2002). Spirituality. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.) ''Handbook of Positive Psychology'' (pp. 646-656) New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturalism ===
[[Metaphysical naturalism|Naturalism]] (from Latin ''natura'' 'birth, nature, quality'&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;) is "the idea or belief that only natural (as opposed to supernatural or spiritual) laws and forces operate in the world".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been especially prominent in America,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jon. "Naturalism." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a valuable tool in scientific endeavors to discover the natural laws of the universe as it believes that everything can be explained through the language and explanatory power of empirical scientific experimentation. It is not, however, necessarily a lack of religion; given a definition of religion that includes searching for the truths of the universe, naturalism is eminently describable as such. Scholar Jerome A. Stone gives the definition as "affirm[ing] that attention should be focused on the events and processes of this world to provide what degree of explanation and meaning are possible to this life".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Jerome Arthur. "Spirituality For Naturalists." ''Zygon'' 47.3 (2012): 481-500. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 3 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual variety of naturalism finds ways to reconcile the feelings of awe and religious experience with the idea that everything is natural and can be studied using methods applicable to studying nature, including the place of humans in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Paul, 1990. ''Philosophical Essays in Pragmatic Naturalism,'' Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Spiritual Naturalism is a variety of philosophical and religious worldviews that are naturalistic in their basic viewpoint but have a spiritual and religious perspective also. Chief among modern forms of Spiritual Naturalism are [[religious naturalism]], [[religious humanism]], [[dualist pantheism]], and humanistic religious naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/6558.shtml uuworld (org)].&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to the beliefs of some [[Paganism|(naturalistic) pagans]], [[Process Philosophy|process thinkers]], many [[Taoism|Taoists]], a number of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], and a variety of non-affiliated independent thinkers who base their spiritual experience directly on Nature itself rather than traditional deities and the [[supernatural]] (i.e. [[Epicureans]]). Some [[Society for Humanistic Judaism|liberal Jewish congregations]], [[nontheist Friend]]s, and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uurn.org/ uurn (org)].&lt;/ref&gt; have similar orientations in their adoption of Religious Naturalism beliefs.

Although the overall movement toward these attitudes remains relatively small and loosely organized, various forms of Spiritual Naturalism have existed since time immemorial, with the pantheistic philosophies of Taoism and similar Eastern nature-mysticisms being perhaps the most notable example. At present, there is a growing interest in adopting a Spiritual Naturalism rational alternative for the modern world because many are losing their belief in more traditional spiritual avenues. This is demonstrated in the recent rapid growth of Religious Naturalism, [[Naturalistic pantheism|pantheism]] (particularly of an avowedly naturalistic variety) and some [[liberal Christian]] perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpc.org/library/article.cfm?library_id=562 Imagining a Progressive Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians such as [[John Shelby Spong]] and [[Paul Tillich]] have embraced thinking that is non-secular naturalist.

Crucial challenges for the spiritual naturalism movement in its various forms currently involve developing and promulgating a conciliate understanding of the somewhat ambiguous terms ''spirituality'' and ''naturalism''. The difference in interpreting the difference between religious and spiritual, [[humanism|humanist]] and [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalist]] and free will and determinism also needs a consensus. In addition the individualistic nature and thinking of many of the adherents preclude organizing cohesive communities. However recent authors ([[Ursula Goodenough]], [[Chet Raymo]], [[Karl E. Peters]], [[Loyal Rue]] and [[Stuart Kauffman]]) are highlighting the paradigm via their naturalistic writings.

In addition a few modern theologians with liberal orientations have rejected some of the historical claims of some biblical doctrines and supernaturalism and moved to progressive forms of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] akin to [[Theism|theistic]] naturalism. Examples are: [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[John Shelby Spong]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[John A. T. Robinson]], William Murry and Gordon Kaufman. Some of those into [[process theology]] may also be included in this movement.

==Orientation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Spiritual Naturalism has advocates that cover the religious spectrum including neo-theism ([[neo-Christianity]], process theology), [[Nontheism|non-theism]], and not-theism, though the advocates are by no means limited to these orientations. The majority probably are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[Atheism|atheistic]] while many prefer not to be categorized.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Spiritual Naturalism? {{!}} The Spiritual Naturalist Society|url = http://spiritualnaturalistsociety.org/about-us/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/|website = spiritualnaturalistsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a vast difference in opinions on how to address the question of a deity of some kind, if at all. There are those who see God as the creative process within/of the universe, those who define [[Pantheism|God as the totality of the universe]] ([[The All]]), some who use God in metaphoric ways, those who have no need to use the concept or terminology of God even as a metaphor, and some who are atheistic proclaiming there is no such entity whatsoever and rebel against usage of the term.

Spiritual Naturalism is chiefly concerned with finding ways to access traditional spiritual feelings without the inclusion of supernatural elements incompatible with [[science]] and a broad [[Humanistic naturalism|naturalism]]. Adherents believe that [[nature]], in all its diversity and wonder, is sufficient unto itself in terms of eliciting the intellectual and emotional responses associated with spiritual experience, and that there is no need for faith in the traditional [[anthropomorphic]] concept of '[[god]]' or similar ideas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Adherents of Spiritual Naturalism are generally scientifically-oriented in most aspects, with their primary difference from other naturalists being their belief that the abandonment of [[superstition]] does not necessarily entail the abandonment of spirituality. To adherents, the intellectual and emotional experience of something greater than oneself is seen as a phenomenon of enduring value; spirituality may be seen as "an emotional response to Reality".

== Examples in religions ==
=== Judaism ===
Spiritual Naturalist ideas are most prevalent in [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]: a modern Jewish movement based on the ideas of [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. Reconstructionist Jews assert that Judaism, as a culture and as a religion, is constantly evolving and adapting to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who is a Reconstructionist Jew? {{!}} Jewish Reconstructionist Community|url = http://www.jewishrecon.org/resource/who-reconstructionist-jew|website = www.jewishrecon.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[God]] is not perceived as a supernatural being, but as being "manifest in the practice of kindness, justice and righteousness on the earth".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Evolution of the Idea of God in Jewish Religion|last = Kaplan|first = Mordecai|date = 1967|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructionist conception of God is compatible with the spiritual naturalist's assertion that there is no supernatural; spirituality is manifest in the physical world. Kaplan also states that "the reality of God henceforth will have to be experienced through the functioning of conscience in the conduct of men and nations".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To Kaplan and Reconstructionist Jews, God is the collective consciousness of the Jewish community, not a supernatural other. One strives to know God, and to know God is to know how to live morally.

=== Christianity ===
Naturalism in [[Christianity]] is a rarer phenomenon than in some other religions because of the intensity of belief in the personhood of God, especially through the figure of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Braxton, Donald M. "Religious Naturalism And The Future Of Christianity." ''Zygon'' 42.2 (2007): 317-341. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 29 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; also posit that the anthropomorphizing tendencies of such religion will not be overcome in the near future, partly because the categories of the supernatural are too well suited to our current attitude toward nature: Westernized societies tend to view nature as something to be used, not something to feel religious awe towards.

With the development of scientific thought and the discoveries in evolution, physics, etc. have come challenges to the Christian worldview. Over time, various ideas on how to reconcile these scientific truths with theological truths of the doctrines of Christianity. There is the once-popular [[clockwork universe]] theory, which states that God made the universe to run its course mechanically predetermined; however, this has lost popularity after more discoveries about the probabilistic nature of the universe. There is also the idea that God interferes supernaturally in ways that mask the presence of the supernatural—perhaps at the quantum level where scientists cannot precisely determine anything. This tends toward making a joke of everything scientists strive for.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brun, Rudolf B. "Strict Naturalism And Christianity: Attempt At Drafting An Updated Theology Of Nature." ''Zygon'' 42.3 (2007): 701-713. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 29 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation, one where both truths may be simultaneous and coterminous comes from the [[New Testament]] quote "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."&lt;ref&gt;''John. The Holy Bible, New International Version: Containing the Old Testament and the New Testament''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan Bible, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be interpreted as saying that the Word of God is not God, but the perfect expression of God that is God and is not God but brings forth creation. In the words of Rudolf Brun "The Christian revelation about creation does not proclaim that creation is an extension or a function embedded in God. Rather, the Word of God that is and remains God is given away to creation. It is a gift that empowers creation to become itself." This allows God to be all things ([[pantheism]]) and in all things ([[panentheism]]) without either of those cases being true. It allows Christian belief in God to be worked into a worldview where there is no predetermined path for the cosmos, because God so loved the world that the Word was given freely to become nature in all its creativity and freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Taoism ===
"The term [[Tao]] means "way", "path", or "principle", and can also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than [[Taoism]]. In Taoism, however, Tao denotes something that is both the source of, and the force behind, everything that exists. Taoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school, but in general they tend to emphasize [[Wu wei|Wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility."&lt;ref name="spiritualnaturalistsociety.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritualnaturalistsociety.org/about-us/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/|title=The Spiritual Naturalist Society|author=|date=|website=The Spiritual Naturalist Society|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Though Tao is ultimately transcendent, it is also immanent. In this secondary sense it is the way of the universe, the norm, the rhythm, the driving power in all nature, the ordering principle behind all life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions|last = Smith|first = Huston|publisher = San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco|year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Tao can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao. 
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.
As the origin of heaven-and-earth, it is nameless:
As the "Mother" of all Things it is nameable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tao Te Ching|last = Laozi|first = and D.C Lau|publisher = Chinese University Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Hong Kong|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
"In a way, Spiritual Naturalism could be looked at as a form of [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical Buddhism]]. There are many [[Schools of Buddhism|schools and ways of conceiving of Buddhism and practicing it]]. Many of Buddhism's concepts can be interpreted in naturalistic terms. Buddhism has certainly inspired the Spiritual Naturalist practices of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], [[mindfulness]], [[Ahimsa|compassion]], and more. Therefore, there is much overlap and many people are both Buddhists and Spiritual Naturalists".&lt;ref name="spiritualnaturalistsociety.org"/&gt; The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] are rooted in right relationship between the devotee, morality, and practices that align with naturalism.

'''Stephen David Ross''' (born 1935) is an American philosopher, currently Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture and of Comparative Literature at [[Binghamton University]]. He has published over 30 books in interdisciplinary philosophy, especially on art, literature, ethics, and metaphysics, from American pragmatism through poststructuralism, from human beings to animals and things.

==Biography==
He was born May 4, 1935 to Allan Ross and Bessie Schlosberg. He studied mathematics at [[Columbia University]] where he received an MA in 1957, and a PhD in philosophy in 1961. He taught philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Colorado in Boulder before moving to [[Binghamton University]]/[[State University of New York]] in 1967. He married Marilyn Gaddis Rose in 1968.

He spent the rest of his teaching career in Binghamton where he helped create two interdisciplinary PhD programs, one in Philosophy, Literature, and the Theory of Criticism in the Department of Comparative Literature, the second in Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture (PIC), located first in the Department of Philosophy, later becoming an independent program. He was appointed Distinguished Professor of Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture and of Comparative Literature in 2006. He is currently Alfred North Whitehead Fellow in the [[European Graduate School]], Saas-Fee, Switzerland. He was editor of the journal [[International Studies in Philosophy]] from 1979-2011.

==Work==
His career has been devoted to different possibilities of expressing and living with uncertain beliefs, unsettled experiences, and inexhaustible realities. He has explored different forms of writing and varied terminologies for expressing what resists expression, based on the conviction that such a resistance requires constant vigilance and innovative writing, the constant production and transformation of forms of knowledge, especially including philosophy, whose relations to art, literature, science, and religion enrich it profoundly with novel and imaginative questions and answers.

He began in American pragmatism, reading it to question itself fundamentally and to entail the ''inexhaustibility'' of nature and reason, the [[:wikt:mystery|mysteriousness]] of things. He wrote several books on ordinality and an ''ordinal metaphysics'', influenced by his mentor, [[Justus Buchler]]. He turned then to [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and his notion of prehension or perspective. A universe of orders composed of orders composing other orders, of perspectives, is an inexhaustible universe without totality. Everything is limited, including every limit, an inexhaustible play of limit and unlimit.

In 2002 he came to believe that such a sense of inexhaustibility required a very different style of writing, more literary and oblique, and found this in post-Heideggerian writings, especially [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Deleuze and Guattari]]. ''The Ring of Representation'' was written in sonorous and voiced verbs—ringing, sounding—avoiding all forms of the verb "to be" so as to question the question of Being.

An ongoing theme throughout his work was that of an infinite ethics, infinite in each decision and inclusive of all things. This led him to Levinas's notions of ''betrayal'' and ''generosity'', two notions that would deeply influence his writing. Betraying contains a double meaning, violation and revelation. He linked it with [[Anaximander]]'s notion of injustice in all things, later defining it as the nonidentity of every identity with itself, a systematic and pervasive sense of how nature and reason exceed themselves, with evolution a foremost example of the first, art and literature of the second.

This was followed by seven volumes on gifts and generosity, undercutting the sense of possessing and having that color traditional views of knowledge, truth, and being. Then followed explorations of images in philosophy and art, understanding the world as images, a different way of thinking of perspectives. Images proliferate from other images, revealing and betraying them. This double movement of betraying led to books on enchantment and [[disenchantment]], on asking and telling, to a novel, returning to an infinite and inclusive ethics through animals and other things.

These all express a sense of unceasing [[question]]ing, and questioning that questioning, that he suggests is profoundly ethical: ethical fullness.

'''Steve William Fuller''' (born 12 July 1959) is an American philosopher-sociologist in the field of [[science and technology studies]].  He has published in the areas of [[social epistemology]], [[academic freedom]], and the subjects of [[intelligent design]] and [[transhumanism]].

==Biography==

Fuller attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=4 August 2014|last=Fuller|first=Steve |title=Science vs. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution |page=9|url= https://books.google.com/?id=1P22AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |date= 2007|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745673493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admitted as a John Jay Scholar to [[Columbia University]], he majored in History and Sociology and graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1979. Awarded a [[Kellett Fellowship]], he studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], and received an M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1981. He earned his Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985, where he was an Andrew Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow. Fuller's doctoral dissertation, "Bounded Rationality in Law and Science", explored the implications of the views of [[Herbert A. Simon]] for political theory and philosophy of science.

Fuller held assistant and associate professorships at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1994, he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the [[University of Durham]], [[England]]. He moved in 1999 to the [[University of Warwick]], England. In July 2007 Fuller was awarded a [[D. Litt.]] by Warwick in recognition of "published work or papers which demonstrate a high standard of important original work forming a major contribution to a subject".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/higher_doctorates_for/  Higher Doctorates for Warwick People], [[University of Warwick]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Fuller served as President of the Sociology section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In that capacity, he staged a play, "Lincoln and Darwin—Live for One Night Only!", at the BA's annual Festival of Science in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403503 |title=On stage, On the Origin ... author endures a dramatic trial of faith |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was later produced as a podcast in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |title=Lincoln and Darwin for one night only |publisher=Sci Phi Journal |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215015/http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller has been a visiting professor in Denmark, Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden (where he held a Fulbright Professorship in 1995 at Gothenburg University), and the United States (UCLA).&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/academicstaff/sfuller/fullers_index/cv/ |title=curriculum vitae |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022061915/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/academicstaff/sfuller/fullers_index/cv/ |archivedate=22 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Fuller became a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas. In 2011, the University of Warwick appointed him to the [[Auguste Comte]] Chair in Social Epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/steve_fuller_social_epistemology/ |title=Professor Steve Fuller appointed to Auguste Comte Chair in Social Epistemology |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Fuller was appointed a Fellow of the UK [[Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/warwickpeople/acss_three_awards |title=Academy of Social Sciences appoints three Warwick Academicians |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was appointed to an Honorary Professorship at [[Dalian University of Technology]], China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.dlut.edu.cn/article/2012/0524/42609.shtml (in Chinese)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528165211/http://news.dlut.edu.cn/article/2012/0524/42609.shtml |date=28 May 2012 }}.

==Work==
Fuller is most closely associated with [[social epistemology]] as an interdisciplinary research program. Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the first book (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].

Along with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on "Science's Social Standing".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Since moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: "I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ... In sum: this book offers only a cartoon opposition of a fake 'Popper' to a fake 'Kuhn.'"&lt;ref name="2005Read"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Read | first = Rupert | title = Book review: How and how not to write on a "legendary" philosopher | journal = [[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 369–387 | doi = 10.1177/0048393105279925 | date = September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller responded, coining the word "Kuhnenstein" (Kuhn + Wittgenstein) to capture Read's view of Kuhn, which Fuller calls a "figment of Read's – and other's – fertile imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fuller | first = Steve | title = Kuhnenstein: or, the importance of being read | journal = [[Philosophy of the Social Sciences (journal)|Philosophy of the Social Sciences]] | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 480–498 | doi = 10.1177/0048393105280868 | date = December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Intellectual'' was selected as a Book of the Year in 2005 by the UK liberal-left magazine, ''New Statesman''. He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate, associated with George Soros' Open Society project, which appears in several languages in newspapers across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/search?search_string=Steve+Fuller&amp;languageid=1&amp;rm=search&amp;submit=submit&amp;submit.x=17&amp;submit.y=13 Project Syndicate]. Project Syndicate. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he also taught a course on the epistemology of journalism at an international summer school at the [[University of Lund]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html The Epistemology of Journalism Course Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118133435/http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html |date=18 November 2006 }}, [[University of Lund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic freedom===

Fuller believes (modeled on what he takes to be the German model) that [[academic freedom]] is a freedom reserved for academics, not a special case of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = Steve | last2 = Haworth | first2 = Alan | title = Academic freedom | journal = [[The Philosophers' Magazine]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–77 | doi = 10.5840/tpm20073864 | date = 2007 }} Debating the [http://www.afaf.org.uk/afaf-statement/ "statement of academic freedom"] made by Academics for Academic Freedom (AFAF).&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the right to "cause reasoned offence", if within the terms of reason and evidence appropriate to the academic profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/against-the-grain-it-is-an-academics-right-to-cause-reasoned-offence-455905.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Against the grain: It is an academic's right to cause 'reasoned' offence | first=Nick | last=Jackson | date=5 July 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes it important for academics to be able to express intellectual opinions for further debate which can result in progress. He also argues that students are equally entitled to academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410297 |title=A clear and present danger |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===
Fuller has made many statements about his support for [[intelligent design]] (ID) and authored two books on the subject. In 2005, in the case of ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design. The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as "naive" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843–853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller has said that he does not support intelligent design "but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|publisher=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&amp;sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Social constructionism and postmodernism|social constructionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Fuller.cfm Steve Fuller and The Hidden Agenda of Social Constructivism], Norman Levitt, Talk Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2007, Fuller debated [[Lewis Wolpert]] at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] on whether evolution and intelligent design should be accorded equal status as scientific theories. Fuller supported the proposition. Fuller endorsed a work in support of Intelligent Design, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s textbook ''[[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreevolution.com/endorsements.php Endorsements], [[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism|Explore Evolution]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in the 2008 film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', Fuller told an interviewer:&lt;ref name=expelled&gt;''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed'' (2008 film). Rocky Mountain Pictures. Directed by Nathan Frankowski.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If you take seriously that evolution has to do with the transition of life forms, and that life and death are just natural processes, then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia. All of those kinds of ideas seem to me follow very naturally from a Darwinian perspective – a deprivileging of human beings, basically. And I think people who want to endorse Darwinism have to take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.}}

Fuller openly acknowledges that while some people simply do not like or accept either 'design in nature' or that human beings were created "in the image and likeness of God" (''imago Dei''), many people do and that it has been a consistent fixture in the progress, development and motivation for doing modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ51gVtJAw | first=Steve | last=Fuller |title="Why some people like the idea of design in nature and others don't" |work=University of Cambridge, |date=14 July 2012 |accessdate= 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhumanism===
Much of his work focuses on questions around technological enhancements and how they can improve the capacities of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/fuller/ Steve Fuller]. Ieet.org. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller argues that the pursuit for enhancements is based on a need ″to create some distance between ourselves and the other animals.″ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | first=Kevin | last=Holmes | title = Talking to the future humans – Steve Fuller | url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/talking-to-the-future-humans-steve-fuller-transhumanism | work=Vice Media | date= 29 September 2011 | accessdate= 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect "to re-engineer the human body to enable us to live longer so as to work and play harder." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Humanity 2.0|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230233423|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==

===''Science Vs Religion?''===
In 2007, Fuller wrote ''Science Vs Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution''. In addition to introductory and conclusionary chapters, it has chapters on the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]], the thesis that modern science has its basis in an attempt by humanity to transcend itself and reach God, how Fuller believes complexity distinguishes ID from "other versions of creationism", legal issues, and the future of "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887 Review of ''Science Vs Religion?''], Sahotra Sarkar, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]], [[Norman Levitt]] in a review described it as "a truly miserable piece of work, crammed with errors scientific, historical, and even theological".&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature | title=Norman Levitt Deconstructs Steve Fuller's Postmodernist Critique of Evolution  | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]] |date=19 December 2007  | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt took issue with the following points:&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"/&gt; 
*Fuller's acceptance at face value of [[William Dembski]]'s claims on complexity and randomness, and his failure to come to grips with the wealth of results that this field has generated and with the trenchant criticism of Dembski's claims (or even to describe these claims accurately);
*Fuller's disparagement of [[evolutionary biology]], without doing "serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself" on which to base it;
*Fuller's misrepresentation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s religious beliefs in order to make a point that is in fact antithetical to Newton's views;
Levitt infers that Fuller's views arise from an "animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority [that] still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature The Painful Elaboration of the Fatuous], Norman Levitt, eSkeptic, [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Fuller later responded to these points, accusing Levitt of axe-grinding and questioning his understanding of the book, which Fuller claimed was less a defense of contemporary intelligent design theory than a demonstration of its rootedness in the history of science. Fuller also claims that Levitt misquotes one of the three passages Levitt cites from the book, making it mean the opposite of the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-01-16.html#feature Steve Fuller Responds to Norman Levitt's Review of ''Science v. Religion''] E-Skeptic, 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt subsequently responded at length to Fuller, concluding that "Fuller's misreading of the politics that generated and sustains the ID movement is so complete as to constitute a peculiar pathology all its own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-01-23.html#response Norman Levitt Responds to Steve Fuller] E-Skeptic, 23 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller has long been highly critical of the views of science of his opponents in the [[Science Wars]], including  Levitt, dating back at least to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=154395&amp;sectioncode=26|title=In Snow's shoes |publisher=THES|date=11 November 1994|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Can Science Studies be Spoken in a Civil Tongue?'', S Fuller, Social Studies of Science, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sahotra Sarkar]], a philosophy professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/profiles/Sarkar/Sahotra/ Sahotra Sarkar] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20051215051045/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/profiles/Sarkar/Sahotra/ |date=15 December 2005 }}, Department of Philosophy, [[University of Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt; and integrative biologist&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/ib/faculty/indexb.html Faculty], Section of Integrative Biology, [[University of Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] also criticised Fuller's book for presenting an "analysis of the intellectual disputes over contemporary ID creationism [that] is almost vacuous".&lt;ref name="2008Sarkar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887 | title=Science v. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution | publisher=Philosophical Reviews |date=7 August 2008 | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkar further states that the book has an idiosyncratic interpretation of the [[history of philosophy]], including of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and of [[logical positivism]]; having a limited grasp of the [[history of science]], including making claims about [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]], [[Lamarck]], [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], Pearson and [[Galton]] that are not supported by their writings; failure to engage the "debate over naturalism that ID creationism has generated" with "remarks on supernaturalism [that show] him to be equally non-cognizant of the work of ... Philip Johnson"; and other scientific errors.&lt;ref name="2008Sarkar"/&gt;

===''Dissent Over Descent''===
In 2008 Fuller's book on the intelligent design controversy, ''Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism'' was published. Steven Poole of [[The Guardian]] wrote: "book is an epoch-hopping parade of straw men, incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish, as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to "action at a distance", except that the distance is in time rather than space. It's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview7 | title=Trivial pursuits Steve Fuller's Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism  | publisher=The Guardian |date=12 July 2008  | first=Steven | last=Poole | accessdate =10 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]], Philosopher of Science at [[Florida State University]] wrote in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that Fuller's book "is completely wrong and is backed by no sound scholarship whatsoever. In at least one case, Fuller makes his case by an egregious misreading—of something I wrote about the role of genetic drift in Sewall Wright's shifting balance theory. For the record, Charles Darwin set out to provide a cause, what he called—following his mentors like William Whewell (who in turn referred back to Newton)—a true cause or ''vera causa''. Darwin felt, and historians and philosophers of science as well as practicing evolutionary biologists still feel, that he succeeded…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/322/5898/47.pdf |format=PDF| title=A Challenge Standing on Shaky Clay  | publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 October 2008  | first=Michael | last=Ruse   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a "book of the week" review by retired Divinity Professor [[Keith Ward]] in the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]],'' the book was praised for providing often overlooked information and provocative interpretations, but was criticised for a number of inaccuracies and misrepresentations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=402929 The book of the week: Dissent over Descent], [[Times Higher Education Supplement]], 24 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]], in [[New Humanist]], wrote that the book contains a "mark of ignorance and historical short-sightedness on Fuller's part".&lt;ref name="2008NewHumanist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1856| title=Origin of the specious | publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=A.C. | last= Grayling  | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fuller wrote an online response saying "if Grayling's grasp of the history of science went beyond head-banging standards, he would realise that our current level of scientific achievement would never have been reached, and more importantly that we would not be striving to achieve more, had chance-based explanations dominated over the design-based ones in our thinking about reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1880 | title=Against the faith | publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=Steve | last=Fuller | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To which Grayling wrote: "Steve Fuller complains, as do all authors whose books are panned, that I did not read his book properly (or at all)."&lt;ref name="2008NewHumanistWeb"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1881 | title=Bolus of nonsense| publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=A.C. | last= Grayling  | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "I'll take on Fuller any day regarding the history and theology of the various versions of Christianity with which humanity has been burdened. […] The same applies to the history of science."&lt;ref name="2008NewHumanistWeb"/&gt;

'''Supererogation''' ([[Latin|Late Latin]]: ''supererogatio'' "payment beyond what is due or asked", from ''super'' "beyond" and ''erogare'' "to pay out, expend", itself from ''ex'' "out" and ''rogare'' "to ask") is the performance of more than is asked for; the action of doing more than [[duty]] requires. In [[ethics]], an act is '''supererogatory''' if it is good but not morally required to be done. It refers to an act that is more than is necessary, when another course of action—involving less—would still be an acceptable action. It differs from a duty, which is an act wrong not to do, and from acts morally neutral. Supererogation may be considered as performing above and beyond a normative course of duty to further benefits and functionality.

==In Catholicism==
In the [[theology]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], "works of supererogation" (also called "acts of supererogation") are those performed beyond what God requires. For example, in [[1 Corinthians 7]], [[Paul the Apostle]] says that while everyone is free to marry, it is better to refrain from marriage and remain celibate to better serve God. The Roman Catholic Church holds that the [[counsels of perfection]] are supererogatory acts, which specific [[Christian]]s may engage in above their moral duties. Similarly, it teaches that to determine how to act, one must engage in reasonable efforts to be sure of what the right actions are; after the reasonable action, the person is in a state of [[vincible ignorance|invincible ignorance]] and guiltless of wrongdoing, but to undertake more than reasonable actions to overcome ignorance is supererogatory, and praiseworthy.

According to the classic teaching on [[indulgence]]s, the works of supererogation performed by all the saints form a treasure with God, the "[[treasury of merit,]]" which the church can apply to exempt [[repentance (Christianity)|repentant]] sinners from the works of [[penance|penitence]] that would otherwise be required of them to achieve full reconciliation with the church.

==In Protestantism==
[[Martin Luther]]'s opposition of this teaching seeded the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Church of England]] denied the doctrine of supererogation in the fourteenth of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], which states that works of supererogation

cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer_(ECUSA)/Historical_Documents_of_the_Church/Articles_of_Religion Book of Common Prayer (ECUSA)/Historical Documents of the Church/Articles of Religion. XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later Protestant movements followed suit, such as in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-articles-of-religion-of-the-methodist-church The Methodist Articles of Religion/Doctrinal Standards of The United Methodist Church/Articles of Religion. XI. Of Works of Supererogation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
A [[Muslim]] must complete a minimum of the [[Salah#The Five Daily Prayers|five daily prayers]], each typically lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes. Supererogatory prayers beyond these are known as [[Nafl prayer|nafl]] prayers, and praying them is considered to bear additional reward. There are also several other supererogatory acts in [[Islam]], such as fasting outside of the month of [[Ramadhan]], or giving [[sadaqah]] (charity, consisting of simple acts of kindness to financial assistance) that is not obligatory.

==Discussion==
Whether an act is supererogatory or obligatory can be debated. In many schools of thought, donating money to [[Charitable organization|charity]] is supererogatory. In other schools of thought that regard some level of charitable donation to be duty (such as with the [[tithe]] in [[Judaism]], [[zakat]] in Islam, and similar standards in many Christian sects), only exceeding a certain level of donation (e.g. going above the common 2.5%-of-capital-assets standard in zakat) would count as supererogatory.

In [[criminal law]], it may be observed that state prohibitions on killing, stealing, and so on derive from the state's duty to protect one's own citizens. However, a nation state has no duty to protect the citizens of an adjacent nation from crime. To send a [[peacekeeping]] force into another country would be — in the view of the nation doing it — supererogatory.

Some schools of ethics do not include supererogatory acts. In [[utilitarianism]], an act can only be better because it would bring more good to a greater number, and in that case it becomes a duty, not a supererogatory act. The lack of a notion of supererogation in utilitarianism and related schools leads to the [[demandingness objection]], arguing that these schools are too ethically demanding, requiring unreasonable acts.

'''''The Eighth Day''''' is the second book of Dr. [[Euler Renato Westphal]], originally published in Portuguese with the title '''''O Oitavo Dia: Na era da seleção natural'''''.

In the second book of Dr. Euler Westphal, professor of [[Systematic Theology]] and Ethical Issues, the Brazilian researcher analyses the scientific and technological advancement to propose a multidisciplinary dialogue about [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Termo casamento não cabe na relação homossexual http://elistas.alcnoticias.org/lista/portugues_alc/archivo/indice/921/msg/881/&lt;/ref&gt;

This book is at the basis of the curriculum of the Interdisciplinarity Seminarium of the Lutheran School of Theology in São Bento do Sul, Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Curriculum of Euler Westphal http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.jsp?id=K4796349P9&amp;tipo=completo&amp;idiomaExibicao=1 / FLT Curriculum http://www.flt.edu.br/bacharelado/Grade%20Curricular%20Curso%20de%20Teologia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It's also an important book in the discussion of the Theology as a science, and its relationship with other sciences particularly Biology, and Philosophical Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph von Sinner. Teologia como ciência. http://www3.est.edu.br/publicacoes/estudos_teologicos/vol4702_2007/ET2007-2d_rvsinner.pdf / Derval Dasílio. RETORNEMOS AO PASTOR QUE APASCENTA A VIDA. http://derv.wordpress.com/page/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

He finds on the post-modern thinking and its concepts of performativity, utility, and lucrativity, and the [[Bauhaus]] model of bricolage a new scientific paradigm. The post-modern paradigm broke with the modern paradigm of rationality.&lt;ref&gt;WESTPHAL, Euler R. O Oitavo Dia: Na era da seleção natural, pages 5ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[post-modernism]] look at the nature as a good thing when it is useful to the humankind, because science and human power are coincident. In the post-modern religion the eschatological and messianic hope is no more in Jesus Christ, but in the efforts to find out a possibility to immortality, good wealth and eternal life through genetical improvement. The wishes of the post-modern man are to reach the perfect human being, the great wealth, without illness and death, the [[brave new world]].&lt;ref&gt;Id. Ibid, pages 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

When science becomes religion and the scientists become priests the humankind starts a new age of totalitarianism of science. The reality of the Almighty God, Creator and Redeemer, is no more recognized by post-modern man, who now adopt the performativity and lucrativity as a new dogma of scientific religion. [[Predestination]] is no more a Christian dogma but a concept of biotechnology. The scientist can see, as a small-great-god, who is predestined by the genetic code to develop an illness, like a cancer. Therefore, the scientist became the one who can choose life or death for a new life under formation.&lt;ref&gt;Id. Ibid, pages 40ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
88
There are many risks on see the science as a religion. Or to put the science as criteria of truth, specially this kind of science that has on post-modern thinking its epistemological base. The practice of get patents of living being its one of these kinds of risks. When an economical group has the patent of a soy bean, than the farmers cannot produce soy without pay royalties to the company that has the patent rights. So poor people at south countries will have their free access to seeds for planting not allowed, in consequence they will not have food for their countries.&lt;ref&gt;Id. Ibid, pages 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioethics is multidisciplinary subject, it dialogues with different ethical issues like philosophical ethics, medical ethics, theological ethics and so one. [[Theology]] can give its contribution on situations like abort, euthanasia, research with living beings. The Christian faith can recover the respect with life and its mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Id. Ibid, pages 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eighth Day the human being has created the brave new world. The little-man-god redesigned the life beings and the human being as image and likeness of the Market-God's utilitarists interests. We need to give the appropriate place to the creation and to the human beings as creation of the Triune God. All things are maintained by the presence of His Holy Spirit. Humility of the science will guarantee that science still be science and not became a religion that promise eternal life, immortality and salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Id. Ibid, pages 110ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tres Dias Con Dios==
In 2012, Tres Dias launched its Spanish-speaking set of weekends - called Tres Dias Con Dios. Normally conducted in English, if hosted in the United States, Tres Dias con Dios is conducted entirely in Spanish throughout the three-day event.

The first [[Tres Dias Con Dios]] weekend was held in Southeast TN, called Southeast TN Tres Dias con Dios—Three Days with God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14503">'''Use-of-force law in Missouri''' refers to the law &amp; [[legal doctrine]] which determine whether a member of law enforcement in the state of Missouri is justified in the amount of force used to gain control of an unruly situation or person, including situations involving death.  In the [[United States]], doctrine about use of force is primarily defined by the individual states, although there have been some [[Use of force|Supreme Court decisions]] of limited scope.

[[Missouri|Missouri's]] legal experts have said the use of force laws in Missouri are considered more officer-friendly than that in other states.&lt;ref name=WSJFerguson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Ashby|title=Why Ferguson Officer Wasn't Charged: A Look at 'Use of Force' Doctrine|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/11/24/why-ferguson-officer-wasnt-charged-a-look-at-use-of-force-doctrine/|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=Wall Street Journal (Law Blog)|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such laws have come under national scrutiny in the wake of the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=CBSAfterFergusson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Condon|first1=Stephen|title=After Ferguson, can the use of force by police be addressed?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-ferguson-what-can-be-done-about-the-use-of-force-by-police/|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=CBS News|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current law governing use of force is specified in Missouri Revised Statutes chapter 563,&lt;ref name=563.046.2&gt;Missouri General Assembly (1977).

== Background ==

=== Use of force ===
{{main|Use of force}}
In the course of their duties, law enforcement personnel use force to subdue suspects. The use of force consists of two parts: the amount of force that may lawfully be used on a [[Use of force continuum|continuum]] that includes [[deadly force]]; and the circumstances under which it may be used, including the level of imminent threat reasonably perceived by the member of law enforcement and the concern that a [[Fleeing felon rule|fleeing felon]] may harm the public.&lt;ref name=DEADLYFORCEUSATODAY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keefe|first1=Brendan|title=Ferguson shooting highlights deadly force laws|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/12/deadly-force-laws-missouri-illinois/18919563/|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=USA Today|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctrines are intended to balance security needs with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects. In the event that members of the public are injured, this may give rise to issues of [[self-defense (theory)|self-defense]] as a [[excuse|justification]].&lt;ref name=NYTWhatHappened&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buchanan|first1=Larry|author9=Ford Fessenden|author2=K.K. Rebecca Lai|author3=Haeyoun Park|author4=Alicia Parlapiano|author5=Archie Tse|author6=Tim Wallace|author7=Derek Watkins|author8=Karen Yourish|title=What Happened in Ferguson?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=New York Times|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of death during a reasonable use of force, this may be legally considered a [[justifiable homicide]]. The application of excessive force is considered [[Police brutality]].&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cassens Weiss|first1=Debra|title=Missouri's 'officer-friendly' use-of-force law likely helped Ferguson officer avoid charges|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/missouris_officer_friendly_use_of_force_doctrine_likely_helped_ferguson_off|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=ABA Journal|publisher=American Bar Association|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of force national guidelines ===
[[State police (United States)|State police in the United States]] are generally given considerable leeway in making the decision about the amount of force needed to save themselves or others. While there is no national definition, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has created legal standards for use of force through two key decisions. "Objective reasonableness" is a concept from the 1985 ''[[Tennessee v.

== Missouri doctrine ==
{{section or|date=December 2014}}
[[List of law enforcement agencies in Missouri|Law enforcement agencies in Missouri]] exist at the town, county, and state levels and are subject to national guidelines, state laws, and applicable local or county policies. Use of force doctrine is defined in Missouri by state law as well as local policy.&lt;ref name=WSJFerguson /&gt; From the 1860s, when Missouri became a state, until the 1960s, individual states wrote their own codes, often using [[common law]] as a basis. In 1962, the [[Model Penal Code]] was published with recommendations to modernize and standardize penal law and [[criminal law of the United States|criminal law]] nationally.&lt;ref name=MPC&gt;[[Sanford H. Kadish]], "Codifiers of the Criminal Law: Wechsler's Predecessors", 78 ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'' 1098 (v.78, n.5, June 1978) and Monrad G. Paulsen and [[Sanford H. Kadish]], "Criminal Law and Its Processes" , 77 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' 790 (v.77, n.4, February 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The code served and continues to serve as a basis for the replacement of existing criminal codes in over two-thirds of the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law Basics|url=http://www.mojolaw.com/info/cl014|publisher=Mojo Law|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri did not incorporate the recommendations.&lt;ref name=KentLaw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Popek|first1=Karen A.|title=Unconstitutional Use of Deadly Force by the Police, The|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|date=January 1979|volume=55|issue=2|url=http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2327&amp;context=cklawreview|accessdate=25 November 2014|publisher=IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes concerning use of force in Missouri included the stipulation that police officers could use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect of a felony including the event that the felony was not of a violent nature, such as a crime against property. In 1977, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] struck down these statutes in ''Mattis v. R Schnarr''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]|title = 547 F. 2d 1007 - Mattis v.

| accessdate = 2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that the Missouri statute authorizing the use of deadly force by police attempting to arrest any fleeing felon was unconstitutional as "an arbitrary imposition of death" and violation of [[due process]].&lt;ref name=KentLaw /&gt;

In ''Tennessee v. Garner'', Justice [[Byron White|White]] wrote for the [[Majority opinion]] addressing the legal issue as whether the totality of the circumstances justified the deadly force. Because it deprives the suspect of his life, White concluded that deadly force should be applied only when there is a "[[reasonable suspicion]]" that a suspect is armed or dangerous. The legal concept derives from a prior decision in ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968) where court recognized law enforcement's right to stop a possible suspect for a brief time and take additional steps to investigate further.&lt;ref&gt;
For the Court in ''[[Berkemer v. McCarty]]'' 468 U.S. 420 (1984), [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]] wrote
:"the usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called '''Terry'' stop,' see ''Terry v. Ohio'', 392 U.S. 1 (1968)" (468 U.S. at 439)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Graham v. Connor, a similar finding was held; ""the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation."&lt;ref name=SentUseofFoce /&gt; Although Missouri statute still stated that law enforcement could use force including deadly force on any suspect that "has attempted to commit or has committed a felony," the concept of reasonableness was included.&lt;ref name=STLouisNPR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Darren|author2=Chad Flanders|title=Missouri's Use Of Force Statute Goes Against Constitutional Rulings|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/commentary-missouris-use-force-statute-goes-against-constitutional-rulings|accessdate=25 November 2014|work=St Louis Public Radio|agency=National Public Radio|date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...An officer may only use deadly force as permitted by other justifications such a self defense or when he reasonably believes that such use of deadly force is immediately necessary to effect the arrest and also reasonably believes that the person to be arrested a)Has committed or attempted to commit a felony; or b)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">The '''volunteer's dilemma''' [[game theory|game]] models a situation in which each of X players faces the decision of either making a small sacrifice from which all will benefit, or [[free rider problem|freeriding]]. 

One example is a scenario in which the electricity has gone out for an entire neighborhood. All inhabitants know that the electricity company will fix the problem as long as at least one person calls to notify them, at some cost. If no one volunteers, the worst possible outcome is obtained for all participants. If any one person elects to volunteer, the rest benefit by not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Poundstone |title=Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |isbn=0-385-41580-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[public good]] is only produced if at least one person volunteers to pay an arbitrary cost. In this game, bystanders decide independently on whether to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the group. Because the volunteer receives no benefit, there is a greater incentive for freeriding than to sacrifice oneself for the group. If no one volunteers, everyone loses. The social phenomena of the [[bystander effect]] and [[diffusion of responsibility]] heavily relate to the volunteer’s dilemma.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Payoff matrix==
The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

{| border cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center"&gt;
|+ Volunteer's dilemma payoff matrix (example)
|
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|at least one other person cooperates 
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|all others defect
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|cooperate
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|defect
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;−10&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|}
When the volunteer's dilemma takes place between only two players, the game gets the character of the game '[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]'.
As seen by the payoff matrix, there is no dominant strategy in the volunteer’s dilemma.  In a mixed-strategy [[Nash equilibrium]], an increase in N players will decrease the likelihood that at least one person volunteers, which is a result of the [[bystander effect]].

==Examples in real life==
===The murder of Kitty Genovese===
The story of [[Kitty Genovese]] is often cited as an example of the volunteer's dilemma. Genovese was stabbed to death outside her apartment building in Queens, New York, in 1964. According to a highly influential ''New York Times'' account, dozens of people witnessed the assault but did not get involved because they thought others would contact the police anyway and did not want to incur the personal cost of getting involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weesie |first=Jeroen |year=1993 |title=Asymmetry and Timing in the Volunteer's Dilemma |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=569–590 |jstor=174269 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations have shown the original account to have been unfounded, and although it inspired sound scientific research, its use as a simplistic parable in psychology textbooks has been criticized.&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Manning| first = R. |author2=Levine, M |author3=Collins, A.| title = The Kitty Genovese murder and the social psychology of helping: The parable of the 38 witnesses| journal = [[American Psychologist]]| volume = 62| issue = 6| pages = 555–562|date=September 2007

===The meerkat===
The [[meerkat]] exhibits the volunteer's dilemma in nature. One or more meerkats act as sentries while the others forage for food. If a predator approaches, the sentry meerkat lets out a warning call so the others can burrow to safety. However, the altruism of this meerkat puts it at risk of being discovered by the predator.

'''Waidan''', translated as '''external alchemy''' or '''external elixir''', is the early branch of [[Chinese alchemy]] that focuses upon compounding [[Elixir of life|elixirs of immortality]] by heating minerals, metals, and other natural substances in a [[lute (material)|luted]] [[crucible]]. The later branch of esoteric ''[[neidan]]'' "inner alchemy", which borrowed doctrines and vocabulary from exoteric ''waidan'', is based on allegorically producing elixirs within the practitioner's body, through [[Daoist meditation]], [[Taoist diet|diet]], and physiological practices. The practice of ''waidan'' external alchemy originated in the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), grew in popularity until the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907) when ''neidan'' began and several emperors died from [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning|alchemical elixir poisoning]], and gradually declined until the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). 

==Terminology==
The Chinese [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''wàidān'' combines the common word ''wài'' [[wikt:外|外]] "outside; exterior; external" with ''dān'' [[wikt:丹|丹]] "cinnabar; vermillion; elixir; alchemy". The [[antonym]] of ''wài'' is ''nèi'' [[wikt:內|內]] meaning "inside; inner; internal", and the term ''wàidān'' 外丹 "external elixir/alchemy" was coined in connection with the complementary term ''nèidān'' "internal elixir/alchemy".

The [[sinologist]] and expert on Chinese alchemy [[Fabrizio Pregadio]] lists four generally accepted meanings of ''dan'': "The color cinnabar, scarlet, or light scarlet", "The mineral cinnabar, defined as 'a red stone formed by the combination of quicksilver and sulphur'", "Sincerity (corresponding to ''danxin'' 丹心)", and "An essence obtained by the refining of a medicinal substance; a refined medicinal substance, the so-called medicine of the seekers of immortality for avoiding aging and death; a term often used for matters concerning the immortal". Pregadio concludes that the [[semantic field]] of the word ''dan'' evolves from a root-meaning of "essence", and its connotations include "the reality, principle, or true nature of an entity or its essential part, and by extension the cognate notions of oneness, authenticity, sincerity, lack of artifice, simplicity, and concentration." (2006: 68-70).

The date for the earliest use of the term ''waidan'' is unclear. It occurs in [[Du Guangting]]'s 901 ''Daode zhenjing guangshengyi'' 道德真經廣聖義 (Explications Expanding on the Sages [Commentaries] on the ''Daodejing''), which is quoted in the 978 ''[[Taiping guangji]]''. Liu Xiyue's 劉希岳 988 ''Taixuan langranzi jindao shi'' 太玄朗然子進道詩 (Master Taixuan Langran's Poems on Advancing in the Dao) has the earliest mention of both the terms ''neidan'' and ''waidan'' (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 174, 178, 180).

''Jindan zhi dao'' 金丹之道 (Way of the Golden Elixir) was a classical name for ''waidan'' alchemy, and ''wàidān shù'' 外丹術 (with [[wikt:術|術]] "art; skill; technique; method") is the [[Modern Standard Chinese]] term.

==History==
[[Joseph Needham]], the eminent historian of [[History of science and technology in China|science and technology]] divided Chinese alchemy into the "golden age" (400-800) from the end of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] to late [[Tang dynasty]] (1976: 117-166) and the "silver age" (800-1300) from late Tang to the end of the [[Song dynasty]] (1976: 167-207). Furthermore, Fabrizio Pregadio uses "golden age" in specific reference to the Tang period (2014: 25)

The extant Chinese alchemical literature comprises about 100 sources preserved in the ''[[Daozang|Daoist Canon]]''. These texts show that while early ''waidan'' was mainly concerned with the performance of ceremonies and other ritual actions addressed to gods and demons, a shift occurred around the 6th or 7th century to the later tradition that used alchemical symbolism to represent the origins and functioning of the cosmos, which played a crucial role in the development of ''neidan'' (Pregadio 2008: 2002).

===Early references===
Little is known about the origins of alchemy in China. The historian and sinologist [[Nathan Sivin]] gives an approximate timeline: the Chinese belief in the possibility of physical immortality began around the 8th century BCE, the acceptance that immortality was attainable by taking herbal drugs started in the 4th century BCE, but the uncertain date when the idea that immortality drugs could be made through alchemy rather than found in nature was no later than the 2nd century BCE (1968: 25). Despite a later tradition that [[Zou Yan]] (c. 305-240 BCE), founder of the [[School of Yin Yang]], was an early alchemist, his biography does not mention alchemy, and no ''waidan'' text is attributed to him (Pregadio 2006: 5).

The sinologist [[Homer H. Dubs]] proposed that the earliest historical allusion to Chinese alchemy was in 144 BCE, but other scholars are doubtful. [[Emperor Jing of Han]]'s 144 BCE anti-[[Coining (mint)|coining]] edict "established a statute (fixing) public execution for (privately) coining of cash or counterfeiting gold" that Dubs believes also made alchemy illegal (tr. Dubs 1947: 63). However, Jing's imperial decree did not ban making alchemical elixirs but rather privately coining money; the commentary of [[Ying Shao]] (140-206 CE) explains how it abrogated the 175 BCE edict by the previous [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]] that allowed people to cast coins without authorization (Pregadio 2000: 166).

The first historically reliable mention of alchemy in China concerns [[Li Shaojun]], a ''[[fangshi]]'' "masters of methods" who suggested around 133 BCE that [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87) should prepare for the ''feng'' 封 and ''shan'' 禪 state rituals to Heaven and Earth by performing an alchemical method of transmuting cinnabar into gold (Pregadio 2008: 1002). According to the c. 94 BCE ''[[Shiji]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shaojun told the Emperor: "By making offerings to the stove (''zao''), one can summon the supernatural beings (''wu''). If one summons them, cinnabar can be transmuted into gold. When gold has been produced and made into vessels for eating and drinking, one can prolong one’s life. If one’s life is prolonged, one will be able to meet the immortals of the [[Mount Penglai|Penglai Island]] in the midst of the sea. When one has seen them and has performed the ''feng'' and ''shan'' ceremonies, one will never die. The Yellow Emperor did just so. Your subject formerly, when sailing on the sea, encountered Master Anqi (Anqi Sheng), who feeds on jujube-dates as large as melons. Master Anqi is an immortal who roams about Penglai; when it pleases him to appear to humans, he does so, otherwise he remains invisible." Thereupon the Emperor for the first time personally made offerings to the stove. He sent some ''fangshi'' to the sea to search for the legendary Penglai and for alchemists who could transmute cinnabar and other substances into gold. (tr. Pregadio 2006: 10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Li Shaojun's immortality elixir in this passage was not meant to be consumed, but used to cast alchemical gold cups and dishes that would supposedly prolong the emperor's life to the point that he could perform the [[thaumaturgic]] and ritual prerequisites to ultimately become immortal (Sivin 1968: 25). 

Although [[Liu An]]'s c. 120 BCE ''[[Huainanzi]]'' does not explicitly refer to alchemy, it does have a passage on the natural evolution of minerals and metals in the earth, which became a prominent idea in later ''waidan'' cosmological texts. They state that elixir compounding reproduces the process through which nature spontaneously transmutes minerals and metals into gold, but alchemy accelerates it by compressing or "manipulating" (Sivin 1977) the centuries of time that the natural process requires, using ''huohou'' 火 候 "fire times" to match cycles of different lengths (Pregadio 2000: 184). The ''Huainanzi'' context lists ''[[Wu Xing|wu-xing]]'' "Five Phases/Elements" correlations for colors, minerals, and metals. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''qi'' of balanced earth is received into the yellow heaven, which after five hundred years engenders a yellow jade [possibly realgar or amber]. After five hundred years this engenders a yellow quicksilver, which after five hundred years engenders gold ["yellow metal"]. After one thousand years, gold engenders the yellow dragon. The yellow dragon, going into hiding, engenders the yellow springs. When the dust from the yellow springs rises to become a yellow cloud, the rubbing together of yin and yang makes thunder; their rising and spreading out make lightning. What has ascended then descends as a flow of water that collects in the yellow sea. (tr. Major et al. 2010: 170)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For each of the Five Colors (yellow, [[Blue–green distinction in language|bluegreen]], vermillion, white, and black), the ''Huainanzi'' transmutation process involves a corresponding mineral, quicksilver (using the archaic name ''hòng'' 澒 for ''gǒng'' 汞 "mercury; quicksilver"), and metal (''jīn'' 金). The other four colored metamorphoses are bluegreen malachite-quicksilver-lead, vermillion cinnabar-quicksilver-copper, white arsenolite-quicksilver-silver, and black slate-quicksilver-iron. According to Dubs, this passage omits mentioning alchemy because of its illegality, accounts for common alchemical ingredients like quicksilver, and comes from the School of Yin-Yang and perhaps even Zou Yan himself (1947: 70, 73). Major says it is considered to be "China's oldest statement of the principles of alchemy" (2010: 152).

The c. 60 BCE ''[[Yantie lun]]'' (Discourses on Salt and Iron) has the earliest reference to the ingestion of alchemical elixirs in a context criticizing [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s patronage of anyone who claimed to know immortality techniques (Sivin 1968: 26). "At that time, the masters (''shi'') of Yan and Qi set aside their hoes and digging sticks and competed to make themselves heard on the subject of immortals and magicians. Consequently the ''fangshi'' who headed for [the Qin capital] Xianyang numbered in the thousands. They asserted that the immortals had eaten of gold and drunk of pearl; after this had been done, their lives would last as long as Heaven and Earth." (tr. Pregadio 2006: 31).

The erudite Han official [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-6 BCE) attempted and failed to compound alchemical gold. The ''[[Hanshu]]'' says that in 61 BCE [[Emperor Xuan of Han|Emperor Xuan]] became interested in immortality and employed numerous ''fangshi'' specialists to recreate the sacrifices and techniques used by his great-grandfather [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]]. In 60 BCE, Liu Xiang presented the emperor with a rare alchemical book entitled ''Hongbao yuanbi shu'' 鴻寳苑祕術 (Arts from the Garden of Secrets of the Great Treasure)–which had supposedly belonged to the ''Huainanzi'' compiler Liu An–that described "divine immortals and the art of inducing spiritual beings to make gold" and Zou Yan's ''chongdao'' 重道 "recipe for prolonging life by a repeated method [of transmutation]" (tr. Dubs 1947: 75). The ''chongdao'' context is also translated as "a method of repeated (transmutation)" (Needham et al. 1976: 14), or reading ''zhongdao'' as "important methods by Zou Yan for prolonging life" (Pregadio 2006: 27). Emperor Xuan commissioned Liu Xiang to produce alchemical gold, but he was ultimately unsuccessful despite having access to the best available alchemical texts in the imperial library, the expertise of numerous ''fangshi'' and metallurgist assistants, and unlimited imperial resources. In 56 BCE, the emperor ordered Liu to be executed yet later reduced the sentence. Dubs concludes that a "more complete and adequate test of alchemy could not have been made" (1947: 77).

===First texts===
The oldest extant Chinese alchemistic texts, comprising the Taiqing corpus, ''Cantong qi'', and ''Baopuzi'', date from circa the 2nd to 4th centuries.

The Daoist Taiqing 太清 (Great Clarity) tradition produced the earliest known textual corpus related to ''waidan''. Its main scriptures were the ''Taiqing jing'' 太清經 (Scripture of Great Clarity), the ''Jiudan jing'' 九丹經 (Scripture of the Nine Elixirs), and the ''Jinye jing'' 金液經 (Scripture of the Golden Fluid), which early sources say were revealed to the Han ''fangshi'' [[Zuo Ci]] at the end of the 2nd century. Both the ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (below) and the received versions of these scriptures in the Daoist Canon show that the Taiqing tradition developed in [[Jiangnan]] (lit. "south of the [[Yangtze]] river") in close relation to local exorcistic and ritual practices (Pregadio 2008: 1002-1003).

The ''[[Zhouyi Cantong Qi]]'' (Token for the Agreement of the Three According to the ''Book of Changes'') or ''[[Cantong qi]]'', is traditionally considered the earliest Chinese book on alchemy. Its original version is attributed to [[Wei Boyang]] in the mid-2nd century, but the [[received text]] was augmented during the [[Six Dynasties]] (220-589) period. Unlike the earlier Taiqing tradition, which focuses on ritual, the ''Cantong qi'' is based on correlative cosmology and uses philosophical, astronomical, and alchemical emblems to describe the relation of the Dao to the universe. For instance, the two main emblems are ''zhengong'' 真汞 (Real Mercury) and ''zhenqian'' 真鉛 (Real Lead), respectively corresponding to Original Yin and Original Yang (Pregadio 2008: 1003). This choice of mercury and lead as the prime ingredients for elixir alchemy limited later potential experiments and resulted in numerous cases of poisoning. It is quite possible that "many of the most brilliant and creative alchemists fell victim to their own experiments by taking dangerous elixirs" (Needham et al. 1976: 74). The new ''Cantong qi'' view of the alchemical process not only influenced the later development of ''waidan'', but also paved the way for the rise of ''neidan''. From the Tang period onward, the ''Cantong qi'' became main scripture of both ''waidan'' and ''neidan'' alchemies.

The Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 318-330 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' devotes two of its twenty chapters to ''waidan'' alchemy. Chapter 4 ''Jindan'' 金丹 "Gold and Cinnabar" focuses on the Taiqing corpus, whose methods are mostly based on minerals, and Chapter 16 ''Huangbai'' 黃白 "The Yellow and the White" contains formulas centered on metals (Pregadio 2000: 167). Ge Hong says that the ritual context of the two sets of practices was similar, but the scriptures were transmitted by different lineages (Ware l966: 261). In addition, the ''Baopuzi'' quotes, summarizes, or mentions many other ''waidan'' methods, often from unknown sources (Needham et al.1976: 81-113). 

Chapter 4 "Gold and Cinnabar" (Ware 1966: 68-96) provides a variety of formulas for elixirs of immortality. Most of them involve ''[[Shijie (Daoism)|shijie]]'' 尸解 "liberation from the corpse", which generates "a new physical but immortal self (embodying the old personality) that leaves the adept's corpse like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis", and is verifiable when the corpse, light in weight as an empty cocoon, did not decay after death. Many ''Baopuzi'' elixirs are based on arsenic and mercury compounds, which have "excellent embalming properties" (Sivin 1968: 41). Some less effective elixirs only provide longevity, cure disease, or allow the adept to perform miracles. The ''Baoppuzi'' lists a total of 56 chemical preparations and elixirs, 8 of which were poisonous, with hallucinations from [[mercury poisoning]] the most commonly reported symptom (Needham et al. 1976: 89-96).

''Baopuzi'' Chapter 16 "The Yellow and the White" (Ware 1966: 261-278) records several methods for preparing artificial alchemical gold and silver, which when ingested will provide immortality. It also includes a few elixir formulas with effects such as providing invulnerability or reversing the course of a stream (Sivin 1968: 42). Ge Hong emphasizes that ''waidan'' alchemy grants access to higher spiritual realms and is therefore superior to other practices such as healing, exorcism, and meditation (Pregadio 2000: 168).

===Golden age===
What Needham calls the "[[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of Chinese alchemy" (c. 400-800) was from the end of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] to the late [[Tang dynasty]].

The Daoist scholar and alchemist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536) was a founder of the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] (Highest Clarity) and the compiler-editor of the basic "Shangqing revelations" purportedly dictated to [[Yang Xi]] by Daoist deities between 364 and 370 (Pregadio 2008: 1002). Many of these revealed texts described immortality elixirs, and Tao incorporated the core ''Taiqing'' (Great Clarity) alchemical texts into the Shangqing corpus, marking the first encounter between ''waidan'' and an established Daoist movement. Although the Shangqing texts used the ''waidan'' process mainly as a support for meditation and visualization practices, the language, techniques, and rituals in these works are mostly identical with those of the Taiqing corpus (Pregadio 2000: 168). Tao was commissioned by [[Emperor Wu of Liang]] to experiment with ''waidan'' alchemy and produce elixirs, but only achieved limited success.

The decline of the original Taiqing tradition resulted in a tendency to focus the alchemical process on two major methods: refining cinnabar into mercury and compounding lead with mercury. Advocates of the cinnabar-mercury ''waidan'' methods, such as the 8th-century alchemist Chen Shaowei 陳少微, described producing quicksilver in cosmological terms, without any reference to the ''Cantong qi'' system. During the Tang dynasty, the lead-mercury tradition based on the ''Cantong qi'' acquired importance, and ''waidan'' alchemy was transformed from an instrument for communicating with supernatural beings to a support for intellectualizing  philosophical principles (Pregadio 2000: 170). Several works related to the ''Cantong qi'' rejected cinnabar-mercury methods with the rationale that ''yang'' cinnabar and ''yin'' mercury alone cannot produce the true elixir. Historically, the lead-mercury theory became the predominant method (Pregadio 2008: 1003).

The Tang period is also known for intensified imperial patronage of ''waidan'', even though elixir poisoning caused the death of Emperors [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] (r. 840-846), [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] (r. 846-859), and likely also [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Xianzong]] (r. 805-820) and [[Emperor Muzong of Tang|Muzong]] (r. 829-824) (Pregadio 2008: 1003). While elixir poisoning is sometimes designated as a reason for the decline of ''waidan'' after the Tang, the shift to ''neidan'' was the result of a much longer and more complex process. ''Waidan'' and early ''neidan'' developed together throughout the Tang and were closely interrelated (Needham and Lu 1983, 218-229).

===Silver age===
Needham's "[[silver age]] of Chinese alchemy" (c. 800-1300) was from the late Tang to the end of the [[Song dynasty]]. During the Tang, ''waidan'' literature gradually changed from emphasizing ritual practices to cosmological principles. Early Taiqing tradition texts stress the performance of alchemical rites and ceremonies when compounding, and describe elixirs as tools for either summoning benevolent gods or expelling malicious spirits. Most post-Tang ''waidan'' texts related to ''Cantong qi'' alchemy stress the cosmological significance of elixir compounding and employ numerous abstract notions (Pregadio 2000: 179). After the late Tang period, ''waidan'' gradually declined and the [[soteriological]] immortality significance of alchemy was transferred to ''neidan'' (Pregadio 2008: 1003).

Imperial interest in alchemy continued during the Song dynasty (960-1279). [[Emperor Zhenzong]] (r. 997-1022) established a laboratory in the Imperial Academy, where the Daoist alchemist Wang Jie 王捷 "produced and presented to the throne artificial gold and silver amounting to many tens of thousands (of cash), brilliant and glittering beyond all ordinary treasures" (tr. Needham 1976: 186). 

Most ''waidan'' sources dating from the Song and later periods are either anthologies of earlier writings or deal with metallurgical techniques (Pregadio 2008: 1003). ''Waidan'' alchemy subsequently declined in the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1974: 208-219).

==Laboratory and instruments ==
Chinese descriptions of alchemical [[Laboratory#Equipment and supplies|laboratory equipment]] vary among texts and traditions, but share some common terminology. The following outline concerns alchemical hardware rather than liturgical or magical artifacts such as the sword, [[Chinese sun and moon mirrors|sun and moon mirrors]], and [[Spiritual warfare in China|peach-wood]] talismans.

The alchemy laboratory was called the Chamber of Elixirs (''danshi'' 丹室, ''danwu'' 丹屋, or ''danfang'' 丹房). Sources differ about how to construct one. One text says the Chamber is ideally built near a mountain stream on in a secluded place (compare a [[clandestine drug lab]]), and has two doors, facing east and south; another says it should never be built over an old well or tomb, and has doors facing in all directions except north (Pregadio 2000: 188).

A layered "[[workbench|laboratory bench]]" called ''tan'' 壇 "altar; platform" was placed either in the center or along a wall of the Chamber (Sivin 1980: 10). It was commonly depicted as a three-tiered clay stove platform, with eight ventilating openings on each tier—8 [[Chinese Numerology#Eight|numerologically]] signifying ''bafang'' 八方 (lit. "eight directions") "eight points of the compass; all directions" (Pregadio 2000: 188). The alchemist's heating apparatus, interchangeably called ''lu'' 爐 "stove; furnace" or ''zao'' 竈 "(kitchen) stove", was placed on the highest tier of the ''tan'' platform. Owing to inconsistent textual terminology, it translates as [[stove]] or [[furnace]] in some sources and as [[oven]] or [[combustion chamber]] in others (Sivin 1980: 11). Depending upon the alchemical formula, [[rice hulls]], charcoal, or horse manure served as fuel.

A ''waidan'' alchemical ''fu'' 釜 "crucible; cauldron" was placed over the ''zao'' stove or sometimes inside it. The ''shuangfu'' 雙釜 "double crucible" was commonly made of red clay and had two halves joined to each other by their mouths (Pregadio 2000: 189). Another type of crucible had an iron lower half and clay upper one (Sivin 1968: 166-168). After placing the ingredients in a crucible, the alchemist would hermetically seal it by applying several layers of a [[Lute (material)|lute]] clay preparation inside and outside. The classic alchemical luting mixture was ''liuyini'' 六一泥 Six-and-One Mud with seven ingredients, typically alum, Turkestan rock salt (''rongyan'' 戎鹽), lake salt, [[arsenolite]], oyster shells, red clay, and talc (Pregadio 2000: 189).

[[File:Liu Ding.jpg|thumb|A bronze ritual ''ding'' from the late [[Shang Dynasty]].]]
Two common types of open alchemical [[reaction vessel]]s were called ''ding'' 鼎 "tripod; container; cauldron" and ''gui'' 匱 "box; casing; container; [[aludel]]" (Sivin 1980: 16). ''[[Ding (vessel)|Ding]]'' 鼎 originally named a "tripod cauldron" [[Chinese ritual bronze]], but alchemists used the term (and ''dingqi'' 鼎器) in reference to numerous metal or clay instruments with different shapes and functions (Pregadio 2000: 189). ''Ding'' generally named both pots and various other reaction vessels to which fire was applied externally—as distinguished from ''lu'' that contained fire within (Sivin 1980: 16). ''Gui'' 匱 (an old character for ''gui'' 櫃 "cupboard; cabinet") was an alchemical name for a reaction vessel casing that was placed within a reaction chamber. Broadly speaking, ''gui'' had lids while ''ding'' were open at the top (Sivin 1980: 18).

Besides the more open bowl-like or crucible forms of reaction vessels, whether lidded or not, many kinds of sealed containers were employed. Two common ones were the ''shenshi'' 神室 (lit. "divine chamber") corresponding to the aludel subliming pot used in [[Arabic alchemy]], and the ''yaofu'' 藥釜 "pyx; bomb" vessel composed of two roughly hemispherical crucible-like bowls with flanges placed mouth to mouth (Sivin 1980: 22).

In addition to these basic tools, the alchemical apparatus also includes both common utensils (like mortars and pestles) and various specialized laboratory instruments for steaming, condensation, [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], distillation, and extraction (Sivin 1980: 26-103).
