{{Elections in Mississippi}}

The '''2018 United States Senate special election in Mississippi''' took place on November 6, 2018, to elect a [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]]. The election was held to fill the seat vacated by Senator [[Thad Cochran]] when he resigned from the Senate, effective April 1, 2018, due to health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/05/mississippi-senator-thad-cochran-announces-he-is-stepping-down|title=Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran announces he is stepping down|last=Jacobs|first=Ben|date=March 5, 2018|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Governor [[Phil Bryant]] appointed [[Cindy Hyde-Smith]] to fill the vacancy created by Cochran's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/mississippi-senate-appointment/index.html|title=Governor picks Cindy Hyde-Smith to replace Cochran|first=Eric Bradner, Kaitlan Collins and Ashley Killough|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde-Smith sought election to serve the balance of Cochran's term, which expires in January 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/08/u-s-chamber-poll-cindy-hyde-smith-leads-mike-espy-chris-mcdaniel/590942002/|title=U.S. Chamber poll shows Cindy Hyde-Smith leading Mike Espy, Chris McDaniel in Senate race|publisher=|accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, per Mississippi law, a nonpartisan top-two special general election took place on the same day as the regularly scheduled [[United States Senate election in Mississippi, 2018|U.S. Senate election]] for the seat currently held by [[Roger Wicker]]. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-things-could-go-wrong-for-republicans-in-mississippis-new-senate-race/|title=How Things Could Go Wrong For Republicans In Mississippi’s New Senate Race|last=Rakich|first=Nathaniel|date=2018-03-06|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two candidates, [[Cindy Hyde-Smith]] and [[Mike Espy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/6000fd9726d34e9cb3c3194e872262cf|title=The Latest: Mississippi has 3 more weeks of US Senate race|date=2018-11-07|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held on November 27, 2018, in which Hyde-Smith defeated Espy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sos.ms.gov/Elections-Voting/Documents/2018%20Website%20Calendar.pdf|title=2018 Elections Calendar – Mississippi Secretary of State|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-28/ap-newsalert-gop-us-sen-cindy-hyde-smith-wins-runoff-in-mississippi-keeps-seat-race-was-rocked-by-her-public-hanging?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google GOP Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith Wins Runoff in Mississippi]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her reasonable margin of victory, Hyde-Smith significantly under-performed the states's partisan lean, as well as the 20-point margin of victory of Roger Wicker in his senatorial election, held concurrently with the first round of the special election in which the combined GOP candidates won 58% to the combined Dem total of 42%. Espy's 46% of the vote is the best Democratic performance in a Mississippi senate election since the [[United States Senate election in Mississippi, 1988|1988 election]].

The victory makes Hyde-Smith the first woman ever elected to the Senate from Mississippi.

==Runoff==
During the run-off campaign, while appearing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], Hyde-Smith said, "If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be in the front row." Hyde-Smith's comment immediately drew harsh criticism, given Mississippi's notorious history of [[lynching]]s and public executions of [[African-American]]s. In response to the criticism, Hyde-Smith downplayed her comment as "an exaggerated expression of regard" and characterized the backlash as "ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2018/11/11/ms-sen-runoff-hyde-smith-jokes-public-hangings-espy-fans-react/1969758002/|title=Hyde-Smith jokes about hangings in viral tweet|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=11 November 2018|publisher=The Clarion Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/nov/11/hyde-smiths-public-hanging-quip-bombs-state-most-l/|title=Hyde-Smith's 'Public Hanging' Quip Bombs in State with Most Lynchings|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=11 November 2018|publisher=Jackson Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/gop-senator-cindy-hyde-smith-made-public-hanging-joke.html|title=Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith Joked About Going to a 'Public Hanging'|last1=Danner|first1=Chas|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=11 November 2018|publisher=New York Media LLC|agency=The Intelligencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wlbt.com/2018/11/11/video-cindy-hyde-smith-jokes-about-sitting-front-row-public-hanging/|title=VIDEO: Cindy Hyde-Smith jokes about sitting in "front row" of "public hanging"|last1=McCarthy|first1=Waverly|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=11 November 2018|publisher=WLBT License Subsidiary, LLC|agency=WLBT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/12/politics/gop-senator-hyde-smith-public-hanging-mississippi|title=GOP Mississippi senator facing criticism over comment about 'public hanging'|last1=Sullivan|first1=Kate|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018|publisher=Cable News Network|agency=Turner Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cindy-hyde-smiths-democratic-opponent-mike-espy-slams-public-hanging-remark-as-reprehensible|title=Sen.

Hyde-Smith joined Mississippi Governor [[Phil Bryant]] at a news conference in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] on November 12, 2018, where she was asked repeatedly about her comment by reporters. In the footage, Hyde-Smith adamantly refused to provide any substantive answer to reporters' questions, responding on five occasions with variations of, "I put out a statement yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGc_249TRAs|title=Senator deflects over 'public hanging' comment|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=13 November 2018|publisher=Cable News Network|agency=Turner Broadcasting System}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/mississippi-gop-sen-cindy-hyde-smith-mum-public-hanging-remark-n935396|title=Mississippi GOP Sen.

__NOTOC__
Year '''466 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Priscus and Albinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 288 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 466 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* [[Kimon]] carries the war against [[Persia]] into [[Asia Minor]] and wins the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] in [[Pamphylia]]. This is a decisive defeat of the Persians as Kimon's land and sea forces capture the Persian camp and destroy or capture the entire Persian fleet of 200 [[trireme]]s (manned by [[Phoenicia]]ns). Many new allies of [[Athens]] are now recruited, such as the trading city of [[Phaselis]] on the [[Lycia]]n-Pamphylian border.

==== Italy ====
* The [[Tyrant]], [[Thrasybulus of Syracuse|Thrasybulus]], is driven out by the citizens of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Sicily]]. The city moves to a democratic system of government.
* The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[colony]] of [[Taranto|Taras]], in [[Magna Graecia]], is defeated by the native population of [[Apulia]]. As a result, the Tarentine [[monarchy]] falls, with the installation of a [[democracy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6851">[[Image:Boon Island Lighthouse, Maine.jpg|thumb|right|Boon Island Light in 1911]]
'''Boon Island''' is a barren piece of land located in the [[Gulf of Maine]] 6&amp;nbsp;miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) off the town of [[York, Maine|York]] on the [[Maine]] coast. The island is approximately 300 by 700&amp;nbsp;feet (90 by 210&amp;nbsp;m) in size at low tide, and is the site of [[Boon Island Light]], the tallest [[lighthouse]] in [[New England]].

It is often said that the island got its name when the coastal trading vessel, the ''Increase'', wrecked on it in the summer of 1682. Four survivors — three white men and one [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] — spent a month on the island, subsisting on [[fish]] and [[seagull|gulls']] eggs. One day they saw smoke rising from [[Agamenticus|Mount Agamenticus]] several miles away in York, so they built a fire to attract attention to their plight. The Indians at Mount Agamenticus saw the smoke from the island and the [[castaway]]s were soon rescued. Seeing their survival as a boon granted by God, the men are  said to have dubbed it Boon Island.  It's a good story but in fact John Winthrop mentions in his journal  passing by Boon Island by name some eighty years earlier.  [[Celia Thaxter]] called the ironically named Boon Island "the forlornest place that can be imagined."

More famous was the shipwreck on December 11, 1710, of the [[British people|British]] [[merchant ship]], ''Nottingham Galley''. All fourteen crewmen aboard survived the initial wreck, however two died from their injuries - the cook, who died a few days after the initial wreck, and a carpenter, who died two weeks after - and another two drowned attempting to reach the mainland on an improvised [[raft]]. The remaining ten crewmen managed to stay alive despite winter conditions with no food and no fire for twenty-four days, until finally rescued. They resorted to [[cannibalism]], eating the Carpenter after his death, which gave the incident a notoriety that it retains even today.

The story also features a conflict between the captain and members of his crew, primarily his first mate, Christopher Langman.  Langman, backed by two of his fellow crew mates, claimed that that Dean turned the ship over to French privateers and then planned to wreck the ship for insurance money.  When his crew learned of this, they mutinied and forced Dean to continue to Boston, resulting in its wreck on Boon Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20101201/NEWS/12010329|title=Historians to mark the 300th anniversary of Boon Island shipwreck|last=Morse|first=Susan|work=seacoastonline.com|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crew also claimed that A vigorous public relations battle ensued in London the following summer between the captain and members of his unhappy crew, which also helped make the story famous in its day.  The harrowing story was fictionalized by [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]] in his 1956 novel ''Boon Island''.  The only non-fiction history of the event, "Boon Island:  A True Story of Mutiny, Shipwreck and Cannibalism," by Andrew Vietze and Stephen Erickson, appeared in 2012.  It is said that after the ''Nottingham Galley '' disaster, local fishermen began leaving barrels of provisions on Boon Island in case of future wrecks.

A wooden day [[beacon]] was erected in 1799 but lasted only five years. Fierce storms repeatedly scour Boon Island, which has an elevation of {{convert|14|ft}} [[above sea level]] at its highest point. Violent seas can heave [[boulder]]s across its surface, demolishing structures. A stone day beacon was constructed. In 1811, a stone lighthouse was built which stood 32&amp;nbsp;feet above the water, then rebuilt in 1831 to stand 49&amp;nbsp;feet. But damage from the elements was relentless. Consequently, in 1854–1855 the tallest lighthouse in [[New England]] was built — 133&amp;nbsp;feet (40&amp;nbsp;m) of massive [[granite]] blocks at a cost of US$25,000. It had a focal plane of 137&amp;nbsp;feet (42&amp;nbsp;m). [[lighthouse keeper|Keepers]] willing to live in such a desolate place were few, arriving and departing in steady succession. Only one man seemed to thrive there; William W. Williams stayed 27&amp;nbsp;years and lived past the age of 90.

In February 1944, the ''Empire Knight'', a 428-foot (130 m) British freight ship, ran aground at Boon Island and later broke into two sections. The stern section, which included the ship's cargo holds, sank in approximately 260&amp;nbsp;feet (80&amp;nbsp;m) of water, one and one half miles (2–3&amp;nbsp;km) from the Island. In August 1990, the [[United States Coast Guard]] became aware of the existence of a plan of stowage dating from 1944 for the ship indicating that 221&amp;nbsp;flasks (7,620&amp;nbsp;kg) of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] may have been loaded onto the vessel. Investigation revealed that such flasks had been placed on the ship but had since deteriorated, releasing the mercury. An estimated 16,000&amp;nbsp;pounds (7¼&amp;nbsp;t) of mercury remain unrecovered and it is believed to have settled in the low point of the cargo hold.

In 1978, two lightkeepers on the island had to retreat from a powerful winter storm. They took shelter in the light chamber while the seas and wind demolished all other structures on the island. Water rose five feet up the tower and dislodged a number of its segments. Next day, they were rescued by [[helicopter]]. The tower was repaired and automated, no longer requiring a resident keeper. It is now powered by [[solar power]].

In May 2000, the U.S. Coast Guard leased Boon Island Lighthouse to the [[American Lighthouse Foundation]] (ALF) for the restoration and preservation of the historic isolated sea sentinel.

In an effort to raise funds to restore and maintain the remote lighthouse, a fictional lighthouse nation declared its independence as The Republic of Boon Island on April 1, 2003.

In 2014 the lighthouse was sold to real estate developer Art Girard. It has since been sold several more times, and is currently own by Boon Island LLC.

The '''Calgary Underground Film Festival''' (CUFF) is a [[film festival]] held annually in [[Calgary, Alberta, Canada]] for 7 days. The 15th CUFF will take place April 16–22, 2018 at Globe Cinema in downtown Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgaryundergroundfilm.org/ Calgary Underground Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2003, Calgary Underground Film Festival is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to programming films that defy convention. Through the screening of contemporary works in various categories that include: feature, documentary, animation and shorts - CUFF brings Calgarians a unique roster of films rarely seen in North American theatres.

CUFF actively look to showcase titles in all genres, from horror, sci-fi and fantasy to comedies, thrillers and music-related films. In addition to finding great films CUFF is committed to introducing audiences to the people behind the lens, by showcasing local and international indie filmmakers. The organizers are proud to contribute to Calgary's thriving arts community and are thrilled to bring innovative and challenging selections to all film enthusiasts.

CUFF currently has two annual festivals. The main Calgary Underground Film Festival runs for 7-days in mid-April; CUFF.Docs International Documentary Festival is in November. In addition, CUFF showcases special event screenings throughout the year.

==Festival awards==

CUFF gathers a panel of local and visiting industry professionals to choose their top picks of the festival. Additionally, at each screening CUFF audiences receive ballots to submit their own festival favourites.

'''Calomel''' is a [[Mercury element|mercury]] [[chloride]] [[mineral]] with [[Chemical formula|formula]] Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see [[mercury(I) chloride]]). The name derives from Greek ''kalos'' (beautiful) and ''melos'' (black) because it turns black on reaction with [[ammonia]]. This was known to [[Alchemy|alchemists]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Calomel occurs as a secondary mineral which forms as an alteration product in mercury deposits. It occurs with [[native mercury]], [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], [[cinnabar]], mercurian [[tetrahedrite]], [[eglestonite]],  [[terlinguaite]], [[montroydite]], [[kleinite]], [[moschelite]], [[kadyrelite]], [[kuzminite]], [[chursinite]], [[kelyanite]], [[calcite]], [[limonite]] and various [[clay minerals]].&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;[http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/calomel.pdf The Handbook of Mineralogy]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is [[Moschellandsburg]], [[Alsenz-Obermoschel]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

==Electrochemistry==
Calomel is used as the interface between metallic mercury and a chloride solution in a [[saturated calomel electrode]], which is used in [[electrochemistry]] to measure [[pH]] and electrical potentials in solutions, In most electrochemical measurements, it is necessary to keep one of the electrodes in an electrochemical cell at a constant potential. This so-called reference electrode allows control of the potential of a working electrode.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2010, p. 291|pages=291–308|access-date=2018-07-10}}. PDF available.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
Calomel was a widespread and popular medicine for administration to infants as a [[purgative]] to treat intestinal worms and "clear out noxious matter" but was used indiscriminately for a great number of ailments. It is tasteless and, mixed with a sweetener, was readily taken. Fumigation tents to supply calomel, heated on a metal plate, as a [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] within children's lungs were a later method of delivery. As the mercury it contained had the effect of softening the gums, it was made the principle constituent of teething powders, until the mid-twentieth century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swiderski |first1=Richard M. |title=Calomel in America : mercurial panacea, war, song and ghosts |date=2009 |publisher=BrownWalker Press |location=Boca Raton, FA |isbn=978-1-59942-467-5 |pages=37–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound is a laxative and once was a common medicine, especially on the [[American frontier]]. It fell out of use at the end of the 19th century due to its [[mercury poisoning|toxicity]]. One victim was [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin Smith]], the eldest brother of [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/environmental-toxins/beautiful-black-poison/ |title=Beautiful Black Poison |last=Schmid |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[Weston A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3336">'''Canadian Wives' Bureau''' was set up in 1944 by the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)]]. A joint effort between Canadian immigration officials, the military, and the [[Canadian Red Cross]], it arranged ship and train travel for [[war bride]]s and dependents to their Canadian husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/welcome-to-the-canadian-wives-bureau|title=Welcome to the Canadian Wives' Bureau|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Maple Leaf Club]] founded in September 1941 was the earliest known club where British wives of Canadians could go to learn about what to expect in their soon-to-be home. It was followed in 1943 by the [[Princess Alice Clubs]]. The Immigration Branch of the [[Department of Mines and Resources]] arranged dependents' travel until August 1944.

== Beginnings ==
The Canadian Wives' Bureau was created to address the need for a consolidated service for war brides and dependants travelling to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/welcome-to-the-canadian-wives-bureau|title=Globe and Mail|last=|first=|date=1943-09-01|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside overseeing the transportation of women and children to Canada, it also supported local war brides associations in England and Scotland between 1944 and 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/pages/war-brides.aspx|title=War Brides|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Department of National Defence (Canada)]] set up the Bureau's office on the third floor of [[Galeries Lafayette]] on [[Regent Street]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadianwarbrides.com/cwb.asp|title=Canadian Wives' Bureau|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
The Canadian Wives' Bureau was established as a directorate of the Adjutant-General's Branch of the Canadian military. They were responsible for arranging dependents' travel to Canada, caring for them en route, and providing information to available services.

War brides' club creation was encouraged by the Canadian Wives' Bureau across the [[United Kingdom]]. By November 1945, there were thirty-two brides' clubs in England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadianwarbrides.com/cwb.asp|title=Canadian Wives' Bureau|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They held social gatherings and talks to discuss Canadian society.

By early 1947, the number of war brides and dependents declined greatly. As a result, the responsibilities were reassigned to the Immigration Branch of the [[Department of Mines and Resources|Department of Mines and Resource]] on February 2, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadianwarbrides.com/cwb.asp|title=Canadian Wives' Bureau|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cascading failure''' is a process in a system of [[interconnection|interconnected]] parts in which the failure of one or few parts can trigger the failure of other parts and so on. Such a failure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission, computer networking, finance, human body systems, and transportation systems.

Cascading failures may occur when one part of the system fails. When this happens, other parts must then compensate for the failed component. This in turn overloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes to fail one after another.

== Cascading failure in power transmission ==

Cascading failure is common in [[power grid]]s when one of the elements fails (completely or partially) and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system.  Those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements.  Cascading failure is a common effect seen in [[high voltage]] systems, where a [[single point of failure]] (SPF) on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system. This surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure, setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time.

This failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and/or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load. For example, under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer.

Monitoring the operation of a system, in [[real-time computing|real-time]], and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade.  Another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures, to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure, and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhai|first1=Chao|title=Modeling and Identification of Worst-Case Cascading Failures in Power Systems|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05232.pdf|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload, i.e. since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed, it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element.

The question if power grid  failures are correlated have been studied in Daqing Li et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daqing|first=Li|last2=Yinan|first2=Jiang|last3=Rui|first3=Kang|last4=Havlin|first4=Shlomo|date=2014-06-20|title=Spatial correlation analysis of cascading failures: Congestions and Blackouts|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05381|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep05381|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E5381D}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Paul DH Hines et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Paul D. H.|last2=Dobson|first2=Ian|last3=Rezaei|first3=Pooya|date=2016|title=Cascading Power Outages Propagate Locally in an Influence Graph that is not the Actual Grid Topology|arxiv=1508.01775|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|pages=1–1|doi=10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2578259|issn=0885-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
Cascading failure caused the following [[power outage]]s:
* [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Blackout in northeast America in 1965]]
* [[1999 Southern Brazil blackout|Blackout in Southern Brazil in 1999]]
* [[Northeast blackout of 2003|Blackout in northeast America in 2003]]
* [[2003 Italy blackout|Blackout in Italy in 2003]]
* [[2003 London blackout|Blackout in London in 2003]]
* [[2006 European blackout|European Blackout in 2006]]
* [[2012 northern India power grid failure|Blackout in northern India in 2012]]
* [[2016 South Australian blackout|Blackout in South Australia in 2016]]

== Cascading failure in computer networks ==

Cascading failures can also occur in [[computer network]]s (such as the [[Internet]]) in which [[Network traffic control|network traffic]] is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software. In this context, the cascading failure is known by the term '''cascade failure'''. A cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems.

The cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single, crucial [[Router (computing)|router]] or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is [[routing|routed]] to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation.

=== Symptoms ===

The symptoms of a cascade failure include: [[packet loss]] and high network [[lag|latency]], not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to [[congestion collapse]], which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication.

If enough routes go down because of a cascade failure, a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes.

A common occurrence during a cascade failure is a '''walking failure''', where sections go down, causing the next section to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This '''ripple''' can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored.

=== History ===

Cascade failures are a relatively recent development, with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks. The term was first applied in this context in the late 1990s by a Dutch IT professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large-scale failure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Example ===

Network failures typically start when a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped. Systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more [[Hop (telecommunications)|hops]] and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered.

This can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down, creating similar problems of their own.

Also, related systems are affected in this case. As an example, [[Domain name system|DNS]] resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another cascade failure all on its own.

In December 2012, a partial loss (40%) of [[GMail]] service occurred globally, for 18 minutes. This loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic—in this case, the error was caused by logic using an [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/why-gmail-went-down-google-misconfigured-chromes-sync-server/ inappropriate ''all'' instead of the more appropriate ''some''.] The cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time.

== Cascading structural failure ==
Certain load-bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the "zipper effect", where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members.  In the case of the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]], a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a [[zipper]]). A bridge that can have such a failure is called [[fracture critical]], and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate [[factor of safety]] and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book| title=To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Structural Design| first=Henry| last=Petroski| year=1992| isbn=978-0-679-73416-1| publisher=Vintage| place=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other examples of cascading failures ==

=== Biology ===
[[Biochemical cascade]]s exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications. One negative example is [[ischemic cascade]], in which a small [[ischemia|ischemic]] attack releases [[toxin]]s which kill off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released. Current research is to find a way to block this cascade in [[stroke]] patients to minimize the damage.

In the study of extinction, sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen. Such a species is known as a [[keystone species]].

=== Electronics ===
Another example is the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]], which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed [[diode]] can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second.

Yet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] in 2001 of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the [[Super-Kamiokande]] experiment, where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction.

=== Finance ===
{{main|Systemic risk}}
In [[finance]], the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as ''[[systemic risk]]:'' the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions (its [[Counterparty|counterparties]]) to fail, cascading throughout the system.&lt;ref name="HuangVodenska2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Xuqing|last2=Vodenska|first2=Irena|last3=Havlin|first3=Shlomo|last4=Stanley|first4=H. Eugene|title=Cascading Failures in Bi-partite Graphs: Model for Systemic Risk Propagation|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|year=2013|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep01219|pmid=23386974|pmc=3564037|arxiv=1210.4973|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1219H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Institutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either "[[too big to fail]]" (TBTF) or "too interconnected to fail" (TICTF), depending on why they appear to pose a threat.

Note however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se, but due to the interconnections.

A related (though distinct) type of cascading failure in finance occurs in the stock market, exemplified by the [[2010 Flash Crash]].

== Interdependent cascading failures ==
[[File:Interdependent-cascading-failures2.png|thumb|305x305px]]
Diverse infrastructures such as water supply, transportation, fuel and power stations are coupled together. Owing to this coupling, interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failure, and in particular to targeted attacks, such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes from one network can produce an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from  Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack|url=http://empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinaldi|first=S.M.|last2=Peerenboom|first2=J.P.|last3=Kelly|first3=T.K.|date=2001|title=Identifying, understanding, and analyzing critical infrastructure interdependencies|url=|journal=IEEE Control Syst.|volume=21|pages=11–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks, and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large-scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. For example, the September 28, 2003 blackout in Italy resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network, health care systems, and financial services and, in addition, severely influenced the communication networks. The partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the power grid management system, thus producing a positive feedback on the power grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=V. Rosato |first=Issacharoff, L., Tiriticco, F., Meloni, S., Porcellinis, S.D., &amp; Setola, R. |title=Modelling interdependent infrastructures using interacting dynamical models |journal=International Journal of Critical Infrastructures |year=2008 |volume=4 |pages=63–79 |url=http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCIS.2008.016092 |doi=10.1504/IJCIS.2008.016092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example emphasizes how inter-dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system. A framework to study the cascading failures between coupled networks  based on percolation theory was developed recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. V. Buldyrev|first=R. Parshani, G. Paul, H.

Furthermore, it was shown that such systems when embedded in space are extremely vulnerable to localized attacks or failures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6945">The '''French hill climb championship''', or '''Championnat de France de la Montagne''' started in 1967 and rapidly became one of the continent's most competitive national series.  For much of its history, the leading cars have been from Formula 2 (later Formula 3000 from 1985) or 2-litre sports cars.  Some F1 cars were seen in the 1960s and occasionally in the 1970s (for example [[Daniel Rouveyran]]'s [[March_Engineering|March]] 721G in 1973) and [[Hervé Bayard]] also tried a Formula 5000 car in the early 1970s.

[[Fraud]] is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The [[PwC]] global [[economic crime]] survey of 2018&lt;ref name="Lavion,  et al. 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lavion |first1=Didier, et al |title=PwC’s Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2018 |url=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/forensics/global-economic-crime-and-fraud-survey-2018.pdf |website=PwC.com |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind. This is an increase from the [https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/economic-crime-survey/pdf/GlobalEconomicCrimeSurvey2016.pdf PwC 2016 study] in which slightly more than a third  of organizations surveyed (36%) had experienced economic crime.

Fraud possibilities co-evolve with technology, esp. [[Information technology]]&lt;ref name="bolton_2002" /&gt; Business reengineering, reorganization or downsizing may weaken or eliminate control, while new [[information system]]s may present additional opportunities to commit fraud.

Traditional methods of [[data analysis]] have long been used to '''detect fraud'''. They require complex and time-consuming investigations that deal with different domains of knowledge like financial, economics, business practices and law. Fraud often consists of many instances or incidents involving repeated transgressions using the same method. Fraud instances can be similar in content and appearance but usually are not identical.&lt;ref name="palshikar_2002" /&gt;

The first industries to use data analysis techniques to prevent fraud were the [[telephone companies]], the [[insurance companies]] and the [[bank]]s (Decker 1998). One early example of successful implementation of data analysis techniques in the banking industry is the FICO Falcon fraud assessment system, which is based on a neural network shell.

Retail industries also suffer from fraud at [[point of sale|POS]]. Some supermarkets have started to make use of digitized [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) together with POS data of most susceptible transactions to fraud.

Internet transactions have recently raised big concerns, with some research showing that internet transaction fraud is 10 times higher than in-store fraud.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Fraud that involves [[cell phone]]s, [[insurance claim]]s, [[tax return]] claims, [[Credit card fraud|credit card transactions]] etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses, but yet detecting and preventing fraud is not a simple task. Fraud is an adaptive crime, so it needs special methods of intelligent data analysis to detect and prevent it. These methods exist in the areas of [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases]] (KDD), [[Data Mining]], [[Machine Learning]] and [[Statistics]]. They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of fraud crimes.

Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="palshikar_2002" /&gt; Examples of statistical data analysis techniques are:
* [[Data preprocessing]] techniques for detection, validation, [[error correction]], and filling up of missing or incorrect data.
* Calculation of various statistical parameters such as [[average]]s, [[quantile]]s, performance metrics, probability distributions, and so on. For example, the averages may include average length of call, average number of calls per month and average delays in bill payment.
* Models and probability distributions of various business activities either in terms of various parameters or probability distributions.
* Computing [[user profile]]s.
* Time-series analysis of time-dependent data.
* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] and [[statistical classification|classification]] to find patterns and [[data association|associations]] among groups of data.
* [[Pattern matching|Matching algorithm]]s to [[Anomaly detection|detect anomalies]] in the behavior of transactions or users as compared to previously known models and profiles. Techniques are also needed to eliminate [[false alarm]]s, estimate risks, and predict future of current transactions or users.

Some [[forensic accountant]]s specialize in [[Computational forensics|forensic analytics]] which is the procurement and analysis of [[Digital data|electronic data]] to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud.  The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) [[data collection]], (b) [[data preparation]], (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting.  For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's [[purchasing card]] activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.  Forensic analytics might be used to review the invoicing activity for a vendor to identify fictitious vendors, and these techniques might also be used by a franchisor to detect fraudulent or erroneous sales reports by the franchisee in a [[franchising]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =  Nigrini| first =  Mark| title = Forensic Analytics: Methods and Techniques for Forensic Accounting Investigations| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.| location = Hoboken, NJ| ISBN = 978-0-470-89046-2| date = June 2011| url =  http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470890460.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraud management is a knowledge-intensive activity. The main AI techniques used for fraud management include:
* [[Data mining]] to classify, cluster, and [[data segmentation|segment]] the data and automatically find associations and rules in the data that may signify interesting patterns, including those related to fraud.
* [[Expert system]]s to encode expertise for detecting fraud in the form of rules.
* [[Pattern recognition]] to detect approximate classes, clusters, or patterns of suspicious behavior either automatically (unsupervised) or to match given inputs.
* Machine learning techniques to automatically identify characteristics of fraud.
* Neural networks that can learn suspicious patterns from samples and used later to detect them.

Other techniques such as [[link analysis]], [[Bayesian networks]], [[decision theory]], and [[Pattern matching|sequence matching]] are also used for fraud detection.&lt;ref name="palshikar_2002" /&gt;

The younger companies in the fraud prevention space tend to rely on systems that have been based around machine learning, rather than later incorporating machine learning into an existing system.

However, multiple security concerns have been raised about how such solutions collect signals for fraud detection and how they are being deployed &lt;ref&gt;Mayank Dhiman [https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/research-papers-mynk/Breaking-Fraud-And-Bot-Detection-Solutions.pdf Breaking Fraud &amp; Bot Detection Solutions] ''OWASP AppSec Cali' 2018'' Retrieved February 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Machine learning and data mining==
{{Main article|Machine learning|Data mining}}

Early data analysis techniques were oriented toward extracting quantitative and statistical data characteristics. These techniques facilitate useful data interpretations and can help to get better insights into the processes behind the data. Although the traditional data analysis techniques can indirectly lead us to knowledge, it is still created by human analysts.&lt;ref name="michalski_1998" /&gt;

To go beyond, a data analysis system has to be equipped with a substantial amount of background knowledge, and be able to perform reasoning tasks involving that knowledge and the data provided.&lt;ref name="michalski_1998" /&gt; In effort to meet this goal, researchers have turned to ideas from the machine learning field. This is a natural source of ideas, since the machine learning task can be described as turning background knowledge and examples (input) [[knowledge extraction|into knowledge]] (output).

If data mining results in discovering meaningful patterns, data turns into information. Information or patterns that are novel, valid and potentially useful are not merely information, but knowledge. One speaks of discovering knowledge, before hidden in the huge amount of data, but now revealed.

The machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions may be classified into two categories: 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning. These methods seek for accounts, customers, suppliers, etc. that behave 'unusually' in order to output suspicion scores, rules or visual anomalies, depending on the method.&lt;ref name="bolton_2002" /&gt;

Whether supervised or unsupervised methods are used, note that the output gives us only an indication of fraud likelihood. No stand alone statistical analysis can assure that a particular object is a fraudulent one, but they can identify them with very high degrees of accuracy. 

=== Supervised learning ===
{{Main article|Supervised learning}}

In supervised learning, a random sub-sample of all records is taken and manually classified as either 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent'. Relatively rare events such as fraud may need to be over sampled to get a big enough sample size.&lt;ref name="dal2014learned" /&gt; These manually classified records are then used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm. After building a model using this training data, the algorithm should be able to classify new records as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Supervised neural networks, fuzzy neural nets, and combinations of neural nets and rules, have been extensively explored and used for detecting fraud in mobile phone networks and financial statement fraud.&lt;ref name="green_1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="estevez_2006" /&gt;

Bayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud.&lt;ref name="Bhowmik"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhowmik|first1=Rekha Bhowmik|title=35    Data Mining Techniques in Fraud Detection|url=http://ojs.jdfsl.org/index.php/jdfsl/article/viewFile/180/108|website=Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law|publisher=University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid knowledge/statistical-based systems, where expert knowledge is integrated with statistical power, use a series of data mining techniques for the purpose of detecting cellular clone fraud. Specifically, a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behaviour from a large database of customer transactions is implemented.&lt;ref name="fawcett_1997" /&gt;

Cahill et al. (2000) design a fraud signature, based on data of fraudulent calls, to detect telecommunications fraud. For scoring a call for fraud its probability under the account signature is compared to its probability under a fraud signature. The fraud signature is updated sequentially, enabling event-driven fraud detection.

[[Link analysis]] comprehends a different approach. It relates known fraudsters to other individuals, using record linkage and social network methods.&lt;ref name="phua_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cortes_2002" /&gt;

This type of detection is only able to detect frauds similar to those which have occurred previously and been classified by a human. To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

===Unsupervised learning===
{{Main article|Unsupervised learning}}

In contrast, unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records.

Some important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand&lt;ref name="bolton_2001" /&gt; use [[Peer Group Analysis]] and [[Break Point Analysis]] applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand&lt;ref name="bolton_2001" /&gt; develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.

Also, Murad and Pinkas&lt;ref name="murad_1999" /&gt; focus on behavioural changes for the purpose of fraud detection and present three-level-profiling. Three-level-profiling method operates at the account level and points to any significant deviation from an account's normal behaviour as a potential fraud. In order to do this, 'normal' profiles are created based on data without fraudulent records (semi supervised). In the same field, also Burge and Shawe-Taylor&lt;ref name="burge_2001" /&gt; use behaviour profiling for the purpose of fraud detection. However, using a recurrent neural network for prototyping calling behaviour, unsupervised learning is applied.

Cox et al.&lt;ref name="cox_1997" /&gt; combines human [[pattern recognition]] skills with automated data algorithms. In their work, information is presented visually by domain-specific interfaces, combining human pattern recognition skills with automated data algorithms (Jans et al.)&lt;!--http://www.acc.ncku.edu.tw/chinese/faculty/shulc/courses/cas/articles/internal-fraud-risk-reduction.pdf ? --&gt;.

The '''Eccentrik Festival''' is an annual 3-day [[Gothic rock|Goth]] and [[industrial music]] [[festival]] held in the [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] area and has in some years been spread out between several different venues. The festival started in October 2004. Musical styles typically featured at Eccentrik include [[deathrock]], [[psychobilly]], [[gothic rock]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[post-punk]], [[dark cabaret]], [[steampunk]], [[synthpop]] and other related genres. The festival is also notable for its party-like atmosphere, the pre-festival meet n' greet, art show, and a dancefloor featuring goth, deathrock, industrial, steampunk and post-punk djs from around the US.

In 2008, the Eccentrik Festival went [[steampunk]] by asking some of the most well-known musicians in that genre to perform, as well as having the Davenport sisters of the weekly radio program, [[The Clockwork Cabaret]], act as hosts for the event.

'''Expo 2020''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;إكسبو&lt;/big&gt; ٢٠٢٠}}) is a [[World Expo]] to be hosted by [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], opening on October 20, 2020. The [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) general assembly in [[Paris]] awarded Dubai as the host on November 27, 2013.

==Parameters==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
As a World Expo, it may be a maximum of six months in length and adhere to a wide universal theme that applies to all humanity. Past themes of Universal Expositions include "Man and His World" [[Montreal]] [[Expo 67]], "Leisure in the Age of Technology" [[Brisbane]] [[Expo 88]] and "Discovery" [[Seville]] [[Seville Expo '92|Expo 92]].

==Organization==
The main site of Expo Dubai 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1083 acres) located between Dubai and Abu Dhabi cities, near [[Dubai emirate]]'s western border with [[Abu Dhabi emirate]].
The master plan, designed by the American firm [[HOK (firm)|HOK]], is organized around a central plaza, entitled ''Al Wasl'', enclosed by three large pavilions which will be built by Al-Futtaim Carillion, each one dedicated to a sub-theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inexhibit.com/seed/expo-dubai-2020-a-preview |title=EXPO Dubai 2020 – a preview |publisher=Inexhibit magazine |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217022200/https://www.inexhibit.com/seed/expo-dubai-2020-a-preview |archivedate=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dubai has also been emphasizing on investments in various sectors such as economic growth, real estate, environmental avenues and public affairs. In recent times, Dubai has made major investments in Real Estate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagraj|first=Aarti|title=Dubai Properties launches two-tower project|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/dubai-properties-launches-two-tower-project-business-bay/|accessdate=30 May 2016|publisher=Gulf Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as introduced a world’s largest Solar Power Project which is all set to start by Expo 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagraj|first=Aarti|title=Dubai launches world’s largest concentrated solar power project|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/dewa-launches-worlds-largest-concentrated-solar-power-project/|accessdate=2 June 2016|publisher=Gulf Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from pumping money, the nation is also keen on giving equal prominence to public relationships.

There are reports which have analysed the recent economic downturn and predict that World Expo 2020 Dubai will lead to a property bubble, which might have far reaching consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batrawy|first=Aya|title=Dubai world Expo bid stirs worry of second bubble|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20131125/ml--dubai-world-s-fair-fears/?ir=homepage|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the expo has been very quiet recently and like many other projects in Dubai, some expo projects are cancelled. In other words the hype has died. &lt;ref&gt; https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DV7bvalswuM  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Bids and bidding==
Once  the first city had lodged a bid with the BIE, other cities had six months to respond. In early 2011, Izmir of Turkey and Ayutthaya of Thailand submitted bids to the BIE, initiating the six-month window for other cities to bid. When this window closed on 2 November 2011, there were five prospective cities, with Dubai making a last minute entry. The BIE voted and selected the host city on 27 November 2013.

Five cities originally bid for the slot for a world's fair in 2020, with four remaining: Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Yekaterinburg, Russia; Izmir, Turkey; or São Paulo, Brazil. Expo 2020 will represent a first as a Middle Eastern destination will be hosting the event for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expomuseum.com/2020/ |title=ExpoMuseum / Expo 2020, Ayutthaya, Thailand; Dubai, USA; Izmir, Turkey; Sao Paulo, Brazil; or Yekaterinburg, Russia |publisher=Expomuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cities lodged bids to the BIE for hosting the 2020 EXPO:
* {{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Izmir]], [[Turkey]]

São Paulo was eliminated from contention after the first round of votes. Izmir was knocked out in the second. Yekaterinburg lost to Dubai in the third and final round of voting.

===Dubai Expo===
UAE selected the theme "Connecting Minds, Creating the Future", sub-themes being Sustainability, Mobility and Opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Maeve Hosea |url=http://vision.ae/en/articles/expo_2020_dubai_celebrates_in_style |title=Dubai World Expo 2020: Dubai celebrates in style |website=vision.ae |publisher=Vision Magazine |date=2013-11-28 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum January 2015|url=http://vision.ae/en/articles/world_expo_from_vision_to_victory |title=Dubai World Expo 2020: From vision to victory |website=vision.ae |publisher=Vision Magazine |date=January 2014 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In today’s highly interconnected world, a renewed vision of progress and development based on shared purpose and commitment is key. While a married human mind, an individual country, or a specific community is both unique and remarkable, it is by working collaboratively that we truly advance." Dubai Ruler [[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] said in support of the bid.

The World Expo in Dubai in 2020 will be the first to be held in the [[MENA]] &amp; SA (Middle East and North Africa &amp; South Asia) region.
On 27 November 2013, when Dubai won the right to host the expo 2020, fireworks erupted at the world's tallest building, [[Burj Khalifa]]. A national holiday was declared the following day for all educational institutions across the country. The Dubai Ruler promised Dubai would "astonish the world," in 2020. The staging of the world fair and the preparations leading up to it are expected to result in 277,000 new jobs in the UAE, an injection of nearly $40 billion into the economy, and an increase in visitors of at least 25 million and up to 100 million.&lt;ref name="Expo 2020 Dubai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dubai wins right to host Expo 2020|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/dubai-expo-2020-would-support-277-000-jobs-1.1181465|accessdate=28 November 2013|publisher=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director General of Dubai Municipality, Hussain Nasser Lootah, said that they have the largest laboratory in the region, and can easily research new materials and technologies required for construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/business/economy-finance/dubai-is-ready-to-deal-with-expo-2020-construction-boom-lootah-2014-11-19-1.570636 |title=Dubai is ready to deal with Expo 2020 construction boom: Lootah - Emirates 24&amp;#124;7 |work=Emirates247.com |date=2014-11-19 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's tallest commercial tower to be built in Dubai, in [[Jumeirah Lake Towers]], was given the name "Burj 2020" in honour of the World Expo 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmcc.ae/content-page?Turner-to-Project-Manage-Burj2020&amp;articleid=a051000000UWFsnAAH|title=Turner to Project Manage Burj 2020|publisher=DMCC|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yekaterinburg Expo===
The Russian bid ''The Global Mind'' would have run from May 1 to October 31, and would have been the second largest expo (after [[Expo 2010|2010]] in Shanghai) and intended to  "survey world opinion through seven universal questions".&lt;ref name="Ekaterinburg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/ekaterinburg-russia|accessdate=17 November 2013|title=Ekaterinburg - Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:first night ice sculpture.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An [[ice sculpture]] at First Night Boston]]
'''First Night''' is a North American artistic and cultural celebration on [[New Year's Eve]], taking place from afternoon until midnight. Some cities have all their events during the celebration outside, but some cities have events that are hosted indoors by organizations in the city, such as [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[theater]]s.  Since it happens on [[New Year's Eve]], First Night celebrations are actually held on the last night of the old year. First Night celebrates a community's local culture, often featuring [[music]], [[dance]], [[comedy]], [[art]], [[fireworks]] and, in some cities, [[ice sculpture]]s and [[parade]]s.

== Boston == 
The first First Night was in [[Boston]] on December 31, 1975. It was conceived by Clara Wainwright &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.art21.org/2014/05/29/a-quiet-kind-of-act/#.WM8F0xLyvSI|title=A Quiet Kind of Act |work=Art21 Magazine|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who organized a small group of artists seeking an alternative way of celebrating New Year's Eve, where Boston’s young, innovative artists and musicians could perform on both indoor and outdoor stages. They also wanted to avoid the emphasis on alcohol that is common at New Year's Eve parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worcestermag.com/home/top-stories/Has-the-Ball-Dropped-on-First-Night-Worcester-136014598.html?m=y&amp;smobile=y |work=[[Worcester Magazine]] |title=Has the Ball Dropped on First Night Worcester? |date=December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210041516/http://www.worcestermag.com/home/top-stories/Has-the-Ball-Dropped-on-First-Night-Worcester-136014598.html?m=y&amp;smobile=y |archivedate=2013-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon other surrounding communities started their own First Night celebrations. By the 1990s, the First Night Boston event was attracting works by over a thousand artists.&lt;ref&gt;Nordheimer, Jon (1990-12-26). [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/26/garden/a-new-year-s-fete-of-art-not-alcohol.html A New Year's Fete Of Art, Not Alcohol]. ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved on 2009-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than a million visitors attended First Night events, including free outdoor ice sculptures on [[Boston Common]] and in [[Copley Square]], and waterfront fireworks.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;Ford, Rosemary (2006-12-28). [http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_362094555 Carving out First Night Boston; Local ice sculptor lends frozen art to annual celebration] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122190820/http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_362094555 |date=2013-01-22 }}. ''[[The Eagle Tribune]]''. Retrieved on 2009-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Live coverage of the final part of Boston's First Night, including the countdown to midnight and fireworks over [[Boston Harbor]] that begin at the stroke of midnight, is broadcast by [[WBZ-TV]]. [[CBS]], the station's parent company, is an official sponsor.

In addition to the New Year's festival, First Night is deeply involved in Boston's art and culture communities via the Neighborhood Network. Started in 1994, the Neighborhood Network partners First Night with 25 community organizations throughout Boston's neighborhoods- including [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], [[Mattapan]], [[Jamaica Plain, Boston|Jamaica Plain]] and [[South Boston]]- to engage young people and families in creative workshops with artists and educators. In 2000 First Night launched Summer Beat, a series of summer camp like dance and music workshops spread around the city of Boston.

In 2013, the non-profit First Night Boston organization closed for financial reasons, though [[Mayor Menino]] of Boston (in office for only another year) pledged to find private or public funding the January 2014 celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/06/20/first-night-creator-city-longtime-new-year-eve-celebration-cease-operations/XxXDvkP8l16znqkwJ6NRyI/story.html|title=First Night, creator of the city’s longtime New Year’s Eve celebration, to cease operations | work= [[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2013, Mayor Menino announced he had acquired the necessary funding and that the 2013 First Night would be “a bigger, brighter display than ever before.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/11/07/mayor-menino-announces-first-night-plans-festival-had-appeared-jeopardy/YKhDEaFqYWSiefMcPbkqbL/story.html |title= Mayor Menino announces First Night plans after festival had appeared to be in jeopardy| work=The Boston Globe |date= November 7, 2013|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Boston took over the First Night festivities in 2015 and hired an [[Event management|event planning]] firm to manage the smaller and scaled back event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/12/17/first-night-midnight-fireworks-show-back/Vit2kRXGWTLraCuEYAZxzK/story.html |title=Fireworks are returning to First Night festival |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |author=Filipov, David |date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=31 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other cities ==

By 1999, First Night celebrations were being held in more than 200 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Denver Post |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF4544F5D59DE4&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id |title=Major cities plan New Year's parties |date=October 10, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, more than 260 cities had such a celebration. However, in 2001, 20 cities dropped out of the First Night celebrations due to the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] and/or money difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Worcester Telegram Gazette]] |date=December 9, 2009 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WO&amp;p_theme=wo&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12C8478E8C88E490&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id|title=First Night fireworks fizzle out }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Recession]], which began in late 2007, many First Night celebrations faced financial difficulty, being scaled back or canceled.&lt;ref name="wbur1"&gt;{{Cite web

== National organization ==
First Night USA is the national offshoot of the original Boston organization. It works with the numerous First Night licensed events throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=firstnightcities /&gt;

Other celebrations on New Year's Eve, not labeled "First Night", have also sprung up. For example, in 2003, First Night Providence announced they planned to cancel future celebrations, which had been going on for 19 years.  A group of local artists created Bright Night Providence, an artist-run New Year's Eve celebration based on the idea and spirit of First Night.&lt;ref name="brightnight1"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Formula Acceleration 1''' ('''FA1''') was a [[One-make racing|single make]], [[Open-wheel car|open wheel auto racing]] series. It was unusual in its field in that competitors solely represented their [[nation]] as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most [[formula racing]] series.

FA1 was created in 2014 as the signature category in the [[Acceleration 2014]] series of motorsport festivals. Rather than developing their own car, the series reduced costs substantially by using the [[Lola B05/52]] which was used in the early years of the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series. They also continued to use the same 3.4 litre V8 engine built by [[Zytek Engineering]]. On 22 December 2014, it was announced that the series would be merged with [[2015 Auto GP season|Auto GP in 2015]]. This to ensure that at least 18 cars will participate in each race. It was also announced that the 2015 champion will be granted a [[Formula 1]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racexpress.nl/index.php?nav=Artikel&amp;nid=63572|publisher=RaceXpress|title=Auto GP en FA1 bundelen krachten in nieuw kampioenschap|trans-title=Auto GP and FA1 join forces in new championship|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/117209|publisher=Autosport|title=Auto GP set for Formula Acceleration merger in bid to boost grids|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the season was halted after two rounds due to the lack of entrants.

==Technical specifications==
All cars are mechanically identical and have been built with reducing costs in mind, which has led to an approximate price for the whole season of €450,000. FA1 will use the [[A1 Grand Prix cars#Lola-Zytek car (2005–06 to 2007–08)|Lola B05/52]], used in the [[A1 Grand Prix]] between [[2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season|2005]] and [[2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season|2008]].

'''Fraud in the factum''' is a type of [[fraud]] where [[misrepresentation]] causes one to enter a [[Financial transaction|transaction]] without accurately realizing the risks, duties, or obligations incurred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (2nd Pocket ed. 2001 pg. 293).&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be when the maker or drawer of a [[negotiable instrument]], such as a [[promissory note]] or [[Cheque|check]], is induced to sign the instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms.  Determination of whether an act constitutes fraud in the factum depends upon consideration of "all relevant factors".  Fraud in the factum usually voids the instrument under state law and is a [[real defense]] against even an [[holder in due course]].

Contrast this with the situation where a trusted employee signs a check without permission.  The employer must still honor the check despite the fact that the check was a fraudulent negotiable instrument.  Here, the employer had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the obligation by restricting access to the checks.

'''Fraud in the factum is often contrasted with fraud in the inducement.'''

* ''Fraud in the factum'' is a [[law|legal]] defense, and occurs where A makes/signs an agreement, but either does not realize that it is supposed to be a contract, or does not understand the nature/content of the agreement, because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' suppose John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the factum".
* ''Fraud in the inducement'' is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] defense, and occurs when A enters into an agreement, knowing that it is supposed to be a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the agreement is about, but the reason A signed/made the agreement was because of some false information that B gave to A.  ''For example,'' suppose John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, but then John falsely tells her that the bank will foreclose on the property unless she signs it over to him.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead "fraud in the inducement".

[[Image:0 Binche - Les Gilles le jour du mardi gras (1).JPG|thumb|The Gilles wearing their hat with ostrich feathers on Shrove Tuesday.]]
[[Image:0 Les Gilles d'Havré (1).JPG|thumb|The Gilles, clad in their costumes and plumed hats]]

The '''Gilles''' are the oldest and principal participants in the [[Carnival of Binche]] in [[Belgium]]. They go out on [[Shrove Tuesday]] from 4 am until late hours and dance to traditional songs.  Other cities, such as [[La Louvière]], have a tradition of Gilles at carnival, but the Carnival of Binche is by far the most famous.  In 2003, the Carnival of Binche was proclaimed one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].

==Costume==
Around 1000 Gilles, all male, some as young as three years old, wear the traditional costume of the Gille on Shrove Tuesday.  The outfit features a linen suit with red, yellow, and black heraldic designs (the colours of the [[Belgian flag]]), trimmed with large white-lace cuffs and collars. The suit is stuffed with straw, giving the Gille a hunched back.&lt;ref name="vt1724"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtourist.com/europe/wallonia/17.htm |title=17/24.- Wallonia: Gilles de Binche |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gilles also wear wooden clogs and have bells attached to their belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/02/24/arts/EU-Belgium-Mardi-Gras.php |title=Colorful Belgian 'Gilles' dancers mark Mardi Gras |date=2009-02-24 |publisher=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the morning, they wear a mask of a particular design. After reaching the town hall, they remove these masks—they are not worn in the afternoon. During the afternoon parade, they throw [[blood orange]]s to (and sometimes at) the crowd, and some of the Gilles wear large, white, feathered hats. They carry ''ramons'', tied bunches of twigs, and baskets in which to carry the oranges.&lt;ref name="vt1724"/&gt; Their sticks are said to ward off evil spirits.

'''Gorsedh Kernow''' (Cornish Gorsedd) is a non-political [[Cornwall|Cornish]] organisation, based in Cornwall, [[United Kingdom]], which exists to maintain the national [[Celt]]ic spirit of Cornwall. It is based on the Welsh-based [[Gorsedd]], which was founded by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in 1792.

==History==
The Gorsedh Kernow ([[Gorsedd]] of Cornwall) was set up in 1928 at [[Boscawen-Un]] by [[Henry Jenner]], one of the early proponents of [[Cornish language]] revival, who took the name "Gwas Myghal", meaning "servant of [[St Michael|Michael]]". He and twelve others were initiated by the Archdruid of [[Wales]]. It has been held every year since, except during [[World War II]]. 1,000 people have been Cornish bards, including [[Ken George]], [[Robert Morton Nance|R. Morton Nance]] ("Mordon") and [[Peter Berresford Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/archives/newbards/bardlist.htm List of new Cornish bards / bardic names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119161350/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/archives/newbards/bardlist.htm |date=19 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1939 the Council of the Gorsedd of Cornwall approved additional regalia, and asked [[Francis Cargeeg]] to design and execute new regalia for the Grand Bard, the Deputy Grand Bard and the Secretary, and two headpieces for the Marshal's staves. Over time, and up to 1970, additional pieces were added, including Plastrons for past Grand Bards, also produced by [[Francis Cargeeg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~soskernow/Gorsedd.htm Soskernow – Friends of Kernow]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lady of Cornwall.jpg|thumb|250px|Lady of Cornwall and flower girls at the 2007 Gorsedh ([[Penzance]])]]
The Gorsedh Kernow has now opened up to all forms of revived [[Cornish language]], and states its aim as "to maintain the national [[Celt]]ic spirit of Cornwall". The Gorsedh also encourages the study of the arts and history. It has been held annually since and has become an important institution in Cornwall's cultural and civic life. Its competitions attract many applicants and the "open Gorsedh" is attended by many Cornish people. There is also extensive coverage on local media.

An important part of the open Gorsedh is the awarding of bardships to individuals for meritorious work for Cornish culture. Thus the Gorsedh acts in many ways as a form of "honours system"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Bardships are awarded for study in the language, services to Cornish music, encouraging the arts (especially amongst children) amongst other things. Initiate Bards are given [[Bardic name]]s by the Grand Bard who welcomes them into the College of Bards. These names are in Cornish and will often refer somehow to the reason for their bardship: other [[Bardic name]]s refer to the Bard's personal or family name, or describe the Bards themselves,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The three major Gorsedhs in Britain are recorded in an ancient Welsh triad as being held at Moel Merw and Bryn Gwyddon in Wales and [[Boscawen-Un]] in Cornwall (ref: Craig Weatherhill). After domination of the Brythonic Celts by the Saxons the Bardic tradition fell into disuse and despite attempts at revival over the centuries lost all its prestige.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Gorsedh for 2008 was held in September 2008 in [[Looe]] which coincided with the Dehwelans Kernow festival. The 2009 Gorsedh began on 18 April at [[Saltash]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Morton Nance became the second Grand Bard in 1934. He said, "One generation has set Cornish on its feet. It is now for another to make it walk." Although the early Gorsedh used the [[Unified Cornish|Unified form]], in June 2009, members voted overwhelmingly to adopt the new [[Standard Written Form]] as their standard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090414200436/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38814 Gorsedh adopts SWF – Cornish Language Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ipswich serial murders''', commonly known as the work of the '''Suffolk Strangler''', took place between 30 October and 10 December 2006, during which time the bodies of five [[murder]]ed women were discovered at different locations near [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], England. All of the victims were women who had worked as [[prostitute]]s in the Ipswich area. Their bodies were discovered naked, but there were no signs of [[sexual assault]]. Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to have been killed by [[asphyxiation]]. A cause of death for the other victims, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol and Annette Nicholls, was not established.

[[Suffolk Constabulary|Suffolk Police]] linked the killings and launched a murder investigation codenamed Operation Sumac. Due to the size of the investigation police officers were drafted from several other police forces. Two  arrests were made in connection with the murders. The first suspect, who was never officially named by police, was released without charge. Forklift truck driver [[Steve Wright (serial killer)|Steven Gerald James Wright]], then aged 48, was arrested on suspicion of murder on 19 December 2006 and charged with the murders of all five women on 21 December.&lt;ref name="WrightCharge"&gt;{{cite web | title = Man charged over Ipswich murders. | publisher = Channel 4 | date = 22 December 2006| url = http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/man+charged+over+ipswich+murders/173560| accessdate =27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright was [[Remand (detention)|remanded]] in custody and his [[trial]] began on 14 January 2008 at [[Ipswich]] [[Crown Court]]. Wright pleaded not guilty to the charges, although he admitted having sex with all five victims and that he had been patronising prostitutes since the 1980s. [[DNA]] and fibre evidence was presented to the court that linked Wright to the victims. He was found guilty of all five murders on 21 February 2008, and was sentenced the following day to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should [[Whole life tariff|never be released from prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7256402.stm| title = Wright guilty of Suffolk murders| accessdate =24 February 2008| date = 21 February 2008| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murders received a large amount of [[News media|media]] attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, [[Peter Sutcliffe]], who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was some concern that the level of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. The murders also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.

[[Suffolk Constabulary|Suffolk police]] linked the killings and launched a murder investigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Forensic teams scour murder scene | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6173633.stm | accessdate =14 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; codenamed Operation Sumac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Hunt extends to Europe for killer who used bare hands | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 17 December 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/17/suffolkmurders.anushkaasthana1 | accessdate =4 April 2008 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Townsend}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Constable]] [[Alastair McWhirter]] acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance owing to the magnitude of the investigation. A senior investigator with the [[Metropolitan Police]], [[Commander#British police rank|Commander]] [[Dave Johnston (police officer)|Dave Johnston]], was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from [[Scotland Yard]] in London in an advisory capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stephen | first = Wright | title = Enter the Yard expert | work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-422289/Enter-Yard-expert.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day-to-day investigation was conducted by Detective [[Chief Superintendent]] Stewart Gull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Killer 'could be losing control' | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6172499.stm | accessdate =15 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During press conferences on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five bodies were found to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Forensic teams search 'dump' site | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =13 December 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6176693.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being [[forensic]]ally tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Clothes and handbag may have been found | work = Suffolk Evening Star | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=Murders&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=murders&amp;itemid=IPED13%20Dec%202006%2020%3A19%3A52%3A193 | accessdate =15 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicol attended [[Chantry High School (Suffolk)|Chantry High School]] but had left home at 16 to live in a [[hostel]],&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; working as a prostitute to fund her addiction to [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name="victims" /&gt; She had originally worked in massage parlours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Suffolk victim 'hid prostitution' | work = BBC news| publisher = BBC| date = 22 January 2008| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7201938.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was asked to leave on suspicion that she was using drugs.&lt;ref name="nicol" /&gt; Her mother was unaware she was a prostitute, and thought she had been working in a bar or a hairdresser's.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt;

===Gemma Adams===
Gemma Rose Adams&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;England &amp; Wales, 1837–2006 Birth Index&lt;/ref&gt; aged 25, born in [[Kesgrave]], was last seen on West End Road in Ipswich, where she had been living; she disappeared on 15 November at about 01.15 ([[UTC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Gemma Adams | work =The Guardian | date =13 December 2006 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/13/suffolkmurders5 | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams missing"&gt;{{cite news | title = Photo bid to find missing women | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 18 November 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6160740.stm | accessdate =11 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was found on 2 December, in a river at Hintlesham.

===Anneli Alderton===
Anneli Sarah Alderton,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; aged 24, a mother of one who was also in the early stages of pregnancy,&lt;ref name="pregnant.anneli"/&gt; had been living in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]].&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; Alderton disappeared on 3 December and was last seen on the 17.53 train from [[Harwich]] to [[Manningtree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Anneli Alderton | work =The Guardian | date =13 December 2006 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/13/suffolkmurders1 | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alderton got off the train at Manningtree at 18.15 before going on to Ipswich on another train, arriving at 18.43. Alderton's body was found on 10 December near Nacton, in woodland in front of [[Amberfield School]].

Alderton had been asphyxiated and was found naked, and was posed in the [[cruciform]] position.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; Her pregnancy was also revealed by the autopsy and her family were first informed of it by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Hunt for clues in last film of Suffolk killer's pregnant victim | author =Adam Lusher | work =The Daily Telegraph | date =17 December 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537127/Hunt-for-clues-in-last-film-of-Suffolk-killer%27s-pregnant-victim.html | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annette Nicholls===
Annette Nicholls, aged 29, a mother of one from Ipswich, was initially thought to have gone missing on 4 December, but at the trial it was revealed she was last seen in Ipswich town centre on 8 December.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; Her family reported her missing after they grew concerned at the news of the other murders.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; Nicholls' body was found on 12 December near Levington, naked but not sexually assaulted, and also posed in the [[cruciform]] position; a definite cause of death could not be established, but her breathing had been hampered.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt;

Nicholls, the oldest victim, had been a drug addict since the early 2000s, shortly after completing a [[Beautician|beautician's]] course at Suffolk College.&lt;ref name="Nicholls"&gt;{{cite news| title =Victim 5: Annette Nicholls: 'Overnight, she got into heroin and it changed her' | author =Ian Herbert | work =The Independent | date =13 December 2006 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/victim-5-annette-nicholls-overnight-she-got-into-heroin-and-it-changed-her-428256.html | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, she had started working as a prostitute to fund her addiction.&lt;ref name="victims"/&gt; After moving to a [[housing association]] home from her [[council house]], Nicholls asked her mother to look after her son.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; She was thought to be staying with a man in Ipswich at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt;

===Paula Clennell===
Paula Lucille Clennell,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; aged 24, born in [[Northumberland]] and living in Ipswich, disappeared on 10 December in Ipswich at approximately 00.20.&lt;ref name="bbc victims" /&gt; Clennell's body was found on 12 December near Levington on the same day as Nicholls'.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Clennell was found naked but not sexually assaulted and a [[post mortem]] reported that she had been killed by a compression of her throat.&lt;ref name="strangled" /&gt; Prior to her death, Clennell commented on the then recent murders in an interview with [[Anglia News]], stating that despite them making her "a bit wary about getting into cars" she continued to work because "I need the money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Feared victim: I must work, I need the money | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/13/uk.clennell/index.html | accessdate =21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest of suspects==
[[Image:SteveWright house.jpg|thumb|right|Wright's rented flat, 79, London Road, Ipswich, which was boarded up from his arrest until February 2009]]
On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary reported that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women.&lt;ref name="WrightCharge" /&gt; The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in [[Trimley St. Martin]] near [[Felixstowe]], Suffolk.&lt;ref name="Stephens"&gt;{{cite news | title = Man held over prostitute murders | publisher = BBC | date = 18 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6189409.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention of the suspect was extended by [[magistrate]]s by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police get extra time to quiz murder suspect | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = 19 December 2006 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL1920792320061219}} | accessdate =27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December, at 05.00, police arrested a second suspect,&lt;ref name="bbc6192085"&gt;{{cite news | title = Second man held in murders probe | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6192085.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 48 year old, at a residence in Ipswich, on suspicion of committing murder.&lt;ref name="bbc6192085" /&gt; The following day, 20 December, police were granted a 36-hour extension to question the second suspect in detention.

On 21 December, a joint statement was issued by DCS Gull and Michael Crimp, senior [[prosecutor]] for the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] in Suffolk, announcing that the second suspect identified as Steve Wright had been charged with the murder of all five women.&lt;ref name="charge"&gt;{{cite news | title = Man charged with Suffolk murders | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 21 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6194351.stm | accessdate =21 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police said that the first suspect, who was not officially named,&lt;ref name="WrightCharge" /&gt; was released on [[bail|police bail]].&lt;ref name="charge" /&gt; [[Bail]] conditions were cancelled on 6 June 2007 for the first suspect, as no more inquiries concerning the case were planned involving this person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = No charges over prostitute deaths | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 7 June 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6729723.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court appearances==
[[Image:ipscrowncourt mediapen.jpg|thumb|left|Ipswich Crown Court, with the 'media pen' specially erected for the court case. [[Sky News]] also constructed a shelter on the roof of a nearby building.]]

Wright appeared before magistrates in Ipswich on 22 December 2006, and was remanded in custody.&lt;ref name="WrightRemanded"&gt;{{cite news | title = Man remanded over Suffolk murders | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 21 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/6202691.stm | accessdate =21 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His trial began 16 January 2008.&lt;ref name="trial bbc"&gt;{{cite news| title =Weekly summary of Suffolk murder trial  | work =BBC news | publisher =BBC | date =23 February 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7199995.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second jury (of nine men and three women)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prostitute Murders Trial Begins |publisher=Sky News |date=16 January 2008 |url =http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1300814,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected after a member of the first jury could not continue to serve because of ill health.&lt;ref name="trial bbc" /&gt;

The court heard how the bodies of Anneli Alderton and Annette Nicholls were deliberately posed in the [[cruciform]] position, with [[DNA]] evidence linking Steve Wright to three of the victims and fibre evidence also connecting him to the victims.&lt;ref name="DNALink"&gt;{{cite news | title = Ipswich murders: DNA link to Steve Wright | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 17 January 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575810/Ipswich-murders-DNA-link-to-Steve-Wright.html | accessdate =5 May 2010| location=London | first=Gordon | last=Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence argued that Wright frequented prostitutes and had "full sex" with all of the victims except Tania Nichols, whom he picked up with the intention of having sex, but apparently changed his mind and returned her to Ipswich's [[red light district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Accused admits sex with victims | work = The Guardian| date =8 February 2008 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/08/ukcrime.uknews4 | location=London | first=Karen | last=McVeigh | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This contradicted Wright's earlier statement when stopped by police in the district in the early hours of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the red light district and was driving around because he could not sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Prostitute killer 'slipped through police's grasp' | first1 =Gordon |last1=Rayner |first2=Nick |last2=Allen  | work =Daily Telegraph | date =17 January 2008 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575722/Prostitute-killer-%27slipped-through-police%27s-grasp%27.html | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Girlfriend insists new suspect is innocent as forensic teams search their home | work = The Guardian | date = 20 December 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/20/suffolkmurders.estheraddley?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=fromtheguardian | accessdate =7 April 2008 | location=London | first=Sandra | last=Laville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurors were taken to sites involved in the case, including the exterior of Wright's rented house and the sites where the victims were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Jurors shown body-find locations | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =21 January 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7195510.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor suggested that Wright may not have acted alone, as the remains of Anneli Alderton were found some distance from the road but with no evidence that her body had been dragged by one person.&lt;ref name="lone killer"&gt;{{cite news| title = Steve Wright has been convicted of murdering five women in Ipswich.

In his summing up, the judge urged the jury to put aside their emotions:
{{quote|The loss of these five young lives is clearly a tragedy. You are likely to have sympathy for the deceased and their families. Your sympathy{{nbsp}}... must not sway you{{nbsp}}... You may view with some distaste the lifestyles of those involved{{nbsp}}... whatever the drugs they took, whatever the work they did, no-one is entitled to do these women any harm, let alone kill them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Suffolk jury reminded of evidence| work= BBC news| publisher = BBC| date=19 February 2008| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7250292.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Verdict===
[[Image:Ipswich murders memorial.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial site close to where the bodies of Paula Clennell and Annette Nichols were found]]
On 21 February, after eight hours of deliberation, the jury returned unanimous verdicts against Wright on all five counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7256402.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wright guilty of Suffolk murders | date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A murder conviction carries an automatic term of [[life imprisonment]] but the judge could decide if Wright was eligible for [[parole]].&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite news| title =Suffolk strangler Steve Wright jailed for 'whole life term' | work =Philippe Naughton | publisher =The Times | date =22 February 2008 | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article3415510.ece  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that Wright should receive a [[whole life tariff]] and thus never be released from prison.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; On 22 February Wright was sentenced to life imprisonment, the judge recommending against parole because the murders involved a "substantial degree of pre-meditation and planning".&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7258115.stm|title=Suffolk killer will die in prison|publisher=BBC News|date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some family members felt that Wright deserved the death penalty.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1305048,00.html|title=Ipswich Killer Should Face Death Penalty|publisher=Sky News|date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Bradshaw, brother-in-law of Paula Clenell, said: "These crimes deserve the ultimate punishment and that can only mean one thing. Where a daughter and the other victims were given no human rights by the monster, his will be guarded by the establishment at great cost to the taxpayers of this country and emotionally to the bereaved families."&lt;ref name="verdict" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;
But the father of Gemma Adams said, "I am very relieved and pleased for all of the families that this is now over and we can now start to get on with our lives."&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] said the case was an example of the importance of the [[national DNA database]].&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/ipswichkillings/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=Murders&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=murders&amp;itemid=IPED27%20Feb%202008%2014%3A53%3A24%3A610|title=Prime Minister praises Wright police|publisher=Evening Star|date=29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a dock worker, a steward on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|QE2]], a lorry driver, a barman, and, just prior to his arrest, a fork-lift truck driver.&lt;ref name="deep.anger"/&gt;  He became a father again with another lover in 1992.&lt;ref name="deep.anger"/&gt;  Wright built up large debts largely through gambling,&lt;ref name="killings.trials"/&gt; and had recently been declared bankrupt.&lt;ref name="deep.anger"/&gt; Wright had twice tried to commit [[suicide]], firstly by carbon monoxide poisoning and then, in 2000, by an overdose of pills.&lt;ref name="deep.anger"/&gt;

==Media coverage==
[[Image:Anneli Alderton on CCTV.jpg|thumb|right|upright|CCTV image of Alderton on the train was released by the police and heavily used by the media]]

The murders have been likened to those by [[Peter Sutcliffe]], the "Yorkshire Ripper" who was convicted of murdering 13 women (and wounding seven others), mainly those who worked as prostitutes, over a period of five years from 1975 to 1980 in northern [[England]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Horsnell | first = Michael |author2=O'Neill, Sean | title = Another Yorkshire Ripper feared | work = [[The Australian]] | date = 13 December 2006 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20919297-2703,00.html | accessdate =13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to "[[Jack the Ripper]]", the infamous Victorian serial murderer who also targeted prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;

As with previous serial killers dating back to Jack the Ripper, many sections of the media have attempted to coin a name for the presumed murderer, using the "'''Suffolk Strangler'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bennetto | first = Jason | title = The Ipswich Ripper: How a town became a hunting ground | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 12 December 2006 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-ipswich-ripper-how-a-town-became-a-hunting-ground-428077.html | accessdate =27 February 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other terms to refer to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walsh | first = John | title = John Walsh: btw | series = Comments | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 16 December 2006 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/john-walsh-ibtwi-428675.html | accessdate =27 February 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police hunt for Suffolk strangler | work = [[East Anglian Daily Times]] | date = 12 December 2006 | url = http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/police_hunt_for_suffolk_strangler_1_78569 | accessdate =13 December 2006 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bennetto | first = Jason | title = Fears grow over prostitute deaths | work = BBC News | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 12 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6171177.stm | accessdate =12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chittenden | first = Maurice | title = Fear that ‘East Anglia Ripper’ has killed six | work = [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | date = 10 December 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article666394.ece | accessdate =27 February 2008  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Second woman found dead amid fear of vice-girl killer | work = [[The Times]] | date = 9 December 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article665058.ece | accessdate =26 December 2006  | location=London | first=Michael | last=Horsnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red-Light Ripper feared |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]] |date=12 December 2006 |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20913723-401,00.html |accessdate=14 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229050852/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C20913723-401%2C00.html |archivedate=29 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reward was offered, first by local business [[Call Connection]], who initially offered £25,000 and later raised it to £50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Third prostitute was strangled, say police  | author =David Sapsted and Sally Peck | work =Daily Telegraph | date =13 December 2006 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1536667/Third-prostitute-was-strangled%2C-say-police.html | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the ''[[News of the World]]'' offered a £250,000 reward for leads to a direct arrest and conviction of the murderer/murderers, bringing the total reward on offer to £300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Catch Him: News of the World offers £250,000 reward | work = [[News of the World]] | date = 12 December 2006 | url = http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/article10513.ece | accessdate =12 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about the media coverage===
On 21 December 2006, the then [[Attorney General]] [[Lord Goldsmith]] issued guidance to the media after concerns were raised by Suffolk Constabulary about the coverage and potential prejudice of a future trial. Lord Goldsmith urged the media to show restraint in what they reported about the two suspects being held, for fear of prejudicing any possible trial.&lt;ref name="goldsmithguidence"&gt;{{cite news| title = Accused has a right to a fair trial before a jury.| work = [[The Guardian]]| date = 22 December 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/dec/22/pressandpublishing.suffolkmurders| accessdate =29 February 2008 | location=London | first=Audrey | last=Gillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior prosecutor on the case, Michael Crimp, also expressed his concerns about potentially prejudicial media coverage: "Steven Wright stands accused of these offences and has a right to a fair trial before a jury. It is extremely important that there should be responsible media reporting which should not prejudice the due process of law."&lt;ref name="goldsmithguidence" /&gt;

===Coverage of related issues===
The murders refocused press attention on a number of controversial issues in [[British politics]].

The first is that of [[prostitution in the United Kingdom]]. The murders have highlighted the vulnerability of prostitutes and the lack of action taken by the government, whether to be more punitive in the hope of reducing the numbers of prostitutes on the streets, to move towards legalised [[brothel]]s and other measures to improve the safety of the women, or to target the demand for prostitution through prosecution of the clients, as is done in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Target Prostitute Users – Harman | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6188203.stm | accessdate =19 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has moved in the direction of tough "anti-prostitution" laws which target the clients.

The government had at one point considered allowing "mini brothels",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Nigel |title=Calls grow for reform of laws on prostitution |work=[[The Independent]] | date = 14 December 2006 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/calls-grow-for-reform-of-laws-on-prostitution-428379.html | accessdate =27 February 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Waterhouse | first = Keith | title = How to book the hookers and the hooked | work= [[Daily Mail]] | date = 19 January 2006 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-374529/How-book-hookers-hooked.html | accessdate =14 December 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned this plan after fears that such establishments would bring pimps and drug dealers into residential areas. Instead, the laws became tougher: the  [[Policing and Crime Act 2009]] made it illegal to pay for sex with a prostitute who has been "subjected to force" and this is a ''strict liability offense'' (clients can be prosecuted even if they did not know the prostitute was forced).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policing and Crime Act 2009 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/26/contents#pt2-pb1-l1g14 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Naked Anthropologist |url=http://www.lauraagustin.com/unworkable-ways-to-stop-trafficking-uk-law-on-exploitation-and-gain |work=lauraagustin.com |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is that of [[drug abuse|drug use]] and whether it should be legalised or decriminalised, provided on [[Medical prescription|prescription]] to registered addicts, or penalised more harshly.&lt;!--&lt;sup&gt;[[2006 Ipswich murder investigation#Newspaper editorials|see below]]&lt;/sup&gt;--&gt; High numbers (95% according to the [[Home Office]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Paying the Price: a consultation paper on prostitution | publisher = [[Home Office]] Communication Directorate | date = 16 July 2004 | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/paying_the_price.pdf?view=Binary | format = PDF | accessdate = 14 December 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061209055645/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/paying_the_price.pdf?view=Binary | archivedate = 9 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of street prostitutes in the United Kingdom have a history of substance abuse, and prostitution is one means of funding addiction, known to have been used by all five of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Mother tells of murder victim's drug addiction  | first=Karen | last=McVeigh| work =The Guardian | date =23 January 2008 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/23/ukcrime.uknews41 | location=London | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==
In March 2008, it was announced that Wright would be lodging an [[appeal]] against both his convictions and the trial judge's recommendation of a [[whole life tariff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Ipswich killer seeks to appeal sentence | work =Andrew Hough | publisher =Reuters UK | date =19 March 2008 | url =http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL1928924820080319}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming (amongst other things) that the trial should not have been held in Ipswich and that the evidence against him constituted insufficient proof of guilt.&lt;ref name="appeal2"&gt;{{cite news| title =Suffolk killer makes appeal bid  | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =19 March 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7305470.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported to have written to the [[court of appeal]] "All five women were stripped naked of clothing/jewellery/phones/bags and no evidence was found in my house or car."&lt;ref name="appeal2" /&gt; He has asked for a new [[solicitor]].&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite news| title =Outrage at killer's appeal bid | work =MSN news | publisher =MSN | date =19 March 2008 | url =http://news.uk.msn.com/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=7851359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This first appeal was rejected in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Serial killer Wright refused appeal | work =eveningstar.co.uk | date =2 July 2008 | url =http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/news/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=ESTOnline&amp;tCategory=News&amp;itemid=IPED02%20Jul%202008%2014%3A32%3A59%3A843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, it was announced that a new appeal would be lodged,&lt;ref name="appeal3"&gt;{{cite news| title =Suffolk killer renews appeal bid  | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =15 July 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7507530.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in February 2009 it was reported that Wright had dropped this appeal, though some of his family hoped to persuade the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] to review the case.&lt;ref name="dropappeal"&gt;{{cite news| title =Serial killer drops appeal case | work =BBC News | publisher =BBC | date =2 February 2009 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/suffolk/7864669.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Wright announced that he would be launching a third appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gore |first=Alex |title=Suffolk Strangler launches third appeal on anniversary of murders of five prostitutes |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2242191/Suffolk-strangler-Steve-Wright-launches-appeal-anniversary-murders-5-prostitutes.html |accessdate=20 October 2015 |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dramatisations ==
The BBC Drama department commissioned a dramatisation of the murders and the investigation from screenwriter Stephen Butchard. The three-part production, entitled ''[[Five Daughters]]'', began filming in November 2009, and was broadcast on BBC One from 25–27 April 2010. Only a few days after the BBC's announcement of the drama, Brian Clennell, the father of Paula Clennell, complained that it would portray the victims in "a bad light". Wright's brother David also complained that it would jeopardise any future retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Bond, Anthony|date= 1 September 2009|url= http://www.eadt.co.uk/content/eadt/news/story.aspx?brand=EADOnline&amp;category=News&amp;tBrand=EADOnline&amp;tCategory=xDefault&amp;itemid=IPED31%20Aug%202009%2017%3A18%3A15%3A147|title= Father's anger at BBC murders drama|work= East Anglian Daily Times|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Lancashire]] and [[Ian Hart]] led the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= French, Dan|date= 1 December 2009|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a189346/sarah-lancashire-for-ipswich-murders-drama.html|title= Sarah Lancashire for Ipswich murders drama|work= Digital Spy|accessdate=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A musical play, ''[[London Road (musical)|London Road]]'', commissioned by the [[Royal National Theatre]] and written by [[Alecky Blythe]] and Adam Cork, is based on interviews with residents of the street in Ipswich where Steve Wright lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/apr/10/london-road-alecky-blythe-interview |title=London Road: Murder, they sang |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[London Road (film)|film adaptation]] of the play was released in the United Kingdom in 2015. The case was featured in an episode of the documentary series ''[[Real Crime]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23815">The '''Irish border question''' is a controversy about the impact that the [[UK's withdrawal from the European Union]] will have on the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border]] on the island of [[Ireland]], in particular the impact it may have on the economy and people of the island were customs or immigration checks to be put in place at the border. It was prioritised as one of the three most important areas to resolve in order to reach a [[Withdrawal Agreement]]. 

[[File:The Border on Killeen School Road - geograph.org.uk - 446719.jpg|thumb|The UK/Republic of Ireland border crosses this road at Killeen (near [[Newry]]), marked only by a speed limit in km/h. (Northern Ireland uses mph.)]]

The UK voted to leave the European Union in a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on 23 June 2016]] which would effectively make the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border an [[External border of the European Union|external EU border]]. All parties have stated that they want to avoid a hard border in Ireland particularly due to the sensitive nature of the border. 

==Background==
===Irish independence===
{{main|Anglo-Irish Treaty|Partition of Ireland}}
In 1922, the [[Irish Free State]]{{efn|subsequently renamed as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]/''[[Éire]]'', also known as the Republic of Ireland}} seceded from the United Kingdom while Northern Ireland remained in the UK. Consequently the dividing line between these two parts of the island became an [[border|international border]]. Trade in goods and services across this frontier became subject to differing tax and tariff arrangements and an infrastructure of Customs posts was put in place at designated crossing areas. All traffic was subject to inspection by the jurisdiction it was entering. This could entail full vehicle searches with consequent delay and inconvenience. However passport checks were not applied because the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the [[Common Travel Area]].

===Closer links===
A number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements made goods checks less intrusive, the completion of the European [[Single Market]] in 1992 meant that checks on goods were phased out.  However, during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, there were British military checkpoints on main border crossings and UK security forces made some, although not all, of the remaining crossings impassable. In 2005, in phase with [[Good Friday Agreement#History of implementation|implementation]] of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] , the last of the border checkpoints was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron says: |url=https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-what-are-the-options-for-the-irish-border-after-brexit |title=FactCheck: What are the options for the Irish border after Brexit? – Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, the UK and the Republic of Ireland are both members of the [[European Union]], and therefore both are in the [[Customs Union]] and the [[Single Market]], and will remain so until March 2019. There is freedom of movement for all EU nationals within the [[Common Travel Area]] between the UK and Northern Ireland and there are no customs or fixed immigration controls at the border.

===Belfast Agreement=== 
Since about 2005 the border has been perceived as being invisible with little or no physical infrastructure, due to processes put in place by the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]].  The Belfast Agreement, signed on the Christian holiday of 'Good Friday' (April 10th, 1998), has the status of both an international treaty between the UK and the [[Republic of Ireland]] (British-Irish Agreement) as well as an agreement of the parties within [[Northern Ireland]] (Multi-Party Agreement). 

Following Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become an [[External border of the European Union|external EU border]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/brexit-and-the-history-of-policing-the-irish-border|title=Brexit and the history of policing the Irish border|last=Smith|first=Evan|date=20 July 2016|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that a "hard" border may return, with both fewer and supervised, crossing posts in order to support the necessary customs-infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/06/opinions/20-years-good-friday-agreement-northern-ireland-nic-r-intl/index.html Brexit: the unexpected threat to peace in Northern Ireland] Nic Robertson, [[CNN]], 6 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Both the EU and the UK negotiating-teams have expressed a sentiment that this ought to be avoided, where possible, in the outcome of the treaty-negotiations around the UK's exiting the European Union.

[[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]], a foreign political persona associated with the Belfast Agreement, has commented that he believes the creation of a border-control system between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom, 'could' jeopardise the Belfast Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/george-mitchell-uk-and-ireland-need-to-realise-whats-at-stake-in-brexit-talks-36785893.html George Mitchell: UK and Ireland need to realise what’s at stake in Brexit talks.] [[Belfast Telegraph]], 8 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions on the Irish border==

===United Kingdom government===

The UK government have said that Brexit will not mean a return of the hard border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brexit will not mean hard border, leaders vow |registration=yes |date=31 January 2017 |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brexit-will-not-mean-hard-border-leaders-vow-83c7lzs80 |work=[[The Times, Ireland edition]] |first=Niamh |last=Lyons |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to statements by [[Theresa May]] and [[Enda Kenny]], it is intended to maintain this arrangement after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Irish Times |date=26 July 2016 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-may-not-impact-common-travel-area-expert-claims-1.2711557 |accessdate=12 October 2016 |title=Britain does not want return to Northern Ireland border controls, says May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 the UK [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]], [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], stated that the UK government would not seek a return to a "hard border" between the UK and Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=1 September 2016 |title=Brexit secretary: no return to 'hard' border in Ireland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/01/brexit-secretary-no-return-to-hard-border-in-ireland |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=28 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its [[Chequers plan|white paper on Brexit]], the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. With regard to Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's "clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;HM Government ''[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union]''; Cm 9417, February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum on the [[United Ireland|reunification of Ireland]] was suggested by NI [[Sinn Féin]] leader [[Martin McGuinness]] immediately after the UK EU referendum results were announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fenton |date=24 June 2016 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-northern-ireland-eu-referendum-result-latest-live-border-poll-united-martin-mcguinness-a7099276.html |title=Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister calls for poll on united Ireland after Brexit |work=The Independent  |first=Siobhan |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a stance reiterated by the new leader [[Mary Lou McDonald]].&lt;ref name=France24&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20180226-northern-ireland-sinn-fein-mary-lou-mcdonald-reunification-referendum-brexit Irish reunification ‘on the table’, says Sinn Fein's new leader amid Brexit talks].

A week after the referendum the then [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]], the DUP's [[Arlene Foster]] and the [[Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|Deputy First Minister]] Martin McGuinness issued a joint letter where they said that the border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity or create an incentive for those who wish to undermine the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37039683 |title=Foster and McGuinness in Brexit talks call - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider EU reaction===

In April 2017 the [[European Council]] agreed that, in the event of [[Irish reunification]], Northern Ireland could rejoin the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EU approval 'brings united Ireland closer' |date=29 April 2017 |last=Coyne |accessdate=29 April 2017 |work=[[The Times, Ireland edition]] |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/leaders-set-to-agree-that-north-could-rejoin-eu-lfrlzdf7d |first=Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joachim Pfeiffer]], an influential MP for the governing German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] party, believes border controls and customs checkpoints could be avoided, if United Kingdom were to perform some major concession such as to accept the four basic freedoms or to find a special solution for Northern Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/promises-about-no-hard-border-illusory-says-merkel-ally-1.3102079 Promises about no hard Border ‘illusory’, says Merkel ally], {{snd}} ''The Irish Times'', 30 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but that Ireland would have the "hardest border" in the event of a [[No deal Brexit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/ireland-will-have-hardest-border-in-europe-if-uk-doesnt-reach-brexit-deal-ally-of-merkel-warns-37142875.html|title=Ireland will have 'hardest border in Europe' if UK doesn't reach Brexit deal, ally of Merkel warns|work=Independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on the withdrawal negotiations==
{{main|Brexit negotiations}}
===Importance of the Irish border===

In the withdrawal negotiations the Irish border has been set as one of the three most important areas to resolve before moving to negotiations on the future economic relationship, along with British financial contributions to the EU and the rights of EU citizens in the UK.

The Irish and UK governments, as well as EU representatives, have stated that they do not wish for a hard border in Ireland, taking into account the historical and social "sensitivities" that permeate the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/786284/northern-ireland-brexit-irish-border-donald-tusk|title=EU pledges NO hard border in Ireland - but admits 'creative' solution needed|first=Joey|last=Millar|date=31 March 2017|work=Daily Express|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===EU's negotiating stance===

[[Michel Barnier]], the EU chief negotiator, has indicated that he would look to the United Kingdom and Ireland for "solutions" to threats posed to Ireland's trading links, the common travel area, and the Good Friday Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/eu-sees-our-unique-circumstances-but-the-irish-question-must-be-dealt-with-early-in-the-talks-35628265.html|title=EU sees our unique circumstances but the 'Irish question must be dealt with early in the talks' |work=Independent.ie|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denying UK media reports that Ireland expects the effective border to become the [[Irish Sea]], Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Simon Coveney]] said that "the onus was on British officials to come up with an imaginative solution but [the Irish Government] would not support a proposal which would see a hard border return on Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/brexit/onus-on-british-to-resolve-irish-border-issue-for-brexit-irish-foreign-affairs-minister-coveney-35977337.html 'Onus on British to resolve Irish border issue for Brexit: Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Coveney] {{snd}} ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 28 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backstop agreement===

In order to keep a friction-less border, the European Union proposed a "backstop agreement" within the Withdrawal Agreement called the Northern Ireland [[Protocol (politics)|Protocol]]. This would only come into force if there were no other solutions at the time, and it aimed to bring Northern Ireland under a range of EU rules in order to forestall the need for border checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/brexit-what-is-the-backstop-agreement-and-why-does-it-matter-1.3571135|title=Brexit: What is the 'backstop' agreement and why does it matter?|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British government agreed with the principle of such a backstop at the December 2017 meeting,&lt;ref name="henley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/brexit-what-is-the-uks-backstop-proposal|title=Brexit: what is the UK's backstop proposal?|first=Jon|last=Henley|date=7 June 2018|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; it rejected the legal text prepared by Barnier's office because it created a legal and regulatory barrier between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.&lt;ref name="henley"/&gt; The British side hoped to achieve an agreement that applies equally to [[Great Britain]] as well as Northern Ireland, thus avoiding any need for Northern Ireland to be treated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/customs-deal-will-hold-up-brexit-brussels-tells-may-d7vkm9r82|title=New backstop plan for Irish border will tie in whole of UK|date=17 May 2018|work=The Times|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the draft UK/EU Agreement released on 14 November 2018, it is proposed that (from the end of the transition phase on 31 December 2020), the UK and the EU customs territories will operate as one until the parties agree jointly that a mutually satisfactory alternative arrangement has been reached. This alternative arrangement must be such as to continue to ensure that there is no evident border in Ireland. In addition, Northern Ireland will maintain "regulatory alignment" with the EU, again until a mutually satisfactory alternative arrangement can be put in place for Single Market regulations as well as Customs and Excise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/brexit-draft-agreement-what-has-been-agreed-on-northern-ireland-to-avoid-a-hard-border-37529713.html Brexit draft agreement: What has been agreed on Northern Ireland to avoid a hard border]{{snd}} [[Belfast Telegraph]], 14 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-6423_en.htm  European Commission - Fact Sheet: Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland]{{snd}} [[European Commission]], 14 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy areas==

===Common Travel Area===
{{main|Common Travel Area}}

In 1922 the newly established Irish Free State entered into a [[Common Travel Area]] together with the United Kingdom.  This meant that passport checks were not applied as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and  predates the [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|freedom of movement provisions]] arising from membership of the EU, which to some degree superseded it. [[Common Travel Area#2011 agreement|In 2011, the British and Irish Governments agreed]] informally to continue their common controls on entry to the CTA [for non-EEA nationals].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ireland-UK Accord to Further Secure the Common Travel Area|url=http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/IRELAND-UK%20ACCORD%20TO%20FURTHER%20SECURE%20THE%20COMMON%20TRAVEL%20AREA|publisher=Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service|quote=The Joint Statement '''and the accompanying Memorandum of Understanding''' on visa data exchange was signed by Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter, T.D. and UK Immigration Minister, Damien Green, M.P., in Dublin today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the British government guaranteed that free movement of EU citizens across the UK–Ireland border would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Irish Times |date=1 September 2017 |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/major-breakthrough-in-irish-strand-of-brexit-talks-1.3205341 |accessdate=2 September 2017 |title=Major breakthrough in Irish strand of Brexit talks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Norway - European Union relations|the Norwegian model]] might be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nordic.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-norway-model-brexit-2018-4?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=The House of Lords voted for Theresa May to negotiate a Norway-style Brexit — here's what that means|website=nordic.businessinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the [[Norway–Sweden border]], major road crossings have customs control where all lorries are checked, but cars only occasionally, and on minor border crossings there is only video surveillance where lorries can pass with permission and pre-clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tullverket.se/sv/foretag/transporteraochlagravaror/transporteravaror/trafiktillstandfortransportermellansverigeochnorge.4.cab630d15a4bde13b62de.html |title=Trafiktillstånd för transporter mellan Sverige och Norge] |publisher=Tullverket (Swedish customs) |language=Swedish |access-date=2018-07-04 |quote=Translation:"With a traffic permit, you as a carrier can pass a border crossing that does not have an open clearance expedition."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Major]] has argued that Brexit might lead to a hard border since the European Union and the UK need to control their borders for customs purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/john-major-customs-union-brexit-hard-border-northern-ireland|title=Customs union only way to prevent hard border in Ireland, says Major|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|date=10 May 2018|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Research Group]] faction of the Conservative Party believes that the UK might have the choice between not controlling its border if VAT is not enforced, or controlling the border in order to apply possible VAT on imported goods post-brexit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brexitcentral.com/regulatory-divergence-not-require-hard-border-northern-ireland-republic/|title=Regulatory divergence does not require a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic|author=Micheal Burrage|publisher=Brexit Central|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45494896|title=Brexit Irish border: ERG report has more sober approach but problems remain|publisher=BBC News|author=John Campbell|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health issues===
Cooperation exists between the UK and Ireland on health matters, including the mutual recognition of qualifications. The Northern Ireland branch of the [[British Medical Association]] warned that a hard border "could risk patient care".&lt;ref name=nibma&gt;
[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-40125316 Brexit: Hard border 'could risk patient care' says BMA] {{snd}} BBC, 2 June 2017
&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO of Cooperation and Working Together, a body that organises cross-border cooperation in health matters, suggested that [[Norway - European Union relations|the Norwegian model]] might be used.&lt;ref name=nibma /&gt; Along the [[Norway–Sweden border]] and other Nordic borders there is some cooperation on ambulance and helicopter pickup and on child birth clinics and some more, but otherwise health care is separated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11326">'''Jhatka''', or '''Chatka''' (''{{transl|pa|jhàṭkā}}'' {{IPA-pa|tʃə̀ʈkɑ|IPA}}), is meat from an animal killed instantaneously, such as by a single strike of a sword or axe to [[decapitation|sever the head]]. This method of meat production is opposed to slow bleed, ritualistic slaughter ([[kutha meat|kutha]]) methods such as the [[kosher]] ([[shechita]]) and [[halal]] ([[dhabihah]]).&lt;ref name="Engineers2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PechilisRaj2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh|editor=Karen Pechilis and Selva Raj|title=South Asian Religions: Tradition and Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaubzRxh-U0C&amp;pg=PA242 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-44851-2|page=242}}, Quote: "The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the eating of Kutha meat, that is Muslim halal meat, obtained through the slow bleeding or religious sacrifice of animals".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamie S. Scott|title=The Religions of Canadians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbZJ2ZszYw8C&amp;pg=PA320 |year=2012|publisher= University of Toronto Press|isbn= 978-1-4426-0516-9|pages=320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jhatka'' is the method of meat production demanded by many [[Hindu]]s, [[Sikh]]s, and denominational Christians, while [[Zabiha|Halal]] is demanded by [[Muslim]]s, and [[Kosher]] by [[Jew]]s.&lt;ref name="Engineers2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niir Board Of Consultants &amp; Engineers|title=Medical, Municipal and Plastic Waste Management Handbook|date=2009|publisher=National Institute of Industrial Research|isbn=9788186623916|page=214|quote=Halal is the method preferred by Muslims and jhatka by the Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayall, Gurbachan Singh (31 Dec 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Jhatka'' ({{lang-hi|झटका}} ''{{transl|hi|jhaṭkā}}'' {{IPA-hi|dʒʰəʈkɑ|IPA}}; {{lang-pa|ਝਟਕਾ &lt;small&gt;([[Gurmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;, {{nq|جھٹکا}} &lt;small&gt;([[Shahmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;}}) is derived from Sanskrit word ''Jhatiti'' (झटिति) which means "instantly, quickly, at once".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=jhaTiti&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 jhaTiti] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany; same definition is in Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary and Apte Etymology and Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fieldhouse30"/&gt;

==Sikhism==
Jhatka meat is mandated for Sikhs by the tenth Guru:
{{Quote|According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the [[Quran]] - the halal meat prepared by severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non-Muslims. Accordingly, he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food.
|HS Singha|''Sikhism, A Complete Introduction''&lt;ref&gt;HS Singha (2009),Sikhism: A Complete Introduction, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170102458}}, pages 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As stated in the official [[Khalsa#Code of conduct|Khalsa Code of Conduct]], [[Kutha meat]] is forbidden, and Sikhs are recommended to eat the jhatka form of meat.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, I. J., Sikhs and Sikhism {{ISBN|81-7304-058-3}} "And one Semitic practice clearly rejected in the Sikh code of conduct is eating flesh of an animal cooked in ritualistic manner; this would mean kosher and halal meat. The reason again does not lie in religious tenet but in the view that killing an animal with a prayer is not going to ennoble the flesh. No ritual, whoever conducts it, is going to do any good either to the animal or to the diner. Let man do what he must to assuage his hunger. If what he gets, he puts to good use and shares with the needy, then it is well used and well spent, otherwise not."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mini Encyclopaedia of Sikhism by H.S. Singha, Hemkunt Press, Delhi. {{ISBN|81-7010-200-6}} "The practice of the Gurus is uncertain. Guru Nanak seems to have eaten venison or goat, depending upon different [[Janamsakhis|Janamsakhi]] versions of a meal which he cooked at Kurukshetra which evoked the criticism of Brahmins. Guru Amardas ate only rice and lentils but this abstention cannot be regarded as evidence of vegetarianism, only of simple living. Guru Gobind Singh also permitted the eating of meat but he prescribed that it should be jhatka meat and not Halal meat that is jagged in the Muslim fashion."&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sikhs, ''jhatka karna'' or ''jhatkaund'' refers to the instantaneous severing of the head of an animal with a single stroke of any [[weapon]], with the underlying intention of killing the animal whilst causing it minimal suffering.&lt;ref name="Fieldhouse30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Fieldhouse|title=Food, Feasts, and Faith: An Encyclopedia of Food Culture in World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-FqDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-412-4|pages=30–31}}, '''Quote:''' "Jhatka, which comes from the Sanskrit word ''jhatiti'' meaning "at once", is a method of slaughter in which a single rapid jerk or blow to the head is believed to produce the least amount of suffering for the animal. (...) Unlike in Islam, there is no religious ritual that accompanies the killing."&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair-cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the consumption of [[kutha meat]] (halal meat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Opinderjit Kaur Takhar|title=Sikh Identity: An Exploration of Groups Among Sikhs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UaeoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39 |year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90010-2|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[British Raj]], jhatka meat was not allowed in jails, and Sikh detainees during the [[Akali movement]] and beyond had to resort to violence and agitations to secure this right. Among the terms in the settlement between the [[Shiromani Akali Dal|Akali]]s and the [[Punjab Muslim League#Punjab Muslim league and Unionist Party (Punjab)|Muslim Unionist government]] in [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] in 1942 was that jhatka meat be continued as a Sikh Martial Heritage.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On religious Sikh festivals, including [[Hola Mohalla]] and [[Vaisakhi]], at the [[Hazur Sahib Nanded]], [[Fatehgarh Sahib]], and many other Sikh Gurdwaras, jhatka meat is offered as "mahaprasad" to all visitors in a Gurdwara.&lt;ref name="Mahaprashad"&gt;''"The most special occasion of the Chhauni is the festival of Diwali which is celebrated for ten days. This is the only Sikh shrine at Amritsar where Maha Prasad (meat) is served on special occasions in Langar",'' The Sikh review, Volume 35, Issue 409 - Volume 36, Issue 420, Sikh Cultural Centre, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=June 2017}}

Some Sikh Organizations, such as the [[Damdami Taksal]] and [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]], have their own codes of conduct. These organizations define kutha meat as any type of slaughtered meat, and eating meat of any type is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spirit|first1=Khalsa|title=Khalsa Rehat|url=https://khalsaspirit.com/Rehat.html|website=KhalsaSpirit.com|publisher=KhalsaSpirit.com|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{main article|Diet in Hinduism}}
In the diversity of Hinduism, many Hindus are vegetarians from their belief in [[Ahimsa]] (non-injury, non-violence), and to minimize suffering to all life forms, but there is no binding religious dietary law in Hinduism, and the choice is left to the Hindu. Many [[Shaivite]] and [[Shakta]] Hindus, for example, offer meat and liquor as part of certain ritual worship, and then consume the meat.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg and Daniel Jeyaraj (2004), Genealogy of the South Indian Deities, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415344388}}, pages 126-127, 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June McDaniel (2004), Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195167917}}, pages 16-18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hindu]]s who eat [[meat]] seek jhatka meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Veena|title=The Oxford India companion to sociology and social anthropology, Volume 1 |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0195645820|accessdate=13 June 2010|volume=1|date=13 February 2003|publisher=OUP India |isbn=0-19-564582-0|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of Jhatka, Shechita, and Halal methods==
All three methods use sharp knives. In the Shechita and Halal method, the animal is slaughtered by one swift, uninterrupted cut severing the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, and vagus nerves, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out.&lt;ref name=neville&gt;Neville Gregory and Temple Grandin (2007), Animal Welfare and Meat Production, CABI, {{ISBN|978-1845932152}}, pages 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neville/&gt;&lt;ref name=amyfitz&gt;Amy J Fitzgerald (2015), Animals as Food, Michigan State University Press, {{ISBN|978-1611861747}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amyfitz/&gt; In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the head and the spine.&lt;ref name=neville/&gt;&lt;ref name=amyfitz/&gt;. In the Halal method, a prayer to God (Allah/Ad-nai) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during ''Shchita'' meat production, but before every slaughter in ''Halal'' meat production.&lt;ref name=amyfitz/&gt;

==Availability of jhatka meat==
In India, there are many jhatka shops, with various bylaws requiring shops to display clearly that they sell jhatka meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajmermc.org/PDF/MeatByelaws1963.pdf Order No. Tax/F.15(25)DLB/63] Published in the Govt. Gazette on 13-02-1965 (Part 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, there has been little availability of jhatka meat in the United Kingdom, so people have found themselves eating other types of meat,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hRfkTq1ykSIC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=sikh+halal Sikh women in England: their religious and cultural beliefs and social practices] By S. K. Rait, p. 63 Trentham Books, 2005 {{ISBN|1-85856-353-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although jhatka has become more widely available in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn__pj6QjBUC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=Jhatka+Meat++United+Kingdom#v=onepage&amp;q=Jhatka%20Meat%20%20United%20Kingdom&amp;f=false Food safety and quality assurance: foods of animal origin] By William T.

'''Job losses caused by the Great Recession''' refers to jobs that have been lost worldwide within people since the start of the [[Great Recession]]. In the US, job losses have been going on since December 2007, and it accelerated drastically starting in September 2008 following the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laidoffnation.com/2009/06/recession-2008-2009/ |title=Unemployment Spike – September 2008 |publisher=Laidoffnation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2010, the American economy was reported to be more shaky than the [[economy of Canada]]. Many service industries (particularly in countries that either have the same [[unemployment]] rate as the [[economy of the United States|United States]] or [[list of countries by unemployment rate|greater]]) have reported dropping their prices in order to maximize profit margins (looking to make use of any [[price elasticity of demand]] in their market segments). This is an era in which [[employment]] is becoming unstable, and in which being either underemployed or unemployed is a common part of life for many people.

Note: Job losses in June and July 2010 are largely attributed to US census worker jobs lost. Private sector jobs have increased during those months.

Since the start of the recession, 8.8 million jobs have been lost, according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm |title=Employment Situation Summary |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., jobs paying between $14 and $21 per hour made up about 60% those lost during the recession, but such mid-wage jobs have comprised only about 27% of jobs gained during the recovery through mid-2012. In contrast, lower-paying jobs constituted about 58% of the jobs regained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/31/low-wage-jobs-are-dominating-the-u-s-recovery/ "Low wage jobs are dominating the U.S. recovery"] ''Washington Post'', August 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Drastic job loss in Canada started later than in the US. Some months in 2008 had job growth, such as September, while others such as July had losses. Due to the collapse of the American car industry at the same time as a strong Canadian dollar achieved parity +10% against a poorly-performing US dollar, the cross-border manufacturing industry has been disproportionately affected throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hill |first=Bert |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Ottawa+unemployment+rate+cent+October/2192278/story.html |title=Ottawa unemployment rate up to 5.4 per cent |publisher=Ottawacitizen.com |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2010-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While job creation has increased in the past three months, most Canadians still complain about people getting laid off from work. However, a growing amount of these layoffs are considered for seasonal purposes and has little or no relation to the recession. Excluding Stelco employees, most laid off workers have six months to acquire a job while collecting [unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]]. After that, they must go on [[welfare]] and continue their job search from there.

The employment rate has been stabilized between 8.0% and 11.0% for the past two years; signifying the economic strength of Canada's financial institutions compared to its counterparts in the United States. Many job places in Canada (i.e., [[grocery store]]s and [[restaurant]]s) have opted to reduce hours rather than lay off staff. This unemployment of job protection is especially in industries that are needed to keep the economy from going into a [[depression (economics)|depression]]. While the automotive sector is slowly recalling workers back to work, grocery stores and restaurants have slashed hours in the face of the global recession.

The unemployment rate for October rose slightly due to population growth and other factors leading to 35,000 people looking for work, even though 24,500 jobs were created.

In general, throughout the subdued economic growth caused by the recession in the rest of the world, Australian employers have elected to cut working hours rather than fire employees, in recognition of the skill shortage caused by the resources boom.

===United Kingdom===
In September 2007, approximately a year before the recession began, unemployment stood at 1,649,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6990785.stm | work=BBC News | title=Pay rising as unemployment falls | date=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the end of 2008, that figure had risen to 1,860,000 - an increase of 211,000 and nearly 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7787280.stm | work=BBC News | title=Unemployment increases by 137,000 | date=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;By March 2009, unemployment had increased to more than 2,000,000 - the highest level the nation had seen for more than 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7947766.stm | work=BBC News | title=Unemployment passes two million | date=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;It reached 2,261,000 by June that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8104546.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK jobless total at 12-year high | date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;and by April 2010 had exceeded 2,500,000 for the first time in 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8634241.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK unemployment increases to 2.5m | date=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confounding variables in determining cause and effect==
The [[causality]] linking job losses to reduced business revenue is obviously grounded in reality, at least to a large extent. After all, it is self-evident that a firm with one million dollars in annual [[revenue]] cannot pay a two-million-dollar annual [[payroll]] without going into either debt or [[bankruptcy]]. However, at least some of the apparent or alleged causality is difficult to confirm [[Quantitative data|quantitative]]ly, because the data collection and analysis that would be required to do so faces high barriers to implementation, principally the privacy surrounding the accountancy. There is a common theme among working people,&lt;ref name="saved_search_01"&gt;Hinted at by the many [informal/colloquial] online discussions found by web searches such as "using the recession as an excuse to lay off".&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not widely studied or reported in reliable academic or journalistic sources, along the lines that firms are "using the recession as an excuse" for staff reductions whose true root causes lie elsewhere, such as: 
* [[Productivity]] increases that would have happened anyway, recession or no (via ever-improving [[software]] and [[computer network|networks]], for example, or via [[business process reengineering]]) 
* [[Offshoring]] disguised as layoffs in higher-wage countries happening "coincidentally" with hiring in lower-wage countries 
* [[Firing]] disguised as [[layoff]] (redundancy), where the motive for firing varies, including poor performance, low productivity, or even improper termination, but the employer benefits from not having to justify or document the job loss as a firing 

This theme also extends to compensation reduction or growth freezes, with the suspicion again being that the recession is an excuse for, e.g., wage raise freezes, wage cuts, or increasing the employees' contribution percentage for (or lowering the benefits of) company health insurance, company retirement plans, and so on. 

It is very difficult to accurately detect, verify, or track the data that would be needed to test these hypotheses. Short of any outright auditing (which has no legally justifiable basis), firms have a fair amount of [[plausible deniability]]. As for the concern that productivity growth drives unemployment, the very idea is controversial, and it depends on whatever the true reality may be in the [[relationship of automation to unemployment]]. Certainly a pattern of multiple [[jobless recovery|jobless recoveries]], where GDP grows while employment stagnates, makes the public wonder about firms' assurances that all layoffs are necessitated by business conditions alone.

The '''''Lanercost Chronicle''''' is a northern [[England|English]] history covering the years 1201 to 1346.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, p.vi.&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], but it is also highly digressive and as such provides insights into English life in the thirteenth century as well as Scottish life. It includes [[Robert the Bruce]].

A G Little concluded that the chronicle is basically a Franciscan chronicle, which has been adapted, abbreviated, and interpolated at the Augustinian [[Lanercost Priory]].&lt;ref name=Little&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=A G|title=Franciscan Papers, Lists and Documents|year=1943|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|page=42-54}}; limited access via {{cite web|title=Google books|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dmLoAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=authorship+lanercost+chronicle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RVH9Or_jvS&amp;sig=LnoNDiOAZSaQ15g8xYizZ511g5k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gsZEUfXJKeiY0AW1h4HQAw&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=authorship%20lanercost%20chronicle&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to identify the ''Chronicle'' up to 1297 as a version of a lost chronicle of 'Richard of Durham'; after that he believed a different author (with a keen interest in siege equipment and operations)&lt;ref name="L36"&gt;Little ''op. cit.'' p 36&lt;/ref&gt; to be responsible, whom he suspected to have been 'Thomas of Otterburn' whose chronicle is mentioned in the [[Scalachronica]].  The second author, says Little "resembles the first only in being a Franciscan and a patriotic hater of the Scots"&lt;ref name="L36" /&gt; but an additional similarity is that they are both North-country men.  Where most other chroniclers are unclear on the geography of the Borders, the ''Lanercost Chronicle'' gives the name of the farmstead at which the Scots reached Tynedale in 1346.   

The oldest surviving manuscript of the original Latin text is British Library [[Cotton Claudius]] D. vii.  An edition of the Latin was published from it in 1839 as ''Chronicon de Lanercost'', for the [[Bannatyne Club]] and the [[Maitland Club]], and a translation of part of it published in 1913 by Sir [[Herbert Maxwell]].&lt;ref name=Little/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

'''''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit''''' (often abbreviated to '''''Law &amp; Order: SVU''''' or just '''''SVU''''') is an [[Television of the United States|American]] [[police procedural]], legal, crime drama [[television series]] set in [[New York City]], where it is also primarily produced. In the style of the original ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', episodes are often "ripped from the headlines" or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention. Created by [[Dick Wolf]], the series premiered on [[NBC]] on September 20, 1999, as the second series in Wolf's successful [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]]. ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' has been nominated for and won numerous awards, including the 2006 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] for [[Mariska Hargitay]], the first, and to date only, Emmy to be received by a regular on any ''Law &amp; Order'' series. It is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|current longest running scripted non-animated U.S. primetime TV series]] since the cancellation of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' on May 24, 2010 and is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|fourth-longest running scripted U.S. primetime TV series]] on a major broadcast network.

''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' originally centered almost exclusively on the detectives of the [[Special Victims Unit]] in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]]. As the series progressed, additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the [[New York County District Attorney|New York County Manhattan District Attorney's office]] (known as advisers from the Sex Crimes Bureau) and the [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|Medical Examiner's office]]. Certain episodes will go into detail about detectives' personal lives and how they may or may not tie into the crimes dealt with during the show. Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute [[Sex and the law|sexually based offenses]], child abuse, and crimes against the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |title=Special Victims Unit: The Beginning |date=2004 |work=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit: The First Year |publisher=Universal Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show starred [[Christopher Meloni]] as Detective [[Elliot Stabler]] and Mariska Hargitay as Detective [[Olivia Benson]] for its first twelve seasons until the former left the cast, unable to come to an agreement on his contract.&lt;ref name="MeloniExit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/05/chris-meloni-exits-law-order-svu/ |title=Exclusive: Chris Meloni Exits Law &amp; Order: SVU|last=Webb Mitovich|first=Matt |publisher=[[TVLine]]|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/08/chris-meloni-law-order-svu-exit/|title=NBC on Chris Meloni's Law &amp; Order: SVU Exit: We're Not Killing Him Off|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|publisher=[[TVLine]]|date=August 1, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GiddishandPino&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=NBC Signs Kelli Giddish (''Chase'') and Danny Pino (''Cold Case'') as New Detectives for ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit''|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/27/nbc-signs-kelli-giddish-chase-and-danny-pino-cold-case-as-new-detectives-for-law-order-special-victims-unit/96694/|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 29, 2018, ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' has aired 444 original episodes.

==Production==

===History and development===
The idea for ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' originated with the 1986 "preppie murder" case of [[Robert Chambers (criminal)|Robert Chambers]], who strangled Jennifer Levin, a woman he dated whom he later killed during what he claimed was [[Informed consent|consensual]] "[[Sadomasochism|rough sex]]" in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]]. The crime inspired [[Dick Wolf]] to write the story for the [[Law &amp; Order (season 1)|season one]] episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' titled "[[Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (Law &amp; Order)|Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die]]". Even after writing the episode, however, the case continued to haunt Wolf, who wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 2"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

The original title of the show was ''Sex Crimes'', reflecting the sexual nature of the crimes depicted on the show. Initially there was concern among the producers that, should ''Sex Crimes'' fail, identifying the new show with the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise could hurt the original show. Additionally, [[Ted Kotcheff]] wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success. Wolf felt, however, that it was important and commercially desirable to have "Law &amp; Order" in the title, and he initially proposed the title of the show be ''Law &amp; Order: Sex Crimes''. [[Barry Diller]], then head of [[Studios USA]], was concerned about the title, however, and it was changed to ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' to reflect the actual unit of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) that handles sexually based offenses that are especially heinous.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 10-11"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode, "[[Payback (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Payback]]", premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 187"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive producers====
Executive producer [[Neal Baer]] left ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'' as [[showrunner]] at the end of [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|season twelve]], after eleven years (seasons 2–12) on the show, in order to sign a three-year deal with [[CBS Television Studios|CBS Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Nellie | last=Andreeva | title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' Show-runner Neal Baer Signs Big Overall Deal With CBS TV Studios | date=November 23, 2010 | url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/11/law-order-svu-showrunner-nael-bear-signs-big-overall-deal-with-cbs-tv-studios/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer was replaced by former ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' showrunner [[Warren Leight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Ausiello | title=Scoop: NBC Taps New Law &amp; Order: SVU Boss | date=April 11, 2011 | url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/04/law-order-svu-boss-warren-leight-13th-season/ |publisher=[[TVLine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, it was announced that Warren Leight signed a three-year deal with [[Sony Pictures Television]], that will allow him to work on ''SVU'' one more season, its seventeenth. Leight joined the show in [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|season thirteen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' Showrunner Warren Leight Sets Overall Deal with Sony TV (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/law-order-svu-showrunner-warren-leight-sets-overall-deal-with-sony-tv-exclusive-1201451967/|accessdate=May 11, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on March 10, 2016 that original ''Law &amp; Order'' veteran producer Rick Eid would take Leight's place as showrunner starting in season 18. Creator Dick Wolf commented to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "I'm extremely pleased that Rick had decided to rejoin the family and hope that he will be here for years to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stanhope |first1=Kate |title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' Taps Flagship Series Vet as New Showrunner|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/law-order-svu-taps-flagship-874434 |accessdate=March 20, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During post-production of season 18, following the announcement that ''SVU'' was renewed for a nineteenth season, it was revealed that Rick Eid departed the series.

It was announced on May 25, 2017 that original ''Law &amp; Order'' and ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent'' showrunner [[Michael S. Chernuchin]] would be reprising his role starting on season nineteen. Chernuchin was also co-creator and executive producing showrunner of ''[[Chicago Justice]]'', another Wolf-related show that was canceled by NBC at the end of the 2016–17 TV season.&lt;ref name="ChernuchinSVU"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otterson|first1=Joe|title='Law and Order: SVU' Taps 'Chicago Justice' EP Michael Chernuchin as New Showrunner|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/law-order-svu-new-showrunner-michael-chernuchin-1202445137/|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 25, 2017|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Image:Law&amp;OrderSVUFilmingatnightinCentralPark.jpg|thumb|350px|left|''SVU'' shooting on location in [[Central Park]] at night]]
Many exterior scenes of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' are filmed on location in New York City, Wolf's hometown, throughout all five of [[Borough (New York City)|New York City's boroughs]]. As the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] encounters varied law enforcement challenges on a daily basis, the backdrop provides the writers a supply of ideal locations from which to choose.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 2-3"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] served as the filming location for Detective [[Elliot Stabler]]'s residence in [[Queens]], New York.&lt;ref name=Kimpton/&gt;

When searching for a place to film the interiors of the show, the producers found that there were no suitable studio spaces available in New York City. As a result, a space was chosen at NBC's Central Archives building in nearby [[North Bergen, New Jersey]], which had sat empty for some time, and featured air-conditioning, adequate parking, and {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of stage area.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 14"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt; The Archives building was used for police station and courtroom scenes,&lt;ref name=Kimpton&gt;Kimpton, Roger. "Hollywood on the Palisades"; ''Palisade'' magazine; Summer 2010; Pages 12–15&lt;/ref&gt; with various other locations in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] used for other scenes, such as a scene shot at the Meadowlands Parkway in [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]] in 2010. The production left New Jersey for New York in 2010, however, when New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. Assata. "Getting the film crews back to NJ", ''[[The Union City Reporter]]'', February 13, 2011, pages 5 and 7&lt;/ref&gt; The show moved into the studio space at [[Chelsea Piers]] that had been occupied by the original ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' series until its cancellation in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last= Ausiello | title=It's official: NBC cancels 'Law &amp; Order' | date=May 14, 2010 | url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/05/14/nbc-cancels-law-order-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/06/law-order-svu-leaves-new-jersey-over-nixed-tax-credit-may-move-into-lo-set/|title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' Leaves New Jersey Over Nixed Tax Credit &amp; May Move Into 'L&amp;O' Set|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Mail.com Media]]|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast history===

Casting for the lead characters of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at [[Rockefeller Center]]. The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists. For the female lead, Detective [[Olivia Benson]], actresses [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Reiko Aylesworth]], and [[Mariska Hargitay]] were being considered. For the male role, Detective [[Elliot Stabler]], the finalists were [[Tim Matheson]], [[John Slattery]], [[Nick Chinlund]], and [[Christopher Meloni]]. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose—Hargitay and Meloni." Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. [[Garth Ancier]], then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 11"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

The first actor to be cast for the show was [[Dann Florek]]. Florek had originated the character of Captain [[Donald Cragen|Don Cragen]] in the 1988 pilot for ''Law &amp; Order'' and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives, who wanted to add female characters to the all-male primary cast. He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf, however, and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show. Shortly after Florek reprised his role for ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie]]'', he received a call to be on ''Sex Crimes''.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 145-146"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 13"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', [[Richard Belzer]] heard that [[Benjamin Bratt]] had left ''Law &amp; Order''. Belzer requested his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer's character from ''Homicide'', Detective [[John Munch]], to become the new partner of [[Jerry Orbach]]'s character, Detective [[Lennie Briscoe]], since they had previously teamed in three ''Homicide'' crossovers. Wolf loved the idea, but had already cast [[Jesse L. Martin]] as Briscoe's new partner, Detective [[Ed Green]]. The idea was reconfigured, however, to have Munch on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' instead.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 13" /&gt; Since the character of Munch was inspired by [[David Simon]]'s depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman and developed for ''Homicide'' by [[Tom Fontana]] and [[Barry Levinson]], the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three. The appropriate agreements were reached and, while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights, contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show in which Munch is a main character; as a result, Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 150"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Winters]] was cast as Munch's partner, [[Brian Cassidy]], at the insistence of Belzer. Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother, and told Wolf, "Well, I'll do this new show of yours, ''SVU'', only if you make Dean Winters my partner."&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 13" /&gt; Wolf did make Winters Belzer's partner, but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time, the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. Since the role on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' was only initially meant to be a few episodes, Winters was forced to leave when it was time to film ''Oz'' again. Winters returned for the Season 13 finale, "[[Rhodium Nights]]", reprising his role as Cassidy. He also appeared (as Cassidy) on the two-part Season 14 premiere "[[Lost Reputation]]"/[[Above Suspicion (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|"Above Suspicion"]].&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 157"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;157&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a recurring character into season 15. The void left by Winters's departure was filled for the remainder of the season by [[Michelle Hurd]] as Detective [[Monique Jeffries]], a character who Wolf promised that, despite starting out as a minor character with one scene in the pilot, would eventually develop. Hurd left the show at the beginning of season two to join the cast of ''[[Leap Years]]''.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 154-156"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;154–156&lt;/ref&gt; Munch's permanent partner came in the form of [[rapping|rapper]]-turned-actor [[Ice-T]], who had previously worked with Wolf on ''[[New York Undercover]]'' and ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie|Exiled]]''. Ice-T originally agreed to do only four episodes of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', but he quickly gained affection for the ensemble nature of the cast. He relocated to New York City before his four-episode contract was up and remained with the show as Munch's permanent partner, Detective [[Fin Tutuola|Odafin "Fin" Tutuola]].&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 152-154"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;152–154&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the show focused exclusively on the policework of the detectives in the Special Victims Unit of the 16th precinct, with members of the District Attorney's office occasionally appearing as guest roles crossing over from the original ''Law &amp; Order''. From season two onwards, the format was changed to be more faithful to the original ''Law &amp; Order'' concept by including court cases. [[Stephanie March]] had little television experience before being cast on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', nor did she watch much TV. Nevertheless, March was cast as Assistant District Attorney [[Alexandra Cabot]] at the beginning of season two but still believed that, due to the grim nature of the series, it would be short-lived. She stayed with the series for three seasons, however, and left when she believed she had reached the natural conclusion of the character's development. She would later reprise the character as a guest appearance in season six and as a regular character on the short-lived Wolf series, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'', where she was promised more to do. [[Diane Neal]] had previously guest starred on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' in season three before being cast as Cabot's replacement, [[Casey Novak]], in season five. Neal remained with the show through the end of season nine,&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 167-169"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;167–169&lt;/ref&gt; after which she was replaced by [[Michaela McManus]]. March returned to the show in the tenth season (after McManus' departure from the cast) when [[Neal Baer]] proposed Cabot receive a character arc to revitalize the second part of the season, which would continue through season eleven.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 165-166"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;165–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{Cite news|last=O'Connor |first=Mickey |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-News-Mariska-1007513.aspx |title=SVU News: Mariska and Meloni Are In For Season 11, and So Is Christine Lahti |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=June 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802191337/http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-News-Mariska-1007513.aspx |archivedate=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamara Tunie]] was cast as [[medical examiner]] [[Melinda Warner]] in season two after working with Wolf previously on ''[[New York Undercover]]'', ''[[Feds (TV series)|Feds]]'', and ''Law &amp; Order''. Warner was initially a [[recurring character]] but became a regular character in season seven, and Tunie was added to the opening credits at that time.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 172-173"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;172–173&lt;/ref&gt; When initially cast as Warner, Tunie was appearing as attorney Jessica Griffin on the [[CBS]] daytime soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]''. From 2000 to 2007 (and again briefly in 2009), she appeared on both series simultaneously. In 2002, she also appeared on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] espionage-themed drama series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in the recurring role of CTU Acting Director Alberta Green. [[BD Wong]] was asked to film four episodes as Dr. [[George Huang (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|George Huang]], a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] and [[Offender profiling|criminal profiler]] on loan to the Special Victims Unit. After his four episodes, he was asked to stay on with the show.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 175-176"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

After he starred in ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (film)|Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]'' and guest starred as Detective [[Chester Lake (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Chester Lake]] in the eighth season, Wolf felt that [[Adam Beach]] would be a good addition to the cast and asked him to be a permanent member beginning with the ninth season. Although Beach felt the role was a "dream role", the character proved unpopular with fans who felt that he was designed to gradually write out either Richard Belzer or Ice-T. Feeling there were too many police characters on the show, Beach left the show after only one season.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 160-162"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;160–162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michaela McManus]] was originally felt to be too young for the role of an [[District attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] (ADA) before being cast as ADA [[Kim Greylek]] in the tenth season. McManus, months removed from a recurring role on ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', remained with the series only half a season, however, before departing for unspecified reasons.&lt;ref name="Green and Dawn 170-171"&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Patton]] joined the cast as [[Kendra Gill|ADA Mikka Von]]. She replaced [[Stephanie March]].&lt;ref name="TVGuidePattonADAVon"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Paula-Patton-SVU-1020796.aspx|title=Precious Star Paula Patton Is Law &amp; Order: SVU's New ADA|last=O'Connor|first=Mickey|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Patton dropped out after one episode to film ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', and was replaced by [[Melissa Sagemiller]] in the recurring role of [[Gillian Hardwicke|ADA Gillian Hardwicke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/09/10/law-order-svu-melissa-sagemiller-is-new-ada/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911202232/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/09/10/law-order-svu-melissa-sagemiller-is-new-ada/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 11, 2010 |title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' scoop: 'Bar' girl Melissa Sagemiller is new ADA |last=Ausiello |first=Michael |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-Producer-Neal-1022845.aspx|title=SVU Producer Neal Baer Explains ADA Shakeup|last=Rudolph|first=Ileane |work=[[TV Guide]]|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of season twelve, Mariska Hargitay asked for a lighter workload. As a way of writing her out of certain episodes, a plan to have her character promoted to a supervisory role was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/05/exclusive-mariska-hargitay-inks-new-law-order-svu-deal-may-pass-baton-to-jennifer-love-hewitt/|title=Law &amp; Order: SVU Scoop: Hargitay Inks New Deal, Jennifer Love Hewitt May Succeed Her|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=[[TVLine]]|publisher=

Wong added, "I don't know if or when I'll be back on ''SVU''! It was amazing to have such a cool job for 11 years and to be a real NY Actor."

In season 14, [[Raúl Esparza]] joined the cast in a recurring capacity as [[Rafael Barba|ADA Rafael Barba]] and prior to the season 15 premiere, Esparza was promoted to a series regular. Also in season 15, Belzer departed the cast in the fifth episode, "Wonderland Story", in which Sgt. Munch retired from the NYPD and took a job in the DA's office as an investigator. Later in the season, Captain Cragen announced his departure from the NYPD, which made newly promoted Sgt. Benson the temporary squad commander. In leaving the cast, Florek ended a 400-episode run as Captain Cragen. In season 16, [[Peter Scanavino]] joined the series, first in a recurring role for episodes 1–3 and then was promoted to the main cast in episode 5, with Kelli Giddish, Danny Pino, Ice-T and Raúl Esparza no longer appearing in every episode.

By season twelve, both Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni had become among the highest-paid lead actors on a drama, with each earning nearly $400,000 per episode, a salary that ''[[TV Guide]]'' said was exceeded only by ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''&amp;apos;s [[Hugh Laurie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Top-TV-Earners-1021717.aspx |title= Who Are TV's Top Earners? |author= Stephen Battaglio |date=August 10, 2010|publisher=[[TV Guide]] | accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During season sixteen, Hargitay was reported to be earning $450,000 per episode, or $10,350,000 per season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emjl45mehj/no-2-mariska-hargitay-2/ |title=No. 2: Mariska Hargitay – pg.4 Forbes |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In season seventeen, her salary increased to $500,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By: Garrett |url=http://thechive.com/2015/09/21/the-highest-paid-tv-actors-of-all-time-make-a-lot-of-money-per-episode-26-photos/#slide-13 |title=Per episode salaries of the highest paid TV actors of all time |publisher=theCHIVE |date=2015-09-21 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series overview==
{{quote box |width=35% |align=right|border=3px|fontsize=105%|quote=In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.|source={{nb10}}– Opening narration spoken by [[Steven Zirnkilton]]&lt;ref name="Payback" /&gt;}}

Based out of the [[New York City Police Department]]'s 16th precinct in Manhattan, ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' delves into the dark side of the New York underworld as the detectives of a new elite force, the [[Special Victims Unit]] (SVU for short), investigate and prosecute various sexually-oriented crimes including rape, pedophilia, and domestic violence. They also investigate the abuses of children, the disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require specialist handling. All the while trying to balance the effects of the investigation on their own lives. Its stories also touch on the political and societal issues associated with gender identity, sexual preferences, and equality rights. While the victim is often murdered, this is not always the case, and victims frequently play prominent roles in episodes. The unit also works with the Manhattan District Attorney's office as they prosecute cases and seek justice for SVU's victims and survivors with precision and a passion to win and bring closure to the intense investigations. The series often uses stories that are "ripped from the headlines" or based on real crimes. Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing some details.&lt;ref name="NPR 2009-09-29"&gt;{{Cite news| first=Neal | last=Conan | authorlink= Neal_Conan | title= 'Law &amp; Order' Writer Turns Headlines Into TV | date=September 29, 2009 | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113308543 | work = [[Talk of the Nation]] | publisher = [[NPR]] | accessdate =December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the show focused around the detective pairings of [[Elliot Stabler]] &amp; [[Olivia Benson]] and [[John Munch]] &amp; [[Brian Cassidy]]. Stabler is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all and tries his best to protect his family from the horrors he sees every day. His partner Benson's difficult past as the child of a rape victim is the reason she joined the unit. Backing them up is John Munch, and his first partner Brian Cassidy. Munch is a transfer from Baltimore's homicide unit, who brings his acerbic wit, conspiracy theories, and street-honed investigative skills. While Cassidy is young and eager to learn from his fellow detectives. These two detective teams received support from Detectives [[Monique Jeffries]] and Ken Briscoe.&lt;ref name="Payback"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Payback| episodelink = | credits=Writer: [[Dick Wolf]]. Director: [[Jean de Segonzac]] | network = NBC | series = Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit| airdate = September 20, 1999| season = 1| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cassidy transferred to Narcotics after thirteen episodes, Jeffries was partnered with Munch for the remaining of Season One and Briscoe was phased out. In the beginning of season two, Munch was then permanently partnered with Detective [[Fin Tutuola|Odafin "Fin" Tutuola]], whose unique yet sometimes vulgar sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch.&lt;ref name="Limitations"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Limitations| episodelink = | credits=Writer: [[Michael R. Perry]]. Director: [[Constantine Makris]] | network = NBC | series = Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit| airdate = February 11, 2000| season = 1| number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These detectives were supervised by veteran Captain [[Donald Cragen]] who oversaw the team from seasons 1–15. Cragen's tough-but-supportive approach to the team's complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day. Also on the team's payroll is FBI Special Agent Dr. George Huang and Medical Examiner Dr. Melinda Warner. As the resident psychiatrist for the Special Victims Unit, Huang helps keep the officers sane in a field that could drive ordinary people mad. He has also served as the squad's resident criminal profiler, and his insights into the criminal mind have often helped the officers to crack the toughest perps, while Warner has become an integral part of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, and her personal skills have contributed to the unit's high success rate in closing cases.

The Unit did not receive a full-time assistant district attorney until season two, when [[Alexandra Cabot]] was assigned to work with the detectives.&lt;ref name="Wrong is Right"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Wrong is Right| episodelink = | credits=Writers: Jeff Eckerle &amp; [[David J. Burke]]. Director: [[Ted Kotcheff]] | network = NBC | series = Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit| airdate = October 20, 2000| season = 2| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cabot's departure in season five, she was replaced by [[Casey Novak]], who remained as the ADA until the end of season nine. [[Kim Greylek]] became the permanent ADA in the season ten premiere, until Cabot made a return midway through that season when Greylek departed. Cabot remained the ADA through the second half of season eleven. After Cabot's departure, the ADA void was filled by Sonya Paxton ([[Christine Lahti]]) and Jo Marlowe ([[Sharon Stone]]) until the conclusion of season eleven. Gillian Hardwicke served as the SVU ADA during season twelve. In season thirteen, both Cabot and Novak returned as ADAs. From the beginning of season fourteen, ADA [[Rafael Barba]] had been SVU's prosecutor, until leaving halfway through season nineteen. ''[[Chicago Justice]]'''s [[Peter Stone (Chicago and Law &amp; Order character)|Peter Stone]] became SVU's ADA after ''Chicago Justice'' was canceled after only one season.

In season 13, other big changes happened when Stabler left in the season twelve finale. Detectives [[Nick Amaro]] and [[Amanda Rollins]] joined the team filling the void left by Stabler. Amaro brings empathy to his cases while dealing with a stressful home life, while Rollins' dogged persistence and instincts help her close cases, but her secrets could derail her career. In the current seasons, the Manhattan SVU is now run by Lieutenant Olivia Benson.

==Reception==

===U.S. television ratings===
''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' premiered on Monday, September 20, 1999. After nine episodes, the show was moved to Friday nights, where it found its audience and following its first and second seasons became a Top 20-overall show, overcoming the "[[Friday night death slot]]" phenomenon. Beginning with the season five, the show aired on Tuesdays to compete with CBS' ''[[Judging Amy]]'' and ABC's ''[[NYPD Blue]]''. In its later years, ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' consistently outperformed ''Law &amp; Order'' in the Nielsen ratings for first run episodes until the latter's cancellation in 2010.

In 2016, a ''[[New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that ''SVU''{{'}}s popularity was "atypical: generally slightly more popular in rural areas and the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]], but largely restricted to the eastern half of the country. It's most popular in [[Albany, N.Y.]]; least in Colorado and Utah".&lt;ref name="katz20161227"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title='Duck Dynasty' vs. 'Modern Family': 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=2016-12-27 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May (with the exception of the second and tenth season), which coincides with the completion of May [[sweeps]].''

'''Mohammed Mana Ahmed al-Qahtani''' ({{lang-ar|محمد مانع أحمد القحطاني}}) (sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''al-Kahtani''') (born November 19, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/guantanamo/detainees/63-mohammed-al-qahtani/documents/11&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] citizen who has been detained as an al-Qaeda Agent since June 2002 in the [[United States]]'s [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s in [[Cuba]]. Qahtani allegedly tried to enter the [[United States]] to take part in the [[September 11 attacks]] as the [[20th hijacker]] and was due to be onboard Flight 93 along with the four other hijackers. He was refused entry due to suspicions that he was trying to immigrate. He was later captured in Afghanistan in the [[battle of Tora Bora]] in December 2001.

After military commissions were authorized by Congress, in February 2008, Qahtani was charged on numerous counts. In May, the charges were dropped without prejudice. New charges were filed against him in November 2008 and dropped in January 2009, as evidence had been obtained through [[torture]] and was inadmissible in court. This was the first time an official of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] had admitted any torture of detainees at Guantanamo.

In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview in January 2009, [[Susan J. Crawford|Susan Crawford]] of the Department of Defense said that the U.S. government had so abused Qahtani through isolation, [[sleep deprivation]], [[Nudity#Imposed nudity|forced nudity]] and exposure to cold that he was in a "life-threatening condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Bob | last=Woodward | title=Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official | date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trutho"&gt;[http://www.truth-out.org/1006095 "Court Documents Reveal Existence of New Torture Tapes"], TruthOut, 6 October 2009, accessed 12 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="confess"&gt;[http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2009/01/20/bush-era-ends-with-guantanamo-trial-chiefs-torture-confession/ "Bush Era Ends With Guantánamo Trial Chief’s Torture Confession"], Andy Worthington, 20 January 2009, accessed 5 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mohammed al-Qahtani was born in 1979 in [[Kharj]], Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/63.html Prisoner 63"], Wikileaks&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Saudi national from a large sunni family.  His father served as a police officer for 28 years. His mother remained at home to raise their twelve children. He has seven brothers and four sisters, who range in age from 14 to 42 years of age.

==Denied entry by US immigration==
On August 3, 2001, Qahtani at the age of 21 flew into [[Orlando, Florida]], from [[Dubai]]. He was questioned by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|immigration]] agent [[José Meléndez-Pérez]], who was dubious that he could support himself with only $2,800 cash to his name, and suspicious that he intended to become an [[illegal immigrant]], as he was using a one-way ticket.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt; He was sent back to Dubai, and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia.

==Transfer to Guantanamo==
Captured in the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], Qahtani was shipped by the Americans with other detainees to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] set up at the United States Navy base at [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. He continued giving a false name, and insisted he had been in the area solely to pursue an interest in [[falconry]].&lt;ref name="mayer"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jane Mayer|Mayer, Jane]] |title=[[The Dark Side (book)|The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals]] |date=2008 |publisher=Anchor Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0307456298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|140}}

After ten months, U.S. Border and Immigration Authorities took a fingerprint sample and discovered that he was the same person who had tried to enter the United States just before the [[September 11 attacks]]. Seizing the airports CCTV surveillance recrodings, the FBI claimed they were able to identify the car of [[Mohamed Atta]] at the airport, believed there to pick up Qahtani.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;
Another military account stated that Qahtani was identified as someone who had previously been turned away due to visa problems – by fingerprints "taken in Southwest Asia".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the military invited FBI interrogators to interview Qahtani. By the fall of 2002, they were frustrated by his resistance. DOD interrogators talked of using different techniques, based on a class they attended.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;

Shortly after September 26, 2002, top administration political appointees: [[David Addington]], the VP's chief of staff; [[Alberto Gonzales]], then [[White House Counsel]]; [[John A. Rizzo]] of the CIA; [[William Haynes II]], General Counsel of DOD; his legal assistant, [[Jack Goldsmith]]; and two Justice Department lawyers, [[Alice S. Fisher]] and [[Patrick F. Philbin]], flew to [[Camp Delta]] to view Qahtani and talk with his interrogators. They were trying to develop ways to break down detainee resistance and had come up with a list of potential techniques to be used.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;{{rp|198–202}}

Lieutenant Colonel [[Diane Beaver]], the top legal adviser at Guantanamo, suggested to her command in [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] that acting with "pure intent" was important, and they might seek immunity from "command authorities" prior to using such harsh interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;{{rp|198–202}} (In August 2002, the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], Department of Justice, had provided legal opinions (later called the [[Torture Memos]]) to the CIA that narrowly defined torture and authorized the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], since commonly defined as torture).

The political appointees went on to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to view [[José Padilla (prisoner)|Jose Padilla]], and finally to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to view [[Yaser Esam Hamdi]]. These men were United States citizens. Like the foreign detainees in Guantanamo, they were held in solitary confinement, where most human contact was with their interrogators, according to a theory about how to develop dependence among prisoners, for long-term gathering of intelligence by interrogators. At this time, none of the detainees, including the American citizens, had access to counsel or federal courts.&lt;ref name="mayer"/&gt;

Qahtani had initially been [[interrogate]]d by FBI agents, who used standard techniques based in police work. On December 2, 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld authorized in writing the use of 17 [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] to be used against Qahtani (see next section).&lt;ref name=Nyt040621&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B16F9395D0C728EDDAF0894DC404482 "U.S. Said to Overstate Value of Guantánamo Detainees"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 21, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After details of Qahtani's status were leaked in 2004, the [[US Department of Defense]] issued a press release stating that Qahtani had admitted:
*He had been sent to the US by [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the lead architect of the 9/11 attack;
*He had met [[Osama bin Laden]] on several occasions;
*He had terrorist training at two al-Qaeda camps;
*He had been in contact with many senior al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name=Nyt040621/&gt;

Al-Qahtani is also said to have informed interrogators that he had received operational training in covert communications from [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]], whom he identified as a courier for Osama bin Laden. This was an early lead at a time when the hunt for bin Laden by other means had ground to a halt, but, as the national security expert [[Peter Bergen]] has noted, it had to be combined with another eight years of work, relying on a wide variety of techniques of intelligence-gathering, to culminate in the US government's [[Operation Neptune Spear|2011 raid on the bin Laden compound]] in [[Abbottabad]], Pakistan and killing of the al-Qaeda leader.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter.

At Guantánamo, Mohammed al-Qahtani was subjected to a regime of 17 aggressive interrogation techniques, known as the "First Special Interrogation Plan," authorized in writing by [[US Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] on December 2, 2002, and implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo, Major General [[Geoffrey D. Miller|Geoffrey Miller]].&lt;ref name=Nyt040621/&gt;&lt;ref name=CCRDeclarationAQ&gt;{{cite web | title =Interrogation Log Detainee 063| publisher =Center for Constitutional Rights| date =2002-11-23| url =http://ccrjustice.org/files/Publication_AlQahtaniLog.pdf| accessdate =2008-02-29|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; After complaints from military investigators, the list of approved techniques was reduced.&lt;ref name=Nyt040621/&gt;

The special interrogation plan and techniques were not revealed until 2008 in testimony to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] during its investigation of detainee treatment, and were reported by the FBI Inspector General, [[Glenn Fine]].&lt;ref name="trutho"/&gt; The authorized techniques were related to those described in the three August 2002 legal opinions, later known as the [[Torture Memos]], drafted by [[John Yoo]] and signed by [[Jay S. Bybee]] of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], issued to the CIA.

Under these coercive techniques, Qahtani gave additional information, including naming 30 other prisoners as working directly for bin Laden. The military used this information as justification to hold the men as [[enemy combatants]]. But, because the material was extracted under torture, it was later considered inadmissible in court. Qahtani later recanted this testimony, saying he had given the names of other detainees only to stop the abuse.

It was not until February 2008 that Qahtani was first charged before a [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|military commission]], and the prosecution dropped the charges in May of that year. He was charged again in November 2008, but on January 14, 2009, [[Susan J. Crawford]], a senior Pentagon official of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], stated that she would not proceed with his prosecution. She said that Qahtani's "treatment met the legal definition of torture.... The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive".&lt;ref name=officialtorture/&gt; As [[convening authority]] of the military commissions, Crawford was responsible for overseeing the Guantanamo military commissions.&lt;ref name=officialtorture&gt;{{cite news | title =Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official| url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html| accessdate =2009-01-14 | work=The Washington Post | first=Bob | last=Woodward | date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her statement was the first time any top official of the Bush administration had said there was torture of detainees at Guantanamo.

===Interrogation log===
{{main|Enhanced interrogation techniques}}
{{wikisource|Secret ORCON: Interrogation Log Detainee 063}}
On March 3, 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published the secret log of 49 days of the 20-hour-per-day interrogation of Qahtani at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] from late November 2002 to early January 2003.&lt;ref name=InterrogationLog&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/2006/log/log.pdf Interrogation log], [[US Department of Defense]], November 23, 2002 through January 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This had been leaked to the press.&lt;ref name=BioethicsJournal&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The log described Qahtani being forcibly administered intravenous fluids, drugs, and  enemas, in order to keep his body functioning well enough for the interrogations to continue.&lt;ref name=BioethicsJournal/&gt; The log, titled ''SECRET ORCON INTERROGATION LOG DETAINEE 063'', offers a daily, detailed account of the [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] used from November 23, 2002, to January 11, 2003.

These included the following:
* Forced to submit to an enema
* Beatings
* Placed in stress positions for long periods of time in order to induce severe pain
* Threats made against his family, including female members
* Forced nudity, including in the presence of female personnel
* Placed in tight restraints for many months on end, day and night
* Lowering the temperature in the room, then throwing water on the detainee's face
* Restraint on a swivel chair for long periods
* Various humiliations, such as training the detainee to act as a dog, dance lessons, and forcing him to watch puppet shows depicting sexual acts between him and Osama bin Laden at his mock birthday party
* [[Deprivation of sleep]] for long periods
* Loud music and [[white noise]] played to prevent the detainee from sleeping
* Forcing the detainee to pray to bin Laden
* Various interrogation techniques described as "pride &amp; ego down", "[[circumstantial evidence]]", "fear-up", or "Al Qaeda falling apart"
* Threats of [[extraordinary rendition]] to countries that torture
* Strip searches
* Body searches
* Prohibiting detainee from praying for prolonged times and during [[Ramadan]]
* Threatening to desecrate the [[Koran]] in front of him
* Forced to pick up trash with his hands cuffed, while being called "a pig"
* Exposure to low temperatures for prolonged times
* Forcible administration of IVs by medical staff during interrogation, which were described by Qahtani as "repetitive stabs" each day
* Repeatedly screened a video of September 11 attacks
* Pictures of 9/11 victims taped to his body
* Forced to stand for U.S. national anthem and listen to interrogators and guards sing "God Bless America"

The interrogation log does not record Qahtani admitting to being a member of al-Qaeda. The entry for January 1, 2003, relates that Qahtani blames Osama bin Laden for deceiving the 19 9/11 hijackers ("his friends"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;2A0780 asked how one man, Bin Laden, convince {{sic}} 19 young men to kill themselves, (detainee was starting to fade he was going in and out of sleep.) The question was repeated, detainee stated that they were tricked, that he distorted the picture if {{sic}} front of them, 2A0780 asked detainee if this made him mad, detainee stated yes, (detainee did not realize that 2A780 {{sic}} had not started putting detainee into the picture) 2A0780 asked detainee if he was mad that his friends had been tricked, detainee said yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his friends knew about the plan, detainee said no, 2A0780 asked if detainee knew about the plan, detainee stated that he didn't know. 2A0780 asked detainee if it made him mad that he killed his friends, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if he was glad that he didn't die on the plane, detainee stated yes.  2A0780 asked detainee if his parents were happy that he didn't die detainee stated yes. 2A0780 stated "he killed your friends" detainee stated yes.&lt;ref name=InterrogationLog/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about his greatest sins in his life, Qahtani responded that he had not taken care of his parents properly, had not finished college, and had not been able to repay $20,000 he had borrowed from his aunt.&lt;ref name=InterrogationLog/&gt;

==Recanting==
On March 3, 2006, Qahtani's lawyer [[Gitanjali S. Gutierrez|Gitanjali Gutierrez]] said that her client had recanted the accusations he had made against fellow detainees during earlier periods of interrogation under torture.&lt;ref name=Time060303&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1169322,00.html Exclusive: "20th Hijacker" Claims That Torture Made Him Lie"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He had told his lawyer that he was forced to [[false confession|falsely confess]] and name names, in order to get his "enhanced interrogation" to end.&lt;ref name=Time060303/&gt; He had accused 30 other detainees of being former bodyguards of Osama bin Laden.

Given the circumstances of how Qahtani's confessions were obtained, lawyers for the other detainees argued that his testimony should not be used by the military as justification to detain their clients. They used this argument in their petitions for ''habeas corpus'' challenges for their clients. The government argued that, under the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] (2005), detainees could not use the federal courts for ''habeas corpus'' except on appeal.&lt;ref name=Time060303/&gt;

In its decision in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that the Detainee Treatment Act and the military commissions as established by the Department of Defense were unconstitutional for depriving detainees of ''habeas corpus'' and rights of due process, and that the military commissions had not been authorized by Congress.

==Military Commissions Act of 2006==
In the fall of 2006, Congress quickly passed and the President signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. It responded to the Court's concerns but mandated the restriction of detainees to the military commission system.

On February 9, 2008, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that the [[Office of Military Commissions]] was close to laying charges against six of the [[high-value detainees]] at Guantanamo, including Qahtani. He was believed to have been the planned 20th hijacker for the [[9/11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes20080209&gt;

Qahtani and the other five were charged on February 11, 2008, with war crimes and murder, and faced the [[death penalty]] if convicted.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20080209/&gt; [[Gitanjali Gutierrez]], an attorney with the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] (CCR), was representing Qahtani. Attorneys at CCR denounced the systematic use of torture against detainees and challenged the validity of the military commission. They said that evidence in Qahtani's death penalty case was obtained by torture.&lt;ref name=CCRchallengesevidence/&gt;

In their February 2008 press release, CCR said that "the military commissions at Guantanamo allow secret evidence, hearsay evidence, and evidence obtained through torture. They are unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice." &lt;ref name=CCRchallengesevidence&gt;{{cite web | title =CCR challenges validity of military commissions and use of torture evidence in new death penalty cases| publisher =Center for Constitutional Rights| date =2008-02-11| url =http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-challenges-validity-military-comissions-and-use-torture-evidence-new-dea| accessdate =2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide attempt===
According to his lawyer, in early April 2008, al-Qahtani tried to [[Guantanamo suicides|kill himself]] after learning that he faced charges that could carry the death penalty. He cut himself at least three times, causing "profuse bleeding" that needed hospital treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/20/us-guantanamo-qahtani-idUSN2032969320080520 | work=Reuters | title=Alleged 9/11 "20th hijacker" tried suicide: lawyer | date=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; When announcing the new charges, Morris stated that the new charges were based on "independent and reliable evidence". He stated: “His conduct is significant enough that he falls into the category of people who ought to be held accountable by being brought to trial.”

===Crawford orders charges dropped===
[[Susan Crawford (Pentagon)|Susan Crawford]], the senior official in charge of the [[Office of Military Commissions]], has the final authority over whether charges were laid. On January 14, 2009, after a change in administrations, Crawford ruled that the prosecution would not proceed against Qahtani because he had been subjected to interrogation techniques in Guantanamo that rose to the level of torture.&lt;ref name=Afps2009-01-14&gt;

He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp.  He promised to institute a new review system, convening a task force to review material on detainees that was made up of officials from six agencies, whereas the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense.  Reporting back a year later, the [[Joint Review Task Force]] recommended release and repatriation of 53 detainees. It classified other individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, although there was insufficient evidence to charge them with crimes. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.

Mohammed al Qahtani was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.
Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a [[Periodic Review Board]].

==Qahtani's 2014 federal appeals court order==
On 2 September 2014, a judicial panel for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second US Circuit Court of Appeals]] in New York stated that pictures and videos of Qahtani, taken while in detention, should remain classified. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented Mohammed al-Qahtani for this federal lawsuit, had sought to disclose these audiovisual materials under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The judges decided that the release of these pictures and videos "could logically and plausibly harm national security because these images are uniquely susceptible to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite violence against United States interests domestically and abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Representation in popular culture==
In a review of the drama film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'' (2012) about the hunt for [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Peter Bergen]], a national security analyst, compared the character of Ammar and the issue of torture to the treatment of Qahtani in detention. In a controversial passage, Ammar is interrogated under torture in the film and gives up the name of a bin Laden courier. Bergen notes that although Qahtani gave a name under alleged torture, it took another eight years, with US analysts using every form of intelligence-gathering from high technology to 'people on the ground,' for the government to locate and kill [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name="bergenzero"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/10/opinion/bergen-zero-dark-thirty Peter Bergen, "'Zero Dark Thirty': Did torture really net bin Laden?"], CNN, December 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources later suggested the character of Ammar was based on [[Ammar al-Baluchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://townhall.com/tipsheet/nicolebailey/2013/10/26/government-gave-zero-dark-thirty-filmmakers-classified-info-n1731985], Townhall, 26 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''movement demanding trial of war criminals''' is a protest movement in [[Bangladesh]], from 1972 to present.

==1972==
In 1972, the spouses of martyred intellectuals started the peaceful protest. Zahir Rayhan's wife took first step for this.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Desh, 26 February 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==1979==
In 1979 a protest started by the hand of Mujtijoddha Sangsod.&lt;ref&gt;Muktijoddha Sangsad, edited by Muntasir Rahman, third part&lt;/ref&gt;

==1988==
In 1988 protest was incited by Dr. M A Hasan's Shahid Lft. Selim Mancho.&lt;ref&gt;Juddhaporadh, Gonohotta O Bicharer Onneshon&lt;/ref&gt;

==1992==
As the ruler of Bangladesh, President [[Ziaur Rahman]] (1975–1981) enacted several controversial measures, ostensibly to win the support of Islamic political parties and opponents of the [[Awami League]]. In 1978, he revoked the ban on the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], which was widely believed to have collaborated with the Pakistani army and members of which are alleged to have committed war crimes against civilians.

[[Ghulam Azam]], the exiled chief of the Jammat-e-Islami, was allowed to come back to Bangladesh in July 1978. In 1991 December Ghulam Azam, was elected the Amir of Jamaat-e-Islam. Subsequently, [[Jahanara Imam]] organized the Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee (Committee to exterminate the Killers and Collaborators), and became its public face. The committee called for the trial of people who committed crimes against humanity in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War in collaboration with the Pakistani forces. The Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee set up mock trials in Dhaka in March 1992 known as Gonoadalot (Court of the people) and 'sentenced' persons they accused of being war criminals. Imam and others were charged with treason. This charge was, however, dropped in 1996 after her death by the Chief Advisor Mohammed Habibur Rahman of the Caretaker government of that time.

The activities of the "Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee" led by Jahanara Imam were deemed unlawful by the Government of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;"Shahid Janani Jahanara Imamer andoloner 15 bochor" by Shahriar Kabir, published by Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006==

On 22 May 2017, a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]] was carried out at [[Manchester Arena]] in Manchester, England, following a concert by [[Ariana Grande]] as part of her [[Dangerous Woman Tour]]. 22 of the concert-goers and parents who were in the entrance waiting to pick up their children following the show were killed, more than 500 were injured and 116 of those were seriously injured.

A few hours after the bombing, Grande posted on [[Twitter]]: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words. {{sic}}"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=ArianaGrande |number=866849021519966208 |date=23 May 2017 |title= broken. from the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry.

==Money raised==
The [[British Red Cross]] received £2.35 million (nearly $3 million) in donations during the three-hour concert for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund.

Francis Wilkinson, in [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg.com]], wrote that Grande offered "a face that was brave and kind in the wake of terror while accomplishing several useful goals – raising money for victims, bolstering courage and making the attacks look both puny and pointless.

Kory Grow in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', wrote "It felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Notes (software)|Notes]] app, "Helicopter hovering overhead," which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat.

{{quote|Less than two weeks after the attack, and with only a few days to privately process and mourn, Ariana returned to Manchester with an entire benefit concert she coordinated. ... She called in every favor, pulling in famous friends like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber to show up for the grieving city. After meeting with a parent of one of the victims, Grande said she shifted the tone of the show from somber to celebratory because she understood that it was what her fans needed. ... All night, Ariana performed without breaking, but that was when she had others by her side. ... When it was just her alone with her fans for her finale cover of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", the floodgates opened. In what will likely go down as one of the defining moments of her career, she paused the song, looked out to her audience, which was already sobbing along with her, then resumed the music to nail yet another impossible note.&lt;ref name=Vulture2017/&gt;|}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11034">'''Opera Theatre of Saint Louis''' (OTSL) is an American summer opera festival held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].  Typically four operas, all sung in English, are presented each season, which runs from late May to late June.  Performances are accompanied by the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]], which is divided into two ensembles, each covering two of the operas, for the season.  The company's performances are presented in the Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of [[Webster University]]. 

==First seasons and achievements==
In 1976, Leigh Gerdine, Laurance L. Browning, Jr. and James Van Sant co-founded OTSL.  They hired [[Richard Gaddes]], who at the time was working at The [[Santa Fe Opera]], as the company's first Artistic Director. They signed him as full-time General Director in 1978 at the suggestion of Ed Korn, who was brought in as a consultant from the Metropolitan Opera.  Gaddes acknowledged that the model for OTSL was The [[Santa Fe Opera]]:

: That was not a coincidence. I always say that John Crosby sired the Opera Theater of St. Louis. The whole concept was modeled on Santa Fe, and part of the idea was that the apprentices here would feed into St. Louis. Which they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Allan Kozinn | title=Stepping Aside at an Operatic Oasis; Founding Director of the Santa Fe Opera Looks Back on 43 Years of Innovation | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E6D81339F935A3575AC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=New York Times | date=6 September 2000 | accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season in 1976 presented eleven performances of [[Britten]]'s ''[[Albert Herring]]'', [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Impresario]]'', [[Gian Carlo Menotti|Menotti]]'s ''[[The Medium]]'', and [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Don Pasquale]].'' This mixture of some standard works, and some new and unconventional operas, was to continue in future seasons and characterize the company's approach.  This was achieved on a budget of $135,000.  The young singers included Sheri Greenawald and [[Vinson Cole]]. 
 
During the early seasons, the company had a major influence with such achievements as first joint [[BBC]]/[[WNET]] telecast of ''[[Albert Herring]]'' and in 1983 the first appearance by any U.S. [[opera company]] at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]. The first production of a Japanese opera in [[Japan]] by any American company was followed by a return to [[Tokyo]] in September 2001 to present the Japanese premiere of the classic ''[[The Tale of Genji|Genji Monogatari]],'' adapted as an opera by [[Minoru Miki]] as ''[[The Tale of Genji (opera)|The Tale of Genji]]''.

Well-known directors [[Graham Vick]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Mark Lamos]] have made U.S. operatic debuts with OTSL, as did [[conducting|conductor]]s [[Leonard Slatkin]] and [[Christopher Hogwood]]. [[Colin Graham]] served as OTSL's Director of Productions from 1978-1985.  [[John Nelson (conductor)|John Nelson]] was OTSL's Music Director from 1985 to 1988, and Principal Conductor from 1988 to 1991.

Other notable U.S. singers, including [[Christine Brewer]], [[Susan Graham]], [[Denyce Graves]], [[Dwayne Croft]], [[Thomas Hampson (baritone)|Thomas Hampson]], [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Patricia Racette]], [[Sylvia McNair]], and [[Stephanie Blythe]] have made appearances in St. Louis productions.  OTSL has presented 14 world premieres, including [[Stephen Paulus]]' ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (opera)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' in 1982, ''[[The Loss of Eden]]'' by Cary John Franklin in 2002;  [[David Carlson|David Carlson's]] ''Anna Karenina'', with a libretto by [[Colin Graham]]; [[Terence Blanchard]]'s [[Champion (opera)|Champion]] (2013), with a libretto by the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Michael Cristofer]]; and [[Ricky Ian Gordon]]'s ''Twenty-Seven'', with a libretto by [[Royce Vavrek]].  The last two operas have been part of the most recent OTSL series of commissioning new operas, under the "New Works, Bold Voices" initiative.  The third opera in this cycle is planned to be ''Shalimar the Clown'', with music by Jack Perla and libretto by Rajiv Joseph, scheduled for presentation in the 2016 OTSL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.opera-stl.org/about/news-press/2015/05/19/world-premiere-adapted-from-salman-rushdies-shalimar-the-clown-highlights-2016-season-repertory/ | title=World Premiere Adapted from Salman Rushdie’s Shalimar The Clown Highlights 2016 Season Repertory | publisher=Opera Theatre of Saint Louis | date=19 May 2015 | accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, OTSL has given 14 American premieres, including [[Michael Berkeley]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre (21st century opera)|Jane Eyre]]''; [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Paul Bunyan (operetta)|Paul Bunyan]]''; [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'' ''(The Journey to Reims)''; and [[Judith Weir]]'s ''[[The Vanishing Bridegroom]]''.

The company trains young artists in the [[Gerdine Young Artists]] program, named for Opera Theatre's founding board chairman, Leigh Gerdine.  The Gerdine Young Artists serve as the annual chorus for the company, as the company does not retain a resident chorus.  OTSL chorus directors have included Donald Palumbo, Cary John Franklin, Sandra Horst, and Robert Ainsley. 

==Administration==
Succeeding Gaddes as OTSL General Director was [[Charles MacKay (arts administrator)|Charles MacKay]], who held the post from 1985 to 2008.  MacKay had previously served as OTSL Executive Director, beginning in 1984.  MacKay led the campaign to construct and fund the new Sally S.

[[File:Women at work during the First World War Q32344.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Women of the Sixth (American) Unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital at Ostrovo]]

The '''Ostrovo Unit''' was the 7th [[Field hospital]] unit of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals]]. It comprised approximately 200 tents and was situated near [[Lake Ostrovo]], Macedonia during the [[First World War]] under the command of the [[Serbian Army]].
It was often called The America Unit as the money to fund it came from America and except for a few dressing stations, it was the Allied hospital nearest the front.

==Beginnings==
The unit opened in September 1916 soon after the [[Battle of Malka Nidzhe]] (Gornichevo ridge). Gornichevo ridge formed the twin summits of [[Kaimaktsalan]], 7,700 and 8,200 feet above sea level. This ridge had to be captured before Monastir ([[Bitola]] on modern British maps) could be re-taken. The first Chief Medical Officer, an Australian, Dr [[Agnes Elizabeth Lloyd Bennett]] recorded on the first day that they took 24 cases: "all terribly bad wounds - abdominal, chest, head and compound fractures." On 25 September she wrote: "We now have 160 cases, all bad and it is terribly hard work." During the first eight weeks the America Unit admitted 425 cases of whom sixty died.

==Location==
The unit was approximately ninety miles west of [[Salonika]] and was in a beautiful location. According to its third CMO Dr Isobel Emslie: "It lay quite by itself on a green sward in the hollow of the hills which rose on every side; close by was a clump of ancient elm-trees, the home of families of cawing rooks, and beyond the white tents of the hospital lay Lake Ostrovo."

Miles Franklin wrote: "The royal sunlight on the purple hills! Blue as heaven, high and peaked like cats' teeth, they intensified a longing for the Blue Bogongs that was ten years poignant." Franklin was inspired to write a story, ''By Far Kaimaktchalan'' and a piece entitled ''Somewhere in the Balkans'' but finished neither. ''Ne Mari Nishta'' remains her only finished account of her time there. She left in February 1918.

==Staff==
The America Unit was the fourth unit of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals]] in which at least ten Australian women  served including [[Agnes Bennett]], [[Mary De Garis]] and the novelist [[Miles Franklin]]. Other Australians served in a similar unit near Salonika. The Anglo-Irish medical physicist [[Edith Anne Stoney]] provided x-ray support to the unit while being based at Salonika.

==The Spirit of the Camp==
In Dr Isobel Emslie's words: "The spirit of this unit was a very pleasant one; the big, happy family of women was so entirely thrown on its own resources that it formed a very united body. Most of the sisters had been so much with the Serbians that they had learnt the language and were thoroughly in sympathy with them. Ours was a Serbian Army hospital, and we took our orders directly from Army Headquarters."
At the advanced dressing station established three hours drive further up [[Kaimaktsalan]] the unit took casualties direct from the battlefield. Dr Bennett wrote of the girls' courage during bombardment. However malaria and dysentery took such a toll on the staff that the station was closed in September 1917.

==Closure of the Unit==
On 30 September 1918 the unit received news of the armistice with Bulgaria and on the morning of 23 October the unit started for northern Serbia with a convoy of nine vehicles on a 311 kilometre trek. All the staff made the trip and the unit set up in an abandoned army barracks in [[Vranje]]. The unit was in operation until October 1919. Fifty two of the members of the Vranje Unit were decorated with the [[Royal Red Cross]] and several also received the [[Order of Saint Sava]].

'''PAX''' (originally known as '''Penny Arcade Expo''') is an overall term used to refer to a series of gaming culture festivals that involve; [[Tabletop game|tabletop gaming]], [[Arcade game|arcade gaming]], and [[video game|video gaming]]. PAX festival events are  held annually in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]; [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]]; and [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Australia]]. PAX was originally created by [[Jerry Holkins]] and [[Mike Krahulik]], the authors of the ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' [[webcomic]], because they wanted to attend a show exclusively for gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX East History|url=http://east.paxsite.com/what-is-pax|website=PAX East|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301014352/http://east.paxsite.com/what-is-pax|archivedate=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAX was first held in 2004. Defining characteristics of the festivals include an opening keynote speech from an industry insider, game-culture inspired concerts, panels on game topics, exhibitor booths from both independent and major game developers and publishers, a [[LAN party]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], tabletop gaming tournaments, and video game freeplay areas. Every PAX also features the Omegathon, a festival-long tournament consisting of a group of randomly selected attendees competing for a grand prize. The final round of the Omegathon makes up part of the closing ceremonies of PAX.  Past games for the final round of the Omegathon  have included ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Pong]]'', ''[[Halo 3]]'', and [[skee-ball]].

== History ==
{{Main article|History of PAX}}
[[File:Pennyarcadeexpocrowd.jpg|thumb|left|Crowds filling the Meydenbauer Center at PAX 2006]]
The first PAX, known at the time as the ''Penny Arcade'' Expo, was held on August 28–29, 2004, in [[Bellevue, Washington]], at the [[Meydenbauer Center]], and was attended by approximately 3,300 people. The event was then held annually in August, at the same venue, for the next two years. Attendance grew rapidly, with over 9,000 attendees in 2005, and over 19,000 in 2006.

[[File:PAX 2009 - Wil Wheaton (3888471061).jpg|thumb|left|Actor [[Wil Wheaton]] signs autographs at PAX 2009]]
By 2007, the event had outgrown its previous venue, and moved to the [[Washington State Convention and Trade Center]], which was twice the size. Attendance in 2007 was counted at 39,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Magrino |first= Tom |title= PAX 2010 descends on Boston |url= http://www.gamespot.com/news/6197016.html |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fnews%2F6197016.html&amp;date=2009-09-07 |work= Gamespot |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] |date= August 29, 2009 |archivedate= September 7, 2009 |accessdate= September 7, 2009 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, attendance grew to 58,500, and in 2009, it grew to 60,750.

In 2010, PAX held its first event on the East Coast. PAX East 2010 was held in Boston, from March 26–28, at the [[Hynes Convention Center]]. Attendance levels rivaled those of PAX 2009; PAX East 2010 was attended by 52,290. From then on, the original Washington festival was referred to as PAX Prime in order to avoid confusion between the two. PAX Prime 2010 was attended by 67,600 people, and involved off-site events for the first time.

PAX Prime 2011 was attended by over 70,000 people. For the two days prior to PAX Prime, an event called PAX Dev was held; it was exclusive to the game developer community, no press were permitted, and it was attended by 750 people. This supplemental event was created as a forum where "developers [could] speak freely and focus entirely on their trade".&lt;ref name="PAX Dev FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.paxsite.com/faqs.php |title=PAX Dev FAQs |publisher=dev.paxsite.com |date= |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331161611/http://dev.paxsite.com/faqs.php |archivedate=March 31, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the second annual PAX East was held in March 2011, at a new venue, the [[Boston Convention and Exhibition Center]].

PAX Prime 2013 was the first four-day PAX and took place from August 30 to September 2, 2013. Passes for PAX Prime 2013 sold out within six hours.

An agreement reached in early 2012 has extended Boston as the home of PAX East until 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Herald Staff |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/business/general/view/20220215pax_east_commits_to_boston_for_10_more_years/ |title=PAX East commits to Boston for 10 more years |work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Parilia''' is a [[Roman festival|festival]] of rural character performed annually on 21 April, aimed at cleansing both sheep and shepherd.  It is carried out in acknowledgment to the Roman deity [[Pales]], a deity  of uncertain gender who was a patron of shepherds and sheep.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;''The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Ed. Vol. X: The Augustan Empire 43 BC – AD 69''. Cambridge University Press. Great Britain: 1996. pp. 816-817&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] describes the Parilia at length in the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', an [[elegiac couplets|elegiac]] poem on the [[Roman calendar|Roman religious calendar]], and implies that it predates the [[founding of Rome]], traditionally 753 BC, as indicated by its [[pastoral]], pre-agricultural concerns. During the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], [[Roman agriculture|farming]] was idealized and central to Roman identity, so the festival took on a more generally rural character. Increasing urbanization caused the rustic Parilia to be reinterpreted rather than abandoned, as Rome was an [[mos maiorum|intensely traditional society]]. During the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], the date was celebrated as the "birthday" of Rome ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]] Romae)''.

==Ceremony==

The pastoral structure of the festival is carried out by the shepherd himself. After the sheep pen had been decorated with green branches and a wreath draped on the gate, the remainder of the ceremony took place in sequence. At the first sign of daylight, the shepherd would purify the sheep: by sweeping the pen and then constructing a bonfire of straw, olive branches, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], and sulfur.  The noises produced by this burning combination were interpreted as a beneficial omen. The shepherd would jump through this flame, dragging his sheep along with him.  Offerings of [[millet]], cakes, and milk were then presented before [[Pales]], marking the second segment of the ceremony.  After these offerings, the shepherd would wet his hands with dew, face the east, and repeat a prayer four times.  Such prayers requested Pales’s assistance in freeing the shepherd and the flock from evils brought about by accidental wrongdoings (e.g. trespassing on sacred grounds and removing water from a sacred water source).&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Fowler, Warde W. ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic''. MacMillan and CO, Limited. London: 1899. pp. 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt; The final portion of the rural festival made use of the beverage burranica, a combination of milk and ''[[Defrutum|sapa]]'' (boiled wine).  After consumption of this beverage, the shepherd would leap through the fire three times, bringing an end to the ceremony.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Butrica, James L. ''Propertius on the Parilia'' (4.4.73-8). Classical Quarterly 50.2. Memorial University of Newfoundland. Great Britain: 2000. pp. 472-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

The urban form of the Parilia, on the other hand, is blended with other Roman religious practices and carried out by a priest.  Ovid personally participated in this form and describes his experiences in the ''Fasti''.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Ovid. ''Fasti'';  Gower, John. ''Ovids Festivalls, or Romane calendar, translated into English verse equinumerally''. London: 1640.  pp. 93-97.&lt;/ref&gt; While the central actions of the rural ceremony carry over, the urban form adds two ingredients from other religious festivals: the Fordicidia and the [[October Horse]].  The [[Fordicidia]] sacrifices a pregnant cow to the deity [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] to promote cattle and field fertility.  The unborn calf is then removed from the womb and burnt.  The [[October Horse]] is the right hand horse of the team that won a particular chariot race on October 15 of the previous year.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Adkins, Lesley &amp; Roy A.  ''Dictionary of Roman Religion''.  Facts on File Inc.  New York: 1996.  pp. 82, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the ashes of the unborn calf and the blood from the head of the October Horse are mixed by the [[Vestals]] and are added to the burning bean straw of the bonfire.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; [[Dumézil]] questioned whether the ''Equus October'' provided the horse blood,&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 1, chap. 4 "Mars".&lt;/ref&gt; since the two ancient sources that mention the ingredient omit identifying the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Propertius ''Elegiae Romanae'' 4, 1, 19-20 (where the horse is described as ''curtus'', "dismembered"); Ovid ''Fasti'' IV, 721 sqq. The October Horse, however, is the only horse sacrifice known to have been practiced regularly by the Romans.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

By the end of the late Republic, the Parilia became associated with the birthday of Rome.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Kearns, Emily.  ''The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion''.  Oxford University Press.  Oxford: 2003.  pp. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous accounts of the founding of Rome exist, but the particular one related to the Parilia is described by Ovid in his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''.  According to this myth, [[Romulus]], upon reaching Rome on the day of the Parilia, took a stick and engraved a line in the ground that defined the boundaries of the new city ''([[pomerium]])''.  He then prayed to the gods [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] asking for protection of this area. However, his brother [[Remus]], unaware of the boundaries, crossed the line and was struck down by Romulus's henchman [[Celer (builder)|Celer]].&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;  

Over time, and under the influence of several Roman rulers, the structure of the Parilia changed.  First, after [[Julius Caesar]] heard the news of Roman Victory at [[Battle of Munda|Munda]] in 45 BC (around the date of the Parilia), he added games to the ceremony.  At these games, the citizens would wear crowns in Caesar’s honor. Caligula instituted into the celebration a procession of priests, noblemen, boys and girls of noble birth singing of his virtues while escorting the Golden Shield, previously bestowed upon him by the citizens of Rome, to the Capitol.{{cn|date=June 2013}} At this time the Parilia became Rome's birthday celebration rather than the rural festival it had once been.{{cn|date=June 2013}}  In 121 AD [[Hadrian]] founded a new temple of Venus and Roma and changed the festival’s name to Romaea. The temple was ruined.{{clarify|date=October 2016 |reason=which temple ruined by whom and when?}}&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

The '''planned presidential transition of Mitt Romney''', better known as the '''Romney Readiness Project''', refers to the [[United States presidential transition|planned transfer of power]] from [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] to [[Mitt Romney]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s candidate for president in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]]. Because Barack Obama was reelected as President, the transition did not take place.

The transition plan was the first to occur under the terms of the 2010 Pre-election Presidential Transition Act.&lt;ref name="ClarkReadiness"/&gt;

The Edward "Ted" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the [[Obama transition team]].

==Planning the transition==
{{Further information|Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012#"Readiness Project"}}
Known internally as "The Readiness Project", transition planning began in April 2012, several months before the [[2012 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name="KeaneTransition"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keane|first1=Angela|title=Trump Campaign Upends the Science of Presidential Transition|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-06/trump-s-campaign-upends-the-science-of-presidential-transition|accessdate=May 13, 2016|publisher=[[Bloomberg Politics]]|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Mike Leavitt]], it consisted of a skeleton staff of four until August, when additional employees were retained. The staff eventually grew to almost 300 people.&lt;ref name="SteinmetzTeam"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinmetz|first1=Katy|title=Planning a Presidency That Never Was: Inside the Romney Transition Team|url=http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/15/planning-a-presidency-that-never-was-inside-the-romney-transition-team/|accessdate=May 13, 2016|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayden|first1=Eric|title=Mitt Romney's Transition Website: Where 'President-Elect' Romney Lives On|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-transition-website-where-president-elect-romney/|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parker"/&gt; Other senior executives within the project included [[Robert Zoellick]] and [[Allan B. Hubbard|Al Hubbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Anna|title=Mitt transition efforts intensifying|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/09/mitt-transition-efforts-intensifying-081600?o=1|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=[[Politico]]|date=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities undertaken by the Readiness Project included preparing policy briefings for [[United States federal civil service|civil servant]]s at federal agencies, which would be delivered by "parachute teams" following the election; creating a list of candidates to fill the several hundred [[List of positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation|political appointments made by the President]]; coordinating with the [[Obama administration]] for the transfer of occupancy of presidential residences, including the [[White House]] and the [[Number One Observatory Circle]]; liaising with the [[United States Armed Forces]] for the assumption of [[National Command Authority]] and launch control of [[nuclear weapon]]s; and developing a post-election communications plan, which reportedly included a 1,000-word victory speech Romney would deliver.&lt;ref name="parker"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|author-link=Ashley Parker (journalist)|title=Campaigning Aside, Team Plans a Romney Presidency|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/us/politics/mitt-romneys-transition-team-is-hard-at-work.html|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nr"/&gt; On the evening of the election, the Readiness Project's transition website, declaring Romney's victory, was accidentally pushed live, but was quickly taken down again. The site was built by a Utah-based web development company, SolutionStream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=Kit|title=If Mitt Romney Had Won, Is This What His Website Would've Looked Like?|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3002828/if-mitt-romney-had-won-what-his-website-wouldve-looked|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, the project was provided with office space by the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) beginning in September 2012, two months prior to the election.&lt;ref name="parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nr" /&gt; The offices of the Readiness Project were shuttered and completely cleared within three days following Romney's defeat. Total spending by the Readiness Project between its inception and dissolution was $8.9 million, with those costs paid by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="nr"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fund|first1=John|author-link=John Fund|title=What was Romney Planning?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/338182/what-was-romney-planning-john-fund|accessdate=January 22, 2016|work=[[National Review]]|date=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contingency===
The Romney team was reported as having shaken off the fear of appearing presumptuous, a fear that hampered the Obama team and hindered them from making adequate transition preparations.&lt;ref name="BermanTakeover"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Russell|title=The Most Important Takeover of Any Organization in History|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/improving-the-presidential-transition-2016/477528/|accessdate=May 29, 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with the Obama presidential transition, Leavitt communicated directly with [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Jack Lew]], and the two coordinated a plan, putting members of the transition team in charge of various government departments in direct communication with members of the Obama administration. Leavitt described his new style of transition team as "essentially a federal government in miniature."&lt;ref name="BermanTakeover"/&gt;

==Impact==
The [[Ted Kaufman|Edward "Ted" Kaufman]] and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the Obama transition team. The organization said, "The new law creates a federal overseer for the presidential transition and requires each agency to name a person to manage the process."&lt;ref name="KeaneTransition"/&gt;

Leavitt agreed to work on the [[Planned presidential transition of Donald Trump|planning for Donald Trump's presidential transition]], even though he had not endorsed Trump.&lt;ref name="CanhamLeavitt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Canham|first1=Mike|title=Former Gov.

This is a very serious thing."&lt;ref name="FauldersTransition"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faulders|first1=Katherine|title=Donald Trump Camp Enlists Former Romney Aide Mike Leavitt in Transition Talks|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-camp-enlists-romney-aide-mike-leavitt/story?id=39257726|accessdate=May 26, 2016|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report by Leavitt===

'''Rakhri''' or Rakhrhee ({{lang-pa|ਰੱਖੜੀ}}) is the Punjabi word for [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhi]] and a festival observed by [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Nesbitt (2016) Sikhism: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=sikhs+raksha+bandhan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil9ZXF0KjdAhXKC8AKHT35DHEQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sikhs%20raksha%20bandhan&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marian de Souza, Gloria Durka, Kathleen Engebretson, Robert Jackson, Andrew McGrad (2007) International Handbook of the Religious, Moral and Spiritual Dimensions in Education.

It, like Raksha Bandhan, celebrates the relationship between brothers and sisters. Rakhri means “to protect” whereby a brother promises to look out for his sister and in return, a sister prays for the well being of her brother. A Rakhri can also be tied on a cousin or an unrelated man. If a woman ties a Rakhri on an unrelated man, their relationship is treated as any other brother and sister relationship would be. The festival is a siblings-day comparable to Mother's day/Father's day/Grandparents day etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siblingsdayfoundation.org/articles|title=Articles - Siblings Day Foundation|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==
A sister will tie the Rakhri on her brother and her brother will give a gift. Another feature of the celebration is the consumption of sweets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=raksha+bandhan+sikh+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCWoVChMIwba-7YnexwIVFEfbCh3lawop#v=onepage&amp;q=raksha%20bandhan%20sikh%20women&amp;f=false Kristen Haar, Sewa Singh Kalsi (2009) Sikhism]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no special ceremony but a sister will sing folk songs&lt;ref&gt;Pande, Alka  (1999)  Folk Music &amp; Musical Instruments of Punjab: From Mustard Fields to Disco Lights, Volume 1 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CgraAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rakhri++punjab+soldiers&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=rakhri++]&lt;/ref&gt; and  say something along the lines of:

'''Social Innovation Camp''' (SICamp) is a competition and event for software developers, designers and social innovators to create new businesses and projects that use the web to achieve a social goal. It is a method for [[social innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/reports/assets/features/the_open_book_of_social_innovation |title=Publications |website=Nesta.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total [[solar eclipse]] occurred on November 22, 1984. A solar eclipse occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. Totality was visible in [[Indonesia]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. West of the [[International Date Line]] the eclipse took place on November 23, including all land in the path of totality.

'''Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer''' ('''SMILE''') is a planned joint venture mission between the [[European Space Agency]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] to study the interaction between [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetosphere]] and the [[solar wind]], while simultaneously monitoring the magnetosphere's [[Plasma (physics)|plasma environment]].&lt;ref name="ESAstudySMILE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_and_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences_to_study_Smile_as_joint_mission|title=ESA and Chinese Academy of Sciences to study Smile as joint mission |publisher=ESA |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMILE-RFI" /&gt; Launch is expected at the end of 2021.&lt;ref name="ICLFirstHurdle"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_4-6-2015-12-39-12 |title=Solar wind monitoring mission passes the first hurdle |publisher=[[Imperial College London]] |first1=Hayley |last1=Dunning |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

SMILE will be equipped to simultaneously capture images and movies of the [[magnetopause]], [[polar cusp]]s, and [[aurora]].&lt;ref name="ESAstudySMILE" /&gt; Traditionally, satellites have taken local measurements of different regions to build up a global picture of the [[magnetosphere]]. However, a recent discovery that the magnetosphere emits X-rays will allow SMILE to capture more comprehensive data than previous missions did through the analysis of these X-rays.&lt;ref name="ICLFirstHurdle" /&gt;

Key instruments on board the spacecraft will include:&lt;ref name="ICLFirstHurdle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="proposal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~gbr/SMILE/images/SMILE_Executive_Summary.pdf| title = Joint Scientific Space Mission Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) - European Space Agency (ESA) PROPOSAL SMILE: Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer | first1=Graziella | last1=Branduardi-Raymon | first2=Chi | last2=Wang |format=PDF |accessdate=4 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Soft [[X-ray]] Imager''' (SXI) – used to study the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere.

The mission consists of a propulsion module and service module provided by the CAS, and a payload module containing all of the scientific instruments and an X-band communications system by the ESA. The launch will be conducted by ESA, while the Mission Operations Centre will be run by CAS; both organizations will jointly operate the Science Operations Centre.&lt;ref name="SMILE-RFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/57064-request-for-information-rfi-for-the-provision-of-the-payload-module-for-the-joint-esa-china-smile-mission/ |title=Request for Information (RFI) for the provision of the payload module for the joint ESA-China SMILE mission |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft is currently planned for launch in 2021 to a [[Molniya orbit]] with an [[apogee]] of 20 {{Earth radius}} ([[Earth radii]], where 1 {{Earth radius}} = 6,371&amp;nbsp;km) using a European Launch Vehicle. Mission cost is estimated to be {{Euro|92 million}}.&lt;ref name="proposal" /&gt;

==History==
Following the success of the [[Double Star (satellite)|Double Star]] mission, the ESA and [[Chinese Academy of Sciences|CAS]] decided to jointly select, design, implement, and launch a space mission together for the first time. After initial workshops, a call for proposals was announced in January 2015. After a joint [[peer review]] of mission proposals, SMILE was selected as the top candidate out of 16 proposed.&lt;ref name="ESAstudySMILE" /&gt; The SMILE mission proposal was jointly led by the [[University College London]] and the Chinese National Space Science Center. From June to November 2015, the mission entered initial studies for concept readiness, and final approval was given for the mission by the ESA Science Programme Committee in November 2015.&lt;ref name="ICLFirstHurdle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SMILE-RFI" /&gt;

A Request For Information (RFI) on provisions for the payload module was announced on 18 December 2015. The objective was to collect information from potential providers to assess low risk payload module requirements given stated interest in the mission, in preparation for the Invitation to Tender in 2016.&lt;ref name="SMILE-RFI" /&gt;

The '''Team USA Scholarship''' is a scholarship program to allow [[American people|American]] racing drivers to compete overseas. The competition selects young talents to compete in select auto events.

==History==
===Formula Ford Festival (part 1)===
[[File:Bryan Herta 2004 Indianapolis 500 Third Qual Day.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Winner of the 1991 scholarship, [[Bryan Herta]]. ]]
The event was launched late in the 1990 racing season. The Scholarship was set up with initial support from [[IndyCar Series]] team owner [[Rick Galles]], gentleman racer and business owner [[Jonathan Holtzman]] and [[Ford]] [[Special Vehicle Operations]].&lt;ref name="First Scholarship"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vasser For FF Festival|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1733|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadian Formula Ford 2000]] graduate [[Jimmy Vasser]] and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Sprint Car champion [[Jeff Gordon]] were selected to compete at the [[Formula Ford Festival]]. As Gordon had prior commitments in midget racing, so only Vasser made the trip to [[Brands Hatch]]. Vasser raced a [[Lanan Racing|Lanan]] 1604 chassis. The young American was involved in a crash with [[Steffan Nielsen]] in the heat race which ended is Festival.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?page_id=110|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Scholarship again partnered with Lanan Racing, now racing a [[Reynard Motorsports|Reynard]] chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1724|title=Herta to Represent U.S. in World Cup|last=|first=|date=1991-10-19|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herta qualified for the final race in 15th place and worked his way up to eleventh place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1991/48/interview-bryan-herta|title=Interview -- Bryan Herta|last=|first=|date=01-12-1991|website=Motorsport Magazine|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1992 two drivers were chosen to compete, [[Tony Ave]] and [[Ashton Lewis]]. The racers were selected after a test session at [[Snetterton Circuit|Snetterton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1712|title=Ave and Lewis to Represent U.S. in Formula Ford Festival|last=|first=|date=11-09-1992|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primus Racing]]/[[John Village Automotive]] entered three [[Van Diemen]] RF92 chassis. Two were driven by Ave and Lewis, a third was driven by [[Geoff Boss]] as a guest driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1709|title=Team USA Impresses in Shakedown Test|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boss was the fastest American driver qualifying fourth, but as his car did not pass technical inspection he had to start from the back of the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1706|title=Team USA Out of Luck in Qualifying|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was the best Team USA Scholarship driver in the 1992 Formula Ford Festival finishing fifteenth. Boss was unable to advance after starting last in his heat race. Ave collided with [[John Oxborrow]] in his heat race and failed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1703|title=Lewis Finishes Fifth at Brands Hatch|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Nadeau]] was the sole driver selected for the Team USA Scholarship for 1993. The [[North Carolina]] native qualified on pole position for his heat race, winning the race in his year old Van Diemen RF92. He won the race with an advantage of over 26 seconds over [[Jan Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1683|title=Nadeau Scores Stunning Victory in Fastest Heat Race|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFter a second place in the semi-final race, Nadeau started the final in third. Racing with other young talents such as [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Jan Erik Löfgren]] Nadeau had to settle for fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1680|title=Nadeau Claims Fighting Fourth in Thrilling Festival Finale|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Borkwoski]] and [[Clay Collier]] were selected to race in the Formula Ford Festival [[Ford Zetec|Zetec]] class. The Festival was unsuccessful for both drivers with neither progressing into the final race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1672|title=Team USA Shut out in Formula Ford Festival|last=|first=|date=|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International F3 Trophy===
For 1995 Team USA Scholarship had an agreement with [[Dick Bennetts]], team owner of [[West Surrey Racing]] to field a [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]]-[[Honda]] powered [[Dallara]] F395 for a selected driver in the International Formula 3 Trophy. The race was run at [[Donington Park]] on 22 October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1669|title=Vasser, Herta Confirm Worth of Team USA Scholarship|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memo Gidley]] was selected and qualified the car in 16th position. Gidley finished the race in eleventh place after lengthy battles with [[Marc Cramer]] and [[Thomas Schwister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1654|title=Gidley Displays His Racecraft on F3 Debut|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen McAuley]] won the race with [[Jason Elliott (racing driver)|Jason Elliott]] and [[Scott Lakin]] completing the podium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/december-1995/4/month-motor-sport|title=The month in Motor Sport|last=|first=|date=2007-11-15|website=Motorsport Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EFDA Nations Cup===
With Formula 3 deemed to expensive, the Team USA Scholarship returned to more affordable racing. The [[EFDA Nations Cup]] was selected, being a one-make series all drivers raced equal material. The cars were [[Reynard Motorsports|Reynard]] [[Formula Opel Lotus]] single seaters. [[Tony Renna]] was selected out of six finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1647|title=Tony Renna Wins 1996 Team USA Scholarship|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Nadeau]] racing in the 1996 Eruopean Formula Opel Lotus championship, joined Renna in the Nations Cup event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1642|title=Nadeau to Represent America in Nations Cup VII|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two races the team placed second in the overall standings of the [[1996 EFDA Nations Cup]], scoring the silver medal.

The team returned to the Nations Cup in 1997 with [[Buddy Rice]] and [[Matt Sielsky]].&lt;ref name="1997 finalists"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1628|title=Rice, Sielsky Win 1997 Team USA Scholarships|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Edwards (racing driver)|Paul Edwards]] was selected as a third driver, racing in the [[Formula Ford Festival]]. Edwards started fifth in the Festival race and worked his way up to third. Unfortunately, a run in with [[Robert Lechner (racing driver)|Robert Lechner]] caused Edwards to retire. In the Nations Cup Rice and Sielsky struggled in qualifying with the setup and the team had to settle for fifth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1608|title=Team USA Places Fifth; Edwards Stars in World Cup|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Team USA Scholarship supported Paul Edwards in the final three rounds of the [[Formula Opel Euroseries]] and the EFDA Formula Opel Lotus Winter Series. His best finish was a fifth place at the Nürburgring with a Team USA Scholarship supported [[Motaworld Racing]] entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlg.speedfreaks.org/archive/1998/fopel.html|title=Formula Opel Euroseries|last=|first=|date=|website=The GEL Motorsport Information Page|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Winter Series Edwards raced with [[Team Meritus]]. Edwards won at [[Donington Park]] and placed second at the [[Hockenheimring]]. Leading the championship into the final round, again at the Hockenheimring, Edwards won the championship by default as the final was canceled. Freezing winter conditions caused the organisation to abandon the final event. Edwards won the championship over other contenders such as [[Richard Lyons (racing driver)|Richard Lyons]] and [[Takuma Sato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1586|title=Cancellation Ensures Edwards’ Championship|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formula Palmer Audi (part 1)===
For 1999 Team USA Scholarship shifted focus to the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] Winter Series. A series set up by former Formula 1 driver [[Jonathan Palmer]] featuring one-make [[Van Diemen]] chassis powered by 1.8L [[Audi]] engines.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Three drivers were selected to compete, [[Paul Edwards (racing driver)|Paul Edwards]], [[Andy Lally]] and [[Jeff Simmons (racing driver)|Jeff Simmons]] were selected to compete.&lt;ref name="1999 finalists"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1584|title=Team USA Scholarship Expands to Three-Car Effort|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards won three out of four races (at [[Snetterton Circuit|Snetterton]] and [[Brands Hatch]]), with [[Paul Munn]] winning the fourth race. Edwards won the championship with an 8-point advantage.&lt;ref name="Motorsport Winners"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://motorsportwinners.com/defunct/formula-palmer-audi-winter-series/|title=Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series (1998-2008)|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Motorsport Winners|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lally finished fifth, Simmons eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/formula-palmer-audi-winter-series/1999/|title=Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series 1999 standings|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=DriverDB.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phil Giebler]] and [[Joey Hand]] were selected for Team USA Scholarship for the 2000 Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series.&lt;ref name="2000 finalists"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1567|title=Six Young Americans Selected for Scholarship Shootout|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giebler scored three podiums and a win at Brands Hatch to claim the title. Hand scored a single podium finish, a second place at Snetterton, to settle for sixth in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/formula-palmer-audi-winter-series/2000/|title=Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series 2000 standings|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=DriverDB.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand Formula Ford===
In November 2001 twelve drivers were selected for a shootout style event at the [[Jim Russell Racing Driver School]]. [[A.J. Allmendinger]] and [[Bryan Sellers]] were selected for the 2001 Team USA Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1556|title=Allmendinger, Sellers Earn 2001 Team USA Scholarships|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relative inexperience with single seaters, Team USA Scholarship returned to [[Formula Ford]], in [[New Zealand Formula Ford Championship|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The duo raced a partial season, with successes. Sellers won two races, both at [[Timaru International Motor Raceway|Timaru]], and placed ninth in the series championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/formula-ford-new-zealand/2002/|title=2001-02 Talley's Formula Ford Championship|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=DriverDB.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers and Allmendinger placed second and third at the [[New Zealand Grand Prix]], behind [[Fabian Coulthard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.org.nz/Results/060102FFr2.htm|title=P&amp;O Nedlloyd New Zealand Grand Prix|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=Motorsport New Zealand|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020225114802/http://www.motorsport.org.nz/Results/060102FFr2.htm|archive-date=2002-02-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 2003, three drivers were selected for the six race New Zealand International Formula Ford Series. [[Joe D'Agostino (racing driver)|Joe D'Agostino]], [[Charlie Kimball]] and [[Ryan Millen]]. Millen, who is of New Zealand ancestry, is the nephew of [[1980 New Zealand Grand Prix]] winner [[Steve Millen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teamusascholarship.org/?p=1524|title=Three American Youngsters Set To Contest New Zealand Formula Ford Series|last=|first=|date=03-12-2017|website=Team USA Scholarship|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Tikka To Ride'''" is the first episode of [[science fiction]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' Series VII and the 37th in the series run. It was first broadcast on the British television channel [[BBC Two|BBC2]] on 17 January 1997.&lt;ref name="BBC - Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF VI - TIKKA TO RIDE"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/NMYJ411X | title =BBC - Programme Catalogue - RED DWARF VI - TIKKA TO RIDE | publisher =BBC |accessdate =12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Doug Naylor]] and directed by [[Ed Bye]], it was the first episode not to involve co-creator and writer [[Rob Grant]].

Series VII was the first series to have extended episodes.

==Plot==
[[Dave Lister|Lister]] makes a video explaining how the crew survived [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|their battle]] with their future selves. If the future crew had killed their former selves, they would have eliminated their own existence, and therefore not have been able to destroy themselves. (See [[temporal paradox]].) Therefore, time has reset to a point before the crew picked up time drive. Lister's explanation is too convoluted for the video camera to handle and it explodes. [[Kryten]] dismisses the whole incident as "garbled" and more "boring than an in-flight magazine produced by [[Air Belgium (1979–2000)|Air Belgium]]."

Unfortunately disaster has struck - ''[[Red Dwarf ships#Starbug|Starbug]]'' is still damaged from the battle and as a consequence all the [[Indian food]] supplies have been destroyed; not even a single [[papadum]] survived. Lister proposes that the crew obtain the time drive again and go back in time to an Indian take-away and order 500 curries (even though [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|Out of Time]] established that travel to other places (such as Earth) would also require a star drive). [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]] and Kryten  are against the idea and oppose going back in time, having seen the kind of people they could possibly become. Lister argues that they can use a time drive and avoid that consequence if they don't abuse it like their future selves did; however he finds himself outnumbered and seemingly concedes defeat. However, Lister swaps Kryten's head for one of his spare heads and removes the guilt chip from it, having the now guiltless Kryten reassure the crew that it will be okay. The next morning, Rimmer and Cat are confused when Kryten serves them high-calorie breakfasts, starts smoking and using phrases like ''"you bet your ass"''. However, when Kryten assures them it'll be ok to pick up the time drive the two assent and board the ship containing it, intending to go back to the 21st Century to one of Lister's favourite curry houses to pick up a large order.

Their [[time travel]] calculations are a little off and they find themselves in [[Dallas, Texas]] on 22 November 1963. They appear at the [[Texas School Book Depository]] just as [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|firing]] at U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. They inadvertently knock him out the window to his death below, thereby preventing Kennedy's assassination. The crew use the time travel device, to go three years forward to 1966.

The crew find Dallas deserted. Wandering the streets, they find a man who has been trampled to death, indicating people left in a hurry. Reading a nearby newspaper, Kryten finds out what has happened:

{{quote|President Kennedy was impeached in 1964 for sharing a mistress with Mafia boss, Sam Giancana. It was the biggest scandal in American history. Kennedy was sentenced to three years in an open prison in July, '65. J. Edgar Hoover became president; he was forced to run by the mob, who had pictures of him at a transvestite orgy...Soon after his election, the USSR were  allowed to install a nuclear base in Cuba in return for Mafia cocaine trafficking between Cuba and the States. With a Soviet nuclear base 30 miles from the US mainland, people fled from all the major cities.}}

The crew attempt to correct the situation by returning to the day of the shooting and driving Oswald to a higher floor in the building, but this plan still fails to lead to Kennedy's death; by sending Oswald up another floor, they made the shot's trajectory so steep that Kennedy was merely wounded. Lister suggests getting a second gunman to shoot from behind a nearby grassy knoll. With none of the crew willing to shoot the President themselves, Lister travels to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] in 1965 and persuades a post-impeachment Kennedy to travel back to 1963, become a "second gunman" on the [[grassy knoll]], and shoot himself to restore his place in history. The plan works: Kennedy shoots his past self and the timeline is restored.  Kennedy grimly thanks the gang for the chance to restore himself to his proper place in history, and fades away as a result of the resetting timeline. Lister, too late, realises he forgot to ask Kennedy for the name of a good Indian take-away. Having seen that Lister has learned absolutely nothing from the experience, the other members of the crew give him a well-deserved beating in return for all he's put them through.

===Extended Edition/Alternate Ending===

Shown as an option on the Series 7 DVD, the Extended Edition of ''Tikka To Ride'' continues after Cat, Rimmer and Kryten take out their frustrations on Lister. After managing to correctly use the time drive and steal the Indian food supplies from Starbug before the events of the episode began (thus showing an example of a predestination paradox and allowing Lister to re-stock on curry, papadums and lager), the crew end up storing the food in one of Starbug's cargo holds (ostensibly the same cargo hold it was stolen from in the first place - B-deck). Rimmer leaves with Kryten in tow but remarks as he does ''"I must've passed this thing a million times. What the hell's it for?"'' in regards to a lever by the door. It doesn't take long for Lister to give into the curiosity planted by Rimmer and pull the lever. The lever, in fact, activates the separation sequence for Starbug, jettisoning the rear section of the ship into space while allowing the front half to fly away; an ace Rimmer had ''"had up his sleeve for months"''. Lister notes that he's stranded alone in deep space with nothing but three-and-a-half tons of curry, and couldn't be happier before eagerly digging into the crates.

==Production==
Even though the previous series had ended on a cliffhanger, fans had been forced to wait three years for the resolution. This was due to a number of factors, which included [[Craig Charles]] being imprisoned before being cleared of a charge of [[rape]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Although tempted to end it, he later agreed to write two more eight-episode series of the show, as this would allow the episode count to reach 52 and therefore be eligible for [[Television syndication|syndication]].&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Writing"/&gt;

"Tikka To Ride" ushered in new production values. The cinematic quality and filming of the new episodes meant that the studio audience was no longer viable (however the show was shown to an audience at a later date and their laughter was added). Also the special effects were increasing every series and the majority of the episodes were pre-recorded.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Production"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/production.html | title =Red Dwarf Series VII Production | publisher =Red Dwarf.co.uk |accessdate =17 December 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022124317/http://reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/production.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Naylor's desires for a seventh series was the prospect of international syndication and a movie.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf Series VII Production"/&gt; This vision was helped with the return of [[Ed Bye]] to the director's chair, having previously left due to a scheduling clash with directing his wife [[Ruby Wax]]'s new TV show at the time.&lt;ref name="Interview: Ed Bye"&gt;Interview: Ed Bye, Red Dwarf smegazine, issue 12, January 1993, Fleetway Editions Ltd, {{ISSN|0965-5603}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to return to helm the seventh series, his first Red Dwarf episode since Series IV's "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]".

The arrival of the seventh series was also promoted by the show making its first appearance of the front cover of the [[Radio Times]].

Guest stars included [[Michael J. Shannon]] who played John F. Kennedy, Toby Aspin as Lee Harvey Oswald, Peter Gaitens as FBI Agent and Robert Ashe as Cop.

The deserted Dallas scenes were filmed at [[Farnborough Airport]]. The expanded Starbug cargo deck scenes were filmed inside the former [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] wind tunnels at Farnborough. The motorcade scenes were filmed at the [[Chobham]] test track, with additional crowd shots filmed around buildings at [[Shepperton Studios]].

==Cultural and historical references==
The title of this episode is a piece of word-play based on the name of the song "[[Ticket to Ride]]" by [[the Beatles]], in accordance with the theme of curry on which the storyline focuses, tikka being an Indian spice marinade.

When on the [[Grassy Knoll]], Lister, Rimmer and Cat are dressed up as tramps, an outfit which the normally vain and shallow Cat would not be seen dead in: "Superficial is my middle name".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]'', Red Dwarf Series V, episode 6, March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the [[Three tramps]], men that are reported to have been found in a [[boxcar]] behind the Grassy Knoll when the police searched it after the shooting, but were later released. Conspiracy theorists have assumed that they were part of the assassination plot.&lt;ref name="Posner_Case_Closed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Case Closed|first=Gerald|last=Posner|authorlink=Gerald Posner|year=1993|publisher=Warner Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the crew travelling backwards in time and accidentally saving someone's life, leading to a change for the worse in history, was also used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]''. In each case the person saved was actually an advocate of peace; however, there were few other similarities between the episodes.

In the commentary for the Series III episode "[[Timeslides]]" when talking about Kryten's shouting "Duck!" at the Grassy Knoll line, they note how their characters actually did something similar later on.

==Plot inconsistencies==
At the start of the episode, Lister explains that the crew survived the [[Out of Time (Red Dwarf episode)|previous cliffhanger]] because of a [[temporal paradox]], which made it impossible for them to be killed by their future selves.  However, later in the same episode, Kennedy is able to kill his younger self without creating the same paradox.  There is no explanation of why there is one rule for the crew of Starbug and another for Kennedy. Similarly, it is explained that by preventing the initial assassination, Russia wins the space race (this is why Starbug disappears). This means the JMC never exists and the time drive would never have been found in the first place.

In the previous episode it was made clear that the time drive was only a ''time'' drive and not a space and time drive, so the crew could travel forward or backward in time but were still stuck in deep space. It was not explained in the episode how the time drive can suddenly transport them through space, or why, given that they could travel to 1963 Earth, they did not simply travel back to 22nd Century Earth as per their original plan.

On the Red Dwarf VII DVD documentary ''Back from the Dead'', director Ed Bye recalled explaining to a fan that the time drive was made up, and was just a lump of plastic.

==Reception==
"Tikka to Ride" has generally been well received by critics. DVDActive called it "a promising start to the series" and noted that it was "beautifully shot, with a movie-style score".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/red-dwarf-vii.html |title=Red Dwarf VII (UK - DVD R2) |publisher=www.dvdactive.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Verdict stated "what other sitcom, sci-fi or otherwise, would take on the Kennedy Assassination and an alternative future for the United States had the beloved President not been felled by a rain of bullets?" and concluded that the episode "was majestic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php |title=Red Dwarf: Series 5-8 |publisher=www.dvdverdict.com |accessdate=5 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119032101/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/reddwarfseries58.php |archivedate=19 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sci-Fi Online noted that "''Tikka to Ride'' morphs into a surprisingly serious time paradox" but felt that the final plot twist was "a largely pointless contrivance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/reviews/dvd/05-11-07_RedDwarf7.htm |title=DVD Red Dwarf Series 7 |publisher=www.sci-fi-online.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BellaOnline called the episode "pure silliness, and I mean of the kind that makes ''Red Dwarf'' great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art40890.asp |title=DVD Review--"Red Dwarf Series VII" |publisher=www.bellaonline.com |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy''' (formerly known as Trance Energy) was a Dutch trance event featuring Electronic Trance Music [[DJ]]s from around the world. It was organized by [[ID&amp;T]] and was held since 1999 in various venues in the [[Netherlands]].

==History==
Founded in 1999. Traditionally, there was a "small" edition and a big edition each year. In 2002, the small edition failed to sell out its 20,000-person ticket capacity (only 15,000 tickets were sold) and thereafter, Trance Energy was only held once annually, at the Jaarbeurs convention center in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]], where it has been sold out each year up to 2009. The festival gained "cult" status among Trance fans. In 2010, it failed to sell out by slight margins since it was organized on Easter week end and this was problematic for some foreign visitors (especially from Poland).

In 2011 ID&amp;T changed the concept and renamed the festival to "Energy the network", opening the festival to other genres from Trance only. The change was announced in September 2010, and labelled as a simple "name change". This change caused controversy and was very negatively greeted on internet forums. Meanwhile, one ID&amp;T competitor launched a Trance only festival in the Netherlands. As a result, attendance declined steadily with edition 2011 and 2012 being not sold out by large margins. (Only half of 2012 tickets were sold). In 2013, the event was moved to the Ziggo Dome, a smaller venue in Amsterdam and still it failed to sell out. There has been no announcement of a 2014 edition up to this date. Yet ID&amp;T has not announced cancellation of the event like they usually do.

While audience in the first years was mostly Dutch, there were subsequently many international visitors, mainly from the European Union but sometimes from other areas around the world. This is due to the festival earning worldwide fame thanks to [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] of DJ mixes and some official videos of former editions. At the 2010 edition, it has been quoted by ID&amp;T that more than 40% of the audience was not Dutch.

In 2017, ID&amp;T announced the return of Trance Energy. The brand will be hosting a stage at Tomorrowland. The return of the festival itself, looks likely.

== Description of the Event ==
[[File:Above &amp; Beyond at Trance Energy 2010.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Above &amp; Beyond (band)|Above &amp; Beyond]] performing during Trance Energy in 2010.]]
Past 2003 editions of Trance Energy usually focus on three stages located in different halls of the Jaarbeurs convention center and connected by corridors :

* The "Mainstage" (capacity : 20,000 people) where headliner DJs of the night do their sets. The sets are usually between one and two hours long. Impressive light shows with lasers, lights and fireworks are featured along with some acts (Dancers, Live acts, DJ sets, etc...). The setup is quite typical of a "classic" trance party: Minimal decorations with most of the ambience being created by lights and the structural elements used to rig them. Only the size makes it different.
* The "Madhouse" (capacity : 5,000 people) which features more house and club music. This stage has sometimes been criticized by some of the visitors who find the music played there too distant from the "trance" theme of the event.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* An alternate stage whose name changes each year (capacity : 5,000 people) where edgier trance than on the mainstage is played. This stage often features very famous names who are able to take more risks musically speaking than what they would be allowed on the mainstage.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Since 2007, a fourth stage has been added, the "Hard Stage" featuring harder derivatives of Trance Music.
In 2009, students of the Utrecht School for the Arts were asked to design the entrance of the festival. They created a multi-disciplinary entrance, where interactivity, game-elements, video, fashion and music came together.

Trance Energy toured Australia in 2009.  The tour attracted controversy after police shut down the Melbourne leg early due to 26 overdoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Mark|title=Police decided not to patrol overdose rave|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/police-decided-not-to-patrol-overdose-rave-20090411-a3h7.html|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15532">Below is a partial list of alleged sightings of [[unidentified flying objects]] or UFOs in [[Canada]].

== 1960, Clan Lake, Northwest Territories ==
On June 18, 1960, a prospector told the Yellowknife RCMP detachment that a month earlier, he and his partner saw a UFO at Clan Lake, located 30 miles north of [[Yellowknife]]. According to UFOlogist Chris Rutkowski, the men claimed they saw a hovering object 4 to 6 feet wide that hit the surface of the lake. The RCMP investigated, but found nothing.&lt;ref name="NNSL"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Tim|title='Something came in over the trees' 50 year-old UFO mystery remains unsolved near Yellowknife|url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2010-01/jan27_10ufo.html|website=NNSL|publisher=Northern News Services|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1967, Falcon Lake, Manitoba incident ==

Stefan Michalak claimed he was burned by one of two flying saucers with which he reportedly came into contact on May 19, 1967 near [[Falcon Lake (Manitoba)]]. [[Ufology|Ufologists]] claim that images of Michalak in the hospital show a grid of burn marks on his chest, and a similar grid appears burned into his t-shirt. Ufologists consider it to be one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Falcon Lake event: Canada’s most famous UFO encounter|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadas-most-famous-ufo-encounter|website=CBC Archive|publisher=CBC-Radio Canada|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two books have been written on the alleged Falcon Lake occurrence:

* (2017). Stan Michalak, Chris Rutkowski. ''When They Appeared Falcon Lake 1967: The inside story of a close encounter''. {{ISBN|9781772800951}}
* (2015). George Dudding. ''The Falcon Lake UFO Encounter''. {{ISBN|978-1514246825}}

Skeptic Dr. Aaron Sakulich reviewed the report made by Michalak to police shortly after the incident, along with other evidence, and concluded that Michalak was indeed burned but that the burns were in fact likely caused by an accident brought on by [[alcohol]] consumption, and that Michalak, who was prospecting for silver ore near the lake at the time, probably made the story up to keep other prospectors out of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sakulich |first1=Aaron |title=Stefan Michalak's Ridiculous Story |url=http://www.theironskeptic.com/articles/michalak/michalak.htm |website=The Iron Skeptic |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] released a $20 silver [[Coins of the Canadian dollar|coin]] depicting the alleged event as part of its Canada's Unexplained Phenomena series, stating "According to Stefan Michalak’s account, two glowing objects descended from the sky on May 20, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, where one landed close enough for him to approach. When the craft suddenly took flight, its emission set Michalak’s clothes ablaze, leaving him with mysterious burns… and an unusual tale to tell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 1 oz.

== 1967, Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia incident ==
{{Main article|Shag Harbour incident}}
The incident was the purported crash of an Unidentified Flying Object in [[Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia]] in October 1967.

==1969, Prince George, B.C. UFO==
In [[Prince George, British Columbia]], three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object in the late afternoon sky on January 1, 1969. The sphere radiated a yellow-orange light and appeared to ascend from 2,000 to 10,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/ufo/002029-1100-e.html Canada's Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown] at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==1975-1976, Southern Manitoba==
Several sightings were reported of a red glowing UFO, sometimes described as "mischievous" or "playful", sighted in Southern [[Manitoba]] in 1975 and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''The Canadian UFO Report: The Best Cases Revealed|last=Rutkowski |first=Chris |author2=Dittman, Geoff  |year=2006 |publisher=The Dundurn Group |isbn=1-55002-621-6 |pages=333 pg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1978, Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador ==
In October 1978, Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP witnessed a sighting of a flying saucer hovering over the harbour near the town of [[Clarenville]] and Random Island.  This was reported to him by local citizens.  When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance.  The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half.  When he switched on the roof lights of his police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights.  This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland.  The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast.  In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.

== 1986, Munros Point, Nova Scotia Sighting ==
In the early evening of January 20, 1986 a couple travelling by car on a rural road in Cape Breton, NS witnessed a bright light appear and hover directly over their car. Almost immediately their vehicle lost power. After watching the blinding light for less than a minute, they watched it quickly accelerate away from them, lighting up the ground below the object as it departed.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== 1989, Marieville, Quebec ==
On November 20 at 5.30 p.m., in Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (a rural neighbourhood of [[Marieville, Quebec|Marieville]]) several people heard a noise similar to an electric generator and saw some strange lights in the sky. Two days after the phenomenon a perfect round circle was found outside the residence of Mr Jean Prigent, one of the witnesses of the sighting.&lt;ref&gt;Chris A. Rutkowski, Geoff Dittman, ''The Canadian UFO Report: The Best Cases Revealed'', Durdun Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990, Montreal aerial phenomenon==

On November 7, 1990, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], witnesses reported a round, metallic object of about 540 metres wide over the rooftop pool of the [[Bonaventure Hotel]]. Eyewitnesses saw 8 to 10 lights forming into a circle above them, emitting bright white rays. The phenomenon lasted three hours, from 7 to 10 p.m., and moved slowly northwards. While none could identify the lights, a few witnesses, according to the next day’s report in [[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]], were ready to express their belief that they were visited by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]].&lt;ref name=UFOMONT&gt;{{cite web| title =Montreal Mirror: "Montreal X-Files." | url=http://www.ufon.org/uforom/| accessdate = 2008-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101132732/http://www.ufon.org/uforom/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
A few witnesses say what they saw in a televised interview on [[CBC Television|CBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/science-technology/the-unexplained/close-encounters-of-the-canadian-kind/an-aerial-phenomenon-over-montreal.html|title=CBC Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006, Ajax, Ontario==
A UFO was photographed in [[Ajax, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufocasebook.com/ajaxontario.html |title=Ajax, Ontario, Canada Photograph Shows Unknown Flying Object (www.ufocasebook.com) |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010, Harbour Mille incident ==
During the night of January 25, 2010 there were multiple UFO sighting reports in [[Harbour Mille]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] initially stated the reports were due to a missile launch, but later retracted the statement, and the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister]] stated that the UFOS were not missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/01/28/ufo-newfoundland-pmo.html |title=No evidence UFO was rocket: PMO |date=2010-01-28 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another minor report of this incident came from Calgary where boys playing hockey reported seeing similar objects, about which they stated "We thought they were Transformers"

== 2014, Kensington, PEI Sighting ==
While putting out a bonfire late in the evening of June 4, 2014, John Sheppard witnessed unusual lights in the sky over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and captured 22 minutes of it on his cellphone. After reporting the incident to MUFON and their investigation concluding it being a confirmed sighting, CBC covered the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ufo-sighting-1.3399004|title='This is a really serious sighting': National UFO group confirms P.E.I. sighting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, CBC released a follow-up article in which a series of alternate explanations for the event were presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/ufo-pei-debunked-1.3401853|title=A drone? A plane? P.E.I.'s UFO sighting disputed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014, Multiple reports of UFO sightings over Toronto, Ontario ==
There were multiple reports of a UFO activity above [[Toronto]] in the last week of July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speculations About a UFO Lights Seen Over Toronto|url=http://www.latest-ufo-sightings.net/2014/08/speculations-about-a-ufo-with-lights-seen-over-toronto.html|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canadian UFO survey results ==
According to the 2002 Canadian UFO Survey published by [[Ufology Research of Manitoba]], [[Toronto]] had the largest number of sightings with 34, followed by [[Vancouver]] with 31 and [[Terrace, British Columbia|Terrace, B.C.]] with 25 reports.&lt;ref name=UFORUM&gt;{{cite web| title = Ufology Research of Manitoba| url=http://www.ufon.org/uforom/| accessdate = 2007-12-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160901/http://www.ufon.org/uforom/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a typical UFO sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes.
	 
The Canadian Federal Government currently (2007) directs all UFO sightings to ''Chris Rutkowski'' of Ufology Research of Manitoba.&lt;ref name=UFORUM/&gt;&lt;ref name=UFORUM2&gt;{{cite web| title = Bio: Chris Rutkowski (Ufology Research of Manitoba)| url=http://www.ufon.org/uforom/mybio.html| accessdate = 2007-12-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230036/http://www.ufon.org/uforom/mybio.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2018, a Canadian news site mentioned a new study conducted by Ufology Research, formerly known as Ufology Research of Manitoba, stating there have been more than 1,000 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timminspress.com/2018/07/15/ufos-reportedly-seen-in-northern-ontario&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoyo A Go Go''', usually abbreviated to '''Yoyo''' and often typeset in various ways{{refn|group=note|The official name of the festival as printed on the first live album is ''Yoyo A Go Go'', but this has varied over time. Later iterations, particularly in the media and in popular usage, often hyphenate the name in different ways (as in ''Yo-Yo'' and ''Go-Go'', and occasionally ''Yo-Yo-A-Go-Go'') and the capitalization often varies.}}, was an [[independent music]] [[Music festival|festival]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], first held in 1994 and followed by successor festivals in 1997, 1999, and 2001. Five- and six-day concert marathons featured dozens of [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[indie rock]] acts stacked back to back, as well as a variety of associated entertainment and small-scale local retail. The concerts took place at the historic [[Capitol Theater (Olympia)|Capitol Theater]] and showcased performers from the local [[Olympia music scene]], while also including national and international artists.

==Background==
The first Yoyo enterprise was a [[recording studio]] built inside Olympia's [[Capitol Theater (Olympia)|Capitol Theater]] by audio engineer Pat Maley. By 1992, Maley had formed the Yoyo record label and released the compilation ''[[Throw: The Yo-Yo Studio Compilation|Throw]]'' (reissued on CD in 2001) which included tracks by [[Music of the Pacific Northwest|area musicians]]. Maley eventually decided to initiate an [[independent music]]al event, inspired by Olympia's earlier [[International Pop Underground Convention]] (IPU),&lt;ref name="MTV1999"/&gt; a highly regarded 1991 festival that has been deemed "a watershed moment in indie rock".&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker149"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parker |first=Bryan C. |authorlink= |year=2015 |title=Beat Happening |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=de51CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |page=149 |isbn=9781628929270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A musician himself, Maley organized the festival with help from drummer Kent Oiwa, graphic designer Pat Castaldo, and local disc jockey Michelle Noel.&lt;ref name="Beebe"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Beebe |first=Elaine |date=July 18–24, 1997 |title=Olympia Hosts Punk Festival |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19970718&amp;id=s-4xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_esDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3890,4309646&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Eugene Register-Guard]] |location=Eugene, OR |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guiding principle was the [[DIY ethic]] central to punk rock. In a press release for the festival, Maley declared: "Long ago, punk rock stopped being simply a noun that was young, loud, and proud. Now it's also a descriptive term that tries to explain the difference between the buy in/sell out culture that wakes us up every morning for work, and the culture so many of us make every day with our own hands".&lt;ref name="May"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/various-yoyoagogo1999/ |title=Various Artists: 'Yoyo a Go Go 1999' |author=May, Krista L. |authorlink= |date=September 3, 2001 |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |work=Popmatters.com |accessdate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoyo festivals ran concurrently with another citywide event, the annual [[Lakefair]] festival. Yoyo organizers felt little sense of competition, and were inclined to believe Lakefair, with its more traditional style of fireworks and parade, would be a complementary affair and "add to the overall sense of fun".&lt;ref name="MTV1999"/&gt; From the first festival, audience members and performers marched together as a contingent ("The Throw Team") in the Lakefair Parade.&lt;ref name="Olywa1994"/&gt;

==Themes and styles==
The crush of performances squeezed into five- or six-day festivals meant most shows were limited to about thirty minutes.  For this reason, some observers criticized Yoyo for a lack of focus: "The breadth of musical styles – and musical abilities – works against appreciating any one band".&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; [[Candice Pedersen]], co-owner of [[K Records]] and another key Yoyo organizer, explained that the point of the festival was not to maximize publicity or sales, but to share and enjoy a communal endeavor: "[S]ee all the bands, have a good time, meet a lot of people, and treat each other well".&lt;ref name="Stovall"/&gt; The mutual support among artists and audience was seen by many as a hallmark of the [[Olympia music scene]] and one of the keys to its growth and endurance.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

Continuing the IPU's efforts at [[Music community|scene]]-building, Yoyo attracted participants for whom stage-sharing was acceptable and professional competition was virtually unknown.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cox |first=Anna Marie |date=November 1997 |title=Punk Rock Slumber Party: Yoyo A Go Go |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]] |publisher= |volume=13 |issue=8 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ogux2DAvNU0C&amp;pg=PA114 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For its polite performers – and the rapt audiences who lavished attention on them – Yoyo has been called "the friendliest punk fest",&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; a trait which earned it one magazine's gentle chiding as a "punk rock slumber party".&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

Another emblematic feature of Yoyo was the ubiquity of female musicians. [[All-female band]]s (or female-led ones) were commonplace, even more so than at the IPU in 1991. The IPU had heralded the advent of the [[riot grrrl]] movement with opening night festivities billed as [[International Pop Underground Convention#Girl Night|"Girl Night"]], but Yoyo festivals cemented this as a feature of the Olympia scene: female bands were "a given, not a special attraction".&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; Though its musical styles were far-flung, the Olympia community that populated Yoyo was most often linked to [[twee pop]] and [[cuddlecore]].&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

==Yoyo 1994==
As described in ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]'', "the first Yoyo blossomed in the damp heat that followed [[Seattle music scene|Seattle]]'s [[grunge]] explosion."&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; The Olympia scene was riding a wave of interest from major media who were giving close scrutiny to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the wake of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s international success.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; The first Yoyo festival was a five-day affair, July 12–16, 1994.&lt;ref name="Olywa1994"/&gt;

Dozens of independent bands played at Yoyo 1994 including [[Beck]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Mary Lou Lord]], [[Team Dresch]], [[Lois Maffeo|Lois]], [[Go Sailor]], [[the Spinanes]], [[Mecca Normal]], [[Some Velvet Sidewalk]], [[the Halo Benders]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Unwound]], and [[Tattle Tale]].&lt;ref name="MTV1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stovall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AM1994"&gt;{{allmusicguide |id=R307189|label=Yo-Yo-a-Go-Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avant-garde music|Avant-garde]] rockers [[Deerhoof]] played one of their first shows at the festival, and were quickly signed to record a single for [[Kill Rock Stars]].&lt;ref name="Pilchak"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pilchak |first=Angela |authorlink= |date=January 2005 |journal=Contemporary Musicians: Profiles of the People in Music |volume=50 |title=Deerhoof |url= |location=Farmington Hills, MI |publisher=Gale |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several visiting Japanese bands were also part of the bill, including [[Bloodthirsty Butchers]].&lt;ref name="Stovall"/&gt; The roster was publicized as a mixture of bands from "around the corner and around the world."&lt;ref name="Olywa1994"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.olywa.net/yoyo/festival94shtml |title=1994 Festival |author= |authorlink= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124141856/http://www.olywa.net/yoyo/festival94.shtml |archive-date=November 24, 2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Yoyo |work=Olywa.net |accessdate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making an unscheduled appearance were [[Krist Novoselic]] and [[Dave Grohl]], in their first public performance together since [[Death of Kurt Cobain|the death]] of [[Kurt Cobain]] in April.&lt;ref name="Parker149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StThomas"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Nirvana: The Chosen Rejects |last=St. Thomas |first=Kurt |authorlink=Kurt St. Thomas |year=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn=0312206631 |page=218 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LuLUMJalA1oC&amp;pg=PA218 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair played a set with [[the Stinky Puffs]], led by ten-year-old Simon Timony, and joined by [[Ira Kaplan]] (of [[Yo La Tengo]]) and [[Jad Fair]]. A solemn moment for the festival came when Timony offered a memorial song he wrote for Cobain: "'You rode off into the sun / but I love you anyway,' he sang in a preteen falsetto, while Novoselic towered behind him, playing stone-faced."&lt;ref name="Stovall"/&gt;

A double album containing almost two hours of live performances, ''Yo-Yo A Go-Go'', was released by Yoyo on August 20, 1996.&lt;ref name="AM1994"/&gt;

==Yoyo 1997==
[[File:Sleater-Kinney at Yoyo a Gogo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Sleater-Kinney]] onstage at Yoyo]]
"The continued presence of kitty-cat iconography and strummy guitar lullabies at Yoyo 1997 suggests a wistful nostalgia for Olympia's original love-rock days".&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; Over fifty bands played, including once again several visiting Japanese bands such as Copass Grinders and Kirihito.&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; Headliners included [[Sleater-Kinney]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Karp (band)|Karp]], [[Unwound]], [[Mirah]], [[Cold Cold Hearts]], [[Murder City Devils]], [[The Softies]], [[The Crabs]], and [[Built to Spill]].&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt;

Among the varied entertainment was an ''a cappella'' performance piece by artist [[Nikki McClure]];&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; a puppeteers' rendition of ''[[The Gong Show]]'';&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; a string quartet conducted by composer [[Timothy Brock]];&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; a ukulele recital by [[Khaela Maricich]];&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; and an outdoor [[nature walk]] designed specifically for punks.&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; Festival attendees were also treated to special movie screenings offered by the [[Olympia Film Society]]&lt;ref name="Beebe"/&gt; and an afternoon show by the campy, all-female troupe Cha Cha Cabaret, led by riot grrrl activist [[Jen Smith]] (under the stage name "Lady Hand Grenade").&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

A compilation of live recordings from the 1997 festival was released on Yoyo Recordings in 1999 under the title ''Yoyo A Go Go – Another Live Compilation – July 15–20, 1997''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|1239452|name=Yoyo A Go Go (1997)|type=album}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoyo 1999==
The 1999 festival was held July 13–18, and featured musical performances by [[Sleater-Kinney]] and [[Elliott Smith]].&lt;ref name="MTV1999"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/515847/elliott-smith-sleater-kinney-to-headline-yoyo-a-go-go/ |title=Elliott Smith, Sleater-Kinney To Headline Yoyo A Gogo |author=Garr, Gillian |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=MTV |work=Mtv.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Negativland]] appeared at the festival and played their first live set in six years, while [[Bratmobile]] arrived as part of a reunion tour, having broken up several years earlier.&lt;ref name="MTV1999"/&gt; In total, over fifty bands played over the six-day event, including [[The Make-Up]], [[Dub Narcotic Sound System]], [[The Donnas]], [[Quasi]], [[Tullycraft]], [[Dead Moon]], [[Marine Research]], [[Thrones (band)|Thrones]], [[Bonfire Madigan]], and [[Mecca Normal]].&lt;ref name="MTV1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Summer Festivals |author=Sisario, Ben |authorlink=Ben Sisario |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 May 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/arts/summer-festivals-pop-jazz-an-abundance-of-performing-arts-nationwide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pearl Jam]] singer [[Eddie Vedder]] made a guest appearance with [[C Average]] and took part in their costumed tribute set to [[The Who]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Amazing Journey: The Life of Pete Townshend |last=Wilkerson |first=Mark |year=2006 |publisher=Bad News Press |location=Louisville, KY|isbn=9781411677005 |page=520 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b03CYc9UWSIC&amp;pg=PA520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elliott Smith]] played the festival's final set, and his celebrated performance was released on DVD in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What's Happening |author=Asher, Tizzy |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=17 September 2004 |page= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Live Wire; Static &amp; Wack Jackasses |author= |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=16 September 2004 |page= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-761070151.html |accessdate= }}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live album, ''Yoyo A GoGo 1999'', was released in 2001. The album features twenty live tracks by festival performers, followed by a zestful five-minute recording of Negativland leading the crowd in a recitation of [[Casey Kasem]]'s notorious and profanity-streaked diatribe: "This all means diddly-shit! Who gives a shit . . . diddly-shit! This is American Top 40 bullshit!".&lt;ref name="May"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;{{Allmusicguide |class=album |id=mw0000729902 |label=Yoyo A GoGo 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CD's communal finale has been described as the "collective Yoyo a Go Go 'fuck-you' to the mainstream recording industry and corporate radio".&lt;ref name="May"/&gt;

==Yoyo 2001==
The fourth Yoyo festival was held July 17–22, 2001, and once again included over fifty musical acts, as well as spoken word performances, art shows and seminars.&lt;ref name="Olywa2001"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.olywa.net/yoyo/festival01.shtml |title=2001 Festival |author= |authorlink= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011114212409/http://www.olywa.net/yoyo/festival01.shtml |archive-date=November 14, 2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Yoyo |work=Olywa.net |accessdate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Headlining participants included Bratmobile, [[The Need]], [[The Gossip]], C Average, Dead Moon, and [[Sarah Dougher]].&lt;ref name="vanHorn"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444773/bratmobile-need-gossip-playing-yoyo-a-gogo-festival/ |title=Bratmobile, Need, Gossip Playing Yoyo A Gogo Festival |author=van Horn, Teri |authorlink= |date=June 25, 2001 |publisher=MTV |work=Mtv.com |accessdate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also appearing were [[Erase Errata]], [[the Evaporators]], [[Mark Robinson (musician)|Mark Robinson]], [[the Microphones]], [[the Mountain Goats]], [[The Cannanes]], [[Tracy and the Plastics]], [[Mecca Normal]], and the [[Selby Tigers]].&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockbites.com/newsByMonth/2001May/2001May18-3.html |title=Yoyo 2001 |author=Jason, M. |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Rockbites |work=Rockbites.com |accessdate=March 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Yoyo festivals were always inclusive of the [[LGBT]] community, and since the original 1994 event always proudly sported a "solid queer presence".&lt;ref name="Stovall"/&gt; In its tradition, a later series of annual festivals dedicated to [[queercore]] began in Olympia in 2002 under the name ''[http://www.homoagogo.com/ Homo-A-Go-Go]''.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Angela |authorlink= |editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=Driver |year=2008 |title=Queer Youth Cultures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHEcZEcgFfcC&amp;pg=PA58 |location=Albany, NY |publisher=SUNY Press |page=58 |isbn=9780791478868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmakers Elina Shatkin, Cris Dupont, and Thomas Logoreci collaborated on a documentary about the 1999 and 2001 festivals, ''Try This At Home'', which was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://olympiafilmsociety.org/closing-night-try-this-at-home-qa-and-performance-by-c-average-guidon-bear-and-special-guests/ |title=Closing Night: 'Try This At Home', Q&amp;A, and Performance by C Average And Guidon Bear |author=Staff writer |year=2015 |publisher=Olympia Film Society |work=Olympiafilmsociety.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoyo and its participating artists are prominent features of ''A Revolution You Can Dance To: Indie Music in the Northwest'', an exhibition (2016–2017) at the [[Washington State History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Henry |first=Dusty |date=October 12, 2016 |title=The Washington State History Museum Lets You Experience the Origins of DIY IRL |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/the-washington-state-history-museum-lets-you-experience-the-origins-of-diy-irl/ |newspaper=Seattle Weekly |location=Seattle, Washington |publisher= |accessdate=October 31, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021081201/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/the-washington-state-history-museum-lets-you-experience-the-origins-of-diy-irl/ |archivedate=October 21, 2017 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
