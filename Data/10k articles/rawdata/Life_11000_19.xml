On March 22, 2014, a boat traveling on Africa's [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] capsized.  According to local police, 45 survivors were rescued.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda: 19 Die in Lake Albert Boat Accident|agency=AP|publisher=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uganda-19-die-lake-albert-boat-accident-23018766|date=March 22, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Officially, 251 people died in the accident.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=Uganda Lake Albert boat disaster 'killed 251 refugees'|date=March 27, 2014|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774338|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
Early on March 22, 2014, two boats carrying people from the [[Kyangwali Refugee Settlement]] refugee settlement left the [[Uganda]]n shore of Lake Albert en route to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;  On the way, one of the boats capsized.  Its passengers had been returning home after [[United Nations]] and Congolese forces won major victories over the [[Allied Democratic Forces]] and [[M23 (militia)|M23]] rebel groups in recent months.&lt;ref name=Xinhua&gt;{{cite news|title=Death toll in western Ugandan boat accident rises to 108 people|agency=Xinhua|date=March 25, 2014|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2014-03/25/c_126310046.htm|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;  There was no evidence that the boat's passengers had left Uganda due to conditions at the refugee camp.&lt;ref name=NewVision /&gt;

Reports indicated that the accident occurred due to overcrowding, a common cause of boating casualties in the region due to lax enforcement of safety rules.&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt;  The boat's listed capacity was 80, but approximately 300 people were on board at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;  The lack of life vests and inability of most passengers to swim also contributed to the high death toll.&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;{{cite news|title=Shipwreck on Africa's Lake Albert claims 98 lives|agency=AFP|work=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/shipwreck-on-africas-lake-albert-claims-98-lives-20140325-hvmd0.html|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the boat was in poor condition mechanically.&lt;ref name=NewVision&gt;{{cite news|title=Congolese hold prayers for boat accident victims|date=April 6, 2014|work=New Vision|author=Pascal Kwesiga|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/654257-congolese-hold-prayers-for-boat-accident-victims.html|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death toll and response==
Initial efforts led to the rescue of 45 survivors and recovery of 19 bodies on March 22.  Survivors were taken to the [[Bundibugyo District]] of Uganda, where they received care from the Ugandan government and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]].&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;  By March 24, 109 bodies were recovered.&lt;ref name=Xinhua /&gt;  Of those, 88 were accepted for burial in DRC.  The remainder were rejected due to cultural concerns over burying people more than 72 hours after death, and were buried at the Bundibugyo hospital cemetery.&lt;ref name=NewVision /&gt;  On March 27, the official death toll was revised to 251.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;  Most of the dead were children.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 100 Congolese refugees killed in boat accident, Uganda says|author=Philippa Croome|publisher=CNN|date=March 24, 2014|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/24/world/africa/uganda-boat-capsizes-death-toll/|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The boat's skipper recalled counting 96 adults on board, but he did not count the children.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;  Police said they believed nearly all passengers had been accounted for.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Boat accident death toll in western Uganda rises to 107|author=Elias Biryabarema|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/24/us-uganda-accident-idUSBREA2N0JO20140324|date=March 24, 2014|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement, the United Nations said it was "shocked and saddened" by the tragedy.&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; Three days of national mourning were declared in DRC.  The government also helped arrange funerals and offered support for the dead.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;  On April 7, DRC announced plans to repatriate about 21,000 refugees living in Uganda.  DRC envoy to Uganda Jean Okoto Lolakombe remarked "It is sad that we lost our people, but we have learnt a lesson from the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DRC to repatriate nationals from Uganda|work=The Africa Report|url=http://www.theafricareport.com/East-Horn-Africa/drc-to-repatriate-nationals-from-uganda.html|author=Godfrey Olukya|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 175,000 registered Congolese refugees living in Uganda as of March 2014.&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;

'''Achilles Tatius''' ([[Greek Language|Greek]]: Ἀχιλλεὺς Τάτιος) of [[Alexandria]] was a [[Roman era]] [[Greek literature|Greek]] writer of the 2nd century whose fame is attached to his only surviving work, the [[ancient Greek novel]] or [[Novel#Individual Novels Discussed|romance]] ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon|The Adventures of Leucippe and Clitophon]]''.

==Life and minor works==
[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]] (in his commentary on [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' 14.350), the ''[[Suda]]'', [[Photius]], in his  ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' (cod. 87), and the manuscript tradition all affirm he lived and wrote in [[Alexandria]]. The papyrus,&lt;ref&gt;The “early dating of P.Oxy 3836 holds, Achilles Tatius' novel must have been written 'nearer 120 than 150'" Albert Henrichs, ''Culture In Pieces: Essays on Ancient Texts in Honour of Peter Parsons'', eds. Dirk Obbink, Richard Rutherford, Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 309, n. 29 {{ISBN|0199292019}}, 9780199292011&lt;/ref&gt;  and linguistic&lt;ref&gt;"the use (albeit mid and erratic) of the Attic dialect suggest a date a little earlier [than mid-2nd century] in the same century." ''The Greek Novel: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide Oxford University Press'', 2010, p. 7 {{ISBN|019980303X}}, 9780199803033&lt;/ref&gt;  evidence demonstrate he flourished early in the 2nd century AD. 
Suda preserves a tradition that "He became at last a [[Christian]] and a [[bishop]]." There are literary parallels&lt;ref&gt;E.g., "We are referring to AA's almost literal echo of Achilles Tatius' ''Leucippe and Cleitophon'' (5.27.1) in Vr 55-56” L. R. LANZILLOTTA "The Acts of Andrew. A New Perspective on the Primitive Text" ''Cuadernos de Filologia Clásica. Estudios griegos e indoeuropeos'', v. 20, 2010, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;  between [[Leucippe and Clitophon]]  and the Christian [[Acts of Andrew]], a roughly contemporary  composition.&lt;ref&gt;PIÑERO &amp; DEL CERRO claim that Acts might in fact be the oldest of the major Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, based on AA's thought and views, with additional support from the fact that AA has not been influenced by the Acts of Peter. See PIÑERO, A. and DEL CERRO, G. (2004), ''Hechos apócrifos de los Apóstoles. I: Hechos de Andrés, Juan y Pedro''. Madrid: 107-235. Prieur stated that "The distinctive christology of the text", its silence concerning Jesus as a genuinely historical figure, and its lack of mention of church organisation, liturgy, and ecclesiastical rites, lead one to "militate for an early dating" (''Anchor Bible Dictionary'', vol. 1, p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt;
     
The ''Suda'' also ascribes to the author a work on the sphere (in [[Greek Language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|περὶ σφαίρας}}), a fragment of which, professing to be an introduction to the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Aratus]], may still be extant (in [[Greek Language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Eἰσαγωγὴ εἰς τὰ Ἀράτoυ φαινόμενα}}).  This, however, may be the work of another Achilles Tatius, who lived in the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Citation  | last =  | first =   | author-link =   | contribution = Achilles Tatius (2)  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work is referred to by [[Julius Firmicus Maternus|Firmicus Maternus]], who about 336 speaks of the ''prudentissimus Achilles'' in his ''Matheseos libri'' (''Math.'' iv. 10). The fragment was first published in 1567, then in the ''Uranologion'' of the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Denis Pétau]], with a [[Latin]] translation in 1630.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Achilles Tatius|volume=1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same source also mentions a work of Achilles Tatius on [[etymology]], and another entitled ''Miscellaneous Histories''.

'''Allen Francis Gardiner''' (1794–1851) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer and [[missionary]] to [[Patagonia]].{{sfn|Boase|1889|pp=409,410}}

==Biography==

Gardiner was the fifth son of Samuel Gardiner of Coombe Lodge, [[Oxfordshire]], by Mary, daughter of Charles Boddam of Capel House, Bull's Cross, [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], [[Middlesex]]. He was born on 28 January 1794 in the parsonage house at [[Basildon]], [[Berkshire]], where his parents were temporarily residing. He was religiously educated, and in May 1808 entered the [[Royal Naval Academy|Royal Naval College]], [[Portsmouth]].{{sfn|Boase|1889|p=409}}

===Naval career===
On 20 June 1810 he went to sea as a volunteer on board [[HMS Fortunee (1800)|HMS ''Fortunee'']]. He next served on the [[HMS Phoebe (1795)|HMS ''Phoebe'']] as a [[midshipman]] during the [[War of 1812]] until August 1814. He distinguished himself in the capture of the [[United States|American]] frigate [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']], and was sent to [[England]] as acting lieutenant of that prize. Being confirmed as [[lieutenant]] on 13 December, he served in the  [[frigate]] [[HMS Ganymede (1809)|HMS ''Ganymede'']] in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], then in the [[HMS Leander (1813)|''Leander'']], and the [[HMS Dauntless (1808)|''Dauntless'']] in various parts of the world.

He returned invalided to Portsmouth on 31 October 1822.

As [[second lieutenant]] of the [[HMS Jupiter (1813)|''Jupiter'']], Gardiner he was at [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1824, and in 1825 returned to England in charge of the ''Clinker.'' He was promoted to [[commander]] on 13 September 1826. After that, although he often applied for positions in the Royal Navy, he never succeeded in obtaining another appointment.{{sfn|Boase|1889|p=409}}

===Marriage and family===
On 1 July 1823, Gardiner married Julia Susanna, second daughter of John Reade and his wife of Ipsden House, [[Ipsden]], Oxfordshire. They had several children together including one son, Allen W. Gardiner. Not all his daughters survived to adulthood. Julia Gardiner died in the [[Isle of Wight]] on 23 May 1834.

About two years later, Gardiner married secondly, 7 October 1836, Elizabeth Lydia, eldest daughter of the Rev. Edward Garrard Marsh, vicar of Aylesford, Kent.{{sfn|Boase|1889|p=410}}

===Missionary work===
Long interested in the [[missionary]] work being done in non-Christian populations, after the death of one of his daughters, he decided to enter that field. With this view Gardiner went to [[Africa]] in 1834. Exploring the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] country, he started the first missionary station at [[Port Natal]] in present-day South Africa. From 1834 to 1838, he worked to plant Christian churches in Zululand, but political events and native wars combined to prevent any permanent success. 
He founded a mission at Hambanathi on near the [[Tongaat]] river.{{sfn|Watson|1960|p=60}} The took the name Hambanathi, which means "come with us" in the [[Zulu language]] from {{bible verse|Numbers|10:29}}.

From 1838 to 1843, Gardiner laboured among the indigenous peoples of Chile, and went from island to island in the Indian Archipelago (now called [[Tierra del Fuego]]). His efforts were foiled by the opposition of the various governments.{{sfn|Boase|1889|p=409}}

Gardiner's first visit to [[Tierra del Fuego]] took place 22 March 1842, when, coming from the [[Falkland Islands]] in the schooner ''Montgomery,'' he landed in Oazy harbour. He appealed to the [[Church Missionary Society]] to send missionaries to [[Patagonia]], but was declined for lack of funds to support such a distant endeavour. Similarly, he appealed to the [[English Wesleyan Mission|Wesleyan]] and [[London Missionary Society|London Missionary]] societies.

In 1844 a special society was formed for South America, which took the name of the [[South American Missionary Society|Patagonian Missionary Society]].{{sfn|Every|1915|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Anonymous | title = History of SAMS | publisher = South American Missionary Society (SAMS) | url = http://samsusa.org/content/history | accessdate = 23 June 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120826104715/http://samsusa.org/content/history | archive-date = 26 August 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hunt, a schoolmaster, was sent out as the first missionary and accompanied by Gardiner. They were unable to establish a mission and returned to England in June 1845. Gardiner departed England again 23 September 1845, and, in company with Federico Gonzales, a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Protestant]], from whom he learnt [[Spanish language|Spanish]], went to [[Bolivia]]. They distributed [[bible]]s to the Indian population, but were strongly opposed by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], who were the predominant Christian group in the country.

He established Gonzales as a missionary at [[Potosí|Potosi]], and returned to England, landing at [[Southampton]] 8 February 1847. The next year he sailed to Tierra del Fuego, where he surveyed the islands with a view to a mission, and suffered great hardships. He tried to interest the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] and the Foreign Missions of the [[Church of Scotland]] in this enterprise, but neither could render any aid. He proposed that a mission should be established on a substantial ship, rather than trying to set up one on land. At last, a lady at [[Cheltenham]] having given £700, the mission was determined on.

Accompanied by Richard Williams, surgeon; Joseph Erwin, ship-carpenter; John Maidment, catechist; and three Cornish fishermen, Pearce, Badcock, and Bryant, Gardiner sailed from [[Liverpool]] 7 September 1850 in the ''Ocean Queen.'' The party landed at [[Picton Island]] 5 December. He had with him two launches, each twenty-six feet long, in which had been stowed provisions to last for six months. The [[Yahgan]] people were hostile, the climate severe, and the country barren. The party were also hindered by failures such as the devastating realisation that they had left nearly all their shot on the ship, leaving them unable to hunt for fresh food. Six months elapsed without the arrival of additional supplies, which were detained at the Falkland Islands for want of a vessel. After relocating to Spaniard Harbour on the south east coast of the main island, the unfortunate men gradually died of starvation. Gardiner, the last survivor, is believed to have died 6 September 1851.{{sfn|Boase|1889|pp=409,410}}

On 21 October the ''John Davison'' arrived to resupply the group, and found all the men dead. On 6 January 1852 ''{{HMS|Dido|1836|6}}'' visited the place, but all the sailors could do was to bury the bodies and bring away Gardiner's journal. Two years later in 1854, the ''[[Allen Gardiner (schooner)|Allen Gardiner]]'', an 88-ton schooner named for him, was sent out to Patagonia as a British missionary ship. In 1856 Allen W. Gardiner, the captain's only son, went to that country as a missionary.{{sfn|Boase|1889|p=410}}

==Commemoration==
An islet in the Chilean group of islands which includes Picton island remains named after Gardiner. However, the street in [[Durban]] named in his honour,&lt;ref name="grah_GARD"&gt;{{Cite web | title = GARDINER STREET – DURBAN – A PICTORIAL HISTORY | author =  | work = Graham Leslie McCallum | date =  | accessdate = 2018-01-04 | url = https://grahamlesliemccallum.wordpress.com/2016/05/18/gardiner-street-durban/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was later renamed Dorothy Nyembe Street, to honor a South African activist and as part of the city's renaming process.

'''Anna of Foix-Candale''' (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|King Vladislaus II]].

==Life==
Anne was the daughter of [[Gaston de Foix, Count of Candale|Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale]], and [[Infanta Catherine of Navarre]]. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen [[Eleanor of Navarre]], and [[Gaston IV, Count of Foix]]. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics. 

The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]] of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in [[Székesfehérvár]] and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day.{{sfn|Cazacu|2017|p=204}}

Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as [[Anne of Bohemia and Hungary|Anna Jagellonica]], and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]].{{sfn|Cazacu|2017|p=204}} She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in [[Buda]] on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22.

==Children==
Although Anna was Vladislaus II's third wife, she gave birth to his only surviving legitimate children, both of whom were born in [[Buda]]:

* [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]], later [[Queen consort]] of [[Hungary]] and [[Royal Consorts of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. Married [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and they inherited Bohemia and what was left of Hungary.
* [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]], born on July 1, 1506, killed at the [[Battle of Mohács]] on August 29, 1526.{{sfn|Cazacu|2017|p=204}} Married [[Mary of Habsburg]]; their marriage was childless, although he fathered illegitimate issue.

==Plot== 
In 1969, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and sarcastic Emily Summerspring arrive at the El Royale, where they meet the hotel's only employee, Miles Miller.

Upon checking into the honeymoon suite, Sullivan (in reality an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Dwight Broadbeck, sent to investigate the hotel and remove evidence of their operations) discovers a passageway leading into a corridor looking onto [[one-way mirror]]s in each of the hotel's rooms, as well as a 16mm camera setup. Broadbeck witnesses an apparent kidnapping in progress in Emily's room; he is instructed to not to interfere with the kidnapping, and to sabotage the guests' vehicles to prevent any of them from escaping. Meanwhile, Flynn invites Sweet to join him for dinner. She sees him drugging her drink and knocks him unconscious with a bottle, running out of the hotel to escape. Miles finds Flynn and reveals to him the secret passageway, afterwards explaining that "management" has instructed him to film the guests and send the footage to them. However, he chose to hold back one particularly incriminating film reel of a recently deceased public figure.

Against orders, Broadbeck attempts to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. Emily opens fire on Broadbeck, killing him and accidentally injuring Miles who was watching from behind the mirror. Sweet attempts to escape in her car after witnessing the murder, but Flynn arrives. He reveals that he is really a criminal named Donald O'Kelly, who was imprisoned after a botched robbery ten years earlier. Recently freed on parole, O'Kelly has returned to the El Royale in priest garb to retrieve the money which his brother Felix had hidden there before being killed in a double cross ten years earlier - but owing to his failing memory he can't recall which room it was in. He had attempted to drug Sweet to gain access to her room, believing the cash to be buried there. The two agree to split the cash amongst themselves.

In the lobby, Emily and Rose, having discovered the corridor, interrogate Miles about the surveillance operation. It is revealed that Emily has forcibly removed her sister from a cult led by Billy Lee, a charismatic and sadistic figure responsible for a string of murders in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. However, Rose reveals that she has already called Billy about their location. As O'Kelly and Sweet attempt to leave with the money, Billy Lee and his cultists arrive and hold them hostage along with Emily and Miles.

While interrogating and terrorizing the group, Lee learns of the money and the film, which he realizes is worth much more than the money. In a sadistic game of roulette, Lee kills Emily. Using a brief power outage to his advantage, O'Kelly attacks Lee as the hotel lounge catches fire. During the chaos, Miles reveals that he served as a sniper in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] who killed 123 people. At Sweet's insistence, he picks up a gun and kills Lee and the other cultists. A distraught Rose stabs Miles, but is shot by O'Kelly afterwards. Before Miles passes, Sweet tells O'Kelly to [[Confession (religion)|absolve]] him of his guilt over his actions in Vietnam, which he does. O'Kelly and Sweet retrieve the money and Sweet tosses the film into the fire before the pair flee the hotel.

Not long after, Sweet performs at a show in [[Reno]] for the crowd, as O'Kelly proudly looks on.

'''''Bam''H I''' (from ''[[Bacillus amyloliquefaciens]]'') is a type II [[restriction endonuclease]], having the capacity for recognizing short sequences (6 b.p.) of DNA and specifically [[Bond cleavage|cleaving]] them at a [[Restriction site|target site]]. This exhibit focuses on the structure-function relations of ''Bam''H I as described by Newman, et al. (1995). ''Bam''H I binds at the [[recognition sequence]] 5'-GGATCC-3', and cleaves these sequences just after the 5'-guanine on each strand. This cleavage results in [[sticky end]]s which are 4 b.p. long. In its unbound form, ''Bam''H I displays a central [[beta sheet|b sheet]], which resides in between [[alpha helix|α-helices]]. ''Bam''H I is an extraordinarily unique molecule in that it undergoes a series of unconventional [[conformational change]]s upon [[DNA recognition]]. This allows the DNA to maintain its normal B-DNA conformation without distorting to facilitate enzyme binding. ''Bam''H I is a symmetric [[Protein dimer|dimer]]. DNA is bound in a large cleft that is formed between dimers; the enzyme binds in a "crossover" manner. Each ''Bam''H I subunit makes the majority of its backbone contacts with the phosphates of a DNA half site but base pair contacts are made between each ''Bam''H I subunit and nitrogenous bases in the major groove of the opposite DNA half site. The protein binds the bases through either direct [[hydrogen bond]]s or water-mediated H-bonds between the protein and every H-bond donor/acceptor group in the major groove. Major groove contacts are formed by atoms residing on the amino-terminus of a parallel 4 helix bundle. This bundle marks the ''Bam''H I dimer interface, and it is thought that the [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]]s of the NH2-terminal atoms on this bundle may contribute to [[electrostatic stabilization]].

==Sites of Recognition Between ''Bam''H I and DNA==
The ''Bam''H I enzyme is capable of making a large number of contacts with DNA. Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, as well as both main-chain and side-chain interactions aid in binding of the ''Bam''H I recognition sequence. In the major groove, the majority of enzyme/DNA contacts take place at the amino terminus of the parallel-4-helix bundle, made up of a4 and a6 from each subunit. Although a6 from each subunit does not enter the DNA major groove, its preceding loops interact with the outer ends of the recognition site. Conversely, a4 from each subunit does enter the major groove in the center of the recognition sequence. A total of 18 bonds are formed between the enzyme and DNA across the 6 base pair recognition sequence (12 direct and 6 water mediated bonds). Arg155 and Asp154 located in a spiral ring before a6 are connected with G:C base pairs outside while the middle G:C pairs are connected with Asp154, Arg122, and Asn116 (direct binding). Hydrogen bonding between water and Asn116 results in binding at A:T base pairs inside (water-mediated binding).&lt;ref name="Tong 621–630"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong Z, Zhao B, Zhao G, Shang H, Guan Y | title = 2'-O-methyl nucleotide modified DNA substrates influence the cleavage efficiencies of BamHI and BglII | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 621–30 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25116617 | doi = 10.1007/s12038-014-9466-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed above, the L and R subunits bind in a cross over manner, whereby the R-subunit of ''Bam''H I contacts the left DNA half-site of the recognition sequence. The binding of each ''Bam''H I subunit is precisely the same as its symmetrical partner. The recognition site for ''Bam''H I has a [[palindromic sequence]] which can be cut in half for ease in showing bonds.

&lt;/div&gt;

As of the end of 2010, there were 5 crystal structures of ''Bam''H I in the [[Protein Data Bank]]

== Two-metal Mechanism ==
BamHI, type II restriction endonucleases, often requires divalent metals as cofactors to catalyze DNA cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Alexander J. | last1 = Ninfa | first2 = David P. | last2 = Ballou | first3 = Marilee | last3 = Benore | name-list-format = vanc | title = Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology | date = 2008 | publisher = Wiley | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 978-0-470-08766-4 | page = 345 | edition = 2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-metal ion mechanism is one of the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed.  Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward.  The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viadiu H, Aggarwal AK | title = The role of metals in catalysis by the restriction endonuclease BamHI | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 910–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9783752 | doi = 10.1038/2352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site. This water molecule will act as the attacking molecule attacking the BamHI-DNA complex and thus making the complex negative. Later, another water will bound to metal ion B and donate a proton to the leaving group of complex, stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the leaving oxygen atom.&lt;ref name="pmid12496295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mordasini T, Curioni A, Andreoni W | title = Why do divalent metal ions either promote or inhibit enzymatic reactions? The case of BamHI restriction endonuclease from combined quantum-classical simulations | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 7 | pages = 4381–4 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12496295 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C200664200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of Ca2+ in the active site of BamHI is known. It is an inhibitor of DNA cleavage, converting BamHI into the pre-reactive state.  This revealed the water molecular is the attacking molecule.  It donates a proton to the leaving group that is bounded to Ca2+ forming a 90o O-P-O bond angles.  If Glu 113 is replaced by lysine, the cleavage is lost since Glu 113 accepts the proton from the attacking water molecule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">'''Bashir Nur Gedi''' (died 19 October 2007) was the radio manager and acting director of [[Radio Shabelle]], an independent radio station that regularly ran watchdog reports on government corruption in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]]. Gedi was murdered in 2007, though the precise circumstances of his death remain unclear. He was one of several prominent members of the station's leadership killed, including fellow acting media directors, [[Muktar Mohamed Hirabe]] and [[Hassan Osman Abdi]].&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/01/20121295474898100.html Radio journalist gunned down in Mogadishu - Africa - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was the eighth journalist killed that year in Somalia.&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/10/19/idUSHUL973327 Somali journalist gunned down in Mogadishu | Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters2&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/10/20/idUSL20381530 Media watchdogs denounce death of Somali reporter | Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bashir Gedi served as the acting director for Radio Shabelle, an independent Somalian radio station that reports news while routinely highlighting government and military corruption. During Gedi's tenure, the government shut down Radio Shabelle, [[HornAfrik Media Inc|HornAfrik]] and [[IQK Koranic]].,&lt;ref name=reuters1 /&gt; and intimidated the station with violence, shooting at the building and rounding up 18 employees for questioning.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;[http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/story.html?id=1630695a-1dc8-4560-b28f-4e7f75b9495e Somali journalist gunned down in Mogadishu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328084818/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/story.html?id=1630695a-1dc8-4560-b28f-4e7f75b9495e |date=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After one week of hiding inside the building of Radio Shabelle because of threats, Bashir Gedi ventured home on October 19, 2007. It was then that he was killed by a group of young gunmen, reported to be between the ages of 14 and 20, who were armed with pistols.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;[http://cpj.org/2007/10/radio-shabelle-manager-assassinated.php Radio Shabelle manager assassinated - Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garowe&gt;[http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Press_Releases_32/Somalia_Urgent_appeal_to_international_community_after_media_owner_murdered.shtml Garowe Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021081913/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Press_Releases_32/Somalia_Urgent_appeal_to_international_community_after_media_owner_murdered.shtml |date=October 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, his murder remains unsolved.&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;  Following his death, two more acting directors of Radio Shaballe, Muktar Mohamed Hirabe and Hassan "Fantastic" Osman Abdi,&lt;ref name="10news"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130116005416/http://www.10news.com/news/30324396/detail.html Gunmen Kill Journalist In Somalia - San Diego News Story - KGTV San Diego&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; have been murdered in very similar fashion.&lt;ref name=aljazeera /&gt;

==Context==
Journalists in Somalia, which has been in a state of anarchy since dictator [[Mohamed Siad Barre]] was overthrown in 1991, routinely face violence, arbitrary imprisonment and harassment.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  The danger has intensified since the Somali government, with Ethiopian military help, expelled Islamist militants from Mogadishu in 2007.  Journalists not only face attacks from the government but also the insurgent forces angry with the critical reporting by Somalia's media.&lt;ref name=reuters2 /&gt; According to statistics kept by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], 40 journalists have been killed or murdered in Somalia since 1992 and it is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpj.org/killed/ Journalists Killed since 1992 - Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Although Bashir Gedi knew he was under constant threat of being harmed or killed by those factions angry with his Radio Shabelle's reports, he continued to lead his station in their mission to disseminate news.  His and his colleagues' subsequent murders have drawn worldwide attention to the problems faced by Somalian journalists.

==Reactions==
[[Human Rights Watch]] called the development of independent and critical radio networks like Shabelle one of the most positive developments since Somalia slipped into anarchy.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G"&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2007-10-23-rights-group-chides-somali-govt-for-media-abuses Rights group chides Somali govt for media abuses - News - Mail &amp; Guardian Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, "Shabelle, considered one of the leading stations in Somalia, has been harassed, threatened, and attacked by both government security forces and insurgents because of its critical reporting of the ongoing violence in Mogadishu."

[[Reporters Without Borders]] said, "The security situation in Mogadishu seems to be completely out of control. Abandoned by the Somali authorities and their international partners, journalists have become key targets who are easily accessible. One after another, the country's leading media owners are being eliminated. By taking no action in this climate of total impunity, those who could be in a position to stop these murders will end up becoming accomplices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201201311207.html allAfrica.com: Somalia: Murder of the Head of Radio Shabelle in Mogadishu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It criticized the state of total impunity whereby no suspects are ever brought to trial or convicted.&lt;ref name=reuters2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Garowe /&gt;

The Somali press freedom group, the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), has proclaimed the murder to be politically motivated. Omar Faruk Osman, who is the secretary-general NUSOJ, said, "It is totally intolerable and sends a clear message to each media person that his or her life is at risk because of his or her media activity. We have been appealing to political groups to end killing of media people, but no group listens."&lt;ref name=reuters2 /&gt;

'''Cerebral achromatopsia''' is a type of color-blindness caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is often confused with congenital [[achromatopsia]]&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;Briefing from 2008 Achromatopsia Conference by James Fulton&lt;/ref&gt; but underlying physiological deficits of the disorders are completely distinct. A similar, but distinct, deficit called '''color agnosia''' exists in which a person has intact color perception (as measured by a matching task) but has deficits in color recognition, such as knowing which color they are looking at.

==Signs and symptoms==

Patients with cerebral achromatopsia deny having any experience of color when asked and fail standard clinical assessments like the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test|Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test]] (a test of color ordering with no naming requirements). Patients may often [[Anosognosia|not notice their loss of color vision]] and merely describe the world they see as being "drab". Most describe seeing the world in "shades of gray".&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt; This observation notes a key difference between cerebral and congenital achromatopsia, as those born with achromatopsia have never had an experience of color or gray.

==Pathophysiology==

Cerebral achromatopsia differs from other forms of color blindness in subtle but important ways. It is a consequence of cortical damage that arises through [[ischemia]] or [[infarction]] of a specific area in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex of humans.&lt;ref  name=Jaeger&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaeger W, Krastel H, Braun S |title=[Cerebral achromatopsia (symptoms, course, differential diagnosis and strategy of the study). I] |language=German |journal=Klin Monbl Augenheilkd |volume=193 |issue=6 |pages=627–34 |date=December 1988 |pmid=3265459 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1050309 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This damage is almost always the result of injury or illness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Classification===
A 2005 study examined 92 case studies since 1970 in which cerebral lesions affected color vision.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; The severity and size of the visual field affected in cerebral achromatopsiacs vary from patient to patient.

====Bilateral and hemifield====

The majority of cases in the 2005 study were the result of bilateral lesions in the ventral occipital cortex.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; It is unknown whether this was the result of bilateral lesions being more likely to produce color-loss symptoms, or if it was a sampling effect of patients with more severe brain trauma more often being admitted for treatment. In many of the cases examined, patients reported only partial loss of color vision. The locations of color vision loss can be restricted to one hemisphere or one quarter of the visual field. The term "hemiachromatopsia" has been used to denote patients who experience loss of color in only one hemisphere of the visual field. However, as applied to achromatopia resulting from brain trauma, the term is incomplete in characterizing the often-complex nature of the vision loss.

====Transient====

In still rarer cases, temporary ischemia of the associated ventral occipital cortex can result in transient achromatopsia. The condition has thus far been characterized only in stroke patients and provides further support for a color processing area.

In one case, a 78-year-old stroke victim had lost the ability to identify color, but was unaware of his deficit until doctors performed color discretion tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Arx SW, Müri RM, Heinemann D, Hess CW, Nyffeler T |title=Anosognosia for cerebral achromatopsia--a longitudinal case study |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=970–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19944708 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.11.018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even when presented with this information, the patient believed he had retained his ability to perceive color even though the world around him appeared grey. He attributed this achromatism to "poor lighting" and it took several weeks for the patient to fully appreciate the extent of his disability. In addition, the characteristic comorbidity of prosopagnosia was present. After two months and frequent sessions with doctors, tests indicated his color had fully returned. The ischemia caused by lesions on the posterior cerebral arteries had subsided and follow up MRI scans indicated that blood flow had once again returned to the VOC.

===Co-occurrence with other deficits===
The most common disorder seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is [[prosopagnosia]], the inability to recognize or recall faces. In some studies, the comorbidity is seen as high as 72%.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; This significance has not been overlooked and is a subject of ongoing research. See {{section link||Difference from congenital achromatopsia}} below.

Cerebral achromatopsiacs often have poor spatial acuity.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

The most common tests perform to diagnose cerebral achromatopsia are the [[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]], the [[Ishihara plate]] test, and the color-naming test.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Testing and diagnosis for cerebral achromatopsia is often incomplete and misdiagnosed in doctor’s offices.&lt;ref name=Fulton/&gt;

Remarkably, almost 50% of tested patients diagnosed with cerebral achromatopsia are able to perform normally on the color-naming test. However, these results are somewhat in question because of the sources from which many of these reports come.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Only 29% of cerebral achromatopsia patients successfully pass the Ishihara plate test, which is a more accepted and more standardized test for color blindness.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt;

===Difference from congenital achromatopsia===
The most apparent distinguishing characteristic between congenital achromatopsia and cerebral achromatopsia is the sudden onset of color vision loss following a severe head injury or damage to the occipital lobe following a stroke or similar ischemic event.&lt;ref name=Jaeger/&gt;  Non-invasive imaging techniques can be the most helpful in determining whether the area of damage following a traumatic event is an correlated with color-vision processing. Simple diagnostic tools can also be used to determine whether a patient is a likely candidate for further testing, as advancing imaging procedures can often prove expensive and unnecessary.

Co-morbid factors can be valuable indicators of the likelihood of cerebral achromatoptsia. One disorder often seen alongside cerebral achromatopsia is prosopagnosia, the inability to recall or recognize faces. The correlation is still the subject of ongoing research, but the most telltale clue in this association is the close proximity of brain lesions seen in prosopagnosics and cerebral achromatopsiacs without prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"/&gt; Figure 1 illustrates overlap of brain lesions compiled from numerous case reports of both disorders. A common area of damage associated with both disorders can be seen in the right occipital lobe.

==Treatment==

No current treatment is known for the disorder.
==History==

The number of reported cases of cerebral achromatopsia are relatively few compared with other forms of color-vision loss. In addition, the severity of the color perception deficits along with other psychological effects vary between patients.&lt;ref name="Bouvier SE, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouvier SE, Engel SA |title=Behavioral deficits and cortical damage loci in cerebral achromatopsia |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=183–91 |date=February 2006 |pmid=15858161 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi096 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

Based on the knowledge gained from cerebral achromatopsia case studies, current research is focusing on learning more about the cortical area involved in color processing.

A recent study provided some of the first direct evidence of color-specific processing in the ventral occipital cortex. A subject with a history of seizure activity was examined using fMRI and electrode implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphey DK, Yoshor D, Beauchamp MS |title=Perception matches selectivity in the human anterior color center |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=216–20 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18258428 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the fMRI, researchers examined the areas of blood oxygenation in the occipital lobe as the subject viewed various color-specific stimuli. The result of the experiment was the identification of an area in the subject, slightly anterior to the lesioned area in cerebral achromatic patients, that responded to variance in color stimulation. The resolution of the MRI was a limiting factor in identifying areas corresponding to specific colors. The next portion of the study used an electrode implanted in the right hemisphere in the location identified by the fMRI scan as pertaining to color processing. It was found the electrical activity of the area increased when the subject was presented with blue stimuli. The next, and most significant finding of the study, was that when the electrode was used to present an electrical stimulus in the subject’s brain, the subject reported the perception of the color blue. Such a result is consistent with other reports of electrical stimulation in visual field maps eliciting perception of phosphines in subjects’ visual field.

The color stimulus presented is not the only factor in determining the involvement of the VOC in color processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beauchamp MS, Haxby JV, Jennings JE, DeYoe EA |title=An fMRI version of the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue test reveals multiple color-selective areas in human ventral occipitotemporal cortex |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=257–63 |year=1999 |pmid=10355906 |doi=10.1093/cercor/9.3.257 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of attention and the type of object also affect the activiation of the VOC. It has been noted that this area of the occipital lobe may not be a processing center but rather a pathway that is a critical intersection of several cortical areas involved in color perception.

==Society and culture==

The disorder is often presented as evidence of our incomplete knowledge of color processing. Color vision research is a well-studied field of modern neuroscience and the underlying anatomical processing in the retina have been well categorized. The presence of another factor in the perception of color by humans illustrates the need for more research.

===The case of the colorblind painter===

The most famous instance of cerebral achromatopsia is that of "Jonathan I." immortalized in a case study by [[Oliver Sacks]] and Robert Wasserman, and published as "The Case of the Colorblind Painter".&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. "The Case of the Colorblind Painter". ''An Anthropologist on Mars''. New York: Random House, 1995. 3-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay tracks Johnathan I.'s experience with cerebral achromatopsia from the point where an injury to his occipital lobe leaves him without the ability to perceive color, through his subsequent struggles to adapt to a black, white and gray world, and finally to his acceptance and even gratitude for his condition. Especially pertinent is the analysis of how cerebral achromatopsia affects his practice as a painter and artist. Descriptions of cerebral achromatopsia's effects on his psychological health and visual perception are especially striking. For instance, in recounting Mr. I.'s descriptions of flesh and foods, the authors write:

{{quote|Mr. I. could hardly bear the changed appearances of people ("like animated gray statues") any more than he could bear his own changed appearance in the mirror: he shunned social intercourse and found sexual intercourse impossible. He saw people's flesh, his wife's flesh, his own flesh, as an abhorrent gray; "flesh-colored" now appeared "rat-colored" to him. This was so even when he closed his eyes, for his preternaturally vivid ("eidetic") visual imagery was preserved but now without color, and forced on him images, forced him to "see" but see internally with the wrongness of his achromatopsia. He found foods disgusting in their grayish, dead appearance and had to close his eyes to eat. But this did not help very much, for the mental image of a tomato was as black as its appearance.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6188">[[File:Nikolai Tchaikovsky.jpg|thumb|Russian revolutionary [[Nikolai Tchaikovsky]] (1851–1926), after whom the Circle was named.]]
The '''Circle of Tchaikovsky''', also known as '''Tchaikovtsy''', '''Chaikovtsy''', or the '''Grand Propaganda Society''' (''Чайковцы'', ''Chaykovtsy''; ''Большое общество пропаганды'' ''Bolshoye obshchestvo propagandy'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[literary society]] for self-education and a [[revolutionary]] organization of the [[Narodniks]] in the early 1870s.

== Background and origin ==
The [[intelligentsia]] of mid-nineteenth century [[Tsarist]] Russia were dissatisfied with what they saw as social stagnation of the nation and had begun to demand reform (their attitude was notably characterised by novelist [[Ivan Turgenev]] as [[nihilism]]).&lt;ref name=hodge&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|2008|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of this social activism gave rise to a number of secret organisations, among them [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]], [[People's Revenge]], and the Circle of Tchaikovsky.&lt;ref name=hodge/&gt;

The Circle was founded in [[St. Petersburg]] during student unrest in 1868-1869 as a group opposed to the reckless violence of [[Sergey Nechayev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mavor|1914|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Nikolai Tchaikovsky]], one of its prominent members. A literary society for self-education within the Medical Surgical Academy was the heart of the organization, the initial purpose of which was to share books and knowledge that had been banned in the [[Russian Empire]]. It included students [[Mark Natanson]], V. M. Aleksandrov, and [[Anatoly Serdyukov]], who were joined by Nikolai Tchaikovsky and [[Feofan Lermontov]]. Besides self-education, the circle's main tasks were to unite students of Petersburg and other cities, and conduct [[propaganda]] among workers and [[peasant]]s with the purpose of fomenting a [[social revolution]]. The Tchaikovsky set higher moral standards for their members in the face of Nechayev's unscrupulousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beran|2007|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a negative attitude towards struggle for [[political freedom]]s, which, in their view, were only advantageous to the arising Russian [[bourgeoisie]]. These principles were formulated in the ''Программа для кружков самообразования и практической деятельности'' (''Program for the circles of self-education and practical activity''), put together by the Tchaikovtsy in late 1870 – early 1871.

== Activities ==
One of the first tasks of the Tchaikovtsy was to organize the printing, publishing, and distribution of scientific and revolutionary literature with the help of publishers [[Nikolai Polyakov]], [[Kozma Soldatyonkov]], and others. These literary works included the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' by [[Karl Marx]], and books by others including [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], [[Nikolai Dobrolyubov]], [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Pyotr Lavrov]], [[Vasili Bervi]], [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. In the summer of 1871, the circle of Natanson merged with a female self-education circle of [[Alexandra Kornilova]] and [[Sophia Perovskaya]]. Soon, they were joined by [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky|Sergei Stepnyak-Kravchinsky]], [[Dmitry Klements]], [[Sergei Sinegub]], [[Nikolai Charushin]], [[Leonid Shishko]], and others. The central Petersburg circle comprised around 60 people. Circles in [[Moscow]] ([[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov]], [[Lev Tikhomirov]], [[Mikhail Frolenko]]), [[Odessa]] ([[Felix Volkhovsky]], [[Andrei Zhelyabov]]), [[Kiev]] ([[Yakov Stefanovich]], [[Pavel Axelrod]]) and other cities sided with the Petersburg cell on a federal basis. Altogether, the Tchaikovtsy numbered around 100 participants.

In 1872, the Tchaikovtsy began organizing circles of workers with the purpose of training propagandists for work in the countryside. These activities were most successful in Petersburg and Odessa, where the circles comprised around 400 workers. Some of these workers—including [[Viktor Obnorsky]] and [[Feodor Kravchenko]]—would later become the founders of the first [[proletarian]] organizations such as the [[Worker's Union of Southern Russia]] (Южнороссийский союз рабочих) and [[Northern Union of the Russian Workers]] (Северный союз русских рабочих). The results of this propaganda work were summarized in a report by Peter Kropotkin, which would be discussed in the Petersburg circle of the Tchaikovtsy in late 1873.

The final stage of activities of the Tchaikovtsy included the [[Call to the People campaign]], bringing revolutionary propaganda and organization directly to the peasants of Russia. In 1873/1874, most members of the circle were arrested and were later prosecuted in the [[trial of the 193]]. Tschaikovsky joined a religious-communist group and emigrated to the United States in 1874.

(2001). Ritual and medical circumcision among Filipino boys: Evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. In G.C. Denniston, F.M. Hodges, &amp; M.F.

New York: Kluwer/Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-46701-1}} {{ISBN|9-780306-467011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including their frequency and severity. The CAPS distinguishes itself from other PTSD assessments in that it can also assess for current or past diagnoses of PTSD.

== Background ==
The CAPS was originally designed by the National Center for PTSD to assess PTSD. This measure was intended to be clinician-administered, and only administered by those clinicians with prior experience, training, and knowledge of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Previous measures of PTSD typically included introspective (subjective) self-report measures that the patient fills out without the help of a clinician. The clinically-administered PTSD scale was modeled after the [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression|Hamilton Depression Scale]] (HDRS),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weathers|last2=Keane|last3=Davidson|first=|date=2001|title=Clinician-administered PTSD scale: A review of the first ten years of research|url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/articles/article-pdf/id23235.pdf|journal=Depression and Anxiety|doi=10.1002/da.1029|pmid=11387733|volume=13|issue=3|access-date=2016-03-07|pages=132–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clinician-administered scale to assess depressive features. It should be noted however that the HDRS has been subject to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagby RM, Ryder AG, Schuller DR, Marshall MB |year=2004 |title=The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: has the gold standard become a lead weight? |journal= American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=12 |pages=2163–77 |pmid=15569884 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important features of the CAPS are:
# Allows for a range of symptom severity rather than a dichotomous (yes/no) result. This allows for both a diagnosis as well as a sliding scale for clinicians to assess relative changes. It can be used for weekly changes or for a one-time diagnosis.  
# Creation of two scales: frequency and severity of symptoms. To fulfill a symptom criteria, a patient needs to have a certain frequency and severity of symptoms. This allows for a more refined level of measurement by measuring both how often a patient has symptoms and how severe they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=Dudley|date=1994|title=Rationale and development of the clinician-administered PTSD Scales|url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/newsletters/research-quarterly/V5N2.pdf|journal=The National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Uniformity - the assessment was created in a way that would promote uniform administration of the assessment through clear questions and probes for interviewers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The CAPS has developed over the years to keep up with changes in the widely used [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The DSM is currently in its fifth edition (DSM-5, May 2013) and serves as a guide to clinicians in diagnosing mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the DSM system of psychiatric classifications is problematic in typecasting many relatively normal behavioral issues as "abnormal" (e.g., such as the over-classification of ADHD), promoting and entrenching archaic stereotypical psychiatric nosology, and in reifying subjective suppositions about psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J. (2006). ''Scientific Analysis of Personality and Individual Differences''. D.Sc. Thesis, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland. [http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35180021?selectedversion=NBD43801500 National Library of Australia catalogue entry for D.Sc. thesis]. [Retrieved 6 November 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed critiques of the DSM system of psychiatric classifications have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Beutler, L.E., &amp; Malik, M.L. (2002). ''Rethinking the DSM: A Psychological Perspective''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malik, M.L., Johannsen, B.E., &amp; Beutler, L.E. (2008). Personality dosorders and the DSM: A critical review. In G.J. Boyle, G. Matthews, &amp; D.H. Saklofske. (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Personality Theory and Assessment: Vol. 1 - Personality Theories and Models''. Los Angeles, CA: Sage Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are three versions of the CAPS-5 (Table 1). One version provides responses in the past month, one provides responses in the past week, and the last provides responses for the worst month (lifetime PTSD). There is also a version for children - the CAPS-CA-5&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/adult-int/caps.asp|title=Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) - PTSD: National Center for PTSD|website=www.ptsd.va.gov|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1 also shows the development of the CAPS by DSM version.

The CAPS1 was intended to monitor changes over a one-month period, whereas the CAPS-2 was developed to monitor changes over a week period. The CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 were later changed to the CAPS-DX and CAPS-SX respectively to avoid confusion over future versions. The CAPS-5 has two versions – one that can assess for one-week changes and one that can assess for one-month changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The one-week changes may be more helpful for treatment providers to see change in symptom scores over time, whereas the one-month changes may be more helpful to assess for baseline PTSD.

The CAPS has been revised to the CAPS-5 to reflect current changes in the [[DSM-5]]. The CAPS is currently the gold-standard assessment for PTSD and is used widely through the VA for compensation and pension determinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Department of Veterans Affairs|date=|title=Best Practice Manual for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Compensation and Pension Examinations|url=http://www.avapl.org/pub/PTSD%20Manual%20final%206.pdf|journal=Veterans Affairs Brief|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As described in Table 1, there are three versions of the CAPS, one to monitor monthly changes (often used for diagnosis), one to monitor weekly changes (often for assessing for time changes) and worst month (to assess for lifetime PTSD).

=== Current version and recent changes ===
The current CAPS-5 contains 30 questions relating to PTSD symptoms. Each question asks about both the frequency and the severity of each symptom. These questions are split into categories. Each criterion has several questions, and scores for each criterion are added up at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/PTSD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=PTSD Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=2013|website=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Criterion A: A traumatic event 
* Criterion B: Re-experiencing symptoms 
* Criterion C: Avoidance symptoms 
* Criterion D: Negative alterations in cognitions and mood 
* Criterion E: Alterations in arousal and reactivity 
* Criterion F: Disturbance lasted at least a month 
* Criterion G: Disturbance causing impairment

==== Scoring ====
To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;
* An index trauma/Criterion A event
* At least '''one''' Criterion B symptom (questions 1-5)
* At least '''one''' Criterion C symptom (questions 6-7) 
* At least '''two''' Criterion D symptoms (questions 8-14)
* At least '''two''' Criterion E symptoms (questions 15-20)
Both criterion F and G must be met as well for a PTSD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; To meet criteria for a symptom, a patient must meet criteria in both frequency and intensity score for each item. Frequency and intensity and then combined to form a single severity score. Severity scores range from 0-4, with 0 being absent to 4 being extreme/incapacitating.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

The National Center for PTSD provides information for clinicians to learn [http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/overview/caps-training.asp how to administer and score the CAPS]''.'' They recommend that, in addition to training, the CAPS be administered by clinicians familiar with PTSD.

==Sample question and clinician follow-up==
&lt;u&gt;Sample Question:&lt;/u&gt; "In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams?")&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; 
* To calculate frequency, a patient may be asked "In the past month, have you had any unwanted memories of (EVENT) while you were awake, so not counting dreams?" or "How often have you had these memories in the past month?"&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;
* To calculate intensity, a patient may be asked "How much do these memories bother you" and "Are you able to put them out of your mind and think about something else."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; 
These frequency and intensity scores will get calculated together to create a severity score for each question. Total symptom severity is calculated by summing up all the individual item severity scores. For example, in the CAPS-IV scoring, to meet criteria for a symptom, the symptom must have an intensity score of 2 (on a scale or 0-4) or greater and a frequency score of 1 (on a scale of 0–4) or greater.

==Psychometric properties==
'''Test-Retest Reliability:''' Although relatively high test-retest coefficients have been reported (Time 1 vs. Time 2), no information has been provided about the actual retest time interval.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Weathers, F.W., Bovin, M.J., Lee, D.J., Sloan, D.M., Schnurr, P.P., Kaloupek, D.G., Keane, T.M., &amp; Marx, B.P.

Advance  online  publication. doi.org/10.1037/pas0000486&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to interpret test-retest reliability coefficients in the absence of knowing the retest time interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boyle | first1 = G.J. | year = 1985 | title = Self report measures of depression: Some psychometric considerations | url = | journal = British Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 45–59 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8260.1985.tb01312.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, G.J., Saklofske, D.H., Matthews, G. (2015). Criteria for selection and evaluation of scales/measures. In G.J. Boyle et al. (Eds.), ''Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Constructs''. San Diego, CA: Elsevier/Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Without provision of clear-cut information about the temporal stability of the CAPS-5 over varying intervals of time (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc.), administration of the CAPS-5 cannot be recommended for assessment of PTSD in clinical populations.

'''Validity:''' The most recent version of the CAPS (CAPS-5) has demonstrated convergent validity with other measures of PTSD including the CAPS-IV and the PTSD Checklist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The CAPS-5 demonstrated discriminant validity with other measures, including measures of anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also has been translated into multiple languages, such as the Turkish and German that have also demonstrated validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boysan|first=Murat|last2=Ozhemir|first2=Pinar|last3=Yilmaz|first3=Ekrem|last4=Selvi|first4=Yavuz|last5=Özdemir|first5=Osman|last6=Kefeli|first6=Mehmet|date=2017|title=Psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (Turkish CAPS-5)|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/24750573.2017.1326746|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=173-184|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller-Engelmann|first=Meike|last2=Schnyder|first2=Ulrich|last3=Dittmann|first3=Clara|last4=Priebe|first4=Kathlen|last5=Bohus|first5=Martin|last6=Thome|first6=Janine|last7=Fydrich|first7=Thomas|last8=Pfaltz|first8=Monique|last9=Steil|first9=Regina|date=2018|title=Psychometric Properties and Factor Structure of the German Version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1073191118774840|journal=Assessment|volume=|pages=1-11|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
* The CAPS can only assess for one trauma (one Criterion A event). This can present difficulties when a patient may have more than one trauma.
* The CAPS can be a lengthy interview taking up to 45–60 minutes. It may be difficult to find the personnel and time to conduct these interviews for clinics that have fewer resources available. 
* The CAPS was constructed using data from military veterans. Although it is used in non-veteran populations, there may be differences in traumatology and symptoms between these populations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21556">'''Crasher''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] in the [[Gobots]] toyline, and the subsequent [[Challenge of the GoBots]] cartoon and the ''[[Transformers]]'' series. She was a regular character in the Gobots cartoon and star of the film ''Gobots: Battle of the Rock Lords'' voiced by [[Marilyn Lightstone]]. She is sometimes called "'''Fracture'''" for trademark purposes.

The female Crasher was one of [[Cy-Kill]]'s most loyal Renegades, despite having a somewhat manic personality. One of her favoured pastimes is participating in demolition derbies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1-4402-1282-1 | page= 90=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered reckless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | title = News | journal = Computer &amp; Video Games| volume = 1 | issue = 61 | page = 8 | date = |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue061/Pages/CVG06100008.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under interrogation, she admitted to having a crush on [[Leader-1]] before the Guardians and Renegades began their struggle. Unlike most Gobots, she rarely seems to use her hand-mounted blasters, instead using a trademark attack wherein she stamps her foot on the ground to create a powerful earthquake-style energy discharge that could track its victim in much the same manner as a heat-seeking missile. Crasher's seeming state of near-madness effectively renders her fearless, and she has an ongoing grudge with the Guardian [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]], rarely avoiding a chance to battle him. However, she tends to take any defeat or challenge very personally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oafe.net/yo/tfm_frac.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her gender, unlike many 1980s female cartoon characters, Crasher is shown to be treated equally compared to her male counterparts, and is feared by most Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Going, Going, Gobots by Matt Carara, Toyfare Magazine #123, November 2007, page 80-82&lt;/ref&gt; Crasher enjoyed Gobot demolition derbies and at one time had a crush on [[Leader-1]].

According to Hasbro employees Crasher was the inspiration for the Decepticon [[Fracture (Transformers)|Fracture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/04/8_things_you_didnt_know_about_gobots_and_probably.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
Crasher appears in almost every episode, usually as a featured character.

In the pilot Crasher and Cop-Tur aid Cy-Kill when he steals the astrobeam and escapes Gobotron to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Battle for Gobotron|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= Written by Alan Burnett, Jeff Segal and Tom Ruegger |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= September 8, 1984 |season= 1|number= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cy-Kill, [[Cop-Tur]], Crasher, [[Geeper-Creeper]], [[Pincher (Gobots)|Pincher]], and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attack a lab, but it is defended by Leader-1, Baron Von Joy, Blaster, Dozer, [[Dumper (Gobots)|Dumper]], [[Road Ranger (Gobots)|Road Ranger]], Scooter, [[Scratch (Gobots)|Scratch]] and [[Turbo (Gobots)|Turbo]]. Although the Guardians were winning the battle, an accidental backfire from Baron Von Joy's weapon allows the Renegades to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= It's The Thought That Counts|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cy-Kill]], Cop-Tur, Crasher and [[Snoop (Gobots)|Snoop]] attack [[Leader-1]], Turbo, [[Scooter (Gobots)|Scooter]] and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]]. Crasher wounds Small Foot. After attaining recordings of the Guardians the Renegades retreat. Using the recordings Cy-Kill has [[Herr Fiend]] program robot duplicates of the Guardians. When demonstrating [[Space Bender]] weapon to Unicom, Leader-1 learns that the Renegades ware attacking Washington. The Renegades ambush Leader-1 and replaced him with his duplicate. Leading the [[Command Center (Gobots)|Command Center]] back to Gobotron and getting rid of Scooter and Small Foot the Renegades then release duplicates of [[Path Finder (Gobots)|Path Finder]], [[Rest-Q]], [[Van Guard]] and Turbo. Small Foot and Scooter are able to capture the Turbo duplicate and learn where their friends are being held. Cy-Kill then replaces [[Good Night (Gobots)|Good Night]]. Using the duplicate Turbo the Guardians infiltrate the Renegade base, free the captured Guardians and escape from [[Spoons (Gobots)|Spoons]] and [[Fitor]]. Although blocked by the Renegades, Scooter uses a hologram of [[Zod (Gobots)|Zod]] to make the Renegades flee. Making it back to Gobotron the Guardians are attacked by the Guardian duplicates. The real Guardians are able to defeat their duplicates with the aid of the real [[Zeemon]], [[Hans-Cuff]] and Rest-Q. Cy-Kill then arrives in [[Thrustor]] with more duplicates, but Small Foot is able to stop with robots using the Space Bender, which fuses their robot brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Doppleganger|episodelink= |series= Challenge of the GoBots|serieslink= Challenge of the GoBots|credits= |network= First-run syndication|station= |airdate= |season= 1|number= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scooter and [[Small Foot (Gobots)|Small Foot]] join Nick and A.J. to watch a car stunt show which is attacked by Crasher, [[BuggyMan]] and [[Fly Trap]]. Small Foot fights Buggyman and defeats him, but the Renegades regain the upper hand until the Guardians are rescued by Leader-1 and Turbo who arrived in [[Power Suit (Gobots)|Power Suit]]s. Cy-Kill vows to gain Power Suits for the Renegades. Scooter decides he needed more firepower, so he has [[Baron Von Joy]] remove his damaged holo projector in favor of a blaster unit. [[Screw Head]], [[Bad Boy (Gobots)|Bad Boy]] and Cop-Tur are sent to attack Unicom bases and distract the Guardians while Cy-Kill, Crasher and Scorp attempt to take the suits from the Guardian Command Center. Small Foot and Scooter are able to delay the Renegades until Leader-1 and Turbo return to chase away the Renegades.

===Fun Publications===
Crasher was also featured in various Transformers fiction from [[Fun Publications]], in both the "Ask [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]]" and "Renegade Rhetoric" [[Facebook]] series. Notably, she appeared in the "Echoes and Fragments" story that intermingled elements from GoBots into the plot of ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''; in a nod to her two identities, Crasher was reformatted by [[Unicron]] into Fracture.

===Toys===
*'''''Tonka GoBots'' 21 Crasher''' (1983)
:Crasher’s toy was a re-release of the [[Machine Robo]] ''[[Porsche]] Robo'' figure. It was first issued by [[Tonka]] in 1983, in an authentic white [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]] Porsche [[livery]] (of the [[Porsche in motorsport|1982-87 factory team]]).

*'''''Tonka GoBots'' 21 Crasher''' (1984)
:From the outset the character was black/red in the cartoon, and by 1984 the toy was recolored to match Crasher's on-screen appearance. There was a variant of the stickers on this toy. One having a solid white background behind the "1" on the arms, the other having a red stripe above the white.
:This toy was sold by itself and in a gift pack with Tank and Geeper-Creeper.

*'''''Robo Machines'' Sports Car''' (1993)
:In 1993, the white version (with a new sticker sheet) was issued as "Sports Car" (the trademark "Crasher" now belonging to Hasbro) in Bandai's [[Machine Robo]] range.

This version of Crasher is based off the ''Gobots'' character, despite being Cybertronian. She presumably has the same alternate mode.

===IDW Publishing===
In the second issue of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'', Crasher is one of the background Transformers cheering [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s victory over Cy-Kill. However, she is drawn with a face similar to the toy, with a large red visor taking up much of her face.

Though not part of the [[Transformers (film)|live-action ''Transformers'' film]], '''Fracture''' is featured as part of the toy line and associated comics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oafe.net/yo/tfm_frac.php&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to Megatron and the Decepticon cause, Fracture is a dangerous enemy. She is totally fearless, and probably a little bit crazy, as she dives directly into any battle, regardless of the odds.

Although she carries a powerful negative energy blaster, she prefers to use the seismic energy dischargers on her feet to smash the surrounding earth to pieces. Any battlefield on which she walks shudders with the force of her steps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News/Item&amp;newsid=950171CF-D56F-E112-41602F3A7E919719 Hasbro.com - Decepticon Fracture]&lt;/ref&gt; In the IDW comics, Fracture was given a new design to fit in more with the movie's animation style, rather than one resembling her toy.

Her appearance in the Titan Magazines series depicted her with her toys appearance, though with a different characterization. Notably being loyal to Stockade rather than Megatron, believing him to be the original reason the Great War began and thus [[Cybertron]]'s destruction.

===Titan Magazines===
Note: Stories from the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark are in ''italics''.

''Fracture appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called "Return to Cybertron: Part 1." She is part of the "New Decepticons" on Cybertron led by [[Stockade (Transformers)|Stockade]].''

===IDW Publishing===
Fracture is among the Decepticons who arrive on Earth under the direction of Soundwave in ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' #3. She arrives in [[Italy]] and assumed the form for a [[Formula One]] race car. In issue #4 Fracture is hunted down by [[Ironhide]] and human members of [[N.E.S.T.]], who chase her until Ironhide can run her off a cliff, killing her.

A mirror-universe version of Crasher appeared in the ''Transformers: Timelines'' fiction. She is one of the heroic Decepticons. Crasher can cause quakes with her fists. She is a white racing vehicle. Her cousin is the evil Autobot [[Blurr]].

===Fun Publications===
Crasher appears in the fiction ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]'', a text-based story from [[Fun Publications]]. She is part of the Mayhem Suppression Squad called in by Soundwave to defend the [[Arch-Ayr]] fuel dump from an Autobot attack. She later became part of the crew of the Nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Dungeons &amp; Dinobots|publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Evan Gauntt]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Do Over'' the Nemesis launches after the Ark. After a brief battle the Nemesis is shot down and crashes on Earth, with the crew escaping in stasis pods. Although not directly depicted, Crasher is a member of the crew of the Nemesis.

Crasher appears in ''Eye In the Sky'' where Cliffjumper recovers her pod and reactivates her. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to [[Burpleson Air Force Base]] to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.

The '''Fracture''' name is used once again, this time for a male character from ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' (the 2015 animated follow-up to the previous series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''). This version of Fracture is a [[bounty hunter]] who has a rivalry with the Autobot bounty hunter, [[Drift (Transformers)|Drift]]. He transforms into a purple motorcycle and is the only one that doesn't have an animal motif for his robot mode in the first season. He has two [[Mini-Con]] partners, [[Airazor]] and Divebomb, voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]] and [[Khary Payton]], respectively, who transform into missiles which launch from Fracture's shoulders. Like Drift, Fracture's Mini-Cons seemingly form part of his alternate mode as they are seen transforming with him.

===Animated series===
Fracture debuted in the episode 12, entitled "Hunting Season". He traveled to Earth to collect the bounty the Cybertron High Council put on Bumblebee, but when Drift steps in to defend Bumblebee and his ship is hijacked by the Autobots, Fracture stayed on Earth and joined [[Steeljaw]]'s gang. In his following appearances, he would join Steeljaw's pack in attempting to break out the Decepticons that the Autobots had already captured, only to fail repeatedly. In the first-season finale, Fracture attacks the Autobot base when only Fixit, Denny and Russel are there. The three prepare to fight Fracture and his Mini-Cons, only to find that a newly resurrected [[Optimus Prime]] has already defeated them. Despite not being an ''Alchemor'' prisoner, the defeated Fracture (and his Mini-Cons) was presumably placed in a stasis cell before Optimus when off to fight [[Fallen (Transformers)|Megatronus]].

===Video games===
Fracture appears as an unlockable character in the mobile game for ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''.

===Toys===
*'''''Robots in Disguise'' One-Step Changer Decepticon Fracture''' (2015)
:Part of the third wave of ''Robots in Disguise'' One-Step Changers, Fracture transforms from robot to chopper in one step. For some reason, his optics were painted blue instead of red.

*'''''Robots in Disguise'' Deployer Decepticon Fracture''' (2015)
:This Warrior-sized mold of Fracture transforms from a Cybertronian Chopper Bike to a robot. Low on articulation, Fracture is constructed around his "Deployer" gimmick, a large, built-in, spring-loaded launcher which hangs off his right-hand side and can launch any ''Robot in Disguise'' Mini-Con figure, including his packed-in partner, [[Airazor]]. In robot mode, pulling down on a lever on Fracture's back swings the launcher downward to fire the loaded Mini-Con; in vehicle mode, it becomes his bike's sidecar, and the Mini-Con is launched by pressing a button on top of it. The launcher is designed with a "safety" switch on its underside that prevents the button from being pressed unless the bike is placed on a surface. The included Airazor transforms into a torpedo, and comes with a sprue of extra weapons and armor. Most of these extra pieces attach to Airazor to make his alternate mode resemble a tiny spacecraft; he also comes with an teeny-weeny little pair of energy swords, which he can hold in his hands or store on his legs, and which can also mount on Fracture's forearms. Fracture features a Mini-Con mounting port on his left elbow, where Airazor or any other Mini-Con can attach.

As with all ''Robots in Disguise'' figures, all Fracture toys have a scannable insignia on the right side of his front wheel. Scanning this with the ''Robots in Disguise'' mobile game temporarily unlocks Fracture as a playable character, if the player has not already permanently unlocked him.

[[File:Depthx commons détouré.jpg|thumb|Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer]]
The '''Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer''' ('''DEPTHX''') is an [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] designed and built by [[Stone Aerospace]], an [[aerospace engineering]] firm based in [[Austin]], [[Texas]].  It was designed to [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] explore and map underwater [[sinkholes]] in northern Mexico, as well as collect water and wall core samples.  The DEPTHX vehicle was the first of three vehicles to be built by Stone Aerospace which were funded by [[NASA]] with the goal of developing technology that can explore the oceans of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] to look for [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2007-02/robot-subs-space "Robot Subs in Space"].  ''[[Popular Science]]''.  1 Feb 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/swimming-to-europa "Swimming to Europa"].  ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]''.

''[[Wired magazine]]''. 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DEPTHX was a collaborative project for which Stone Aerospace was the [[principal investigator]].  Co-investigators included [[Carnegie Mellon University]], which was responsible for the navigation and guidance software, the [[Southwest Research Institute]], which built the vehicle's science [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]], and research scientists from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[Colorado School of Mines]], and [[NASA]] [[Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/depthx/about.html About the DEPTHX Project].

In 1999, [[William Stone (caver)|Bill Stone]] had been involved in an underwater [[surveying]] project in [[Wakulla Springs]], [[Florida]].  For that project, Stone had devised a digital wall mapper that was propelled by a [[diver propulsion vehicle]] and steered by divers which was designed to create a 3-D map of Wakulla Springs using an array of sonars, as well as a suite of other sophisticated sensors.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://usdct.org/wakulla2-technology.php Wakulla 2 Technology]. U.S. Deep Caving Team. Retrieved 27 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project, the Wakulla Springs 2 Project, attracted the interest of [[Planetary science|planetary scientist]] [[Dan Durda]] from the Southwest Research Institute, who wished to create a similar piece of technology to explore the oceans of Europa, but one that could drive itself autonomously.  Stone accepted the challenge, and several collaborative proposals were submitted to NASA.  It wasn't until 2003 that NASA would finally fund DEPTHX as a three-year, $5 million project.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

The vehicle underwent several different design concepts over the next couple of years as engineers at Stone Aerospace explored various options. Initial designs focused on a less [[ellipsoidal]] design, however these designs were abandoned due to concerns that such a shape would be difficult to maneuver out of the potentially tight spots it might encounter during the exploration of unknown territory.  It was also during this time that the DEPTHX team did a field campaign at [[Cenote]] [[Zacatón]] using a drop [[CTD (instrument)|sonde]] to acquire some initial data for the software team, which itself contributed to the overall design changes.  The final design was decided upon in 2006, at which point construction of the vehicle began.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://archive.is/20130105124702/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/about-us/about-us-history.php Stone Aerospace History].

Stone Aerospace.  Retrieved 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed vehicle was about {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter and weighed about {{convert|3300|lb|kg}}.  It had redundant navigation systems including 54 sonars, an [[inertial measurement unit]], [[Doppler Velocity Log|doppler velocity logger]], as well as depth gauges and [[accelerometers]].  Propulsion systems were also redundant, having six thrusters and two equivalent battery stacks.  It was outfitted with a variable [[buoyancy]] system, and finally with the science payload that included the ability to take in water and solid core samples for later analysis, as well as an onboard microscope to analyze water samples in real time.&lt;ref name="popsci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="depthx"&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php DEPTHX (DEep Phreatic THermal eXplorer)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151122212722/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php |date=2015-11-22 }}.  Stone Aerospace.  Retrieved 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==

During the DEPTHX 2007 deployment, the vehicle was able to create 3-D maps of four cenotes in Sistema Zacatón in [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]].  This was the first autonomous system to explore and map a [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] cavern.  The mapping of Cenote Zacatón was particularly notable because its depth was previously unknown, as human divers had not been successful in attempts to reach the bottom.  DEPTHX created the first map of the bottom of Zacatón, which has a depth of over {{convert|1000|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/NA/Mexico/Tamaulipas/SistemaZacaton.htm Sistema Zacatón]. Wondermondo.  Retrieved 26 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  DEPTHX was the first robotic system of any kind to implement [[three-dimensional]] [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM).  It was also the first such system to make its own decisions on where and how to collect samples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php DEPTHX (DEep Phreatic THermal eXplorer)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151122212722/http://www.stoneaerospace.com/products-pages/products-DEPTHX.php |date=2015-11-22 }}. Stone Aerospace. Retrieved 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  From these samples, at least three new [[Phylum|divisions]] of bacteria were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02324.x/abstract A comparative molecular analysis of water-filled limestone sinkholes in north-eastern Mexico]. Wiley Online Library.  25 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the DEPTHX mission led to the funding of the follow-on project, [[ENDURANCE]].  The ENDURANCE vehicle reused the frame and a number of systems from the DEPTHX vehicle, but was considerably reconfigured for the needs of the [[Antarctic]] environment.&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

'''David Duncan''' (28 February 1789 – 27 August 1829) was a British minister in the [[Presbyterian]] [[United Secession Church]]. 
==Life==
Born in [[Forgandenny]], Perthshire, Scotland, fourth son of Lilias and Gilbert Duncan. He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], studied Latin, Greek, logic, mathematics, moral and natural philosophy. In 1817 he was admitted a student into the Divinity Hall, under the inspection of the [[General Synod|General Associate Synod]] of the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Presbyterian Secession Church]]: the Rev. George Paxton, of Edinburgh, was professor. In 1822, he took the ministerial care of the [[Associate Congregation|United Associate Congregation]] of Union Chapel in Sunderland, Durham until he died after suffering from an infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |plainurl= |id=DE4oAAAAYAAJ |page=377 |title=The Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parepa-Rosa, Euphrosyne, 1836-1874.jpg|upright|thumb|Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]]
'''Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa''' (7 May 1836 – 21 January 1874) was a British [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who established the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] together with her husband [[Carl Rosa]]. Parepa's [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|aristocratic father]] died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Parepasculpture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of Parepa-Rosa at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]]]
Euphrosyne Parepa was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to the [[soprano]] Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of [[Bass (voice type)|basso]] Arthur Edward Seguin) and the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyar]] Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Illustrated&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFDB173BEF34BC4B51DFB766838F669FDE|title=Obituary: Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=23 January 1874|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in [[Malta]] as Amina in ''[[La Sonnambula]]'', followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of Elvira in ''[[I Puritani]]'', with the [[Royal Italian Opera]] company, with whom she spent the 1857 season.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold and Elizabeth Forbes. [https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.20896 "Parepa(-Rosa), Euphrosyne (De Boyescu, Parepa)"], Grove Music Online, 20 January 2001, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the [[Royal Opera House]] was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 January 1874, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; The critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote of this introduction: "Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of "''Son vergine vezzosa''" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the ''finale''] she was again called for. … '''"Qui la voce"''' … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the ''artiste'' was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Italian Opera: First Appearance of Mdlle. Parepa", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 May 1857, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] and at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], becoming known for such roles as Leonora in ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' and Elvira in ''[[La muette de Portici]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in [[Alfred Mellon]]'s ''Victorine'' in 1859 and the role of Mabel in [[George Alexander Macfarren]]'s opera ''Helvellyn'' in 1864. She also was a successful [[oratorio]] and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She sang with [[Charles Santley]] at the opening of the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in 1861, appeared before the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'' and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Elkin. ''Royal Philharmonic'', Ryder: London (1946), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and later years==
Her first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist [[Carl Rosa]], the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the [[Fourteenth Street Theatre|French Theatre on Fourteenth Street]], New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s opera ''The Puritan's Daughter'', with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' and ''[[Maritana]]'' to Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' and ''Oberon''.&lt;ref name=Carl&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/uk-ushistory.asp|title=The Carl Rosa Opera Company: American and British History|publisher=Carl Rosa Company Ltd|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at [[Cairo]], Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt; In 1872, Parepa sang at the [[Lower Rhine Festival]] in [[Düsseldorf]], and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and the title role in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; In September 1873, the company changed its name to [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa's English Opera]], since Parepa was pregnant.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;

Parepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as part of her husband's planned season a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Highgate cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Legge, R. H., revised by J. Gilliland. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/21264 "Rosa, Euphrosyne Parepa (''née'' Euphrosyne Parepa de Boyesku or Boyescu)"], ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 23 September 2004, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in her memory.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

==Reputation==
William Winter wrote that "Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.  … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJSYCwf6VaQC&amp;pg=PA253  ''Brief Chronicles''], Ayer Publishing (1970) {{ISBN|0-8337-3826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her obituary in ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' stated: "Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual".&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;

Her achievements were recognised by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society of London]] (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|title=RPS Gold Medal Recipients Since 1870|publisher=Royal Philharmonic Society|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509113938/http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5718">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''firefly algorithm''' is a [[metaheuristic]] proposed by [[Xin-She Yang]] and inspired by the flashing behavior of [[firefly|fireflies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=X. S. |last=Yang |title=Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms |publisher=[[Luniver Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=1-905986-10-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphor ==
The primary purpose for a firefly's flash is to act as a signal system to attract other fireflies. Xin-She Yang formulated this firefly algorithm by assuming:

#All fireflies are unisexual, so that any individual firefly will be attracted to all other fireflies;
#Attractiveness is proportional to their brightness, and for any two fireflies, the less bright one will be attracted by (and thus move towards) the brighter one; however, the intensity (apparent brightness) decrease as their mutual distance increases;
#If there are no fireflies brighter than a given firefly, it will move randomly.

The brightness should be associated with the objective function.

== Algorithm ==
In pseudocode the algorithm can be stated as:

 '''Begin'''
    1) Objective function: {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}), \quad \mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,...,x_d) &lt;/math&gt;;}}
    2) Generate an initial population of fireflies {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_i \quad (i=1,2,\dots,n)&lt;/math&gt;;.}}
    3) Formulate light intensity {{mvar|I}} so that it is associated with {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;}}
       (for example, for maximization problems, {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;I \propto f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; or simply &lt;math&gt;I=f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;;)}}
    4) Define absorption coefficient {{mvar|&amp;gamma;}}
  
    '''While''' (t &lt; MaxGeneration)
       '''for''' i = 1 : n (all n fireflies)
          '''for''' j = 1 : i (n fireflies)
             {{nowrap|'''if''' (&lt;math&gt;I_j&gt;I_i &lt;/math&gt;),}}
                Vary attractiveness with distance r via {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \exp(-\gamma \; r) &lt;/math&gt;;}}
                move firefly i towards j;                
                Evaluate new solutions and update light intensity;
             '''end if''' 
          '''end for''' j
       '''end for''' i
       Rank fireflies and find the current best;
    '''end while'''
 
    Post-processing the results and visualization;
 
 '''end'''

Note that the number of objective function evaluations per loop is one evaluation per firefly, even though the above pseudocode suggests it is n*n. (Based on Yang's [[MATLAB]] code.) Thus the total number of objective function evaluations is (number of generations) * (number of fireflies).

The main update formula for any pair of two fireflies &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_j &lt;/math&gt; is
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i^{t+1}=\mathbf{x}_i^t + \beta \exp[-\gamma r_{ij}^2] (\mathbf{x}_j^t - \mathbf{x}_i^t) +\alpha_t \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_t &lt;/math&gt; is a parameter controlling the step size, while &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t &lt;/math&gt; is a vector drawn from a Gaussian or other
distribution.

It can be shown that the limiting case &lt;math&gt;\gamma \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the standard [[Particle Swarm Optimization]] (PSO). In fact, if the inner loop (for j) is removed and the brightness &lt;math&gt;I_j&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the current global best &lt;math&gt;g^*&lt;/math&gt;, then FA essentially becomes the standard PSO.

== Criticism ==

Nature-inspired [[Metaheuristic|metaheuristics]] in general have attracted [[List of metaphor-inspired metaheuristics#Criticism of the metaphor methodology|criticism in the research community]] for hiding their lack of novelty behind an elaborate metaphor.  The firefly algorithm has been criticized as differing from the well-established [[particle swarm optimization]] only in a negligible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Omid N.|last1=Almasi| first2=Modjtaba|last2= Rouhani|year=2016|title=A new fuzzy membership assignment and model selection approach based on dynamic class centers for fuzzy SVM family using the firefly algorithm|journal=Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer sciences|volume=4| pages=1-19|url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/elektrik/issues/elk-16-24-3/elk-24-3-77-1310-253.pdf|doi=10.3906/elk-1310-253|quote= Practical application of FA on UCI datasets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael A.|last=Lones|year=2014|title=Metaheuristics in Nature-Inspired Algorithms|journal=[[Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference|GECCO '14]]|url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ml355/common/papers/lones-gecco2014-metaheuristics.pdf|doi=10.1145/2598394.2609841|quote=FA, on the other hand, has little to distinguish it from PSO, with the inverse-square law having a similar effect to crowding and fitness sharing in EAs, and the use of multi-swarms in PSO.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dennis|last=Weyland|year=2015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221471601500010X|title=A critical analysis of the harmony search algorithm—How not to solve sudoku|journal=Operations Research Perspectives|volume=2|pages=97–105|doi=10.1016/j.orp.2015.04.001|quote=For example, the differences between the particle swarm optimization metaheuristic and "novel" metaheuristics like the firefly algorithm, the fruit fly optimization algorithm, the fish swarm optimization algorithm or the cat swarm optimization algorithm seem negligible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Force-feeding''' is the practice of feeding a human or other animal against their will. The term "'''gavage'''" ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɡ|ə|ˈ|v|ɑː|ʒ}}) refers to supplying a nutritional substance by means of a small plastic [[feeding tube]] passed through the nose ([[nasogastric tube|nasogastric]]) or mouth (orogastric) into the stomach. In hospitals, some psychiatric patients can be restrained so sedatives can be injected into them; this happens if patients have been non-compliant with their instructions.

== Of humans ==
Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] described how he was force-fed: "The feeding pipe was thick, thicker than my nostril, and would not go in. Blood came gushing out of my nose and tears down my cheeks, but they kept pushing until the cartilages cracked. I guess I would have screamed if I could, but I could not with the pipe in my throat. I could breathe neither in nor out at first; I wheezed like a drowning man &amp;mdash; my lungs felt ready to burst. The doctor also seemed ready to burst into tears, but she kept shoving the pipe farther and farther down. Only when it reached my stomach could I resume breathing, carefully. Then she poured some slop through a funnel into the pipe that would choke me if it came back up. They held me down for another half-hour so that the liquid was absorbed by my stomach and could not be vomited back, and then began to pull the pipe out bit by bit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daily Kos]]: [http://fenwaysteve.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/12/18/19365/937 "The WaPo prints a torture story."]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The unfortunate patients had their mouth clamped shut, had a rubber tube inserted into their mouth or nostril. They keep on pressing it down until it reaches your esophagus. A china funnel is attached to the other end of the tube and a cabbage-like mixture poured down the tube and through to the stomach. This was an unhealthy practice, as the food might have gone into their lungs and caused [[pneumonia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/ |title=Guidelines for Physicians Concerning Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Relation to Detention and Imprisonment |website=wma.net |publisher=[[World Medical Association]] |access-date=12 December 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In prisons ===
Some countries force-feed prisoners when they go on [[hunger strike]]. It has been prohibited since 1975 by the [[Declaration of Tokyo]] of the [[World Medical Association]], provided that the prisoner is "capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment". The violation of this prohibition may be carried out in a manner that can be categorised as [[torture]], as it may be extremely painful and result in severe bleeding and spreading of various diseases via the exchanged blood and mucus, especially when conducted with dirty equipment on a prison population.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4569626.stm "UN concern at Guantanamo feeding."]&lt;/ref&gt; Large feeding pipes are traditionally used on hunger striking prisoners&lt;ref  name=BostonGlobe2005-12-30/&gt; whereas thin pipes are preferred in hospitals.

[[Suffragettes]] who had been imprisoned while campaigning for [[votes for women]] went on hunger strike and were force fed. (This lasted until the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act]] of 1913, better known as the Cat and Mouse Act, whereby debilitated prisoners would be released, allowed to recover, and then re-arrested.) Rubber tubes were inserted through the mouth (only occasionally through the nose) and into the stomach, and food poured down; the suffragettes were held down by force while the instruments were inserted into their bodies, an experience which has been likened to [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Purvis, June; ''Emmeline Pankhurst'', London: Routledge, p 134, {{ISBN|0-415-23978-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a smuggled letter, [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] described how the warders held her down and forced her mouth open with a steel gag. Her gums bled, and she vomited most of the liquid up afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Pugh, Martin]]; ''The Pankhursts'', UK: Penguin Books, 2001, p 259, {{ISBN|0-14-029038-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmeline Pankhurst]], founder of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], was horrified by the screams of women being force-fed in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|HM&amp;nbsp;Prison Holloway]]. She wrote: "Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office. …I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during the days when those cries were ringing in my ears." When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst, in order to avoid being force-fed, raised a clay jug over her head and announced: "If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself."&lt;ref name=Pankhurst252&gt;{{cite book |last=Pankhurst |first=Emmeline |authorlink=Emmeline Pankhurst |title=My Own Story |year=1914 |location=London |publisher=Virago Limited (1979) |ISBN=0-86068-057-6 |pages=251 &amp; 252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, [[Frances Parker]], another suffragette, was being force-fed by the rectum in the Perth prison: "Thursday morning, 16th July ... the three wardresses appeared again.   One of them said that if I did not resist, she would send the others away and do what she had come to do as gently and as decently as possible.   I consented.   This was another attempt to feed me by the rectum, and was done in a cruel way, causing me great pain.   She returned some time later and said she had ‘something else’ to do.   I took it to be another attempt to feed me in the same way, but it proved to be a grosser and more indecent outrage, which could have been done for no other purpose than torture.   It was followed by soreness, which lasted for several days."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Djuna Barnes]], the American journalist, agreed to submit to force-feeding for a 1914 ''[[New York World]]'' magazine article. Barnes wrote, "If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits." She concluded, "I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex."&lt;ref&gt; Mills, Eleanor; with Kira Cochrane (eds.) (2005). Journalistas: 100 Years of the Best Writing and Reporting by Women Journalists. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1667-3}}. p 163–166.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United Kingdom also used forcible feeding techniques against [[Irish Republicans]] during their struggle for independence. In 1917 Irish prisoner [[Thomas Ashe]] died as a result of complications from such a feeding while incarcerated at [[Dublin]]'s [[Mountjoy Prison|Mountjoy Jail]]. The outrage of Ashe's  death from the Irish public was so great that force feeding has never been used in Ireland again since.&lt;ref name=CcrHungerStrikes2002-2005&gt;

==== United Nations War Crimes Tribunal====
On December 6, 2006, the [[United Nations War Crimes Tribunal]] at [[The Hague]] approved the use of force-feeding of [[Serbia]]n politician [[Vojislav Šešelj]]. They decided it was not "torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/yugo/article/0,,1966016,00.html | title=War crimes tribunal orders force-feeding of Serbian warlord | date=December 7, 2006 | publisher=The Guardian| accessdate = 2007-09-16 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Traynor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
In 2015, the [[Knesset]] passed a law allowing the force-feeding of prisoners in response to a hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee who had been held for months in [[administrative detention]].  Israel doctors refused to feed Mohammad Allan against his will, and he resumed eating after the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] temporarily released him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/08/22/433587857/hunger-strike-raises-debate-about-force-feeding-in-israeli-prisons| title=Hunger Strike Raises Debate About Force-Feeding In Israeli Prisons |date=22 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other forms====
Force-feeding of pernicious substances may be used as a form of [[torture]] and/or [[physical punishment]]. While in prison in northern Bosnia in 1996, some Serbian prisoners have described being forced to eat paper and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/serb-prisoners-forced-to-eat-soap-during-months-of-beatings-in-solita-ry-confinement-1344790.html?printService=print |title= Serb prisoners 'forced to eat soap' during months of beatings in solitary confinement |work= [[The Independent]] |location=London |date= 30 March 1996 |first= Lynne Reid |last= Banks |authorlink= Lynne Reid Banks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it has been alleged that prisoners are forced to eat foods forbidden by their religion. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' has reported that Muslim prisoners in [[Abu Ghraib prison]] under the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|U.S.-led coalition]] described in sworn statements having been forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, both of which are strictly [[haraam|forbidden in Islam]] (see [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html | work=The Washington Post | title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge | date=2004-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Of babies===
[[File:'Gavage' method of infant feeding used in France. Wellcome L0001803.jpg|thumb|'Gavage' method of infant feeding used in France, late 19th century]]
According to ''Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadler|first1=S H|title=Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy|date=1896|location=London|page=18|edition=2nd|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', a French system of feeding newborn or premature babies who could not suckle was known as ''gavage''. Sadler dates its origin to 1874 and quotes [[Étienne Stéphane Tarnier]], a pioneer perinatologist, describing the procedure. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadler|first1=S H|date=1896|edition=2nd|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For girls before marriage===
{{Main|Leblouh}}
Force-feeding used to be practiced in the [[North Africa]] and still is in [[Mauritania]]. Fatness was considered a marriage asset in women; culturally, [[voluptuous]] figures were perceived as indicators of wealth. In this tradition, some girls are forced by their mothers or grandmothers to overeat, often accompanied by [[physical punishment]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;pressing a finger between two pieces of wood) should the girl not eat. The intended result is a rapid onset of [[obesity]], and the practice may start at a young age and continue for years.  This is still the tradition in the rather undernourished [[Sahel]] country [[Mauritania]] (where it is called [[leblouh]]), where it induces major health risks in the female population; some younger men no longer insist on voluptuous brides, but traditional beauty norms remain part of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0711/p04s01-woaf.html "Women rethink a big size that is beautiful but brutal"] Clare Soares 11 July 2006.

===In slavery===
Slaves who tried to [[suicide|commit suicide]] by starving themselves were force fed with a contraption called the ''speculum orum''. This device forced the slave's mouth open in order to be fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html|title=Africans in America/Part 1/The Middle Passage|website=www.pbs.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Of domestic animals ==
[[File:Hyena-forcefeed.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ancient Egyptian]] force-feeding a [[hyena]]]]  
Force-feeding has been used to prepare animals for slaughter.  In some cases, such as is the case with geese raised for [[foie gras]], it is still practiced today.

=== In farming ===
{{Main|Foie gras}}
[[Image:Mulard duck being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for foie gras production.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Animal welfare]] groups object to force-feeding of birds. Here a [[Mulard duck]] is being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for [[foie gras]] production.]]
Force-feeding is also known as gavage, from a French word meaning "to gorge". This term specifically refers to force-feeding of [[Domestic duck|ducks]] or [[Domestic goose|geese]] in order to fatten their livers in the production of [[foie gras]].
In modern [[Egypt]], the practice of fattening geese and male [[Muscovy duck]]s by force-feeding{{dubious|date=May 2014|reason=Are you sure tubes are inserted in their mouths?! Over-feeding is different from force-feeding.}} them various grains is present, mostly by individuals, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption of those birds later. It is not widespread on commercial farms however. The term used for such a practice is called "Tazgheet" تزغيط from the verb "Zaghghat" زغَط.

Force-feeding of birds is practiced mostly on geese or male [[Mulard|Moulard ducks]], a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid.  Preparation for gavage usually begins 4–5 months before slaughter. For geese, after an initial free-range period and treatment to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed 2–4 times a day for 2–5 weeks, depending on the size of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird's throat to deposit the food into the bird's [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent [[Vomiting|gag]] reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as [[chickens]]. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons.

[[Shen Dzu]] is a similar practice of force-feeding pigs.

===In scientific research===
Gavage is used in some scientific studies such as those involving the rate of metabolism.  It is practiced upon various [[laboratory animal]]s, such as mice. Liquids such as medicines may be administered to the animals via a tube or syringe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/abs/nature05414.htmlAn obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of bodies==
On September 26, 2002, a man searching for acorns discovered their bodies in the mountain, an area that had been previously searched. He first reported the remains via an anonymous phone call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2002092899618|title=Police Continue Excavation, Find Loaded Shell Near the Site|date=27 September 2002|accessdate=15 July 2011|publisher=Dong-A Ilbo|author=Sung-Kyu Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the police stated that they thought the boys had died of [[hypothermia]]. However, the parents did not accept that conclusion and demanded a full investigation.&lt;ref name="bodiesfound" /&gt; The families questioned the conclusion that the boys had simply died after getting lost due to the oddities of the boys' clothes being found tied in knots and of their bodies being found a short distance from the village in an area the boys knew very well.&lt;ref name="Hwang Sun-yoon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1909669|title='Frog boys' baffle investigators|date=11 October 2002|accessdate=15 July 2011|publisher=JoongAng Daily|author=Hwang Sun-yoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic experts discovered that the boys had been murdered with repeated blows to the head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1911052|title='Frog boys' probably murdered|accessdate=15 July 2011|publisher=JoongAng Daily|date=13 November 2002|author=Hwang Sun-yoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that one had been shot in the head with a [[shotgun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2002/11/12/2002111261033.html|title='Frog Boys' Concluded as Murdered |date=12 November 2002|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=15 July 2011|author=Keum Won-seob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 2006, the [[statute of limitations]] expired on the case. This means authorities cannot prosecute anyone for the murders.&lt;ref name="statuteoflimitations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/03/24/2006032461036.html|title=Statute Runs Out for Unsolved 'Frog Boys' Murder|date=24 March 2006|accessdate=15 July 2011|publisher=Chosun Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910053015/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/03/24/2006032461036.html|archive-date=2012-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police said they will continue the investigation to get answers.&lt;ref name="statuteoflimitations" /&gt;

'''Ham''' (1957 – January 19, 1983), also known as '''Ham the Chimp''' and '''Ham the Astrochimp''', was a [[chimpanzee]] and the first [[Hominid|non-human hominid]] launched into [[outer space|space]], on January 31, 1961, as part of America's space program.&lt;ref name=csrvlmt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SYNfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sjAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4039%2C4654 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Chimp survives 420-mile ride into space |date=February 1, 1961 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chsent&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wVFYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cfcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3503%2C5627337 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Chimp sent out on flight over Atlantic |date=January 31, 1961 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ham's name is an acronym for the lab that prepared him for his historic mission—the '''H'''olloman '''A'''erospace '''M'''edical Center, located at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in [[New Mexico]], southwest of [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]].

He was purchased by the [[United States Air Force]] and brought to [[Holloman Air Force Base]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="NASA Brief History"/&gt;

There were originally 40 [[chimpanzee]] flight candidates at Holloman. After evaluation, the number of candidates was reduced to 18, then to 6, including Ham.&lt;ref name="Animals in Space" /&gt;{{Rp|245–246}} Officially, Ham was known as No. 65 before his flight,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanser|first1=Kathleen|title=Mercury Primate Capsule and Ham the Astrochimp|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/mercury-primate-capsule-and-ham-astrochimp|website=airandspace.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space Museum|accessdate=20 May 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/dhMiD|archivedate=20 May 2018|date=10 November 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only renamed "Ham" upon his successful return to Earth.

''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science'' (New York: Routledge, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his handlers, No. 65 had been known as "Chop Chop Chang".&lt;ref name=Patch&gt;{{cite web|title=Chop Chop Chang Commemorative Patch (HAM the Astrochimp)|url=http://www.retrorocketemblems.com/content/chop-chop-chang-commemorative-patch-ham-astrochimp|website=Retrorocket Emblems|accessdate=20 May 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/K59wO|archivedate=20 May 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Haraway/&gt;{{rp|page 138}}

Beginning in July 1959, the two-year-old chimpanzee was trained under the direction of neuroscientist [[Joseph V. Brady]] at [[Holloman Air Force Base]] Aero Medical Field Laboratory to do simple, timed tasks in response to electric lights and sounds.&lt;ref&gt;

During his pre-flight training, Ham was taught to push a lever within five seconds of seeing a flashing blue light; failure to do so resulted in an application of a mild [[electric shock]] to the soles of his feet, while a correct response earned him a banana pellet.&lt;ref name = "This New Ocean" /&gt;{{Rp|243}}

What differentiates Ham's mission from all the other primate flights to this point is that he was not merely a passenger, and the results from his test flight led directly to the mission [[Alan Shepard]] made on May 5, 1961 aboard ''[[Mercury-Redstone 3|Freedom 7]]''.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}

On January 31, 1961, Ham was secured in a [[Project Mercury]] mission labeled [[Mercury-Redstone 2|MR-2]] and launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral, Florida]], on a suborbital flight.&lt;ref name=csrvlmt/&gt;&lt;ref name = "This New Ocean"&gt;

After his death in 1983, Ham's body was turned over to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for necropsy. Following the necropsy, the plan was to have him stuffed and placed on display at the Smithsonian, following Soviet precedent with pioneering [[Soviet space dogs|space dogs]] [[Belka (dog)|Belka]] and Strelka. However, this plan was abandoned after a negative public reaction. Ham's remains, minus the skeleton, were buried at the [[International Space Hall of Fame]] in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

'''Harvey Samuel Firestone''' (December 20, 1868 – February 7, 1938) was an American businessman, and the founder of the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], one of the first global makers of automobile tires.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Family background==
Firestone was born on the [[Columbiana, Ohio]] farm built by his paternal grandfather.  He was the second of Benjamin and Catherine ([[née]] Flickinger) Firestone's three sons; Benjamin had a son and a daughter by his first wife. The original farm was disassembled and moved to [[Greenfield Village]], a {{convert|90|acre|m2|adj=on}} historical site founded by [[Henry Ford]], in 1983 as part of a larger outdoor museum.

Firestone's paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Hans Nicholas Feuerstein, immigrated from [[Berg, Bas-Rhin]], [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/f/r/a/Scott-O-Fraser/FILE/0022page.html Familytreemaker.genealogy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212063747/http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/f/r/a/Scott-O-Fraser/FILE/0022page.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1753, and settled in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p1670.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 1670" ''ancestry.com''] October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of Nicholas' sons – including Harvey's great-great-grandfather, Johan Nicholas – changed their surname to "Firestone", the English translation of the family's German name "Feuerstein".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p1687.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 1687" ''ancestry.com''] October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 1895, Firestone married [[Idabelle Smith Firestone|Idabelle Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p11749.htm "Shirer Family Genealogy Project, Person Page 11733" ''ancestry.com''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102191137/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mysong/p11749.htm |date=2012-11-02 }} October 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually had seven children. Notable great-grandchildren include: [[Andrew Firestone]], [[Nick Firestone]], and [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] (the son of Henry Ford's grandson and Harvey and Idabelle's granddaughter [[Martha Firestone Ford|Martha]]).

==Education and career==
After graduating from [[Columbiana High School]], Firestone worked for the [[Columbus Buggy Company]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] before starting his own company in 1890, making [[rubber]] tires for [[carriage]]s. In 1900 he soon saw the huge potential for marketing tires for automobiles and then founded the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], a pioneer in the mass production of tires. In 1926 he published a book, ''Men and Rubber: The Story of Business'', which was written in collaboration with [[Samuel Crowther (journalist)|Samuel Crowther]].&lt;ref&gt;''Men and Rubber: The Story of Business''. By Harvey Samuel Firestone, in collaboration with [[Samuel Crowther (journalist)|Samuel Crowther]]. London: William Heinemann &amp; Co., printed in U.S.A., 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1938, Firestone died of [[coronary thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Harvey Firestone is Dead in Florida.

==The Millionaires' Club==
Firestone, [[Henry Ford]], and [[Thomas Edison]] were generally considered the three leaders in American industry at the time, and often worked and vacationed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zumbrun |first=Francis Champ |title=Famous Travelers - Edison, Ford and Firestone |publisher=Maryland Department of Natural Resources |url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/feature_stories/FamousTravelersPart1.asp |accessdate=February 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203060801/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/feature_stories/FamousTravelersPart1.asp |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three were part of a very exclusive group titled "The Millionaires' Club."

==Legacy==
The main library of [[Princeton University]] is named [[Firestone Library]] in his honor. It is among the largest university libraries in the world. On August 3, 1950, the [[Harvey S Firestone Memorial]], a large sculpture ensemble dedicated to Firestone, created by sculptors [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]] and [[Donald De Lue]] was dedicated. It is located at Bridgestone Firestone Inc., 1200 Firestone Parkway in [[Akron, Ohio]]. In 1974, Firestone was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]]. [[Firestone High School]] in [[Akron, Ohio]], is named in his honor. There is a Harvey S Firestone Park in [[Columbiana, Ohio]]. The town [[Harbel]] in [[Liberia]], home to Firestone's rubber plantation, the largest in the world, is named after Firestone and his wife Isabelle.

"'''I Am Prepared to Die'''" is the name given&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/mandela.htm |title=The History Place – Great Speeches Collection: Nelson Mandela Speech – I am Prepared to Die |first= |last= |work=historyplace.com |year=2012 |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the three-hour speech given by [[Nelson Mandela]] on 20 April 1964 from the dock of the defendant at the [[Rivonia Trial]]. The speech is so titled because it ends with the words "it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die". The speech is considered one of the great speeches of the 20th century, and a key moment in the history of South African democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speeches that Changed the World|editor=Owen Collins|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0664221492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drawing the line: towards an aesthetics of transnational justice|first=Carrol|last=Clarkson|publisher=Fordham University Press|pages=84–86|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWsGAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780823254156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The trial==
{{Main|Rivonia Trial}}

In July 1963, ten [[African National Congress]] (ANC) leaders were arrested in [[Rivonia]], a suburb of Johannesburg. Along with Mandela, who had been arrested in August 1962 and was serving a five-year sentence, they were accused of counts of sabotage, furthering communism and aiding foreign powers. This included charges of recruiting persons to undertake guerrilla warfare against the South African state, conspiring to aid foreign military against the republic, and furthering acts of communism. The prosecutor [[Percy Yutar]] did not explicitly move for the death penalty, but it was generally believed that that was what the state wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rivonia's Children: Three Families and the Cost of Conscience in White South Africa|first=Glenn|last=Frankel|publisher=Jacana Media|year=2011|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; All defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.&lt;ref name=SAHistory2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/rivonia-trial-1963-1964|title=Rivonia Trial 1963–64|publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the trial Mandela and the other defendants decided that instead of testifying as witnesses and submitting to cross-examination he would make a speech from the dock to put the state on trial, by pointing out the injustices of the South African society and its legal system.  They also sought to show the political and moral programme of the ANC.&lt;ref name="Mandela 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Long Walk to Freedom]]|first=Nelson|last=Mandela|year=2008|isbn=978-0316548182|authorlink=Nelson Mandela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela worked on the speech for weeks before the trial, receiving help in editing and polishing it from author [[Nadine Gordimer]] and journalist [[Anthony Sampson]].&lt;ref name=Frankel&gt;{{cite news|title=The Speech at Rivonia Trial that Changed History|author=Glen Frankel|date=5 December 2013|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/when-mandelas-and-the-worlds-fate-changed-at-historic-rivonia-trial/2013/12/05/22033836-5e10-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing the speech, Mandela was inspired by [[Fidel Castro]]'s famous "[[History Will Absolve Me]]" defence speech. He was particularly interested in making the speech appeal to an international audience, inspiring international support for the ANC cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Mandela: The Authorized Biography]]|first=Anthony|last=Sampson|publisher=Random House LLC|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela's lawyers urged him to leave out the final statement, lest it provoke the judge into sentencing him to death, but Mandela refused. He felt that he was likely to be sentenced to death regardless of his statement, so that saying what he truly felt would be the best option.&lt;ref name="Mandela 2008"/&gt; Nonetheless, he did add the qualifier "if it needs be".&lt;ref name=LeRoux&gt;{{cite book|title=Precedent &amp; Possibility: The (ab)use of Law in South Africa|first=Dennis|last=Davis|first2=Michelle |last2=Le Roux|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|isbn=9781770130227| year=2009|pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the defence announced that Mandela would begin by giving a speech instead of facing a more traditional cross-examination the prosecutor Percy Yutar made a surprised objection: "My Lord, My Lord, I think you should warn the accused that what he said from the dock has far less weight than if he submitted himself to cross-examination."&lt;ref name=LeRoux/&gt; Judge de Wet over-ruled the objection saying, "I think Mr. Yutar, that counsel for the defence have sufficient experience to be able to advise their clients without your assistance." And [[Bram Fischer]] the main defence lawyer added "Neither we, nor our clients are unaware of the provisions of the Criminal Code", in this way subtly pointing out the fact that Mandela was himself a lawyer with experience in criminal trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The State Vs. Nelson Mandela: The Trial That Changed South Africa|first=Joel|last=Joffe|publisher=Oneworld|year=2007|pages=154–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since in South African law a defendant may not address the court from the witness stand, but only answer questions, Mandela gave the speech from the defendant's dock. He spoke for some three hours, before concluding with the often quoted passage "I am prepared to die".

While delivering the last line of the speech Mandela looked the judge, [[Quartus de Wet]] directly in the eye, the last eye contact between the two during the trial.&lt;ref name=SAHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/rivonia-trial-fifty-years-later |title=The Rivonia Trial Fifty Years later &amp;#124; South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The speech==
The speech describes why the ANC had decided to go beyond its previous use of constitutional methods and Gandhian non-violent resistance, and adopt sabotage against property (designed to minimise risks of injury and death) as a part of their activism against the South African government and its [[Apartheid]] policies (while also training a military wing for possible future use).

Mandela began by stating that he had been among the founders of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the armed wing of the ANC, and that he did not deny his involvement in planning sabotage, saying "I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love for violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and oppression of my people by the whites."&lt;ref name=Broun/&gt;

Mandela argued that all non-violent means had been tried and that they had only resulted in mounting restrictions and reduced freedom for the African people.  Referring to the [[Sharpeville massacre|Sharpeville shootings]] and a number of other instances of government violence against protesters, he stated that "the government which uses force to support its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it", and that the decision to adopt selective use of violent means was "not because we desire such a course. Solely because the government left us no other choice."&lt;ref name=LeRoux/&gt;

Mandela also devoted significant effort to refuting the prosecution's charges that he and the ANC had acted under the domination of the [[Communist Party of South Africa]] and foreign interests. He likened the alliance between the communists and the ANC to the alliance of the US, Britain and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany. He discussed in some detail the relationship between the ANC and the Communist Party, explaining that, while the two shared a commitment to action against the apartheid system, he was wedded to a model of [[constitutional democracy]] for South Africa (he singled out the British political model for particular praise), and also supported a market economy rather than a communist economic model. He noted that, while there were political differences between the Communists and the ANC, "theoretical differences among those fighting against oppression is (sic) a luxury that we cannot afford at this stage". He added that the communists had been the only political group in South Africa who had shown themselves willing to treat Africans as human beings.&lt;ref name=Broun/&gt;

===Impact===
Mandela's friends [[Anthony Sampson]] and [[Nadine Gordimer]], who had both participated in reviewing the speech as written by Mandela,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NPW|url=http://www.digitalnpq.org/articles/global/705/04-18-2014/nadine_gordimer|publisher=New Perspectives Quartely}}&lt;/ref&gt; had contrasting reactions to its delivery. Sampson described it as the most effective speech of his career, whereas Gordimer thought the delivery to be "hesitant, parsonical" until "only at the end did the man come through and when he had spoken that last sentence the strangest and most moving sound I have ever heard from human throats, came from the 'black' side of the court audience" .&lt;ref name=LeRoux/&gt;

At the end of the trial Mandela was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 27 years of the sentence before he was released and elected [[President of South Africa]]. Upon his release he quoted the last sentence of his speech to the awaiting press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin Book of Twentieth-century Speeches|first=Brian |last=MacArthur|publisher=Viking|year=1994|page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela believed that the reason Judge de Wet had not sentenced him to death was because, by his speech, Mandela had "dared him to do so".&lt;ref name=Broun&gt;{{cite book|last=Broun|first=K.

The '''international reaction to the [[assassination of Benazir Bhutto|assassination of]]''' '''[[Benazir Bhutto]]''' consisted of universal condemnation across the [[international community]],&lt;ref name=BBCReaction/&gt; including Pakistan's regional neighbors [[Afghanistan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Iran]]. Indian [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] praised Bhutto's efforts for the improvement of [[India-Pakistan relations]]. The [[UN Security Council]] held an emergency meeting and unanimously condemned the assassination, a call echoed by [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]. Both [[European Union]] [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]] and U.S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] also expressed the hope that Pakistan will continue on the path of democracy.

*[[Human Rights Watch]] – A statement was calling the assassination a "tragic event with serious implications for Pakistan's transition to democracy" and stating that "political violence of this nature has claimed far too many innocent lives in Pakistan and it must stop. Benazir Bhutto was a democrat who believed in the supremacy of constitutional rule and throughout her career, sought power through the ballot box. Today, she died campaigning for votes and calling for a free election."

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTE: The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events. PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION SERIES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. See "Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. --&gt;

A baker ([[James Corden]]) and his wife ([[Emily Blunt]]) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the baker's family by a [[Witchcraft|Witch]] ([[Meryl Streep]]) who found the baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the baker's father also stole some magic beans, the witch's own mother cursed her to be ugly. The witch is able to lift the curse and allow them to have a child, but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her to make a potion: a white cow, a red cape, a yellow strand of hair, and a golden slipper, none of which she is allowed to touch.

The witch's demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack ([[Daniel Huttlestone]]), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood ([[Lilla Crawford]]), whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy bread and sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel ([[MacKenzie Mauzy]]), whose tower the baker's wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella ([[Anna Kendrick]]), who also runs into the baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince ([[Chris Pine]]) and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.

After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a "[[happy ending]]": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderella's prince's brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the [[Giant]] in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the [[Big Bad Wolf]] ([[Johnny Depp]]); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.

However, each of the characters learns that their endings don't remain happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the baker's wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her magic powers. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giant's wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find Jack, but debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother, and the baker's wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all the remaining beans away, the witch begs her mother to punish her again, hoping to regain her powers, but instead she disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.

The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giant's wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giant's wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giant's wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.

Meanwhile, many of the songs in the film have slightly different lyrics than their stage counterparts due to the slight tweaking of story lines.

Other changes include a major reduction of the significant role of the "mysterious man", who manipulates much of the action in the first act and is eventually revealed to be the baker's father. Also, the character of the narrator is deleted, and the film is instead narrated by the baker.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whyte|first1=Marama|title=Five 'Into the Woods' stage-to-screen changes|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/12/24/into-the-woods-stage-to-screen-changes/|accessdate=January 2, 2015|work=Hypable.com|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor role of Cinderella's father was cut, and he is instead mentioned as deceased.  Due to the film's compressed story line, Rapunzel's pregnancy is eliminated, as is the subplot where the two princes have affairs with [[Snow White]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]].&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt; In the film, the giant's wife attacks during the marriages of Cinderella and Rapunzel to their respective princes, no more than a few weeks after the events of act one; in the stage show, nearly a year passes between the first and second acts. Rapunzel's ultimate fate is also changed: rather than being killed by the giant, she refuses to cooperate with the witch and flees with her prince.&lt;ref name="Whyte" /&gt;

Similarly, much of the violence and sexual content is slightly toned down from the original musical. For instance, the death of Jack's mother is less violent in the film. On stage, the steward clubs her to death with his staff; in the film, he simply shoves her to the ground and she hits her head on a log. The death of the baker's wife is not explicitly shown in the film, and the cause of her death is changed from being crushed by a tree in the giant's wife's wake to accidentally backing off the edge of a cliff while fleeing from the wife of the giant.

==Production==

===Early development===
Early attempts of adapting ''Into the Woods'' to film occurred in the early 1990s, with a script written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]]. A reading was held with a cast that included [[Robin Williams]] as the Baker, [[Goldie Hawn]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Cher]] as the Witch, [[Danny DeVito]] as the Giant, [[Steve Martin]] as the Wolf, and [[Roseanne Barr]] as Jack's Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=BWW EXCLUSIVE: Stephen Sondheim Talks Past, Present &amp; Future|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-EXCLUSIVE-Stephen-Sondheim-Talks-Past-Present-Future-20101103-page2|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Jim Henson Productions]] were also developing a film adaptation with [[Craig Zadan]] as producer and [[Rob Minkoff]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=Jim Henson's Children Put Together a String of Big Deals to Keep Alive : The Muppet Legacy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-26/business/fi-5359_1_jim-henson/3|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 26, 1992|pages=3 of 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movie To Mix Live Actors, Jim Henson Characters|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-09-30/features/9102080788_1_brian-henson-film-project-jim-henson-productions|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Columbia put the film into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], with Minkoff still attached as director, and [[Billy Crystal]], [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Susan Sarandon]] reportedly in talks to star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title='Bliss' sticks in ratings mire; Col chops 'Woods'|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/bliss-sticks-in-ratings-mire-col-chops-woods-1117433140/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=January 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the report by [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], a film adaptation of ''Into the Woods'' remained inactive for 15 years.

===Development at Disney===
After the critical and commercial success of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' in 2002, director [[Rob Marshall]] approached [[Stephen Sondheim]] as he was interested in adapting one of his musicals such as ''[[Follies]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', although Sondheim suggested ''Into the Woods'' instead.&lt;ref name="THRProd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title=Perverted Wolves, Cheating Wives and a Fired 10-Year-Old: The Dark Path to Disney's 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/perverted-wolves-cheating-wives-a-755359|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall concurred, but development of the project was then postponed while he focused on directing ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' and ''[[Nine (2009 live-action film)|Nine]]''. In 2011, Marshall's interest in the project was rekindled when he heard a speech by President [[Barack Obama]] on the tenth anniversary of the [[September 11th attacks]] to the families of the 9/11 victims, which seemed to evoke the same message as the musical's most important song, "No One Is Alone".&lt;ref name="Feinberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feinberg|first1=Scott|title=Rob Marshall on Movie Musicals and His Journey 'Into the Woods' (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/rob-marshall-movie-musicals-his-760996|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall firmly believed that ''Into the Woods'' was “a fairy tale for the post-9/11 generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Tim|title=Disney's 'Into the Woods' Enters Awards Season on High Note|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/disney-enters-awards-race-with-into-the-woods-1201362874/|accessdate=December 13, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, Marshall approached [[Walt Disney Pictures]]—for whom he had just directed ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides]]''—and pitched the idea to the studio,&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; with Lapine writing the script and Sondheim "expected" to write new songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Sets Rob Marshall To Direct Adaptation Of 'Into The Woods'|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/disney-sets-rob-marshall-to-direct-adapation-of-into-the-woods/|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Dion Beebe]], who previously collaborated with Marshall on ''Chicago'', ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', and ''Nine'', served as cinematographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|title=Honors and Hires: Oscar Winning DP Dion Beebe Goes 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/honors-hires-oscar-winning-dp-564344|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim confirmed that a new song had been written for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Matt|title=Stephen Sondheim: An audience with a theatre legend|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/stephen-sondheim-an-audience-with-a-theatre-legend-8559902.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Disney's backing, a three-day reading of the entire updated screenplay took place in New York in October 2012 under Marshall's direction, with [[Nina Arianda]] as the Baker's Wife, [[Victoria Clark]] as Cinderella's Mother/Granny/Giant, [[James Corden]] as the Baker, [[Donna Murphy]] as the Witch, [[Christine Baranski]] as Cinderella's Stepmother, [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Florinda, Ivan Hernandez as the Wolf, [[Megan Hilty]] as Lucinda, [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Rapunzel's Prince, [[Allison Janney]] as Jack's Mother, [[Anna Kendrick]] as Cinderella, [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]] as Steward/Mysterious Man, [[Laura Osnes]] as Rapunzel, [[Taylor Trensch]] as Jack, Casey Whyland as Little Red Riding Hood, and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Cinderella's Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|title=Nina Arianda, Victoria Clark, Patrick Wilson, Cheyenne Jackson, James Corden Part of Into the Woods Film Reading|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Playbill|date=October 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103054115/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/170672-Nina-Arianda-Victoria-Clark-Patrick-Wilson-Cheyenne-Jackson-James-Corden-Part-of-Into-the-Woods-Film-Reading|archive-date=November 3, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this reading which ultimately convinced [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] president [[Sean Bailey]] to [[green-light]] the film despite ongoing concerns about the dark nature of the original musical (which Disney executives had begun to understand since Marshall's original pitch).&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;  However, Disney (which self-finances all its films)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Block|first1=Alex Ben|title=Disney CFO Outlines Strategy, Explains Forgoing Third Party Financing|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-cfo-outlines-strategy-explains-761468|accessdate=January 9, 2015|issue=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided only a relatively small production budget of $50 million (relative to other feature-length fantasy films on its development slate), in turn forcing both cast and crew to accept pay cuts to work on the film.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;

Reports subsequently surfaced in January 2013 that [[Meryl Streep]] had been cast to play the Witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boughton|first=Kathryn|title=Roxbury Composer's Future: New Town, Working with Meryl Streep as a Witch|url=http://www.countytimes.com/articles/2013/01/31/entertainment/doc510959d3e6ffa160222903.txt|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Litchfield County Times|date=January 31, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215182723/http://www.countytimes.com/articles/2013/01/31/entertainment/doc510959d3e6ffa160222903.txt|archive-date=February 15, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep Will Head Into The Woods With Rob Marshall|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Meryl-Streep-Head-Woods-With-Rob-Marshall-35460.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|last=Puchko|first=Kristy|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streep had instituted a personal "no witch" rule after she turned 40 and was offered three witch roles, but ultimately broke her own rule to do a Sondheim role again.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; (As a young [[Yale University]] student, she had participated in the original production of Sondheim's ''[[The Frogs (musical)|The Frogs]]''.)

In April 2013, [[Johnny Depp]] was in final negotiations, along with Streep, to join the film.&lt;ref name="StreepCast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeppCast" /&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that to help make the film on such a tight budget, Depp agreed as a favor to Disney and to Marshall (whom he had just worked with in ''On Stranger Tides'') to a "boarding" arrangement, in which he would appear in a minor role for a fee of $1 million, instead of his typical fee of $20 million for a starring role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|title=How Johnny Depp Made $1 Million in a Week|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-johnny-depp-made-1-676799|accessdate=January 11, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May, James Corden, who took part in the reading of the screenplay, was in talks to play the role of the Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|title=One Man, Two Guvnors Star James Corden in Talks for Into the Woods Film Adaptation|url=http://playbill.com/news/article/177569-One-Man-Two-Guvnors-Star-James-Corden-in-Talks-for-Into-the-Woods-Film-Adaptation|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Playbill|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2013, Disney confirmed the casting of Streep, Depp, and Corden as the Witch, the Big Bad Wolf, and the Baker, respectively.&lt;ref name="CordenCast" /&gt; That same month, [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Christine Baranski]] were cast, respectively, as the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Stepmother.&lt;ref name="BaranskiCast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BluntCast"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Emily Blunt Circling Disney's 'Into the Woods'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emily-blunt-circling-disneys-woods-524132|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=Emily Blunt to Sing Better in Into the Woods Than She Did in That Karaoke Video|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/emily-blunt-cant-live-down-that-karaoke-video.html|accessdate=September 5, 2013|newspaper=Vulture|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall later confirmed that Blunt was selected for her "warm[th]" and likeability to ensure the emotional impact of the sudden death of the Baker's Wife: "[T]hat's very important for that character because it's the heart of the piece and you really have to love her so when she's gone it should feel like a kick in the gut."&lt;ref name="Feinberg" /&gt; After she was cast, Blunt discovered she was pregnant and her costume and choreography had to be adjusted accordingly.&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gioia"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gioia|first1=Michael|title=Emily Blunt On Hiding Her Real-Life Baby Bump, Vocal Nerves and the Much-Talked-About "Moment" in the "Woods"|url=http://playbill.com/news/article/emily-blunt-on-hiding-her-real-life-baby-bump-vocal-nerves-and-the-much-talked-about-moment-in-the-woods-336500|accessdate=January 11, 2015|work=Playbill.com|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her "overweight" appearance during production actually fit in with the role of the Baker's Wife;&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; as she explained, "I feel like she would have eaten a lot of carbs working in the bakery."&lt;ref name="Gioia" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Keep and entrance of Dover Castle, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Dover Castle]] in [[Kent]] was used as the exterior for the Prince's castle.]]
In July 2013, before filming began, Marshall put the cast through six weeks&lt;ref name="THRProd" /&gt; of rehearsals on a soundstage and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] their scenes.&lt;ref name="Twisted"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title=Rob Marshall Boldly Explores Disney's Take on Twisted Tale 'Into the Woods'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/features/into-the-woods-rob-marshall-disney-1201346785/|accessdate=January 7, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the cast members visited [[Angel Recording Studios]] to separately record their respective parts in the presence of Sondheim himself.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Over 90% of the vocal tracks in the final version of the film are from the recording studio sessions, while the rest were recorded on location or on the set.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt;  The advantage of blocking and rehearsing all scenes first was that the cast members could then precisely calibrate their voices in the recording studio to the planned appearance of each scene when later filmed, thereby minimizing the slightly disconcerting disconnection between vocals and choreography typical of [[music video]]s.&lt;ref name="Marchant"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marchant|first1=Beth|title=Editor Wyatt Smith Goes Into the Woods to Cut Sound, Picture and Song|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2015/01/editor-wyatt-smith-goes-woods-cutting-sound-picture-song/|accessdate=January 9, 2015|work=StudioDaily|publisher=Access Intelligence|date=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers spent a whole day shooting scenes which involved Rapunzel's hair being climbed upon.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; Mauzy claimed that the filmmakers wanted to take advantage of her blonde hair, and that the top of Rapunzel's hair appeared in the film was her own real hair; make-up artists only braided it into the extension.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; This hair extension was engineered by hair designer Peter King.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Lexi|title=The Story of Rapunzel's Hair From Into the Woods|url=http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2014/12/into-the-woods-rapunzel-hair.html|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]|publisher=Condé Nast|date=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After testing loose, flowing hair which King found "uncontrollable", he decided to have twenty-seven wefts of real hair woven together into a 30-foot braid, a design which took inspiration from an Arthur Rackham illustration of Rapunzel.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; In order to bring in enough real Russian hair strands needed for the extension, King and his team had to work with several distributors from Germany and England.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; The hair-braiding process required three people, each holding a separate strand and weaving in and out.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; King also dyed the wefts for them to match Mauzy's champagne blonde hair color, and blended together six different shades from ash and strawberry
to create realistic gradations and highlights.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; Between scenes, Mauzy had to "wrap [the hair] around her arm like huge rolls of wool", as recalled by King.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt; A stuntman was employed to shoot hair-climbing scenes.&lt;ref name="mauzycast" /&gt; Thin rope and metal rings were the only additional tools concealed within the braid to hold the weight of a person climbing up.&lt;ref name="rapunzelhair" /&gt;

The film's final shot, which essentially merges into and links back to its first shot, actually transitions digitally between three shots: a [[Technocrane]] on location lifting as high as possible into the sky, an [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|aerial drone]] flying down a valley in [[Wales]], and a shot of an overcast sky in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Failes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Into the Woods: full of effects surprises|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/into-the-woods-full-of-effects-surprises/|accessdate=January 3, 2015|work=FXGuide|publisher=FXGuide.com, LLC|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming concluded on November 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cerasaro|first=Pat|title=Filming Wraps On INTO THE WOODS Movie!

===Music===
{{main|Into the Woods (soundtrack)}}
As noted above, the majority of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast.&lt;ref name="Twisted" /&gt; Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on ''Sweeney Todd'': ''The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'', recorded the film's score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; Music supervisor and conductor [[Paul Gemignani]] instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrated Sondheim's original music.&lt;ref name="officialpr" /&gt; The [[Key (music)|key]] to the song, "Hello, Little Girl," was altered to better suit [[Johnny Depp]]'s lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained, "we emphasized the woodwinds to make it feel a little lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it a little jazzier —&lt;!--mdash with spaces is as quoted--&gt; played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has a jazz feel, it just feels lighter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Ashley|title='Into the Woods': How Disney Tiptoed Around Johnny Depp's Creepy, Sexualized Song|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woods-johnny-depp-sings-hello-760348|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on December 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Records Set To Release Into The Woods Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Into The Woods Deluxe Edition On December 16th|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-set-to-release-into-the-woods-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-and-into-the-woods-deluxe-edition-on-december-16th-282182481.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=December 13, 2014|location=Burbank, California|format=Press release|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was initially reported that the film version would feature two new songs: a duet for the Baker and his Wife, titled "Rainbows"—originally written for a 1992 film adaptation that was never made—and a new song for the Witch, eventually titled "She'll Be Back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Zack|title=Disney's Into the Woods Features Major Plot Changes, Stephen Sondheim Reveals—Spoilers Ahead!|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/552578/disney-s-into-the-woods-features-major-plot-changes-stephen-sondheim-reveals-spoilers-ahead|accessdate=June 19, 2014|newspaper=E!

===Critical response===
The review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 71% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus reads: "On the whole, this Disney adaptation of the Sondheim classic sits comfortably at the corner of [[Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]—even if it darkens to its detriment in the final act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/into_the_woods_2014/|title=Into the Woods|date=December 25, 2014|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], calculate a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/into-the-woods | title=Into the Woods Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CinemaScore]] polls conducted during the opening weekend, audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3987&amp;p=.htm | title = Weekend Report (cont.): Huge Limited Debuts for 'American Sniper,' 'Selma' | author = Ray Subers | publisher = Box Office Mojo | date = December 28, 2014 | accessdate = December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streep was immensely applauded for her performance as the Witch, with many critics and audiences believing she was the film's heart. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called her and Blunt's portrayals as "two of the greatest female performances of the year".  For her performance, Streep received [[Academy Award]], [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award]] nominations for Best Supporting Actress.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film "benefits from respect for the source material, enticing production values and a populous gallery of sharp character portraits from a delightful cast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title='Into the Woods': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/woods/review/758611|accessdate=December 17, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lauded the film, writing; "''Into the Woods'', the splendid Disney screen adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical, infuses new vitality into the tired marketing concept of entertainment for 'children of all ages'".&lt;ref name=NYTReview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=The Quest for Storybook Endings in a Scary but Magical World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/25/movies/into-the-woods-disneys-take-on-the-sondheim-lapine-classic.html|accessdate=December 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] called the movie as "one of the year's best films". Similarly, Pete Hammond of Deadline praised the film as "the most dazzling movie musical since Marshall's own Chicago." and praised the performance of the cast, particularly Streep. Lou Lumerick of the New York Post called the film "this century's best musical" and lauded the performances of Streep and Blunt as the best female performances of the year. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' gave a positive review declaring the film "Rob Marshall's best movie ever" and praised it for its genuine entertainment and strong cast performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/12/19/review-disneys-into-the-woods-hits-a-sour-note/ | title = Review: Disney's 'Into The Woods' Hits A Sour Note | author = Scott Mendelson | publisher = ''Forbes'' | date = December 19, 2014 | accessdate = December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] gave a positive review, stating that the film was a "smart, appealing, upside-down children's story for adults of all ages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=REVIEW: Into the Woods: A Disney Musical for Adults of All Ages|url=http://time.com/3647510/review-into-the-woods-a-disney-musical-for-adults-of-all-ages/|accessdate=December 27, 2014|work=Time|date=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Ellwood of [[HitFix]] tipped Streep as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] contender in the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] category, and also praised the performance of Chris Pine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/can-meryl-streep-actually-win-a-fourth-oscar-for-into-the-woods| title = Can Meryl Streep Actually Win A Fourth Oscar For Into The Woods?| author = Gregory Ellwood| date = November 23, 2014| accessdate = December 16, 2014| publisher = Hitfix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three found much to like in the acting (especially Blunt and Pine's performances), but all three also concluded that after the various cuts and changes, the final version of the film had failed to adequately preserve the power of the dark [[Existentialism|existentialist]] message at the heart of the original musical's second act.&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Souza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; Stevens characterized the result as a "generic [[dystopia]]n bummer,"&lt;ref name="Stevens" /&gt; while Lawson criticized the film as a "dutiful but perfunctory adaptation" which lacked "genuine heart".&lt;ref name="Lawson" /&gt; Paul Katz of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' felt the change in tone between the last two acts was too abrupt, and also criticized the film's faithfulness to the stage musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Paul|title=Into the Woods (Review)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-katz/into-the-woods-review_1_b_6381348.html|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' disliked the performances by Streep and Depp, while simultaneously calling the film's first two acts a "surprising delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=How Disney wrecked "Into The Woods"|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/12/26/how-disney-wrecked-into-the-woods/|accessdate=March 19, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Laver, [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[FRSA]]''' (14 March 1899 – 3 June 1975) was an English author, critic, [[art historian]], and [[museum curator]] who acted as Keeper of Prints, Drawings and Paintings for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] between 1938 and 1959. He was also an important and pioneering fashion historian described as "the man in England who made the study of costume respectable".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs-Smith, Charles, Obituary in ''Costume (Journal of the Costume Society)'' no 10 (1976){{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Laver was born in [[Liverpool]], England, on 14 March 1899, the second child and only son of Arthur James Laver, a [[ocean|maritime]] printer and [[stationer]], and his wife, Florence Mary (née Barker), strict [[Congregationalists]] who brought up their children in a [[puritanical]] manner.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=moore&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31337 Profile of James Laver by Doris Langley Moore, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007]; accessed 10 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Liverpool Institute]]. His academic progress was put on hold by the [[First World War]], in which he served as a [[second lieutenant]].

In 1919 he resumed his residency at [[New College, Oxford]], where he earned a [[BA (Hons)|BA]] degree second class in modern history 1921. The next year, he earned a [[B.Litt]] in theology for a thesis on [[John Wesley]]. His college fees and travel expenses were subsidised by a wealthy shipping magnate, [[Lawrence Holt]].{{Why?|date=September 2013}}&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; At Oxford, he contributed to the student magazine ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and won the 1921 [[Newdigate Prize]] for his poem on ''[[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]''.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Laver at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum==
In 1922, Laver entered the Department of [[Engraving]], [[Illustration]], Design and Painting at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. He arrived shortly before the ''International Theatre Exhibition'' was transferred to the V&amp;A from [[Amsterdam]] and was shown as part of his department. It showcased work by all the leading European designers of the time, and the Museum purchased several designs and models, which became the basis of the Museum's Theatre Collection. Laver was put in charge of this collection. Stage design became one of his passions, possibly in reaction against his upbringing.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1938 he succeeded Martin Hardie as Keeper of the department, a post he held until his retirement in 1958. Despite his significant contributions to object-centred dress history, he was never Keeper of Textiles for the Museum, or part of the Textiles section.&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;Taylor, Lou, ''Establishing Dress History'', (Manchester, 2004) {{ISBN|0-7190-6639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laver and fashion==
Laver is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the field of [[History of fashion design|fashion history]], an interest in which emerged through a desire to date images accurately through the clothing depicted within.&lt;ref name=cumming/&gt; Laver defined the relationships between dress design and other [[applied arts]], and discussed the influence of economic and social factors upon the development of fashionable taste.&lt;ref name=times/&gt; In 1962, Laver received a [[Neiman Marcus Fashion Award]] in recognition of his work in the field of fashion history. In 1937 Laver, with [[Pearl Binder]], co-presented the first television programme to be dedicated to fashion history.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt; ''[[Clothes-Line]]'', a six-part series, was so successful that in 1938, Laver and Binder reunited to present a revised re-tread (in three parts) of the programme, this time called ''[[Clothes-Line|Clothes Through The Centuries]]''.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;

Laver followed the theories of [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Flügel]], using them to develop his favourite theories. These were:
* '''Hierarchical Principle''' =  dressing to indicate one's position in society
* '''Utility Principle''' = dressing for warmth and comfort
* '''Seduction Principle''' = dressing to attract the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=cumming&gt;Cumming, Valerie, ''Understanding Fashion History'' (London, 2004); {{ISBN|0-7134-8875-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, feminist fashion historians such as [[Elizabeth Wilson (historian)|Elizabeth Wilson]] and [[Amanda Vickery]] found these problematic, arguing that Laver and [[C. Willett Cunnington]]'s views trivialised women's behaviour, role within the family, and their contributions to society and culture.&lt;ref name=taylor/&gt;

===Laver's Law===
'''Laver's Law''' was an attempt to compress the complex cycle of fashion change and the general attitude towards any certain style or period into a simple timeline. It first appeared in ''Taste and Fashion'' (1937):&lt;ref name=taf&gt;Laver, James, ''Taste and Fashion'', chapter 18, (London, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-curatorial career==
To supplement his pay whilst at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Laver dedicated his free time to writing [[Article (publishing)|magazine articles]], book reviews, play translations, dramatic criticism and [[light verse]]. One of the plays he translated was [[Klabund]]'s ''The Circle of Chalk'' from the original German.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

His 1927 poem, ''A Stitch in Time'', a [[pastiche]] of [[Alexander Pope]]'s [[The Rape of the Lock]] set in modern times, successfully captured public attention, and led to Laver's popularity as a fashionable party guest.&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; A sequel in 1929 followed, ''Love's Progress'', the two poems being published together as ''Ladies' Mistakes'' in 1933.&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/periods_styles/features/history/staff_obituaries/prints_drawings/laver/index.html Obituary in ''The Times'', 4 June 1975 (reproduced on the V&amp;A website)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 he published a novel, ''Nymph Errant'', about a girl returning to her [[finishing school]], who went astray along the way and ended up in a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[harem]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; It was an instant best-seller and in 1933, [[Charles B. Cochran]] turned it into a musical, ''[[Nymph Errant]]'', featuring songs by [[Cole Porter]] and [[Gertrude Lawrence]] as the [[leading lady]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=moore/&gt; Laver felt as if he was leading a [[double life]]. He once stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To my colleagues at [[South Kensington]] I had become a cigar-smoking, [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]]-supping, enviable but slightly disreputable character, hobnobbing with chorus girls and hanging round stage doors. To Gertrude Lawrence and her friends I was something 'in a museum', engaged in mysterious and apparently useless activities quite outside their comprehension; a character out of ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'', hardly fit to be let out alone."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laver continued to write fiction and work for the theatre and film on a less ambitious scale, but did not attempt becoming a full-time writer. His work on films included acting as historical advisor for ''[[The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Amateur Gentleman (1936 film)|The Amateur Gentleman]]'' (1936), and he co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Warning to Wantons]]'' (1948). During the [[Second World War]], he determined to read all the books on [[occultism]] in the [[London Library]]. As a result, he became an expert in the field, writing a book on the prophet [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Between 1926 and 1938, James Laver was the Director of Art Classes at the [[Working Men's College]], [[Camden Town]].&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[[J. F. C. Harrison]] ''A History of the Working Men's College'' (1854–1954) p.166, Routledge Kegan Paul, 1954; {{ISBN|0-415-43221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran a course on [[English literature]] and also re-organised the art class, introducing [[model (art)|living models]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Laver married the Irish actress [[Veronica Turleigh]] (1903–1971), a Roman Catholic in 1928. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. They first lived in a flat in [[Piccadilly, London]], which proved convenient for their theatrical friends, and later moved to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref name=moore/&gt;

==Death==
Laver died on 3 June 1975 following a fire at his home in [[Blackheath, London]].

'''Jay Leyda''' (February 12, 1910 – February 15, 1988)&lt;ref name=rediscovered&gt;David Stirk and Elena Pinto Simon in {{cite book |last1=Christie |first1=Ian |last2=Taylor|first2=Richard |title=Eisenstein Rediscovered|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-04950-4  |oclc=252972811 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Experimental film|avant-garde filmmaker]] and film historian, noted for his work on [[Cinema of the United States|U.S]], [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet]], and [[Cinema of China|Chinese cinema]], as well as his collections of documentation on the day-to-day lives of [[Herman Melville]] and [[Emily Dickinson]].

==Life and work==
Leyda was born on February 12, 1910, in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He was a member of the [[Workers Film and Photo League]] in the early 1930s. He travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to study filmmaking at State Film Institute, Moscow, with [[Sergei Eisenstein]]. He participated in the filming of Eisenstein's lost film ''[[Bezhin Meadow]]'' (1935–37).&lt;ref name=rediscovered/&gt; When he returned to the United States in 1936 to become an assistant film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he brought the only complete print of Eisenstein's ''[[Battleship Potemkin]].'' In the 1940s he translated Eisenstein's writings.

His ''The Melville Log'' (1951) was a day to day compilation of documents which he had painstakingly collected on the life of [[Herman Melville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leyda |first1=Jay |title=The Melville Log: A Documentary Life of  Herman Melville, 1819–1891|year=1951  |publisher=Harcourt, Brace |location=New York |oclc=174510154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leyda’s wife, Si-lan Chen, a ballet dancer of international reputation, was the daughter of [[Eugene Chen]], a colleague of the Chinese revolutionary [[Sun Yat-sen]]. Leyda was invited in 1959 to work at the Film Archive of China in Beijing, where he stayed until 1964. His account of Chinese film history, ''Dianying'', was the first full length treatment to appear in English. Although he could use the basic (and now outdated) Chinese scholarship only in summary translations, Leyda’s knowledge of film gave him still useful insights into individual films and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Leyda, Dianying: An Account of Films and the Film Audience in China (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1972), xii&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded the [[Eastman Kodak]] Gold Medal Award in 1984. He taught at Yale University (1969-1972), York University (1972-73) and New York University from 1973 until his death in New York on February 15, 1988, of heart failure&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/18/obituaries/jay-leyda-film-historian-writer-and-a-student-of-sergei-eisenstein.html  Andrew L.

He was professor and dissertation advisor to noted film historian, [[Charles Harpole|Charles H. Harpole]] (creator of the ten volume History of American Cinema, dedicated to Leyda); leading film theorist, Tom Gunning; and scholar-practitioner [[Charles Musser]]. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the [[12th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1981 |title=12th Moscow International Film Festival (1981) |accessdate=2013-01-21 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421050907/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1981 |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-curated (with Charles Musser) ''Before Hollywood: Turn of the Century American Film'' (1987) for the [[American Federation of Arts]], a six-part touring program of American films with an accompanying catalog, which the ''New York Times'' called "A fascinating look at the cinema that flourished between 1895 and 1915 in America, before movies could be mentioned in family newspapers." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Before Hollywood: Turn of the Century American Film|last=Leyda|first=Jay|last2=Musser|first2=Charles|last4=et al|publisher=American Federation for the Arts,|year=1987|isbn=978-0933920910|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/books/in-short-nonfiction-faking-it-on-film.html|title="IN SHORT: NONFICTION; Faking It on Film,"|last=Burnette|first=Peter|date=June 7, 1987|work=New York Times|access-date=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonard Hayflick''' (born 20 May 1928) is a [[Professor]] of [[Anatomy]] at the [[UCSF School of Medicine]], and was Professor of Medical [[Microbiology]] at [[Stanford University]] School of Medicine. He is a past president of the [[Gerontological Society of America]] and was a founding member of the council of the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA). The recipient of a number of research prizes and awards, including the 1991 Sandoz Prize for Gerontological Research, he has studied the [[senescence|aging process]] for more than fifty years. He is known for discovering that normal human [[Cell (biology)|cells]] divide for a limited number of times ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hayflick L | title=The limited in vitro lifetime of human diploid cell strains | journal=Experimental Cell Research | volume=37 | year=1965 | pages=614–636 | pmid=14315085 | doi=10.1016/0014-4827(65)90211-9 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (refuting the contention by [[Alexis Carrel]] that normal body cells are [[biological immortality|immortal]]). This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember at what doubling level they have reached. He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses. His cell strain [[WI-38]] soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world's human virus vaccines. Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary [[atypical pneumonia]] (also called "walking pneumonia") was not a virus as previously believed. He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a [[mycoplasma]], the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name. He named the organism ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]''.

In 1959, Hayflick developed the first inverted microscope for use in [[cell culture]] research. To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype. His microscope was accessioned by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 2009.

Hayflick developed the first practical method for producing powdered cell culture media in 1965. This method is now used worldwide for the production of many tons of powdered media annually for use in research laboratories and commercial production facilities. The technique is not patented and Hayflick receives no remuneration from this invention. 

Hayflick is the author of the book, ''How and Why We Age'', published in August 1994 by [[Ballantine Books]], [[New York City|NYC]] and available since 1996 as a paperback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hayflick | first = Leonard | title = How and Why We Age | edition= Reprint | publisher = [[Ballantine Books]] | date = January 23, 1996 | isbn = 0-345-40155-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book has been translated into nine languages and is published in [[Brazil]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Spain]]. It was a selection of the [[Book of the Month Club]] and has sold over 50,000 copies worldwide.

Hayflick and his associates have vehemently condemned "anti-aging medicine" and criticized organizations such as the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[S.

== Biography ==
Leonard Hayflick was born 20 May 1928 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1956. After receiving a post-doctoral fellowship for study at the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]] in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] under the tutelage of the renowned cell culturist Prof. Charles M. Pomerat, he returned to Philadelphia, where he spent ten years as an Associate Member of the [[Wistar Institute]] and two years as an Assistant Professor of Research Medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

In 1968, Hayflick was appointed Professor of Medical Microbiology at the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], [[Stanford, California]].  Hayflick resigned from Stanford in 1976 in protest to the behavior of a few of its administrators who were later shown to have wrongly accepted the beliefs of an NIH accountant who was unable to understand the unique concept of title to a self-duplicating biological system. Hayflick sued the NIH, who later agreed that the issue was in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayflick|first1=Leonard|title=Errors in the "Vaccine Race" Book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323666095_Errors_in_The_Vaccine_Race_book|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WebofS" /&gt; The behavior of Stanford and the NIH was later condemned by 85 prominent biologists who viewed him as having been "exonerated" by subsequent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strehler|first1=B|last2=Abraham|first2=S|display-authors=1|title=Hayflick-NIH Settlement|journal=Science|date=15 Jan 1982|volume=215|issue=4530|pages=240-242|doi=10.1126/science.215.4530.240-b|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/215/4530/240.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Boffey, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/19/science/the-fall-and-rise-of-leonard-hayflick-biologist-whose-fight-with-us.html "The Fall and Rise of Leonard Hayflick,"] New York Times (January 19, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 he moved to the [[University of Florida]], Gainesville, where he became Director of the Center for Gerontological Studies and Professor of Zoology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and Professor of Microbiology and Immunology in the College of Medicine.

In 1988, Hayflick joined the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, where he is currently Professor of Anatomy.  Hayflick is a member of numerous national and international scientific and public boards of directors and committees.  He is now, or has been, on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals. Hayflick was Editor-in-Chief of the international journal “Experimental Gerontology” for 13 years.

He is a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983. He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH and Chairman of its Executive Committee. He was a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and the [[World Health Organization]], and is now a member of several scientific advisory boards.  He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the Board of Directors. He was also recruited by [[Michael D. West]], founder of [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] ({{NASDAQ|GERN}}) and current CEO of [[BioTime]], to join the company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991-2000. Hayflick was also a consultant at [[Genentech]] from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years. He developed their technology for growing animal cells in fermentation tanks in which most of their products were produced.

Hayflick is one of several prominent biologists featured in the 1995 science [[documentary]] [[Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times]].

== Research ==
Hayflick is known for his research in [[cell biology]], virus vaccine development, and [[mycoplasma|mycoplasmology]]. In 1962 he discovered that, contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, cultured normal human and animal cells have a limited capacity for replication.  This discovery, known as the [[Hayflick limit]], overturned a long-held belief bolstered by [[Alexis Carrel]]'s work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture. Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering at what replication level they are at. He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal to be an indication of aging at the cellular level. Hayflick demonstrated for the first time that mortal (normal) and immortal (malignant) mammalian cells existed.

Hayflick developed the first normal human [[diploid]] cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world. Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and [[aneuploid]]. One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorehead at the [[Wistar Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], called [[WI-38]], has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses. He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses. Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people.&lt;ref name="The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=S.J.|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|title=The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity|journal=AIMS Public Health|date=2 March 2017|volume=4|issue=2|pages=127-138|doi=10.3934/publichealth.2017.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayflick produced the first oral [[polio]] vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38. WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere. WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus [[vaccine]]s produced throughout the world including those for [[poliomyelitis]], rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign versions of Hayflick's original WI-38.&lt;ref name="The Role of the WI-38 Cell Strain in Saving Lives and Reducing Morbidity" /&gt;

Hayflick is also known for his discovery of the cause of primary atypical pneumonia (“[[walking pneumonia]]”) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chanock|first1=RM|last2=Hayflick|first2=L|last3=Barile|first3=MF|title=Growth on artificial medium of an agent associated with atypical pneumonia and its identification as a PPLO.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 January 1962|volume=48|pages=41-9|pmid=13878126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etiological agent was first thought to be a virus, but Hayflick showed that it was, in fact, a [[mycoplasma]], a member of the smallest free-living class of microorganisms.  The etiological agent was named by him as ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name. It is now used worldwide for mycoplasma isolation and research.

Hayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the [[International Association of Gerontology]], and the Presidential Award from [[The International Organization for Mycoplasmology]]. Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious [[John Scott Award]] in 2014. This is the oldest scientific award in the United States, established in 1823 in honor of Benjamin Franklin.

In the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by [[Geron Corporation|Geron]] founder [[Michael D. West]] to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Corporation 10K 1996|url= http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/ageing/1996-May/002331.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Société de Biologie of France. In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the [[Lord Cohen Medal|Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal]] by the [[British Society for Research on Ageing]]. The [[American Aging Association]] established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997. A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] in 2000. Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his "...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells..." A third Annual Hayflick Lecture was established at the [[Friedrich Schiller University]] in 2013.

Hayflick is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology. Hayflick is the author of over 275 scientific papers, book chapters and edited books of which four papers are among the 100 most cited scientific papers of the two million papers published in the basic biomedical sciences from 1961 to 1978.

The [[inverted microscope]] that Hayflick modified for use in his tissue culture and mycoplasma work and on which all other such microscopes have been modeled has been acquired by the [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian National Museum of American History]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Macular degeneration''', also known as '''age-related macular degeneration''' ('''AMD''' or '''ARMD'''), is a medical condition which may result in [[blurred vision|blurred]] or [[vision loss|no vision]] in the center of the [[visual field]].&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; Early on there are often no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; While it does not result in complete [[blindness]], loss of central vision can make it hard to recognize faces, drive, read, or perform other activities of daily life.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; [[Visual hallucination]]s may also occur and these do not represent a [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
Macular degeneration typically occurs in older people.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; Genetic factors and smoking also play a role.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; It is due to damage to the [[macula of retina|macula]] of the [[retina]].&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; Diagnosis is by a complete [[eye exam]].&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late types.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; The late type is additionally divided into "dry" and "wet" forms with the dry form making up 90% of cases.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meh2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Preventive efforts include exercising, eating well, and not smoking.&lt;ref name=NEI2015&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Age-Related Macular Degeneration |url=https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts |website=National Eye Institute |access-date=21 December 2015 |date=June 2015 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151236/https://nei.nih.gov/health/maculardegen/armd_facts |archive-date=22 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant vitamins and minerals do not appear to be useful for prevention.&lt;ref name=Evans2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JR, Lawrenson JG | title = Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for preventing age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | pages = CD000253 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28756617 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000253.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no cure or treatment that returns vision already lost.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; In the wet form, [[anti-VEGF medication]] injected into the eye or less commonly [[laser coagulation]] or [[photodynamic therapy]] may slow worsening.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt; Supplements in those who already have the disease may slow progression.&lt;ref name=Evan2017Already&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JR, Lawrenson JG | title = Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | pages = CD000254 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28756618 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000254.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
In 2015 it affected 6.2 million people globally.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre/&gt; In 2013 it was the fourth most common cause of blindness after [[cataracts]], [[preterm birth]], and [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 386 | issue = 9995 | pages = 743–800 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26063472 | pmc = 4561509 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It most commonly occurs in people over the age of fifty and in the United States is the most common cause of vision loss in this age group.&lt;ref name=NEI2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meh2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehta S | title = Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Primary Care | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–91 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26319344 | doi = 10.1016/j.pop.2015.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 0.4% of people between 50 and 60 have the disease, while it occurs in 0.7% of people 60 to 70, 2.3% of those 70 to 80, and nearly 12% of people over 80 years old.&lt;ref name="Meh2015" /&gt;

Signs and symptoms of macular degeneration include:
;'''Visual symptoms'''
* [[Distorted vision]] in the form of [[metamorphopsia]], in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central [[scotoma]]s, shadows or missing areas of vision
* Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test)
* Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80
* Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels).
* Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones
* A loss in [[Contrast (vision)|contrast sensitivity]]
*Formed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aao.org/preferred-practice-pattern/age-related-macular-degeneration-ppp-2015|title=Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP - Updated 2015|date=2015-01-29|work=American Academy of Ophthalmology|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year – Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe &amp; Company |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year – Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe &amp; Company |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side. Most people find this difficult to do.

In addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes.&lt;ref name="Cunningham_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunningham J | title = Recognizing age-related macular degeneration in primary care | journal = Jaapa | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 18–22 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28151737 | doi = 10.1097/01.jaa.0000512227.85313.05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lim_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim LS, Mitchell P, Seddon JM, Holz FG, Wong TY | title = Age-related macular degeneration | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 379 | issue = 9827 | pages = 1728–38 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559899 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60282-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms.&lt;ref name="Cunningham_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lim_2012" /&gt;

==Risk factors==
* '''Aging''': Advanced age is the strongest predictor of AMD, particularly over 50.&lt;ref name="pmid21609220"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deangelis MM, Silveira AC, Carr EA, Kim IK | title = Genetics of age-related macular degeneration: current concepts, future directions | journal = Seminars in Ophthalmology | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–93 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21609220 | pmc = 4242505 | doi = 10.3109/08820538.2011.577129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Family history:'''

===Environment and lifestyle===
* '''Smoking''': Smoking tobacco increases the risk of AMD by two to three times that of someone who has never smoked, and may be the most important modifiable factor in its prevention. A review of previous studies found "a strong association between current smoking and AMD. ...

Over time, this results in accumulation of intracellular and extracellular metabolic debris.  This can cause scarring of the retina or breakdown of its vascularization.

Genetic tests are available for some of these gene variations.  However, pathogenesis of macular degeneration is a complex interaction between genetics, environment and lifestyle, and presence of unfavorable genetic factors doesn't necessarily predict progression to disease.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Human eye cross-sectional view grayscale.png|right|thumb|[[Human eye]] cross-sectional view]]
The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration is not well known, although some theories have been put forward, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory processes.

The imbalance between the production of damaged cellular components and degradation leads to the accumulation of harmful products, for example, intracellular lipofuscin and extracellular drusen.  Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss.

In the dry ([[Exudate|nonexudative]]) form, cellular debris called [[drusen]] accumulates between the retina and the [[choroid]], causing atrophy and scarring to the retina. In the wet (exudative) form, which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid (neovascularization) behind the retina which can leak exudate and fluid and also cause hemorrhaging.

Early work demonstrated a family of immune mediators was plentiful in drusen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullins RF, Russell SR, Anderson DH, Hageman GS | title = Drusen associated with aging and age-related macular degeneration contain proteins common to extracellular deposits associated with atherosclerosis, elastosis, amyloidosis, and dense deposit disease | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 835–46 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10783137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complement [[factor H]] (CFH) is an important inhibitor of this inflammatory cascade, and a disease-associated polymorphism in the CFH gene strongly associates with AMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hageman GS, Anderson DH, Johnson LV, Hancox LS, Taiber AJ, Hardisty LI, Hageman JL, Stockman HA, Borchardt JD, Gehrs KM, Smith RJ, Silvestri G, Russell SR, Klaver CC, Barbazetto I, Chang S, Yannuzzi LA, Barile GR, Merriam JC, Smith RT, Olsh AK, Bergeron J, Zernant J, Merriam JE, Gold B, Dean M, Allikmets R | display-authors = 6 | title = A common haplotype in the complement regulatory gene factor H (HF1/CFH) predisposes individuals to age-related macular degeneration | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 20 | pages = 7227–32 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15870199 | pmc = 1088171 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501536102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen LJ, Liu DT, Tam PO, Chan WM, Liu K, Chong KK, Lam DS, Pang CP | title = Association of complement factor H polymorphisms with exudative age-related macular degeneration | journal = Molecular Vision | volume = 12 | pages = 1536–42 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17167412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Despriet DD, Klaver CC, Witteman JC, Bergen AA, Kardys I, de Maat MP, Boekhoorn SS, Vingerling JR, Hofman A, Oostra BA, Uitterlinden AG, Stijnen T, van Duijn CM, de Jong PT | title = Complement factor H polymorphism, complement activators, and risk of age-related macular degeneration | journal = Jama | volume = 296 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–9 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16849663 | doi = 10.1001/jama.296.3.301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li M, Atmaca-Sonmez P, Othman M, Branham KE, Khanna R, Wade MS, Li Y, Liang L, Zareparsi S, Swaroop A, Abecasis GR | display-authors = 6 | title = CFH haplotypes without the Y402H coding variant show strong association with susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1049–54 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936733 | pmc = 1941700 | doi = 10.1038/ng1871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haines JL, Hauser MA, Schmidt S, Scott WK, Olson LM, Gallins P, Spencer KL, Kwan SY, Noureddine M, Gilbert JR, Schnetz-Boutaud N, Agarwal A, Postel EA, Pericak-Vance MA | title = Complement factor H variant increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 419–21 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15761120 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus an AMD pathophysiological model of chronic low grade complement activation and inflammation in the macula has been advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors = Rohrer B, Long Q, Coughlin B, Renner B, Huang Y, Kunchithapautham K |title=A targeted inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway reduces RPE injury and angiogenesis in models of age-related macular degeneration |journal=Adv Exp Med Biol |volume=703 |pages=137–49 |pmid=20711712 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-5635-4_10 |series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |isbn=978-1-4419-5634-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunchithapautham K, Rohrer B | title = Sublytic membrane-attack-complex (MAC) activation alters regulated rather than constitutive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in retinal pigment epithelium monolayers | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 27 | pages = 23717–24 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21566137 | pmc = 3129152 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M110.214593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lending credibility to this has been the discovery of disease-associated genetic polymorphisms in other elements of the complement cascade including [[complement component 3]] (C3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yates JR, Sepp T, Matharu BK, Khan JC, Thurlby DA, Shahid H, Clayton DG, Hayward C, Morgan J, Wright AF, Armbrecht AM, Dhillon B, Deary IJ, Redmond E, Bird AC, Moore AT | title = Complement C3 variant and the risk of age-related macular degeneration | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 6 | pages = 553–61 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17634448 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa072618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages===
In AMD there is a progressive accumulation of characteristic yellow deposits, called [[drusen]] (buildup of extracellular proteins and lipids), in the [[macula]] (a part of the retina), between the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] and the underlying [[choroid]] which is believed to damage  the retina over time. [[Amyloid beta]], which builds up in [[Alzheimer's disease]] brains, is one of the proteins that accumulate in AMD, which is a reason why AMD is sometimes called "Alzheimer's of the eye" or "Alzheimer's of the retina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratnayaka JA, Serpell LC, Lotery AJ | title = Dementia of the eye: the role of amyloid beta in retinal degeneration | journal = Eye | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 1013–26 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26088679 | pmc = 4541342 | doi = 10.1038/eye.2015.100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
AMD can be divided into 3 stages: early, intermediate, and late, based partially on the extent (size and number) of [[drusen]].&lt;ref name="NEI2015"/&gt;

AMD-like pathology begins with small yellow deposits ([[drusen]]) in the macula, between the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] and the underlying [[choroid]]. Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD, in fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated [[cholesterol]] deposits.

====Early AMD====
Early AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic.&lt;ref name="NEI2015"/&gt;

====Intermediate AMD====
Intermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities. Intermediate AMD may cause some vision loss, but, like early AMD, it is usually asymptomatic.&lt;ref name="NEI2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferris FL, Wilkinson CP, Bird A, Chakravarthy U, Chew E, Csaky K, Sadda SR | title = Clinical classification of age-related macular degeneration | journal = Ophthalmology | volume = 120 | issue = 4 | pages = 844–51 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23332590 | doi = 10.1016/j.ophtha.2012.10.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late AMD====
In late AMD, enough retinal damage occurs that people have symptomatic central vision loss in addition to drusen. The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEI2015"/&gt;

=====Dry AMD=====
Dry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD).  This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy.  Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80–90% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10–20% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type.

====Geographic Atrophy====
[[Geographic atrophy]] (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function.

=====Wet AMD=====
[[Neovascular]] or [[exudative]] AMD, the "wet" form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth ([[choroidal neovascularization]]) in the [[choriocapillaris]], through [[Bruch's membrane]]. It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). Unfortunately, because these blood vessels are abnormal, these new vessels are fragile, ultimately leading to blood and protein leakage below the macula. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.

===Oxidative stress===
Age-related accumulation of low-molecular-weight, phototoxic, [[pro-oxidant]] [[melanin]] oligomers within lysosomes in the [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) may be partly responsible for decreasing the digestive rate of photoreceptor outer rod segments (POS) by the RPE – autophagy. A decrease in the digestive rate of POS has been shown to be associated with [[lipofuscin]] formation – a classic sign associated with AMD.&lt;ref&gt;"Melanin aggregation and polymerization: possible implications in age related macular degeneration."

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Opthalmology AMD Super Resolution Cremer.png|thumb|250px|Super resolution microscopic investigation of human eye tissue affected by AMD]]
Diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration depends on signs in the [[Macula of retina|macula]], not necessarily vision.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wet AMD is typically the advanced progression of dry AMD and will require additional diagnostic tools. Additionally, early diagnosis of wet AMD can prevent further visual deterioration and potentially improve vision.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK481428/|title=Age-related macular degeneration: diagnosis and management|last=National Guideline Alliance (UK)|date=2018|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK)|isbn=9781473127876|series=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: Clinical Guidelines|location=London|pmid=29400919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of dry (or early stage) AMD may include the following clinical examinations as well as procedures and tests:

* The transition from dry to wet AMD can happen rapidly, and if it is left untreated can lead to legal blindness in as little as six months. To prevent this from occurring and to initiate preventive strategies earlier in the disease process, dark adaptation testing may be performed. A dark adaptometer can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.&lt;ref name="Owsley, Cynthia 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Owsley C, McGwin G, Clark ME, Jackson GR, Callahan MA, Kline LB, Witherspoon CD, Curcio CA | title = Delayed Rod-Mediated Dark Adaptation Is a&amp;nbsp;Functional Biomarker for Incident Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration | journal = Ophthalmology | volume = 123 | issue = 2 | pages = 344–51 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26522707 | pmc = 4724453 | doi = 10.1016/j.ophtha.2015.09.041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owsley, Cynthia 2015"/&gt;
*There is a loss of contrast sensitivity, so that contours, shadows, and color vision are less vivid. The loss in contrast sensitivity can be quickly and easily measured by a [[contrast sensitivity]] test like Pelli Robson performed either at home or by an eye specialist.
* When viewing an [[Amsler grid]], some straight lines appear wavy and some patches appear blank
* When viewing a [[Snellen chart]], at least 2 lines decline
* In dry macular degeneration, which occurs in 85–90 percent of AMD cases, drusen spots can be seen in [[Fundus photography]]
* Using an [[electroretinogram]], points in the macula with a weak or absent response compared to a normal eye may be found
*[[Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test]] and Maximum Color Contrast Sensitivity test (MCCS) for assessing color acuity and color contrast sensitivity
*[[Optical coherence tomography]] is now used by most ophthalmologists in the diagnosis and the follow-up evaluation of the response to treatment with antiangiogenic drugs.

Diagnosis of wet (or late stage) AMD may include the following in addition to the above tests:

* [[Preferential hyperacuity perimetry]] changes (for wet AMD). Preferential hyperacuity perimetry is a test that detects drastic changes in vision and involves the macula being stimulated with distorted patterns of dots and the patient identification of where in the visual field this occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faes L, Bodmer NS, Bachmann LM, Thiel MA, Schmid MK | title = Diagnostic accuracy of the Amsler grid and the preferential hyperacuity perimetry in the screening of patients with age-related macular degeneration: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Eye | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 788–96 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24788016 | pmc = 4094801 | doi = 10.1038/eye.2014.104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In wet macular degeneration, [[angiography]] can visualize the leakage of bloodstream behind the macula. [[Fluorescein angiography]] allows for the identification and localization of abnormal vascular processes.

===Histology===
* Pigmentary changes in the retina –  In addition to the pigmented cells in the iris (the colored part of the eye), there are pigmented cells beneath the retina. As these cells break down and release their pigment, dark clumps of released pigment and later, areas that are less pigmented may appear
* Exudative changes: [[hemorrhages]] in the eye, hard exudates, subretinal/sub-RPE/intraretinal fluid
* [[Drusen]], tiny accumulations of extracellular material that build up on the retina. While there is a tendency for drusen to be blamed for the progressive loss of vision, drusen deposits can be present in the retina without vision loss. Some patients with large deposits of drusen have normal visual acuity. If normal retinal reception and image transmission are sometimes possible in a retina when high concentrations of drusen are present, then, even if drusen can be implicated in the loss of visual function, there must be at least one other factor that accounts for the loss of vision.

==Prevention==
A 2017 Cochrane review found the use of vitamin and mineral supplements, alone or in combination, by the general population did not affect whether or not AMD started.&lt;ref name=Evans2017/&gt;

== Management ==
Treatment of AMD varies depending on the category of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, treatment is aimed at slowing down the progression of AMD.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018"&gt;Bishop P. Age-related macular degeneration. ''BMJ Best Practice.'' 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, there are no treatments to reverse the effects of AMD.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt; Early-stage and intermediate-stage AMD is managed by modifying known risk factors such as smoking and atherosclerosis and making dietary modifications.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt; For intermediate-stage AMD, management also includes [[antioxidant]] and [[Mineral (nutrient)|minera]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l supplementation.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JR, Lawrenson JG | title = Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for preventing age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | pages = CD000253 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28756617 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd000253.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Advanced-stage AMD is managed based on the presence of [[choroidal neovascularization]] (CNV): dry AMD (no CNV present) or wet AMD (CNV present).&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt; No effective treatments exist for dry AMD.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt; The CNV present in wet AMD is managed with vascular endothelial growth factor ([[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]]) inhibitors.&lt;ref name="Bishop_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarwar S, Clearfield E, Soliman MK, Sadiq MA, Baldwin AJ, Hanout M, Agarwal A, Sepah YJ, Do DV, Nguyen QD | title = Aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD011346 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26857947 | pmc = 5030844 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd011346.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrenson JG, Evans JR | title = Omega 3 fatty acids for preventing or slowing the progression of age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD010015 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25856365 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd010015.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry AMD===
No medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition.

===Wet AMD===
[[Ranibizumab]] and [[aflibercept]] are approved VEGF inhibitors for the treatment of CNV in wet AMD.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Bevacizumab is another VEGF inhibitor that has been shown to have similar efficacy and safety as the previous two drugs, however, is not currently indicated for AMD.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; AMD can also be treated with [[laser coagulation]] therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Virgili G, Bini A | title = Laser photocoagulation for neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD004763 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17636773 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd004763.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research directions==

===Association with other age-related diseases===
Studies indicate [[drusen]] associated with AMD are similar in molecular composition to Beta-Amyloid (βA) plaques and deposits in other age-related diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and atherosclerosis. This suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullins RF, Russell SR, Anderson DH, Hageman GS | title = Drusen associated with aging and age-related macular degeneration contain proteins common to extracellular deposits associated with atherosclerosis, elastosis, amyloidosis, and dense deposit disease | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 835–46 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10783137 | displayauthors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic testing===
A practical application of AMD-associated genetic markers is in the prediction of progression of AMD from early stages of the disease to neovascularization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Stem cell transplant===
{{see also|Adeno associated virus and gene therapy of the human retina}}
Cell based therapies using bone marrow stem cells as well as retinal pigment epithelial transplantation are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = John S, Natarajan S, Parikumar P, Shanmugam PM, Senthilkumar R, Green DW, Abraham SJ | title = Choice of Cell Source in Cell-Based Therapies for Retinal Damage due to Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Review | journal = Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 2013 | pages = 465169 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23710332 | pmc = 3654320 | doi = 10.1155/2013/465169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of trials have occurred in humans with encouraging results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr AJ, Smart MJ, Ramsden CM, Powner MB, da Cruz L, Coffey PJ | title = Development of human embryonic stem cell therapies for age-related macular degeneration | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 385–95 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23601133 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2013.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==
There are a few other (rare) kinds of macular degeneration with similar symptoms but unrelated in etiology to Wet or Dry age-related macular degeneration. They are all genetic disorders that may occur in childhood or middle age.
* [[Best's disease]]
* [[Sorsby's fundus dystrophy]] is an autosomal dominant, retinal disease characterized by sudden acuity loss resulting from untreatable submacular neovascularisation
* [[Stargardt's disease]] (juvenile macular degeneration, STGD) is an autosomal recessive retinal disorder characterized by juvenile-onset macular dystrophy, alterations of the peripheral retina, and subretinal deposition of lipofuscin-like material.

[[Image:Bruce McCandless II during EVA in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|280px|U.S. astronaut [[Bruce McCandless II|Bruce McCandless]] uses a manned maneuvering unit]]
The '''Manned Maneuvering Unit''' ('''MMU''') is an [[Astronaut Propulsion Unit|astronaut propulsion unit]] that was used by [[NASA]] on three [[Space Shuttle]] missions in 1984. The MMU allowed the [[astronauts]] to perform untethered [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]] spacewalks at a distance from the shuttle. The MMU was used in practice to retrieve a pair of faulty communications satellites, [[Westar]] VI and [[Palapa B2]]. Following the third mission the unit was retired from use. A smaller successor, the [[Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue]] (SAFER), was first flown in 1994, and is intended for emergency use only.

==Overview==
The unit featured redundancy to protect against failure of individual systems. It was designed to fit over the life-support system backpack of the Space Shuttle [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU). When carried into space, the MMU was stowed in a support station attached to the wall of the payload bay near the airlock hatch. Two MMUs were carried on a mission, with the second unit mounted across from the first on the opposite payload bay wall. The MMU controller arms were folded for storage. When an astronaut backed into the unit and snapped the life-support system into place, the arms were unfolded.

To adapt to astronauts with different arm lengths, controller arms could be adjusted over a range of approximately 13 centimetres. The MMU was small enough to be maneuvered with ease around and within complex structures. With a full propellant load, its mass was 148 kilograms (326 pounds).

Gaseous [[nitrogen]] was used as the propellant for the MMU. Two aluminium tanks with [[Kevlar]] wrappings contained 5.9 kilograms of nitrogen each, enough propellant for a six-hour EVA depending on the amount of maneuvering done. Typical MMU velocity capability was about 80 feet per second (25 m/s).

There were 24 nozzle thrusters placed at different locations on the MMU. To operate the propulsion system, the astronaut used his fingertips to manipulate hand controllers at the ends of the MMU's two arms. The right controller produced rotational [[acceleration]] for roll, pitch, and yaw. The left controller produced translational acceleration for moving forward-back, up-down, and left-right. Coordination of the two controllers produced intricate movements in the unit. Once a desired orientation was achieved, the astronaut could engage an automatic attitude-hold function that maintained the inertial attitude of the unit in flight. This freed both hands for work.

==History==
[[File:Robert L. Stewart, hanging above the Earth - DF-SC-84-10569.jpg|thumbnail|Robert L. Stewart]]
In 1966, the [[US Air Force]] developed an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack very similar to the MMU. This was planned to be tested during [[Project Gemini]] on an EVA by [[Eugene Cernan]] on [[Gemini 9A]] on June 5, 1966. However, the test had to be cancelled because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted on the back of the spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final [[Gemini 12]] mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]] programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the [[Space Shuttle]] program, though several maneuvering device designs were tested inside Skylab.
[[File:Capturing the Solar Maximum Mission satellite.jpg|thumb|SMM being captured, 1984]]
The MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It was first tested on February 7 during mission [[STS-41-B]] by astronauts [[Bruce McCandless II]] and [[Robert L. Stewart]]. Two months later during mission [[STS-41-C]], astronauts [[James van Hoften]] and [[George Nelson (astronaut)|George Nelson]] attempted to use the MMU to capture the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the Trunion Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite.  This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter's robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System  ([[SRMS]]). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.

The final MMU mission was [[STS-51-A]], which flew in November 1984. The propulsion unit was used to retrieve two communication satellites, [[Westar]] VI and [[Palapa B2]], that did not reach their proper orbits because of faulty propulsion modules. Astronauts [[Joseph P. Allen]] and [[Dale Gardner]] captured the two satellites and brought them into the Orbiter payload bay for stowage and return to Earth.

After a safety review following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], the MMU was judged too risky for further use and it was found many activities planned for the MMU could be done effectively with manipulator arms or traditional tethered EVAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the MMU was envisioned as a natural aid for constructing the [[International Space Station]], with its retirement, NASA developed different tethered spacewalk approaches.

The two operational, flown flight units MMU #2 and #3 were stored by NASA in a clean room at Lockheed in Denver through 1998. NASA transferred flight article #3 to the National Air and Space Museum in 1998, which now hangs suspended in the hall above the Space Shuttle Discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Matija Cop.jpg|thumb|Matija Čop]]
'''Matija Čop''' ({{IPA-sl|maˈtiːja ˈtʃɔp|pron}}; 26 January 1797 – 6 July 1835), also known in German as '''Matthias Tschop''', was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[linguistics|linguist]], [[polyglot]], [[history of literature|literary historian]] and [[literary critic|critic]].

== Biography ==
Čop was born in the small northern [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniolan]] town of [[Žirovnica, Žirovnica|Žirovnica]], in what was then the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (now in [[Slovenia]]), into a relatively wealthy peasant family. He was sent to [[Ljubljana]] for primary and secondary schooling and then studied [[philosophy]] at the [[lyceum]]s of Ljubljana and [[Vienna]] for three years. In 1817, he returned from Vienna and attended a priest seminary until 1820, when he left it to become a secondary school teacher in [[Rijeka]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]. In 1822 he moved to [[Lvov]] (then also part of the [[Austrian Empire]]), when he started working as a teacher at the local lyceum, but was soon promoted to assistant professor at [[Lviv University]].

In 1827 he returned to Ljubljana, when he was offered a job as a secondary school teacher again. In 1828, he accepted the post of librarian at the Lyceum, which he held full-time after 1831.

During his time in Ljubljana, be became a close friend of the poet [[France Prešeren]]. He served as his tutor, providing him with information on contemporary developments in European literature.

In 1835, at age 38, Čop drowned while swimming in the [[Sava|Sava River]]. Prešeren dedicated his major poem ''[[The Baptism on the Savica]]'' to his late friend.

== Influence ==
With his command of 19 languages (including [[Albanian language|Albanian]]), Čop was perhaps the most [[erudite]] Slovene of his time. Although he did not publish much original work during his lifetime, Čop had a great influence on the later development of [[Culture of Slovenia|Slovene culture]]. Unlike such contemporaries as the linguist [[Jernej Kopitar]] and the poet [[Stanko Vraz]], Čop believed in the possibility of the development of a distinctive Slovenian national culture. He can thus be seen as the predecessor of the Slovenian national awakening in the second part of the 19th century. His broad cosmopolitan education enabled him to recognise the poetic talent of France Prešeren, which remained unnoticed by most of his contemporaries, and to advise him on stylistic and linguistic issues.

Today, Čop is generally regarded as one of the most important Slovenian intellectuals of the 19th century. Several streets, schools and other institutions throughout Slovenia bear his name, among them the fashionable [[Čop Street]] in Ljubljana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15123">{{about|the murder of the Scottish teenager in 2003|the footballer|Jodi Jones (footballer)}}

The '''murder of Jodi Jones''', a 14-year-old girl, took place in [[Easthouses]], Scotland on 30 June 2003. Her 15-year-old boyfriend, Luke Mitchell, came under suspicion, but it was several months before he was arrested. Mitchell was tried for the murder and after Scotland's longest single-accused trial, Mitchell was convicted in January 2005. He was sentenced to detention without limit of time with a minimum of 20 years even though there was no DNA evidence.

==Background ==
Mitchell's parents separated when he was 11, and he was brought up in relatively comfortable circumstances with hobbies that included riding horses and motorbikes. Mitchell went to [[St. David's RC High School]] in Dalkeith. He was in the same year as Jones and supplied her and his circle of friends with [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on the school premises. Around March 2003 when both Mitchell and Jones were 14 years old, Mitchell became her first serious boyfriend, and began having sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4187007.stm |title=scotland, Killer obsessed with occult |publisher=BBC News |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to Jones, Mitchell was also intimate with another girl at the time. Mitchell was a good pupil, but a teacher became concerned about the violence in an essay he had written. In the weeks before she was murdered, Jones's social life, which largely revolved around Mitchell, was curtailed by her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/east-central/188143-luke-mitchell-a-teenage-killer-obsessed-with-music-drugs-and-the-occult/ |title=Luke Mitchell: A teenage killer obsessed with music, drugs and the occult &amp;#124; Edinburgh and East &amp;#124; STV News |publisher=News.stv.tv |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about 5pm on 30 June 2003 Jones went out, saying she was going to see Mitchell. Her body was found several hours later; she had been murdered in a "savage knife attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/Police-believe-Jodis-killer-is.2440583.jp |title=Killer a Local Man Scotsman Online |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspicion falls on Mitchell===
The body was behind a high wall in a wooded area. Mitchell found it at around 10.30pm, while he was with members of Jones's family who were out searching for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/Family-discovers-battered-body-of.2440366.jp |title=Family Find Body On Country Path Scotsman Online |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances in which Mitchell was able to find the body were later alleged by prosecutors to indicate his guilty knowledge. The Jones family made it known that Mitchell was not welcome at the funeral. School authorities cited concern about Mitchell's safety in unsuccessfully attempting to prevent his return to school; two months after the murder he was suspended after objecting to being separated from other pupils.

After his discovery of the body, Mitchell was initially questioned as a witness; he quickly became the main focus of the investigation. There had been media speculation that he was the sole suspect, and 10 months later Mitchell was arrested and charged with the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/Jodis-boyfriend-now-16-can.2548632.jp |title=Jodi's boyfriend, now 16, can be named as suspect |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date=24 July 2004 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
At his trial at the [[High Court of Justiciary]] in [[Edinburgh]], Mitchell pleaded not guilty and lodged a special defence of alibi: that he was at home cooking dinner at the time of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;
http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/Boyfriend-goes-on-trial-accused.2579326.jp&lt;/ref&gt; He did not testify at his trial, which was the longest and most expensive of a single accused in Scottish legal history.&lt;ref&gt;
http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/Jodi-killers-defence-bill-costliest.2689831.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecution case ===
The main plank of the case against him was an attribution of "guilty knowledge"; in finding the body, the prosecution said Mitchell had demonstrated that he already knew where it was. Prosecutors also said that a witness had seen someone resembling Mitchell at the scene, and they accused Mitchell of giving a false alibi. Mitchell's brother testified he had been viewing internet pornography in the house at the time Mitchell said he had been there; under cross examination Mitchell's brother said he would only have done this if he thought the house to be otherwise empty. Mitchell's brother said he had not seen Mitchell in the house that afternoon, thereby failing to corroborate his defence of being in the family home at the time of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;
http://news.scotsman.com/jodijonesmurder/The-clues-that-snared-a.2596853.jp&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution said Mitchell had taken an interest in the [[Black Dahlia]] case, a 1947 homicide of a young woman whose body was severely mutilated in a way that the Crown alleged was similar to injuries suffered by Jones. A knife pouch was also found in Mitchell's possession on which he had marked "JJ 1989 – 2003" and "The finest day I ever had was when tomorrow never came". The prosecution said it would be unlikely for anyone but the killer to remember someone killed with a knife in this way.&lt;ref name="ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2008HCJAC28.html |title=Luke Mitchell v. Her Majesty's Advocate |publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecution, Mitchell's clothes may have been destroyed in a garden incinerator which some neighbours thought was giving off a strange smell. No forensic evidence was recovered from the incinerator, which was an 11" diameter log burner.

===Defence arguments===
In response to the prosecution accusation that only prior knowledge could have explained the way Mitchell was able to discover the body lying behind a wall, lawyers for Mitchell said had been aided by his dog. To allow the jury to explore the plausibility of these claims, a mock-up wall was erected in the Laigh Hall, below Parliament Hall within [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], across the road from the High Court of Justiciary building in [[Edinburgh's Old Town]], where the trial was being heard. A visit by the jury to the murder scene was also arranged. Mitchell maintained his alibi, that he had been at home at the time of the murder.

====Verdict and sentence====
On 21 January 2005, the jury found him guilty after five hours of deliberation. Mitchell, aged sixteen at the time of his conviction, was condemned as being "truly wicked" by Judge [[Lord Nimmo Smith]]. He was also found guilty of a separate charge of supplying cannabis.

Mitchell's sentencing took place on 11 February 2005. Nimmo Smith told Mitchell that he would spend a minimum of 20 years in prison before being considered for parole.

==Appeals==
In March 2006, Mitchell was granted leave to appeal against his conviction (and his length of sentence) at the High Court of Justiciary sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh, on the grounds that the trial judge should have moved the trial outside the city. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh heard Mitchell's appeal in February 2008, and in May 2008 his original conviction was upheld by [[Kenneth Osborne, Lord Osborne|Lord Osborne]], Lord Kingarth and Lord Hamilton. They ruled that there was sufficient evidence in law that Mitchell could be convicted on and rejected his other grounds of appeal, although they stated that the way police had questioned Mitchell on 14 August 2003 had been "outrageous" and was "to be deplored."

On 2 February 2011, Mitchell's appeal against sentence was refused by a two to one majority. [[Lord Justice Clerk]], [[Brian Gill, Lord Gill|Lord Gill]], sitting with [[Lord Hardie]] and [[Lady Cosgrove]] stated that he had the utmost sympathy for the family of the victim and that he understood entirely why this murder should have caused such public revulsion. Nevertheless, he was of the opinion that the sentencing judge should not have imposed a punishment part of such severity on such a young offender. He stated that justice would be done in this case if the punishment part of the sentence were fixed at 15 years. He did not consider that they were precluded from that disposal by anything said in the guidance given in HM Adv v Boyle and Ors (supra). He regretted, therefore, that he had to differ from his Lordship and her Ladyship.&lt;ref name="Appeal against Sentence, Luke Mitchell v HMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2011HCJAC10.html |title=Appeal against Sentence |publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cadder appeal refused ===
On 15 April 2011, Mitchell's bid to challenge his conviction for murder following a human rights ruling by the Supreme Court in the [[Cadder v HM Advocate|Cadder]] case was rejected. His lawyer told the Appeal Court in Edinburgh that his trial was unfair because he had no access to a lawyer during an interview. Lord Osborne sitting with Lord Hamilton [[Lord President of the Court of Session|(Lord Justice General)]] and Lord Kingarth told Mitchell that the application for leave to lodge the additional ground was refused. The appellant's appeal against sentence was finally disposed of on 2 February 2011 and in such circumstances there did not exist a live appeal in respect of which leave could be granted under section 110(4).&lt;ref name="Luke Mitchell Cadder ruling murder appeal rejected"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13095299 |title=Luke Mitchell Cadder ruling murder appeal rejected|publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 Mitchell was refused leave to take his appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], on the basis that his previous appeal had been dealt with before the Cadder ruling and could therefore not be re-opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breakingnews.heraldscotland.com/breaking-news/?mode=article&amp;site=hs&amp;id=N0042121322067790135A |title=Court rejects Mitchell appeal bid |publisher=Breakingnews.heraldscotland.com |date=24 November 2011|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Frontline Scotland ====

In May 2007, a [[BBC Scotland]] ''[[Frontline Scotland]]'' documentary special on [[BBC One]] explored a theory – not followed up by police during the initial investigation – that the murder may have been committed not by Mitchell, but by a student and heavy drug user who was alleged to have handed in an essay about killing a girl in the woods a few weeks before the murder. A friend of this suspect saw him soon after the murder and claimed that he was heavily scratched about the face. The documentary also challenged the theory that Mitchell was an obsessive [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] fan and had a keen interest in the Black Dahlia murder. The documentary stated that there is no evidence that Mitchell knew of the Dahlia case until after the murder. In the documentary Professor Anthony Busuttil, when asked about the similarities between Jones's and Short's injuries said, "there were major dissimilarities." &lt;ref name="own"&gt;{{cite news|author=Samantha Poling |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6634611.stm |title="Luke Mitchell: The Devil's Own?" Samantha Poling, '&amp;#39;BBC Frontline Scotland'&amp;#39; |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jones family were reported in the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' to be "outraged" at the programme, though the newspaper stated that none of them had watched it.&lt;ref name="own"/&gt;

== SCCRC ==

On 20 July 2012, lawyers acting for Mitchell launch a fresh bid to have his conviction overturned when a 300-page dossier was hand delivered to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).  The dossier included claims that a Mitchell lookalike may have confused eyewitnesses. The lawyers, including at least one senior legal figure, are said to be so concerned by Mitchell's conviction, which relied on an entirely circumstantial case, that they donated their services free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldscotland.com/mobile/news/crime-courts/luke-mitchell-in-new-bid-to-gain-freedom.18196698|title=Luke Mitchell in new bid to gain freedom|website=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the SCCRC revealed that police officers breached Luke Mitchell's human rights when they questioned him over the murder of his teenage girlfriend Jodi Jones. However, they determined he was not the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The SCCRC report made it clear that, despite Mitchell’s claims that he was innocent, there are no grounds to challenge the guilty verdict. Chief executive Gerard Sinclair wrote: 'The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has now completed its inquiries into whether or not a miscarriage of justice may have occurred in respect of Mr Luke Muir Mitchell’s conviction and sentence. The Commission has decided not to refer Mr Mitchell’s case to the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/news/crime-courts/police-breached-rights-of-mitchell-during-questioning-over-murder.24676905|title=Police breached rights of Mitchell during questioning over murder|website=HeraldScotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the decision by the SCCRC, it was announced that Mitchell would take his case to the European Courts although the competency of such a move is questionable since the ECHR has a strict six-month deadline for applications pursuant to the case being heard by the domestic court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/human-rights-appeal-for-killer-luke-mitchell-1-3468258|title=Human rights appeal for killer Luke Mitchell|website=edinburghnews.scotsman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family''' ([http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1 TC# 4.B.1]) is a family of transmembrane transporters that is part of the [[TOG superfamily]].&lt;ref name="Yee_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yee DC, Shlykov MA, Västermark A, Reddy VS, Arora S, Sun EI, Saier MH | title = The transporter-opsin-G protein-coupled receptor (TOG) superfamily | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 280 | issue = 22 | pages = 5780–800 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23981446 | pmc = 3832197 | doi = 10.1111/febs.12499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close PnuC homologues are found in a wide range of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="TCB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1#ref3139|title = 4.B.1 The Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are believed to function cooperatively with NadR homologues, multifunctional proteins that together with PnuC, participate in NR [[phosphorylation]], transport and [[transcriptional regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster JW, Park YK, Penfound T, Fenger T, Spector MP | title = Regulation of NAD metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium: molecular sequence analysis of the bifunctional nadR regulator and the nadA-pnuC operon | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 172 | issue = 8 | pages = 4187–96 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2198247 | pmc = 213241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merdanovic M, Sauer E, Reidl J | title = Coupling of NAD+ biosynthesis and nicotinamide ribosyl transport: characterization of NadR ribonucleotide kinase mutants of Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 187 | issue = 13 | pages = 4410–20 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15968050 | pmc = 1151767 | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.13.4410-4420.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penfound T, Foster JW | title = NAD-dependent DNA-binding activity of the bifunctional NadR regulator of Salmonella typhimurium | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 648–55 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9882682 | pmc = 93422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR, a cytoplasmic protein that is partly membrane associated, contains one well conserved and one poorly conserved mononucleotide-binding [[consensus sequence]] (G-X4 GKS). It drives transport and may render transport responsive to internal pyridine nucleotide levels. While its N-terminal half functions as a repressor, its C-terminal half functions as an NR kinase in a putative group translocation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell P, Moyle J | title = Group-translocation: a consequence of enzyme-catalysed group-transfer | journal = Nature | volume = 182 | issue = 4632 | pages = 372–3 | date = August 1958 | pmid = 13577842 | doi = 10.1038/182372a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PnuC of ''Haemophilus influenzae''===
The ''H. influenzae'' homologue has been shown to transport NR from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of NR by NadR is required for NR uptake. The ribonucleoside [[kinase]] (RNK) domain has both [[Walker A motif|Walker A]] and [[Walker motifs|Walker B motifs]], responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, a proposed LID domain was identified in RNK. LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding. They are responsible for coordination of three distinct conformations, an open state in the absence of substrate, a partially closed state after substrate binding, and a fully closed state when both substrates are present.

In ''H. influenzae'', NR enters the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] resynthesis pathway after [[phosphorylation]] to NMN, and subsequently, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is synthesized from NMN and ATP via an NMN adenylyl transferase activity.&lt;ref name="Kurnasov 6906–6917"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cynamon MH, Sorg TB, Patapow A | title = Utilization and metabolism of NAD by Haemophilus parainfluenzae | journal = Journal of General Microbiology | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 2789–99 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3254936 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-134-10-2789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR represents a multifunctional regulator/enzyme complex able to integrate several functions, such as enzymatic catalysis, transport, and transcriptional regulatory activities.

==Other constituents required for uptake==
The components of the ''H. influenzae'' pathway necessary for NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NMN, and NR uptake have been determined. Merdanovic et al. characterized two enzymes, an outer membrane nucleotide phosphatase, and an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotidase (NadN) located in the periplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemmer G, Reilly TJ, Schmidt-Brauns J, Zlotnik GW, Green BA, Fiske MJ, Herbert M, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Smith A, Reidl J | title = NadN and e (P4) are essential for utilization of NAD and nicotinamide mononucleotide but not nicotinamide riboside in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 183 | issue = 13 | pages = 3974–81 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11395461 | pmc = 95280 | doi = 10.1128/JB.183.13.3974-3981.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reidl J, Schlör S, Kraiss A, Schmidt-Brauns J, Kemmer G, Soleva E | title = NADP and NAD utilization in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1573–81 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10760156 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01829.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt-Brauns J, Herbert M, Kemmer G, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Reidl J | title = Is a NAD pyrophosphatase activity necessary for Haemophilus influenzae type b multiplication in the blood stream? | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 291 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–25 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11554562 | doi = 10.1078/1438-4221-00122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NMN cross the outer membrane mainly via the OmpP2 porin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen C, Maier E, Kemmer G, Blass J, Hilpert AK, Benz R, Reidl J | title = Porin OmpP2 of Haemophilus influenzae shows specificity for nicotinamide-derived nucleotide substrates | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 27 | pages = 24269–76 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12695515 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M213087200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only NR can be utilized by the PnuC transport system located in the inner membrane.&lt;ref name="Herbert_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herbert M, Sauer E, Smethurst G, Kraiss A, Hilpert AK, Reidl J | title = Nicotinamide ribosyl uptake mutants in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 5398–401 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12933892 | pmc = 187334 | doi = 10.1128/iai.71.9.5398-5401.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sauer E, Merdanovic M, Mortimer AP, Bringmann G, Reidl J | title = PnuC and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 4532–41 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15561822 | pmc = 529221 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.12.4532-4541.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pnuC'' gene product is the protein that is responsible for the main flow of the NR substrate into the cytoplasm. The study of Merdanovic et al. suggests that the RNK activity of NadR determines NR transport and is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; feedback inhibition. Therefore, NR uptake is under NadR feedback control.&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005" /&gt;

ATP, not the [[proton motive force]], appears to be required for NR uptake. Thus, the driving force for NR uptake via PnuC is NR phosphorylation by NadR. A concerted group translocation mechanism can be considered whereby NadR facilitates the dissociation of NR from PnuC by phosphorylating it to NMN, thus preventing efflux of NR.

===Transport reaction===
The proposed transport reaction catalyzed by PnuC and NadR is:&lt;ref name="TCB" /&gt;

NR (out) + ATP (in) → NMN (in) + ADP (in).

== Structure ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are [[integral membrane protein]]s, 239 and 226 amino acyl residues (aas) in length, respectively, with 7 putative [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] [[Alpha helix|α-helical segments]].

The structure of NadR has been determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SK, Kurnasov OV, Chen B, Robinson H, Grishin NV, Osterman AL, Zhang H | title = Crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae NadR protein.

PnuC has been shown to resemble SWEET porters in overall fold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaehme M, Guskov A, Slotboom DJ | title = Pnu Transporters: Ain't They SWEET? | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–118 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26692123 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2015.11.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the conclusion that these two families are members of the TOG superfamily.&lt;ref name="Yee_2013" /&gt;

He did not think his forces were now sufficient to oppose the Spanish in the open field and decided to draw them into an ambush.  The Spanish turned the tables on them drawing his army out of their ambush and destroyed it killing Paillaeco.  [[Paillamachu]] was elected to succeed him later the same year 1592.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10077">In [[medicine]], specifically in [[end-of-life care]], '''palliative sedation''' (also known as '''terminal sedation''', '''continuous deep sedation''', or '''sedation for intractable distress in the dying'''/'''of a dying patient''') is the [[palliative care|palliative]] practice of relieving distress in a [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] person in the last hours or days of a dying patient's life, usually by means of a continuous [[intravenous]] or [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] infusion of a sedative drug, or by means of a specialized [[Macy Catheter|catheter]] designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications via the [[rectal]] route.

Palliative sedation is an option of last resort for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled by any other means. It is not a form of [[euthanasia]], as the goal of palliative sedation is to control symptoms, rather than to shorten the patient's life.

According to 2009 research, 16.5% of all deaths in the United Kingdom during 2007–2008 took place after continuous deep sedation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seale C. | year = 2009 | title = End-of-life decisions in the UK involving medical practitioners | journal = Palliative Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 198–204 | doi = 10.1177/0269216308102042 | pmid=19318459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seale C | year = 2010 | title = Continuous Deep Sedation in Medical Practice: A Descriptive Study | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 44–53 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2009.06.007 | pmid = 19854611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brimelow, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8184108.stm The alternative to euthanasia?], ''[[BBC News]]'', August 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a 2009 survey of almost 4000 U.K. patients whose care had followed the [[Liverpool Care Pathway for the dying patient]] found that while 31% had received low doses of medication to control distress from agitation or restlessness, only 4% had required higher doses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/media/press-releases/Pages/National-care-of-the-dying-audit-2009.aspx National Care of the Dying Audit 2009], [[Royal College of Physicians]], September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General practice==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Palliative sedation is often initiated at the patient's request. It can also be initiated by the physician who would discuss the option with the patient and family. Palliative sedation can be used for short periods with the plan to awaken the patient after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The patient is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the patient is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some cases, palliative sedation is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the patient.

One such common example is a patient with an enlarging cancer in the throat that compresses the trachea in a patient who does not want [[intubation]] or a [[tracheostomy]], so that eventually symptom control is impossible. Instead of experiencing death by suffocation, once symptoms are intolerable some patients will request palliative sedation to ease their symptoms as death approaches.

==Drugs used==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
A typical drug is [[midazolam]], a short acting [[benzodiazepine]]. [[Opioid]]s such as [[morphine]] are not used as the primary medicine since they are not effective sedative medications compared to benzodiazepines.  However, if a patient was already on an opioid for pain relief, this is continued for pain relief while sedation is achieved.  Other medications to be considered include [[haloperidol]], [[chlorpromazine]], [[pentobarbital]], or [[propofol]].

==Discomfort==
While the intent of palliative sedation is to eliminate pain and suffering, a significant minority of patients "continue to experience pain, [[dysphoria]], or nausea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Palliative Sedation: It's Not a Panacea|journal=[[American Journal of Bioethics]]|volume=11|issue=6|pages=41–42|date=June 2011|pmid=21678216|doi=10.1080/15265161.2011.577513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition and fluids==
As patients undergoing terminal sedation are typically in the last hours or days of their lives, they are not usually eating or drinking significant amounts. There have not been any conclusive studies to demonstrate benefit to initiating artificial nutrition (TPN, tube feedings, etc.) or artificial hydration (subcutaneous or [[intravenous fluids]]). There is also a risk that IV fluids or feedings can worsen symptoms, especially respiratory secretions and pulmonary congestion. If the goal of palliative sedation is comfort, IV fluids and feedings are often not consistent with this goal.&lt;ref name="Maltoni2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Maltoni M, et al|year=2009|title=Palliative sedation therapy does not hasten death: results from a prospective multicenter study|url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/7/1163.abstract|journal=Annals of Oncology|volume=20|issue=7|pages=1163–69|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdp048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialized rectal [[Macy Catheter|catheter]] can provide an immediate way to administer small volumes of liquids for patients in the home setting when the oral route is compromised. Unlike [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] lines, which usually need to be placed in an [[inpatient]] environment,&lt;ref&gt;Plumer AL. 2007. ''Plumer's Principles and Practices of Intravenous Therapy''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the rectal [[Macy Catheter|catheter]] can be placed by a clinician, such as a [[hospice]] nurse or home health nurse, in the home. This is useful for patients who cannot swallow, including those near the end of life (an estimated 1.65 million people are in [[hospice]] care in the US each year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics_Research/2013_Facts_Figures.pdf "National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization's Facts and Figures: Hospice Care in America, 2013 Edition"], nhpco.org; accessed January 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Before initiating terminal sedation, a discussion about the risks, benefits and goals of nutrition and fluids is encouraged, and is mandatory in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Sedation vs. euthanasia==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Titrated sedation might speed death but death is considered a side effect and sedation does not equate with [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref name="Maltoni2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beller|first1=EM|last2=van Driel|first2=ML|last3=McGregor|first3=L|last4=Truong|first4=S|last5=Mitchell|first5=G|title=Palliative pharmacological sedation for terminally ill adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=January 2, 2015|volume=1|pages=CD010206|pmid=25879099|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010206.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of life sedation is only used if the patient perceives their distress to be unbearable, and there are no other means of relieving that distress. In [[palliative care]] the doses of sedatives are titrated (i.e., varied) to keep the patient comfortable without compromising respiration or hastening death. Death results from the underlying medical condition. For more information on the palliative care use of sedatives and the safe use of opioids see [[Opioids]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Patients (or their legal representatives) only have the right to refuse treatments in living wills; they cannot demand life saving treatments, or any treatments at all.{{Where?|date=July 2013}} However, once unconsciousness begins, as the patient is no longer able to decide to stop the sedation or to request food or water, the clinical team can make decisions for a patient. A Living Will, made when competent, can, under UK law, give a directive that the patient refuses 'Palliative Care' or 'Terminal Sedation', or 'any drug likely to suppress my respiration'.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Policies==
===United States===
In 2008, the [[American Medical Association]] Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs approved an ethical policy regarding the practice of palliative sedation.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin B. O'Reilly, [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/07/07/prsi0707.htm AMA meeting: AMA OKs palliative sedation for terminally ill], ''[[American Medical News]]'', July 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[American Medical Association]] (2008), Report of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs: [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/369/ceja_5a08.pdf Sedation to Unconsciousness in End-of-Life Care], ama-assn.org; accessed January 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In October 2010 Svenska Läkaresällskapets, an association of physicians in Sweden, published guidelines which allowed for palliative sedation to be administered even with the intent of the patient not to reawaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Österberg, Lina|title=Sjuka får sövas in i döden|url=http://www.dagensmedicin.se/dagenssjukskoterska/nyheter/2010/10/11/sjuka-far-sovas-in-i-doden/index.xml|work=Dagens Medicin|language=Swedish|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pattern recognition''' is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in [[data]]. Pattern recognition is closely related to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]],&lt;ref name="Bishop2006"&gt;
{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |quote=Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. |page=vii|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/998831/files/9780387310732_TOC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with applications such as [[data mining]] and [[knowledge discovery in databases]] (KDD), and is often used interchangeably with these terms. However, these are distinguished: machine learning is one approach to pattern recognition, while other approaches include hand-crafted (not learned) rules or [[heuristic]]s; and pattern recognition is one approach to artificial intelligence, while other approaches include [[symbolic artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald |last=Tveter |title =The Pattern Recognition Basis of Artificial Intelligence |year=1998 |url=http://www.dontveter.com/basisofai/basisofai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern definition of pattern recognition is:
{{quote
|The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bishop|2006|loc=p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article focuses on machine learning approaches to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition systems are in many cases trained from labeled "training" data ([[supervised learning]]), but when no labeled data are available other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns ([[unsupervised learning]]). Machine learning is the common term for supervised learning methods{{dubious|date=November 2014}} and originates from [[artificial intelligence]], whereas KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition has its origins in [[engineering]], and the term is popular in the context of [[computer vision]]: a leading computer vision conference is named [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]]. In pattern recognition, there may be a higher interest to formalize, explain and visualize the pattern, while machine learning traditionally focuses on maximizing the recognition rates. Yet, all of these domains have evolved substantially from their roots in artificial intelligence, engineering and statistics, and they've become increasingly similar by integrating developments and ideas from each other.

In [[machine learning]], pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, [[Linear discriminant analysis|discriminant analysis]] was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of ''classes'' (for example, determine whether a given email is "spam" or "non-spam"). However, pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are [[regression analysis|regression]], which assigns a [[real number|real-valued]] output to each input;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=W.R.|date=2007-02-20|title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning20072Christopher M.

Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform "most likely" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to ''[[pattern matching]]'' algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is [[regular expression]] matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s. In contrast to pattern recognition, pattern matching is not generally a type of machine learning, although pattern-matching algorithms (especially with fairly general, carefully tailored patterns) can sometimes succeed in providing similar-quality output of the sort provided by pattern-recognition algorithms.

==Overview==
Pattern recognition is generally categorized according to the type of learning procedure used to generate the output value. ''[[Supervised learning]]'' assumes that a set of ''training data'' (the ''[[training set]]'') has been provided, consisting of a set of instances that have been properly labeled by hand with the correct output. Training patterns are the goals of the training process and not to be confused with the training set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/training-pattern|title=What is a Training Pattern in Machine Learning?|last=|first=|date=|website=deepai.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A learning procedure then generates a ''model'' that attempts to meet two sometimes conflicting objectives: Perform as well as possible on the training data, and generalize as well as possible to new data (usually, this means being as simple as possible, for some technical definition of "simple", in accordance with [[Occam's Razor]], discussed below). [[Unsupervised learning]], on the other hand, assumes training data that has not been hand-labeled, and attempts to find inherent patterns in the data that can then be used to determine the correct output value for new data instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author= Carvalko, J.R., Preston K. | year=1972 |title= On Determining Optimum Simple Golay Marking Transforms for Binary Image Processing | journal= IEEE Transactions on Computers  | volume=21 | pages=1430–33  | doi = 10.1109/T-C.1972.223519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of the two that has recently been explored is [[semi-supervised learning]], which uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data (typically a small set of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data). Note that in cases of unsupervised learning, there may be no training data at all to speak of; in other words,and the data to be labeled ''is'' the training data.

Note that sometimes different terms are used to describe the corresponding supervised and unsupervised learning procedures for the same type of output. For example, the unsupervised equivalent of classification is normally known as ''[[data clustering|clustering]]'', based on the common perception of the task as involving no training data to speak of, and of grouping the input data into ''clusters'' based on some inherent [[similarity measure]] (e.g. the [[distance]] between instances, considered as vectors in a multi-dimensional [[vector space]]), rather than assigning each input instance into one of a set of pre-defined classes. Note also that in some fields, the terminology is different: For example, in [[community ecology]], the term "classification" is used to refer to what is commonly known as "clustering".

The piece of input data for which an output value is generated is formally termed an ''instance''. The instance is formally described by a [[feature vector|vector]] of ''features'', which together constitute a description of all known characteristics of the instance. (These feature vectors can be seen as defining points in an appropriate [[space (mathematics)|multidimensional space]], and methods for manipulating vectors in [[vector space]]s can be correspondingly applied to them, such as computing the [[dot product]] or the angle between two vectors.) Typically, features are either [[categorical data|categorical]] (also known as [[nominal data|nominal]], i.e., consisting of one of a set of unordered items, such as a gender of "male" or "female", or a blood type of "A", "B", "AB" or "O"), [[ordinal data|ordinal]] (consisting of one of a set of ordered items, e.g., "large", "medium" or "small"), [[integer|integer-valued]] (e.g., a count of the number of occurrences of a particular word in an email) or [[real number|real-valued]] (e.g., a measurement of blood pressure). Often, categorical and ordinal data are grouped together; likewise for integer-valued and real-valued data. Furthermore, many algorithms work only in terms of categorical data and require that real-valued or integer-valued data be ''discretized'' into groups (e.g., less than 5, between 5 and 10, or greater than 10).

===Probabilistic classifiers===
{{main article|Probabilistic classifier}}
Many common pattern recognition algorithms are ''probabilistic'' in nature, in that they use [[statistical inference]] to find the best label for a given instance. Unlike other algorithms, which simply output a "best" label, often probabilistic algorithms also output a [[probability]] of the instance being described by the given label. In addition, many probabilistic algorithms output a list of the ''N''-best labels with associated probabilities, for some value of ''N'', instead of simply a single best label. When the number of possible labels is fairly small (e.g., in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]]), ''N'' may be set so that the probability of all possible labels is output. Probabilistic algorithms have many advantages over non-probabilistic algorithms:
*They output a confidence value associated with their choice. (Note that some other algorithms may also output confidence values, but in general, only for probabilistic algorithms is this value mathematically grounded in [[probability theory]]. Non-probabilistic confidence values can in general not be given any specific meaning, and only used to compare against other confidence values output by the same algorithm.)
*Correspondingly, they can ''abstain'' when the confidence of choosing any particular output is too low.
*Because of the probabilities output, probabilistic pattern-recognition algorithms can be more effectively incorporated into larger machine-learning tasks, in a way that partially or completely avoids the problem of ''error propagation''.

===Number of important feature variables===
[[Feature selection]] algorithms attempt to directly prune out redundant or irrelevant features. A general introduction to [[feature selection]] which summarizes approaches and challenges, has been given.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Guyon Clopinet, André Elisseeff (2003). ''An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection''. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, Vol. 3, 1157-1182. [http://www-vis.lbl.gov/~romano/mlgroup/papers/guyon03a.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of feature-selection is, because of its non-monotonous character, an [[optimization problem]] where given a total of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; features the [[powerset]] consisting of all &lt;math&gt;2^n-1&lt;/math&gt; subsets of features need to be explored. The [[Branch and bound|Branch-and-Bound algorithm]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|author1=Iman Foroutan |author2=Jack Sklansky | year=1987 |

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; does reduce this complexity but is intractable for medium to large values of the number of available features &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For a large-scale comparison of feature-selection algorithms see 
.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|author1=Mineichi Kudo |author2=Jack Sklansky | year=2000 |

Techniques to transform the raw feature vectors ('''feature extraction''') are sometimes used prior to application of the pattern-matching algorithm. For example, [[feature extraction]] algorithms attempt to reduce a large-dimensionality feature vector into a smaller-dimensionality vector that is easier to work with and encodes less redundancy, using mathematical techniques such as [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). The distinction between '''feature selection''' and '''feature extraction''' is that the resulting features after feature extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original features and may not easily be interpretable, while the features left after feature selection are simply a subset of the original features.

== Problem statement (supervised version)==
Formally, the problem of [[supervised learning|supervised]] pattern recognition can be stated as follows: Given an unknown function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''ground truth'') that maps input instances &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; to output labels &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, along with training data &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \{(\boldsymbol{x}_1,y_1),\dots,(\boldsymbol{x}_n, y_n)\}&lt;/math&gt; assumed to represent accurate examples of the mapping, produce a function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; that approximates as closely as possible the correct mapping &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. (For example, if the problem is filtering spam, then &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}_i&lt;/math&gt; is some representation of an email and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is either "spam" or "non-spam"). In order for this to be a well-defined problem, "approximates as closely as possible" needs to be defined rigorously. In [[decision theory]], this is defined by specifying a [[loss function]] or cost function that assigns a specific value to "loss" resulting from producing an incorrect label. The goal then is to minimize the [[expected value|expected]] loss, with the expectation taken over the [[probability distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, neither the distribution of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; nor the ground truth function &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are known exactly, but can be computed only empirically by collecting a large number of samples of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and hand-labeling them using the correct value of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; (a time-consuming process, which is typically the limiting factor in the amount of data of this sort that can be collected). The particular loss function depends on the type of label being predicted. For example, in the case of [[classification (machine learning)|classification]], the simple [[zero-one loss function]] is often sufficient. This corresponds simply to assigning a loss of 1 to any incorrect labeling and implies that the optimal classifier minimizes the [[Bayes error rate|error rate]] on independent test data (i.e. counting up the fraction of instances that the learned function &lt;math&gt;h:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}&lt;/math&gt; labels wrongly, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of correctly classified instances). The goal of the learning procedure is then to minimize the error rate (maximize the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]]) on a "typical" test set.

For a probabilistic pattern recognizer, the problem is instead to estimate the probability of each possible output label given a particular input instance, i.e., to estimate a function of the form
:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = f\left(\boldsymbol{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[feature vector]] input is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt;, and the function ''f'' is typically parameterized by some parameters &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;For [[linear discriminant analysis]] the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; consists of the two mean vectors &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\mu_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; and the common [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[discriminative model|discriminative]] approach to the problem, ''f'' is estimated directly. In a [[generative model|generative]] approach, however, the inverse probability &lt;math&gt;p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label})&lt;/math&gt; is instead estimated and combined with the [[prior probability]] &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; using [[Bayes' rule]], as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label,\boldsymbol\theta}) p({\rm label|\boldsymbol\theta})}{\sum_{L \in \text{all labels}} p(\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\boldsymbol\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

When the labels are [[continuous distribution|continuously distributed]] (e.g., in [[regression analysis]]), the denominator involves [[integral|integration]] rather than summation:

:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{p({\boldsymbol{x}|\rm label,\boldsymbol\theta}) p({\rm label|\boldsymbol\theta})}{\int_{L \in \text{all labels}} p(\boldsymbol{x}|L) p(L|\boldsymbol\theta) \operatorname{d}L}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; is typically learned using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation. This finds the best value that simultaneously meets two conflicting objects: To perform as well as possible on the training data (smallest [[Bayes error rate|error-rate]]) and to find the simplest possible model. Essentially, this combines [[maximum likelihood]] estimation with a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] procedure that favors simpler models over more complex models. In a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] context, the regularization procedure can be viewed as placing a [[prior probability]] &lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; on different values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta^* = \arg \max_{\boldsymbol\theta} p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta^*&lt;/math&gt; is the value used for &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the subsequent evaluation procedure, and &lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D})&lt;/math&gt;, the [[posterior probability]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf{D}) = \left[\prod_{i=1}^n p(y_i|\boldsymbol{x}_i,\boldsymbol\theta) \right] p(\boldsymbol\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] approach to this problem, instead of choosing a single parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of a given label for a new instance &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}&lt;/math&gt; is computed by integrating over all possible values of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta&lt;/math&gt;, weighted according to the posterior probability:

:&lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x}) = \int p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol\theta)p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|\mathbf{D}) \operatorname{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Frequentist or Bayesian approach to pattern recognition ===
The first pattern classifier – the linear discriminant presented by [[Fisher discriminant analysis|Fisher]] – was developed in the [[Frequentist inference|frequentist]] tradition. The frequentist approach entails that the model parameters are considered unknown, but objective. The parameters are then computed (estimated) from the collected data. For the linear discriminant, these parameters are precisely the mean vectors and the [[covariance matrix]]. Also the probability of each class &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is estimated from the collected dataset. Note that the usage of '[[Bayes rule]]' in a pattern classifier does not make the classification approach Bayesian.

[[Bayesian inference|Bayesian statistics]] has its origin in Greek philosophy where a distinction was already made between the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]' and the '[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]' knowledge. Later [[A priori and a posteriori#Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined his distinction between what is a priori known – before observation – and the empirical knowledge gained from observations. In a Bayesian pattern classifier, the class probabilities &lt;math&gt;p({\rm label}|\boldsymbol\theta)&lt;/math&gt; can be chosen by the user, which are then a priori. Moreover, experience quantified as a priori parameter values can be weighted with empirical observations – using e.g., the [[Beta distribution|Beta-]] ([[Conjugate prior distribution|conjugate prior]]) and [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet-distributions]]. The Bayesian approach facilitates a seamless intermixing between expert knowledge in the form of subjective probabilities, and objective observations.

Probabilistic pattern classifiers can be used according to a frequentist or a Bayesian approach..

Within medical science, pattern recognition is the basis for [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) systems. CAD describes a procedure that supports the doctor's interpretations and findings.
Other typical applications of pattern recognition techniques are automatic [[speech recognition]], [[document classification|classification of text into several categories]] (e.g., spam/non-spam email messages), the [[handwriting recognition|automatic recognition of handwritten postal codes]] on postal envelopes, automatic [[image recognition|recognition of images]] of human faces, or handwriting image extraction from medical forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milewski|first=Robert|author2=Govindaraju, Venu|title=Binarization and cleanup of handwritten text from carbon copy medical form images|journal=Pattern Recognition|date=31 March 2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1308–1315|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2007.08.018|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last two examples form the subtopic [[image analysis]] of pattern recognition that deals with digital images as input to pattern recognition systems.&lt;ref name=duda2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard O.

[[Artificial neural networks]] (neural net classifiers) and [[deep learning]] have many real-world applications in image processing, a few examples:
* identification and authentication: e.g., [[license plate recognition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://anpr-tutorial.com/ THE AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION TUTORIAL] http://anpr-tutorial.com/&lt;/ref&gt; fingerprint analysis, [[face detection]]/verification;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/usr/mitchell/ftp/faces.html Neural Networks for Face Recognition] Companion to Chapter 4 of the textbook Machine Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;, and voice-based authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poddar|first=Arnab|author2=Sahidullah, Md |author3=Saha, Goutam|title=Speaker Verification with Short Utterances: A Review of Challenges, Trends and Opportunities|journal=IET Biometrics|date=March 2018|volume=7|issue=2|pages=91–101|doi= 10.1049/iet-bmt.2017.0065|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8302747/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* medical diagnosis: e.g., screening for cervical cancer (Papnet)&lt;ref&gt;[http://health-asia.org/papnet-for-cervical-screening/ PAPNET For Cervical Screening] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708211332/http://health-asia.org/papnet-for-cervical-screening/ |date=2012-07-08 }} {{cite web |url=http://health-asia.org/papnet-for-cervical-screening/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708211332/http://health-asia.org/papnet-for-cervical-screening/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, breast tumors or heart sounds;
* defence: various navigation and guidance systems, target recognition systems, shape recognition technology etc.

For a discussion of the aforementioned applications of neural networks in image processing, see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Egmont-Petersen, M., de Ridder, D., Handels, H. | year=2002 |

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] (making sense of and identifying objects) is closely related to perception, which explains how the sensory inputs humans receive are made meaningful. Pattern recognition can be thought of in two different ways: the first being template matching and the second being feature detection. 
A template is a pattern used to produce items of the same proportions. The template-matching hypothesis suggests that incoming stimuli are compared with templates in the long term memory. If there is a match, the stimulus is identified.
Feature detection models, such as the Pandemonium system for classifying letters (Selfridge, 1959), suggest that the stimuli are broken down into their component parts for identification. For example, a capital E has three horizontal lines and one vertical line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/attention/revise-it/pattern-recognition |title=A-level Psychology Attention Revision - Pattern recognition &amp;#124; S-cool, the revision website |publisher=S-cool.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
Algorithms for pattern recognition depend on the type of label output, on whether learning is supervised or unsupervised, and on whether the algorithm is statistical or non-statistical in nature. Statistical algorithms can further be categorized as [[generative model|generative]] or [[discriminative model|discriminative]].

[[Riyan Airport]] prison in [[Yemen]]  is a secret prison located in the cargo terminal in Riyan Airport in Yemen. The airport is a civilian one in the city of [[Mukalla]].  US special forces fighting al-Qaida are based close to this prison.  Witnesses have claimed some detainees have been handed over to the US forces for further interrogation.
According to Associated press, there are at least eighteen secret detention centers in [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Southern Yemen]]. 
According to Hussein Arab, Yemen Minister of Interior, these clandestine prisons are located in an airport, military bases and private villas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://interactives.ap.org/yemen-prison/ Inside a Yemeni prison]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shafia Family murders''' took place on June 30, 2009 in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], Ontario. Shafia sisters Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, along with Rona Amir Mohammed, 50, (all Afghan origin) were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in front of the northernmost [[Kingston Mills]] [[canal lock|lock]] of the [[Rideau Canal]] on the same day.&lt;ref name="TWS"&gt;{{cite web

The couple also had a son Hamed, 20, and three other children. Rona, who was herself infertile, was the first wife of Mohammad Shafia in their [[polygamy|polygamous]] household.

On July 23, 2009, Mohammad, Tooba Yahya, and Hamed were arrested on charges of four counts of [[First degree murder#First and second degree|first degree murder]] and conspiracy to commit murder under the guise of [[honour killing]].&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news

The trial, which took place at the [[Frontenac County Court House]], was believed to be the first in Canada conducted in four languages – English, French, [[Dari language|Dari]] and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&amp;e=3327207 Jury selection for murder trial begins next week] from [[The Kingston Whig-Standard]]. Retrieved November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial garnered media attention in Canada for several months, and raised the debate over Canadian values, [[honour crimes]], and violence among Muslim groups.

==Background==
In 1979 or 1980, Mohammad Shafia married Rona Mohammed. The couple did not have children, and medical tests confirmed that Rona was unable to have children. In keeping with Afghan custom, and at Rona's behest, Mohammad Shafia took Tooba Yahya as his second wife. The second wedding took place in 1989, and Rona features prominently in many wedding photographs, many of which feature Shafia flanked by his two wives. The three of them lived together in one household, as is customary, and Tooba gave birth to seven children. Rona participated fully in raising and caring for the children and bonded strongly with them, as though they were her own. Her relationship with her co-wife was, however, less idyllic.

The Shafia family left [[Afghanistan]] in 1992. They moved to Australia for a brief while, and then to the [[United Arab Emirates]], where they lived for over a decade. Mohammad Shafia made a considerable fortune in [[Dubai]], working in the used car business and later diversifying into real estate.&lt;ref name="macleans1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/tag/shafia-trial/ |title=shafia trial – Topics |publisher=Macleans.ca |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, he was a millionaire many times over, and decided to take advantage of an immigration programme introduced by the government of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]], which offered permanent residence and eventual citizenship to people who invested significant money in the province. Shafia invested $2 million in purchasing a strip-mall on the outskirts of [[Montreal]], and a further $200,000 in building a spacious new house for his family. Shafia, his second wife Tooba and their seven children immigrated to Canada and settled in the [[St. Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Léonard]] [[Boroughs of Montreal|borough]] of [[Montreal]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="TNP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Picture of troubled family emerges |work=National Post |location=Canada |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=1826842&amp;p=2 |date=July 25, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Five months later, Shafia sponsored the immigration of Rona, telling the authorities that she was his cousin and that she would work as a cook and housekeeper.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tripp |first=Rob |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Shafia+trial+told+abuse+violence+against+woman/5784534/story.html |title=Shafia trial told of abuse, violence against woman |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/01/09/dimanno_accused_mother_testifies_at_shafia_murder_trial.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/Accused+says+heart+often+bleeds+cries+only+once+stand/5970215/story.html?id=5970215{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a family member's interview, Rona was trapped in an abusive, loveless marriage, trying in vain to convince her husband to grant her a divorce. Rona's siblings claimed that she feared for her life during the days leading up to her death.&lt;ref name="CBC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oldest canal victim feared for her life: siblings |publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2009/07/24/montreal-canal-deaths-rona-mohammed-siblings.html?ref=rss |date=July 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727132811/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2009/07/24/montreal-canal-deaths-rona-mohammed-siblings.html?ref=rss |archivedate=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooba, the second wife, allegedly said to Rona “You are a slave, you are a servant.”  Reportedly, the Shafias held all of Rona’s identity documents, including her passport, so Rona believed she could not flee to another country, where she had relatives.
&lt;ref name="montrealgazette1"/&gt; It was reported that Rona came to Canada as a domestic servant on a visitor's visa and the "[visa's] renewal held over her head like an axe ready to fall" by her husband and co-wife.

They also stated that the family's eldest daughter Zainab's relationship with a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] boy was a source of much anger for her father, and they claimed to have overheard the father's threats to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Allison|title=Shafia sisters complained about violence at home months before their deaths|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/home-life-improving-woman-allegedly-killed-family-court-160133520.html|publisher=The Canadian Press via Yahoo news|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With parents Mohammad Shafia and Tooba Mohammad Yahya, and eldest son Hamed Shafia all in custody during the trial, the remaining Shafia children (two girls and a boy) were being cared for under social services.&lt;ref name="macleans1"/&gt;

==Investigation==
On June 30, 2009, a black [[Nissan Sentra]] with a broken left [[taillight]] was spotted submerged at the [[Kingston Mills]] locks, with four female bodies found inside. Mohammad Shafia was at the [[Kingston Police]] station to report that four of their family – three teenage daughters and a purported aunt – were missing.&lt;ref name=chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of events in the Shafia murders|accessdate=January 30, 2012|url=http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20120129/shafia-trial-choronology-120129/20120129/?hub=MontrealHome|date=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police initially believed that it was a tragic, if bizarre, accident, and first categorized it as a "sudden death investigation".

However, authorities soon learned that Hamed had reported an accident with the family [[Lexus]] SUV in an empty parking lot early that same morning in [[Montreal]]. Despite their suspicions, the authorities did not have "reasonable and probable grounds" or sufficient evidence to ask a judge for a [[search warrant]]. Kingston Police Det. Steve Koopman, the liaison with the Shafia family, managed to gain the Shafias' [[consent]] so that they could view the Lexus. After assessing the damage on both vehicles, police theorized that the Lexus was used to ram the Nissan into the locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/business/fp/yourmoney/Blatchford+Meet+Nice+detective+Shafia+trust/5769418/story.html |title=Blatchford: Meet Mr. Nice Cop – the detective who won the Shafia clan's trust |work=Vancouver Sun |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231110850/http://www.vancouversun.com/business/fp/yourmoney/Blatchford+Meet+Nice+detective+Shafia+trust/5769418/story.html |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdict===
On January 29, 2012, the jury completed its deliberation after 15 hours and reached a verdict of guilty, four counts of first degree murder for each of the three defendants. First degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without a possibility of parole for 25 years.&lt;ref name="verdict"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/01/29/shafia-sunday.html |title=Shafia jury finds all guilty |date=January 29, 2012 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage of the Shafia murder trial==

The coverage of the Shafia murder trial was widespread, often being on the front page of newspapers and the top story in TV newscasts. Since the case involved Afghan Canadians, questions arose as to whether or not it was correct, or even appropriate, to call the murders [[honour killing]] or simply [[domestic violence]]. While the judge who deliberated on the case referred to the act simply as murder, the media chose a different course when it called the murder "honour killing". Across media outlets, the murder was framed as such. A [[publication ban]] placed on the case prevented the media from naming the three children that are still alive, with Hamed being the fourth.

===CBC===

[[CBC News]] covered the trials from day 1 and went a step further by publishing its audience's comments to show how Canadians feel about the case and its details. The CBC stated that the story  garnered many comments from the viewers but that they decided to publish a select few. Furthermore, the CBC did a "summary" of the comments and said that people generally "agreed with the verdict, applauding the court and the jury for its decision after the three-month trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/01/community-reaction-to-the-shafia-trial-verdict.html |title=Community reaction to the Shafia trial verdict |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404231106/http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/01/community-reaction-to-the-shafia-trial-verdict.html |archivedate=April 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CTV===

[[CTV News]] published a piece saying that the trial has cast a shadow over Canada's Islamic community, further tarnishing an image that has not yet recovered from the events of 9/11. But like other media outlets, CTV has asked the Muslim community to clarify their stance on the issue of honour killing.
“Muslims across the country, however, say the revelations in a Kingston, Ont., courtroom have shone a light on problematic aspects of their culture and illuminated new ways to tackle the issues.”&lt;ref name="Media Coverage of the Trials"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20120130/mtl_shafia_community_120130/20120130/|title=Shafia murder trial casts shadow over Canada's Islamic community |date=January 30, 2012 |publisher=CTV News |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CTV also published a timeline of not just the events that took place in Canada but also going back all the way to the Shafia family’s days in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120129/shafia-trial-choronology-120129/#ixzz1rD50C0Tn |title=Chronology of events in the Shafia murders |date=January 29, 2012 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402112159/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120129/shafia-trial-choronology-120129#ixzz1rD50C0Tn |archivedate=April 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ottawa Citizen''===

Pascale Fournier, writing for ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', said that there was a greater tragedy in the failure of the state to intervene before the murders occurred, and that vulnerable groups from immigrant communities need the most protection but rarely get it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fournier|first=Pascale|title=Media coverage of Shafia case sometimes fuelled prejudices|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Shafia+trial+only+beginning/6075736/story.html|publisher=Guelph Mercury|accessdate=April 5, 2012|date=January 31, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Globe and Mail''===

In addition to covering every detail of the trial, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published a piece with the "ten most shocking quotes" from the Shafia trial one of which was by Crown attorney Gerard Laarhuis after the verdicts which is as follows:

“This jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family in the most troubling of circumstances. We all think of these four, wonderful women now who died needless deaths. This verdict sends a very clear message about our Canadian values and the core principles in a free and democratic society that all Canadians enjoy and even visitors to Canada enjoy.”&lt;ref name="Media Coverage of the Trials"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2012/01/29/shafia-sunday.html |title=Shafia jury finds all guilty |date=January 29, 2012 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Only part of this quotation is given by these sources. |date=October 2012}}

This was one of the most criticized quotes by Afghan Canadians, as they asserted that intolerance towards violence against women is not just a Canadian value but a universal value and Afghans like any other peoples condemn the acts of the perpetrators.

===''Montreal Gazette''===

The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' published a column in which it said that labelling the murders as honour killing is a mistake because domestic violence against women is ubiquitous and framing it into a particular category would mean distancing oneself from a crime that is all too common. The authors argue that premeditation is put forth as a core component to differentiate honour killings from other types of murders, such as crimes of convenience or crimes of passion. However, recent studies indicate that premeditation is as much a component in other cases of domestic violence and murder as it is in "honour killings."

"Calling the murders "honour killings" accomplishes two goals. First, it makes it seem as if femicide is a highly unusual event. Second, it makes it seem as if femicide is confined to specific populations within Canada and specific national cultures or religions in the world at large. But Canadian statistics prove otherwise. According to StatsCan figures, from 2000 to 2009 an average of 58 women a year were killed in this country as a result of spousal violence. In that same period, 67 children and young people aged 12 to 17 were murdered by family members. In contrast, recent estimates tell us that there have been 12 or 13 so-called honour killings in Canada in the last decade. It does not take a genius to see that comparing 12 or 13 against the hundreds of women and children who were victims of familial violence serves only to frame "honour killing" as peculiar, when in reality it is part of a larger pattern of violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Should+call+honour+killing/6075589/story.html |title=Should we call it 'honour killing'? |date=January 31, 2012 |publisher=Montreal Gazette |accessdate=April 5, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Maclean's''===
''[[Maclean's]]'' referred to the four murders as “honouricide”. Writer [[Michael Friscolanti]] sat throughout the three-month trial and wrote a 22-page comprehensive article detailing the girls’ lives and even wrote about how one of the girls’ tombstones has the incorrect birthdate.

“In life, and in death, they had no voice. No one to save them. No one who even cares enough to fix Geeti's headstone. Nearly three years after she was buried, it is still engraved with Sahar's birth-date, not hers."&lt;ref name="macleans1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2012}}

==Reaction==
The widespread media coverage pressured the Muslim as well as the Afghan community in Canada to come out and speak about the murders.

===Muslims in Canada===
It has also given rise to the debate about the relationship of honour killing and Islam. Islamic organizations based in Canada condemned the murders. The [[Islamic Supreme Council of Canada]], along with other Canadian Muslim organizations, have publicly denounced [[domestic violence]] and [[honour killing]] as un-Islamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2011/12/09/toronto-islam-domestic-violence.html|title=Muslim leaders decry domestic violence|publisher=CBC |location=Canada |accessdate=December 10, 2011|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Falih Altaie, the family imam, said that the murders were unforgivable, and cautioned against associating honour crimes with Islam, calling the actions incompatible with any religion.&lt;ref name=ctv&gt;{{cite news|title=Shafia deaths unforgivable, says family imam|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120131/shafia-deaths-family-imam-120131/|accessdate=January 31, 2012|newspaper=The Canadian Press via CTV|date=January 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201214018/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120131/shafia-deaths-family-imam-120131/|archivedate=February 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2011-2012/thehouseofshafia/ |title=The House of Shafia |work=CBC News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212093317/http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2011-2012/thehouseofshafia/ |archivedate=February 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 imams from across Canada and the U.S. issued a moral ruling officially condemning honour killings, domestic violence and misogyny as un-Islamic. Thirty-four imams belonging to the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, including a handful of American members, signed the fatwa in an effort to counter misinterpretations of the Qur'an, they said.

===Afghan Canadians===

The Afghan Embassy in Ottawa in an interview with CTVS News condemned the murders of four members of a Montreal family originally from Afghanistan. The embassy called the deaths of the three teenaged sisters and their father's first wife a heinous crime against humanity. Moreover, they claimed that this kind of crime is not part of Afghan or Islamic culture and is not acceptable in any way.&lt;ref name="Reaction from the Afghan community in Canada"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120131/hamed-shafia-120131/ |title=Afghan Embassy speaks out against Shafia murders |date=January 31, 2012 |publisher=CTV News |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304230951/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120131/hamed-shafia-120131 |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taddeo Alderotti''' ([[Latin]]: '''Thaddaeus Alderottus''', [[French language|French]] : '''Thaddée de Florence'''), born in [[Florence (Italy)|Florence]]  between 1206 and 1215, died in 1295, was an Italian doctor and professor of medicine at the [[University of Bologna]], who made important contributions to the renaissance of learned medicine in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]]. He was among the first to organize a medical lecture at the university.

As an alchemist, he is credited with developing [[fractional distillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Alchemy |last= Holmyard |first= Eric John |year=1990 |publisher= Courier Dover Publications|page= 53|isbn= 0-486-26298-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante]] seems to reference him in the [[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]] (XII, 82-85), indicating he pursued learning not for spiritual reasons but worldly ambition, contrasting him with [[St. Dominic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= A History of Medicine Vol. 5 |last= Prioreschi |first= Plinio |year=2003 |publisher= Horatius Press|page= 348|isbn= 1-888456-00-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Taddeo Alderotti was born in [[Florence]], 1210, and received his primary education there.&lt;ref name=Glick&gt;Thomas F. Glick, Steven Livesey, and Faith Wallis, ''Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1260s, Alderotti went to Bologna, a city known for the study and practice of medicine. Through the middle of the fourteenth century, the universities of Bologna, [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]], and [[University of Paris|Paris]] had a virtual monopoly on medical education in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name=jacquart&gt;Danielle Jacquart, "La scolastique médicale," in ''Histoire de la pensée médicale en Occident, vol. 1: Antiquité et Moyen Âge'', edited by Mirko D. Grmek (Seuil, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; As a professor of medicine, Alderotti quickly gained a reputation as an excellent teacher and commanded large crowds of students. His courses relied on the works of [[Hippocrates]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]], which had been given a position of authority since [[Constantine the African]] brought these over from north Africa in the 11th century and translated them.

The students Alderotti taught during his tenure as professor would become some of the best doctors and professors of the next generation. They included, among others, the logician [[Gentile da Cingoli]]; the papal doctor [[Bartolomeo da Varignana]]; [[Dino del Garbo]], commentator of [[Avicenna]]; [[Turisanus]] (Pietro Torregiano de' Torregiani), commentator of Galen; and the anatomist [[Mondino de' Liuzzi]].

A doctor of high repute, Taddeo had a large number of patients, including some far outside Bologna and residing as far away as [[Modena]], [[Ferrara]], [[Rome]], and [[Milan]]. In his old age, he gave up his lectures and he moved his medical practice to Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Plinio Prioreschi, ''Medieval Medicine'' (Horatius Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to a modest Florentine family, Taddeo was by the time of his death in 1295 a rich man. His last will and testament indicates that his medical practice, his lecture, and his investments had paid off handsomely.

'''Terminal lucidity''' refers to an unexpected return of mental clarity and memory that occurs in the time shortly before death in patients suffering from severe [[Mental disorder|psychiatric]] or [[Neurological disorder|neurological disorders]]. This phenomenon has been noted in patients with [[schizophrenia]], [[Neoplasm|tumors]], [[stroke]]s, [[meningitis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.archger.2011.06.031 |pmid=21764150 |title=Terminal lucidity: A review and a case collection |journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=138–42 |year=2012 |last1=Nahm |first1=Michael |last2=Greyson |first2=Bruce |last3=Kelly |first3=Emily Williams |last4=Haraldsson |first4=Erlendur }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Illustration for 'The Dead' in The Year's at the Spring.jpg|thumb|"Honour has come back, as a king, to earth," illustration by [[Harry Clarke]] in ''The Year's at the Spring'', 1920.]]
'''The Dead''' is the name of two poems by [[Rupert Brooke]], parts III and IV of his collection ''[[1914 (poems)|1914]]''.

== 1914 ==
Brooke wrote the five poems that were published in 1914 in the autumn after the outbreak of the [[First World War]] when he enlisted in the [[Royal Naval Division]]. Also in this collection is '[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]]', one of Brooke's most famous poems, though 'The Dead' (IV) was one of his personal favourites. The poems were published in New Numbers before being published in 1914. Brooke published five poems for this collection: I: 'Peace', II: 'Safety', III: 'The Dead', IV: 'The Dead', V: 'The Soldier'.

==III: The Dead==

''Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!''&lt;br /&gt;
''There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,''&lt;br /&gt;
''But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.''&lt;br /&gt;
''These laid the world away; poured out the red''&lt;br /&gt;
''Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be''&lt;br /&gt;
''Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,''&lt;br /&gt;
''That men call age; and those who would have been.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Their sons, they gave, their immortality.''

''Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And paid his subjects with a royal wage;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And Nobleness walks in our ways again;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And we have come into our heritage.''

==IV: The Dead==

''These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And sunset, and the colours of the earth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''These had seen movement, and heard music; known''&lt;br /&gt;
''Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.''

''There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter''&lt;br /&gt;
''And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance''&lt;br /&gt;
''And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white''&lt;br /&gt;
''Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,''&lt;br /&gt;
''A width, a shining peace, under the night.''

==Usage==

'''''The Egoist''''' (subtitled ''An Individualist Review'') was a London [[literary magazine]] published from 1914 to 1919, during which time it published important early [[modernist]] poetry and fiction. In its manifesto, it claimed to "recognise no taboos,"&lt;ref&gt;Caws 340.&lt;/ref&gt; and published a number of controversial works, such as parts of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is considered "England's most important Modernist periodical."&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''The Egoist'' was founded by [[Dora Marsden]] as a successor to her feminist magazine ''[[The New Freewoman]]'', but was changed, under the influence of [[Ezra Pound]], into a literary magazine. Pound got his benefactor [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]] to buy him an editorial position in the magazine, and quickly it became a leading publication for [[Imagism|imagist]] poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Benstock 364-65.&lt;/ref&gt; Its group of friends and contributors includes almost every writer of significance of the time, though some, like [[D. H. Lawrence]] (whose "Once" was published in the magazine in 1914), came to denounce it for "editorial sloppiness" and for the philosophical attitudes of its editorial staff.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke 148-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the work published in ''The Egoist'' is the work of [[James Joyce]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], as well as letters and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Such as Eliot's response to a charge in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', see Longenbach 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsden was the editor in the first half of 1914, when it was a fortnightly; for most of its life it was a monthly. Editorship was taken over in July 1914 by [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant editors were [[Richard Aldington]] and Leonard A. Compton-Rickett, with [[H. D.]] When Aldington left in 1917 for the Army, his place was taken by [[T. S. Eliot]],&lt;ref&gt;Matherer 49.&lt;/ref&gt; who was also working on ''Prufrock and other Observations'' at the time (published as a small book by ''The Egoist'').&lt;ref&gt;Eliot xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; When it folded in 1919, there were only 400 subscribers, down from 2,000 in 1911 when it was ''[[The Freewoman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable contributions==
*[[T. S. Eliot]], "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]," vol. 6, nos. 4 &amp; 5 (September &amp; December 1919).
*[[James Joyce]], ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', starting in 1914;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson xliii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenna 6.&lt;/ref&gt; three-and-a-half sections of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1919)&lt;ref&gt;McKenna 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wyndham Lewis]], ''[[Tarr]]'', April 1916 – November 1917.
*[[Charlotte Mew]], "Fête," May 1914&lt;ref&gt;Bertram 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">A '''torture museum''' is a [[museum]] that exhibits instruments of [[torture]] and provides tutorials on the history of torture and its use in human society. Several museums dedicated to the history of torture are located in [[Europe]].

==Torture museums==
Examples of the torture museums in Europe include: 
* Museo della Tortura di Siena in [[Siena]], [[Italy]]; 
* the [[Torture Museum, Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; 
* Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments,  Amsterdam, Netherlands;
* the [[Torture Museum Oude Steen]] in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]]; 
* the [[Rüdesheim am Rhein#Museums|Mediaeval Torture Museum]] (''Mittelalterliches Foltermuseum'') in [[Rüdesheim am Rhein]], Germany; 
* the Medieval Crime Museum (''das Kriminalmuseum'') in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber#Museums|Rothenburg ob der Tauber]], [[Germany]]; 
* the Medieval Criminal and Torture Museum (''Museo della Tortura e di Criminologia Medievale'') in [[San Gimignano]], [[Italy]];
* the Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. 
* and the Tortureum - Museum of Torture in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]

The Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments was opened in 2012. It uses human size wax figures to increase the interactive learning of what the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] considered to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com|title=Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments Amsterdam|work=Torture Museum Amsterdam|accessdate=9 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TrematodesFig8 EncBrit1911.png|thumb|Life-history stages of the trematode flatworm ''Fasciola hepatica'' from 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]
[[Trematodes]] are any parasitic [[flatworm]] of the class ''Trematoda'', especially a parasitic fluke. While consisting of two suckers, one being [[ventral]] and one being oral. They have a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]] covering which helps them with absorption and protection from the environment. 

The life cycle of a typical trematode begins when the egg is immersed in water or from the adult worms in the definitive host. Some trematode eggs hatch in water, others are eaten by the first intermediate host and hatch within that host, so there are many different routes that a trematode could take to infect a host. Following this, the miracidium, which is free-swimming ciliated larva that a parasite moves from the egg to host stage, hatches which then also goes to find the mollusc host as the first intermediate host. This is where either a rediae or sporocyst will form depending on the host and if there is competition between the two. This eventually forms into a motile cercariae. The cercariae then either infects vertebrates through the skin of a host or is ingested and aims to locate the second intermediate host. When in the vertebrate host, the cercariae can then form into an adult, metacercariae or mesocercariae, depending on the life cycle, or is rejected through feces or urine. Then the metacercariae and second intermediate host has to be ingested by the definitive host for the life cycle to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(02)02262-6 |pmid=11998706 |title=Trematode life cycles: Short is sweet? |journal=Trends in Parasitology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=176–83 |year=2002 |last1=Poulin |first1=Robert |last2=Cribb |first2=Thomas H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the details vary with each [[species]], the general life cycle stages are:
===Egg===
Found in either feces, sputum or in the urine. Depending on the species it will either be unembryonated (immature) or embryonated (ready to hatch), while all are operculated besides schistosomes. Some eggs are eaten by the host (snail) or hatch in the environment first when coming into contact with water.

===Miracidium (plural miracidia)===
These hatch from the eggs and switches to locate the host. They do not have a mouth therefore cannot eat and need to find the host quickly in order to survive because they have a limited amount of energy, which will then develop into the mother sporocyst. Its main function is to infect the first intermediate host, which can differ for different trematodes.&lt;ref&gt;Galaktionov, K. V., &amp; Dobrovolʹskiĭ, A. A. (2003). The biology and evolution of trematodes: An essay on the biology, morphology, life cycles, transmission, and evolution of digenetic trematodes. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporocyst===
Elongated sac that produces either more sporocyst or rediae. This is where larva can be to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Bernard, and Thaddeus K. Graczyk. Echinostomes as Experimental Models for Biological Research. Springer, 2011.{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mother Sporocyst'': They have loose plates (cilia) and migrate to gonas.  
*''Daughter Sporocyst'': They are an asexual production of cercariae, they absorb nutrients while having no mouth.

===Redia (plural rediae)===
After the sporocyst form the larva, the first development from it forms the redia. &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Bernard, and Thaddeus K. Graczyk. Echinostomes as Experimental Models for Biological Research. Springer, 2011.{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a mouth which allows them to have an advantage to their competitors because they can just consume them. Will either produce more rediae or start to form cercariae. The amount of rediae or daughter sporocyst varies a lot in the representatives of different deign taxa. &lt;ref&gt;Galaktionov, K. V., &amp; Dobrovolʹskiĭ, A. A. (2003). The biology and evolution of trematodes: An essay on the biology, morphology, life cycles, transmission, and evolution of digenetic trematodes. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parasite Competition in Snail Hosts====
Co-infections of different parasite species within the same post could occur and cause a competition between the rediae and sporocysts. Not all trematode species have a rediae stage, some may just have a sporocyst stage depending on the life cycle. The rediae are dominant to sporocyst because they have a "mouth" and are able to either eat their competitors' food or their competitor.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===Cercaria (plural cercariae)===
The larval form of the parasite, it develops within the germinal cells of the sporocyst or redia.&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/parasit06/website/glossary.htm|title=Glossary|work=VPTH 603 Veterinary Parasitology|publisher=University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cercaria has a tapering head with large penetration glands.&lt;ref name=schistosoma/&gt; It may or may not have a long swimming "tail", depending on the species.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; The motile cercaria finds and settles in a host where it will become either an adult, or a mesocercaria, or a metacercaria, according to species.

*Mesocercaria: They are involved in an encysted stage either on vegetation or in a host tissue on the second intermediate host. They have a hard shell and are also involved in the trophic transmission. This is where the parasite is able to infect the definitive host because it consumes the second intermediate host that has metacercariae on/in it.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

*Metacercaria: A cercaria [[cyst|encysted]] and resting.They are only involved when there are 3 intermediate host life cycles.

''Cercaria'' is also used as a genus of trematodes, when adult forms are not known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=728666 ''Cercaria''] at WoRMS&lt;/ref&gt; The usage dates back to Müller, in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Vermium terrestrium et fluviatilium seu animalium infusoriorum, helminthicorum et testaceorum, non marinorum, succincta historia. OF Müller, 1773&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult===
The fully developed mature stage, it is capable of sexual reproduction.

==Deviations from the typical life cycle==
Not all trematodes follow the typical sequence of eggs, miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae, and adults. In some species, the redial stage is omitted, and sporocysts produce cercariae. In some species, the cercaria develops into an adult within the same host.

Many digenean trematodes require two hosts, one (typically a snail) where asexual reproduction occurs in sporocysts, the other a vertebrate (typically a fish) where the adult form engages in sexual reproduction to produce eggs. In some species (for example ''[[Ribeiroia]]'') the cercaria [[encyst]]s, and waits until the host is eaten by a third host, in whose gut it emerges and develops into an adult.

Most trematodes are [[hermaphroditic]], but members of the family [[Schistosomatidae]] are [[dioecious]]. Males are shorter and stouter than the females.&lt;ref name=schistosoma&gt;{{cite web|title=Schistosoma|url=http://parasite.org.au/para-site/text/schistosoma-text.html|publisher=Australian Society for Parasitology|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2622">'''William Hogan''' (July 17, 1792 &amp;ndash; November 25, 1874) was a [[United States Representative]] from [[New York (state)|New York]].  He was born in the parish of St. Paul's Convent Garden, [[London, England]], on July 17, 1792.  His father, [[Michael Hogan (shipowner)|Michael Hogan]], was an Irish merchant and shipowner, who sailed with his family between Britain, South Africa, India, China and Australia.  Hogan's mother was Frances Richardson Hogan, the illegitimate daughter of William Richardson, a merchant who based in Bombay who Michael Hogan worked with and Anna Lacy, Richardson's housekeeper who was of at least partial native Indian descent. In 1803, Hogan senior and his family settled in [[New York City]].

Hogan pursued classical studies and graduated from [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1811.  He served in the [[War of 1812]] and fought in the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]].  He studied law, was admitted to the bar but did not engage in practice.

He served as a member of the [[New York State Assembly]], was county judge of [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]], and was elected as a [[Jacksonian Party (United States)|Jacksonian]] to the Twenty-second Congress (March 4, 1831 – March 3, 1833).  Hogan was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1832 to the Twenty-third Congress.  He was appointed examiner of claims on March 30, 1855, and subsequently became a translator in the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], serving until October 8, 1869.  He died in [[Washington, D.C.]] on November 25, 1874, with interment in [[Trinity Church Cemetery]], New York City.

'''Yi Ui-bang''' ({{lang|ko|이의방}}, 1121 - December 1174) was a military ruler of [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] period.

== Life ==
===Background===
Yi originated from the Jeonju Yi clan (전주이씨; 全州李氏). He subsequently joined the military and rose in ranks, becoming a minister in the scholar dominated government.

===Rebellion===
In August 1170 ([[Uijong of Goryeo|Uijong]] 24th year), he joined the Goryeo warrior rebellion, which occurred in defiance against the typically scholar/minister ruled Korea. Primary leaders of this rebellion was [[Jeong Jung-bu]] and [[Yi Go]] who found that warrior-class treatment was truly unfair and planned a coup e tat to establish a warrior government.

The [[King of Goryeo]], [[Uijong of Goryeo|Uijong]] was soon disposed and the new warrior-class ministers set up a puppet king [[Myeongjong of Goryeo|Myeongjong]]. Yi was named as one of the key figures in the new regime with the title of High Merit Minister (壁上功臣) and given special privileges along with the other ministers. When Yi Go tried to plot a coup and get hold of a dictatorship in 1171, Yi, under the orders of Chung Jung-bu purged and murdered Yi Go.

===Governance===
With Jeong, Yi increased the size and power of the military and attracted military-class administrators to the regime and appointed these men to national offices which were previously reserved for scholar-class ministers. In 1173, when a scholar-class minister Kim Bo-dang (김보당 金甫當) attempted to restore disposed king Uijong to the throne, Yi decisively slew the former king, preventing any further restoration attempts. With this merit, he was further promoted to Commander of Land Troops.

During his co-governance with Jeong, Yi also faced a series of Buddhist Monk uprisings from different shrines around the nation. As Goryeo was officially a Buddhist nation since [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wangkon]]'s unification of Korea, the Buddhists had great influence upon the government and most Goryeo kings appointed official Buddhist Great Monk advisors to assist in national administration. Due to the increasing Buddhist uprisings, Yi himself commanded his forces to put down these rebellions and raid Buddhist shrines. With his powerful forces, he swept the nation and raided and pillaged these shrines. 

At this time, [[Jo Wi-chong]] (조위총, 趙位寵), a general of the North-Western border attempted to start a rebellion. Yi responded by murdering favorers of this rebellion such as [[Yun In-mi]] (윤인미, 尹仁美), who was of [[Pyongyang|Seogyung]] birth. Due to this action, Yi lost support and favors from the people, and when he attempted to put down this rebellion, he failed.

===Downfall and death===
Yi, attempting to put down Jeong and gain more power, tried to appoint his daughter as Royal [[Prince consort]], an action which did not fulfill objective but instead further endangered Yi's political situation. Due to this action, the 2nd Jo Invasion force, led by Jeong Jung-bu's son Jeong Gyun subsequently murdered Yi Ui-Bang and his supporters and removed his daughter from the royal family. However, soon enough, Jeong Jung-bu was also murdered and the young and righteous dictator [[Gyeong Dae-seung]] took power.

==Legacy==
General Yi Ui-bang's main legacy remains in the balance that was achieved through the purging of scholars during his co-governance with Jeong. Before the arrival of Yi, the scholar class had more influence in the government to the extent that the warrior-class was greatly mistreated. With the changing of kings and shifting of power from scholar-class to warrior-class, Goryeo faced a new era. A final and very important legacy is his connection with the founder of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], [[Yi Songgye]]. Yi Ui-Bang's younger brother Yi In was a 6th generation ancestor of Yi Songgye, thus connecting Yi Ui-Bang and Yi Songgye together.
