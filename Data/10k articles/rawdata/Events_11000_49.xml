The year '''587 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 167 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 587 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. 

==Events==
* The [[Babylonia]]ns capture Jerusalem, ending the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. The [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] of [[Jerusalem]] is destroyed and some of the inhabitants are exiled. An alternate date of [[586 BC]] has also been proposed for this event.

'''ADAC Formel Masters''' was an [[ADAC]] sanctioned [[open wheel racing]] series based in Germany, held annually from 2008 to 2014. It was replacement of the local [[Formula BMW]] championship. The first season was in 2008 and is the main feeder series to the ATS Formula 3 Cup ([[German Formula Three Championship]]). Like [[Formula Ford]], [[French F4 Championship]] and [[Formula Abarth]], the Formel Masters is aimed at [[karting]] graduates. In 2015 it was replaced by the [[ADAC Formula 4]].

==Race weekend==
A race weekend features one 45-minute practice session on Friday, and one 30-minute qualifying session on the same day, followed by three races. The qualifying session is a straight fight for the fastest laptime, and determines the order of the grids for Races 1 &amp; 2.

Race 3 is on Sunday. The grid is decided by the Race 2 result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.

Each races longs for 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adac-formel-masters.de/docs/adac-formel-masters/static/90/ADAC%20Formel%20Masters%20Reglement%202014%20sportlich%2017_12_2013%20schw.pdf|title=Reglement  2014|date=28 October 2013|work=ADAC Formel Masters|publisher=[[ADAC]]|language=German|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''Amazing Azerbaijan!'' pulls back the glittery facade that this [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|oil-rich]] nation presented to the world when hosting Eurovision 2012, telling personal stories of [[Human rights in Azerbaijan|human rights]] abuses to which Europe’s leaders have turned a blind eye.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2013/01/30-jan-amazing-azerbaijan-a-film-screening-and-discussion/&lt;/ref&gt; The film looks at [[Azerbaijan]] in the run-up to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012 Eurovision Song Contest]], which took place in [[Baku]]. It features interviews with Eurovision contestants and aspiring contestants, politicians, [[human rights activists]], [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], and members of the public, and contrasts the image the government presents to the outside world with first-person accounts of torture, arrest, and abuse by the government.

== Production ==
The film is directed by Liz Mermin, produced by Aisling Ahmed, edited by Herbert Hunger, and features music by James Burrell. It was broadcast across Europe during the week of Eurovision 2012. It is distributed by DR Sales Denmark &lt;ref&gt;https://www.drsales.dk/programmes/amazing-azerbaijan/&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a Bertha (now Doc Society) outreach [[Grant (money)|grant]],&lt;ref&gt;https://docsociety.org/films/display/amazing-azerbaijan/&lt;/ref&gt; at which point it was lengthened to include an interview with the 2012 Eurovision song-contest winner [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]].&lt;ref name="DR DK" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Soundtrack&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazing Azerbaijan!|url=http://ringostrack.com/en/movie/amazing-azerbaijan/61789|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Badon''' ({{lang-la|obsessio[nis] Badonici montis}}, "Blockade/siege of the Badonic Hill", ''Bellum in monte Badonis'', "Battle on Badon Hill", ''Bellum Badonis'', "Battle of Badon"; [[Old Welsh]]: ''Badon'', [[Middle Welsh]]: ''Gweith Vadon'', "Battle of Badon", {{lang-cy|Brwydr Mynydd Baddon}}, "Battle of Badon Mount/Hill") was a battle thought to have occurred between [[Celtic Britons]] and [[Anglo-Saxons]] in the late [[5th century in England|5th]] or early [[6th century in England|6th century]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Ashe, Geoffrey, ''From Caesar to Arthur'' pp.295-8&lt;/ref&gt; It was credited as a major victory for the Britons, stopping the encroachment of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms for a period.

It is chiefly known today for the supposed involvement of [[King Arthur]], a tradition that first clearly appeared in the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. Because of the limited number of sources, there is no certainty about the date, location, or details of the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, R. Ernest &amp; al. ''The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History From 3500 B.C. to the Present'', 4th ed., p. 193. HarperCollins Pub. (New York), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, C. Warren. ''The Making of England to 1399'', 8th ed., p. 31. Houghton Mifflin Co. (New York), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
===Siege of Mount Badon===
The earliest mention of the Battle of Badon is [[Gildas]]' ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'' ("On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain"), written in the early to mid-6th century. In it, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are said to have "dipped [their] red and savage tongue in the western ocean" before [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] organized a British resistance with the survivors of the initial Saxon onslaught. Gildas describes the period that followed Ambrosius' initial success:
{{quote|From that time, the citizens were sometimes victorious, sometimes the enemy, in order that the Lord, according to His wont, might try in this nation the Israel of to-day, whether it loves Him or not. This continued up to the year of the siege of Badon Hill (''obsessionis Badonici montis''), and of almost the last great slaughter inflicted upon the rascally crew. And this commences, a fact I know, as the forty-fourth year, with one month now elapsed; it is also the year of my birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Williams (historian)|Hugh Williams]] (ed.), ''Gildas, De Excidio Britanniae'', Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, 1899, p. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Ruin of Britain'' describes the battle as such an "unexpected recovery of the [island]" that it caused kings, nobles, priests, and commoners to "live orderly according to their several vocations" before the long peace degenerated into civil wars and the iniquity of [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]]. Passages of ''The Ruin of Britain'' that address Maelgwn directly are sometimes employed to date the work from accounts of the king's death by plague in the 540s, but such arguments ignore the obvious [[apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] employed in the passages and the possible years of composition involved in the final collected sermon.

The battle is next mentioned in an 8th-century text of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The "[[Tiberius Bede]]" or C text. Cotton Tiberius MS. C.II. {{la-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the "siege of Mount Badon, when they made no small slaughter of those invaders," as occurring 44 years after the first [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede. ''The [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', I.xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. ''...usque ad annum obsessionis Badonici montis quando non minimas eisdem hostibus strages dabant quadragesimo circiter &amp; quarto anno adventus eorum in Britaniam.''&lt;/ref&gt; Since Bede places that arrival during or just after the joint reign of [[Marcian]] and [[Valentinian III]] in 449{{ndash}}456,&lt;ref&gt;Per Bede's account. The actual dates were somewhat different.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bede, I.xv.&lt;/ref&gt; he must have considered Badon to have taken place between 493 and 500. Bede then puts off discussion of the battle {{ndash}} "But more of this hereafter" {{ndash}} only to seemingly never return to it. Bede does later include an extended account of [[Germanus of Auxerre|Saint Germanus of Auxerre]]'s victory over the Saxons and [[Picts]] in a mountain valley,&lt;ref&gt;Traditionally placed at [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] in [[Flintshire]] in northeast Wales.&lt;/ref&gt; which he credits with curbing the threat of invasion for a generation.&lt;ref name=b20&gt;Bede, I.xx.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the victory is described as having been accomplished bloodlessly, it was presumably a different occasion from Badon. Accepted at face value, St. Germanus's involvement would also place the battle around 430, although Bede's chronology shows no knowledge of this.

===Battle of Badon===
{{anchor|Arthur}}{{see also|Historicity of King Arthur}}

The earliest surviving text mentioning [[King Arthur|Arthur]] at the battle is the early 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The "[[s:Nennius (DNB00)|Nennius]]" entry of the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] credits an 11th-century Irish edition by Giolla Coemgin with being the oldest extant edition of the ''Historia Brittonum'', but it apparently only survived in a 14th-century copy. Cf. Todd, James. ''[https://archive.org/stream/irishversionofhi00toddrich#page/n9/mode/2up Irish version of the Historia Britonum of Nennius]''. Irish Archaeological Soc. (Dublin), 1848. Accessed 6 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the soldier (Latin ''mīles'') Arthur is identified as the leader of the victorious British force at Badon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The twelfth battle was on Mount Badon in which there fell in one day 960 men from one charge by Arthur; and no one struck them down except Arthur himself".&lt;ref&gt;L. ''Duodecimum fuit bellum in monte Badonis, in quo corruerunt in uno die nongenti sexaginta viri de uno impetu Arthur; et nemo prostravit eos nisi ipse solus.'' Mommsen, Theodore (ed.) ''[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/histbrit.html Historia Brittonum]''. Accessed 7 Feb 2013. {{la-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HBeng&gt;Lupack, Alan (Trans.)

The Battle of Badon is next mentioned in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' ("Annals of Wales"),&lt;ref name=ACA/&gt; assumed to have been written during the mid- to late-10th century. The entry states: 
{{quote|The Battle of Badon, in which Arthur carried the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ for three days and three nights upon his shoulders [or shield&lt;ref&gt;The words for "shoulder" and "shield" being easily confused in [[Old Welsh]]: ''scuit'' (shield) vs. ''scuid'' (shoulder)]. Cf. Jones, W. Lewis. ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/1202.html Vol. I, XII, §2.] Putnam, 1921. Accessed 30 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;] and the Britons were the victors".&lt;ref&gt;L. ''Bellum badonis inquo arthur portauit crucem domini nostri ihu xp'i . tribus diebus &amp; tribus noctibus inhumeros suos &amp; brittones uictores fuerunt.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACAeng/&gt;}}

That Arthur had gone unmentioned in the source closest to his own time, Gildas, was noticed at least as early as the 12th-century hagiography that claims that Gildas had praised Arthur extensively but then excised him completely after Arthur killed the saint's brother, [[Hueil mab Caw]]. Modern writers have suggested the details of the battle were so well known that Gildas could have expected his audience to be familiar with them.&lt;ref name=Green31&gt;Green, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s c. 1136 ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' was massively popular and survives in many copies from soon after its composition.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest two being the Cambridge 1706 II.I.14 and Berne Stadtbibliotek MS 568, both apparently from the year of composition. Cf. Griscom, Acton. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gsQ-nT2taacC&amp;pg=PA22 The Historia Regum Britanniae of Geoffrey of Monmouth]''. Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., 1929. Accessed 7 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Going into (and fabricating) much greater detail, Geoffrey closely identifies Badon with [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], including having [[Merlin]] foretell that Badon's baths would lose their hot water and turn poisonous.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson. VII.iii.&lt;/ref&gt; He employs aspects of other accounts, mixing them: the battle begins as a Saxon siege and then becomes a normal engagement once Arthur's men arrive; Arthur bears the image of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Virgin]] both on his shield and shoulder. Arthur charges, but kills a mere 470, ten more than the number of Britons ambushed by [[Hengist and Horsa|Hengist]] near Salisbury. Elements of the Welsh legends are also added: in addition to the shield ''Pridwen'', Arthur gains his sword ''[[Excalibur|Caliburnus]]'' and his spear, ''[[Excalibur#Arthur's other weapons|Ron]]''. Geoffrey also makes the defence of the city from the Saxon sneak attack a holy cause, having [[Dubricius]] offer absolution of all sins for those who fall in battle.&lt;ref name=HRBeng&gt;Thompson, Aaron &amp; al.

==Scholarship==
McCarthy and Ó Cróinín propose Gildas's 44 years and one month is not a reference to the simple chronology but a position within the 84-year Easter cycle used for [[computus]] at the time by the Britons and the [[Christianity in Ireland|Irish church]].

Hirst, Ashe and Wood argue for the site of [[Liddington Castle]] on the hill above [[Badbury, Wiltshire|Badbury]] ([[Old English]]: ''Baddan byrig'') in [[Wiltshire]].

The '''Battle of Inab''', also called '''Battle of Ard al-Hâtim''' or '''Fons Muratus''', was fought on 29 June 1149, during the [[Second Crusade]]. The Zengid army of Atabeg [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] destroyed the combined army of Prince [[Raymond of Antioch]] and the [[Hashshashin]] of Ali ibn-Wafa. The [[Principality of Antioch]] was subsequently pillaged and reduced in size as its eastern border was pushed west.

==Background==
After the death of Nur ad-Din's father [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] in 1146, Raymond of Antioch invaded the vulnerable province of [[Aleppo]] (part of the [[Seljuq Empire]]), which was threatened by hostile powers on all sides. After establishing his own authority in Aleppo and successfully defending Edessa in 1147, Nur ad-Din invaded Antioch in late 1148 and besieged [[Afamiya]]. Raymond beat him off and captured his baggage train.&lt;ref name="Mallett, p 55"&gt;Mallett, p 55&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned a few months later to attack [[Yaghra]], Raymond, at the head of a small force, forced him to retire to Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Mallett, p 55"/&gt;

In June 1149, Nur ad-Din invaded Antioch and besieged the fortress of [[Inab]], with aid from [[Unur of Damascus]] and a force of [[Oghuz Turks|Turcoman]]s. Nur ad-Din had about 6,000 troops, mostly cavalry, at his disposal. Raymond and his Christian neighbor, Count [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], had been enemies since Raymond had refused to send a relief army to Edessa in 1146. Joscelin even made a treaty of alliance with Nur ad-Din against Raymond. For their part, [[Raymond II of Tripoli]] and the regent, [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] refused to aid the Prince of Antioch. Feeling confident because he had twice defeated Nur ad-Din previously, Prince Raymond struck out on his own with an army of 400 knights and 1,000 foot soldiers.&lt;ref name="Oldenbourg, p 336"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallett, p 55"/&gt;

==Battle==
Prince Raymond allied himself with Ali ibn-Wafa, leader of the [[Hashshashin]] and an enemy of Nur ad-Din. Before he had collected all his available forces, Raymond and his ally mounted a relief expedition. Amazed at the weakness of Prince Raymond's army, the [[atabeg]] at first suspected that it was only an advance guard and that the main Frankish army must be lurking nearby.&lt;ref name="Oldenbourg, p 337"&gt;Oldenbourg, p 337&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the approach of the combined force, Nur ad-Din raised the siege of Inab and withdrew. Rather than staying close to the stronghold, Raymond and ibn-Wafa camped with their forces in open country. After Nur ad-Din's scouts noted that the allies camped in an exposed location and did not receive reinforcements, the atabeg swiftly surrounded the enemy camp during the night.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 183&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June, Nur ad-Din attacked and destroyed the army of Antioch. Presented with an opportunity to escape, the Prince of Antioch refused to abandon his soldiers. Raymond was a man of "immense stature" and fought back, "cutting down all who came near him".&lt;ref name="Oldenbourg, p 337"/&gt; Nevertheless, both Raymond and ibn-Wafa were killed, along with [[Reynald of Marash]]. A few Franks escaped the disaster. Much of the territory of Antioch was now open to Nur ad-Din, the most important of which was a route to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Nur ad-Din rode out to the coast and bathed in the sea as a symbol of his conquest. {{cn|date=June 2018}}

The contemporary historian [[William of Tyre]] blamed the Antiochenes' defeat on Raymond's rashness.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett, p 49&lt;/ref&gt; One modern historian says the Crusader defeat at Inab was "as disastrous at that of the [[Battle of Ager Sanguinis|Ager Sanguinis]]"&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 33&lt;/ref&gt; a generation earlier. Yet another remarks that it "was not part of a watershed moment, and should not be seen in the context of the Second Crusade".&lt;ref&gt;Mallett, p 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[Image:RecoveryOfRaymondOfPoitiersBody.jpg|thumb|left|Recovery of Raymond's body after the battle]]

After his victory, Nur ad-Din went on to capture the fortresses of [[Artah]], [[Harem, Syria|Harim]] and ‘Imm, which defended the approach to [[Antioch]] itself. Harim was not recovered until 1157, then lost permanently in 1164. He sent the main party of his army to besiege [[Afamiya]].&lt;ref name="Mallett, pp 48–49"&gt;Mallett, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; After plundering the region, he besieged Antioch, which was virtually defenceless because of the loss of its prince and its army. The city was divided between a surrender party and a resistance party. The former, led by Raymond's widow, [[Constance of Antioch|Constance]], and the [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch]], [[Aimery of Limoges]], prevailed, and Nur ad-Din was bought off, with some of the treasure coming from the Patriarch's own possessions. A small force was left behind to prevent reinforcements from entering the city, while Nur ad-Din went down to the sea to bathe in it&lt;!--a second time, or should the previous mention be removed?--&gt; as a sign of victory. He plundered the lands around [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites|Saint Simeon's Monastery]] and then rejoined his forces to capture Afamiya.&lt;ref name="Mallett, pp 48–49"/&gt;

Upon receiving news that King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] was marching north with some [[Templars]] to relieve the siege, Nur ad-Din opened negotiations. The border between Antioch and Aleppo was re-drawn to Nur ad-Din's gain and the armies went home.&lt;ref name="Mallett, pp 48–49"/&gt; Joscelin now found that his enemy Raymond's defeat and death placed his own possessions in extreme peril. Joscelin would soon be captured by Nur ad-Din (1150) and what remained of his County of Edessa was evacuated by its Latin inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Oldenbourg, p 337"/&gt;

After the victory at Inab, Nur ad-Din became a hero throughout the Islamic world. His goal became the destruction of the [[Crusader states]], and the strengthening of Islam through ''[[jihad]]''; he had already set up religious schools and new mosques in Aleppo, and expelled those he considered heretics from his territory, especially [[Shiite]]s. ''Jihad'' was influenced by the presence of the Christian Crusader states as it could be used as an excuse for maintenance of a permanent state of war. Nur ad-Din went on to capture the remnants of the County of Edessa, and brought Damascus under his rule in 1154, further weakening the Crusader states.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

In the early 1980s  the '''British Air Racing Championship''' was developed with the reformation of the [[Royal Aero Club]] Competition Committee into the [http://www.royalaeroclubrrra.co.uk/ Royal Aero Club Records Racing and Rally Association], allocating points according to position in the field at the finish of each air race, accumulating throughout a racing season.

==History==
As soon as aircraft developed to the stage that they would stay airborne for predictable amounts of time, pilots started to pit their skills and aircraft against each other both personally and on a national and international basis. The earliest air races attracted an international audience and large cash prizes were offered for the winners.  Perhaps the epitome of this would be the  [[Schneider Trophy]].
As aircraft became more diverse, handicapping was adopted in Britain to level the playing field. The first handicapped race was held in 1922, sponsored by [[King George V]]—the [[King's Cup Race|King’s Cup]].  In 1931 the rules were re-written to allow amateur pilots to compete in standard production aircraft. Those rules still apply today, with some minor modifications and the King’s Cup remains the only air race to receive royal patronage.

Handicapped air racing was a British phenomenon, although latterly the concept has been used to stage air races worldwide.

==Racing season==

A typical handicapped air racing season comprises some eight venues and 16 races. The maximum points available for a win in each race is 100 on a sliding scale.

The winner of this cumulative championship is known as the British Air Racing Champion and the trophy associated with it is the Jubilee Trophy. This silver cup was originally presented in 1952. The runner-up is awarded the Brian McBride Trophy, a silver bowl on a wooden [[plinth]].

The '''Brussels Agreement''' ({{lang-al|Marrëveshja e Brukselit}}; {{lang-sr|Бриселски споразум|translit=Briselski sporazum}}) was made between the governments of [[Government of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Government of Kosovo|Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} on the normalization of their relations.&lt;ref&gt;As to the agreement not having been signed, see text of agreement.&lt;/ref&gt; It was negotiated and concluded, although not signed by either party, in [[Brussels]] under the auspices of the [[European Union]]. The negotiations were led by Serbian [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] [[Ivica Dačić]] and Kosovo [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]] [[Hashim Thaçi]], and mediated by [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|EU High Representative]] [[Catherine Ashton]]. The agreement was concluded on 19 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/19/us-serbia-kosovo-eu-idUSBRE93I0IB20130419|title=EU brokers historic Kosovo deal, door opens to Serbia accession|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[Kosovo War]] and [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Yugoslavia, was placed under [[UNMIK|United Nations administration]] under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UNSC Resolution 1244]]. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognized]] by 111 countries.

==Talks==
So far ten rounds of talks were held at the [[European External Action Service]] office in Brussels. [[Baroness Ashton]], the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighbouring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialling a [[Stabilisation and Association Process|Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)]]. The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015. One of the most difficult problems still is removing the parallel Serbian structures in the Northern part of Kosovo until full sovereignty.  

U.S. diplomats supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning.  [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]] (as well as [[Sarajevo]]) in October 2012.  Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador [[Philip T. Reeker|Philip Reeker]] to support Ashton's efforts.  Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues, and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region.
 
The result was a 15-point "First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo-Serbia Agreement: Why Less Is More|url=http://www.crisisgroupblogs.org/across-eurasia/2013/05/07/the-kosovo-serbia-agreement-why-less-is-more/|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the agreement was concluded, the [[European Commission]] officially advised that work start on an SAA with Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbia and Kosovo reach landmark deal|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2013/190413__eu-facilitated_dialogue_en.htm|publisher=European Union External Action Service|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Accession of Serbia to the European Union|accession negotiations]] began with Serbia. The agreement was supported by the European Union, [[NATO]], the [[OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ban welcomes ‘landmark’ agreement between Serbia and Kosovo negotiators|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44708&amp;Cr=kosovo&amp;Cr1#.Um8DpPk5kZw|publisher=UN News Centre|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement==

With just 2 pages, the agreement has 15 very short paragraphs. Paragraphs 1 to 6 concern the establishment, scope and functions of a proposed "Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo". Paragraphs 7 to 9 concern police and security structures and include that there shall be one police force for all of Kosovo including its northern parts to be called "Kosovo Police". Paragraph 11 provides that municipal elections shall be held in all of Kosovo under Kosovo law. Paragraph 12 provides for the creation of an implementation plan and specifies a date (since lapsed) by which the plan would be concluded. Paragraph 13 contains an undertaking to intensify discussions on energy and telecoms. Paragraph 14 provides that "neither side will block, or encourage others to block, the other side's progress in their respective EU paths". Paragraph 15 envisages the establishment of an implementation committee with the facilitation of the EU.   

Politically, the document is intended to agree the integration of the Serb-majority municipalities in Northern Kosovo into the Kosovo legal system, while providing certain guarantees.  The guarantees are that:
- all judicial matters are under the law of Kosovo, but Kosovo Serbs must be a majority of certain judicial panels, and a panel (Mitrovica District Court) must sit in [[Northern Mitrovica]];
-all policing is to be done by the [[Kosovo Police]], but the Police Regional Commander for the Serb-majority areas must be a Kosovo Serb, chosen from a list provided by Kosovo Serb municipalities.&lt;ref name="agreement text"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rts.rs/upload/storyBoxFileData/2013/04/20/3224318/Originalni%20tekst%20Predloga%20sporazuma.pdf | title=First agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations | publisher=rts.rs | accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis Group Less is More"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/2013/05/07/the-kosovo-serbia-agreement-why-less-is-more/ | title=The Kosovo-Serbia Agreement: Why Less Is More | publisher=Crisis Group | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full text==
#There will be an Association/Community of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo. Membership will be open to any other municipalities provided the members are in agreement. 
#The Community/Association will be created by statute. Its dissolution shall only take place by a decision of the participating municipalities. Legal guarantees will be provided by applicable law and constitutional law (including 2/3 majority rule). 
#The structures of the Association/Community will be established on the same basis as the existing statute of the Association of Kosovo municipalities e.g. President, vice President, Assembly, Council. 
#In accordance with the competences given by the European Charter of Local Self Government and Kosovo law the participating municipalities shall be entitled to cooperate in exercising their powers through the Community/Association collectively. The Association/Community will have full overview of the areas of economic development, education, health, urban and rural planning. 
#The Association/Community will exercise other additional competences as may be delegated by the central authorities.
#The Community/Association shall have a representative role to the central authorities and will have a seat in the communities consultative council for this purpose. In the pursuit of this rile a monitoring function is envisaged. 
#There shall be one police force in Kosovo called Kosovo Police. All police in northern Kosovo shall be integrated in the Kosovo Police framework. Salaries will be only from the KP.
#Members of other Serbian security structures will be offered a place in equivalent Kosovo structures. 
#There shall be a Police Regional Commander for the four northern Serb majority municipalities (Northern Mitrovica, Zvecan, Zubin Potok, and Leposavic). The Commander of this region shall be a Kosovo Serb nominated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs from a list provided by the four mayors on behalf of the Community/Association. The composition of the KP in the north will reflect the ethnic composition of the population in the four municipalities. (There will be another Regional Commander for the municipalities of Mitrovica South, Srbica and Vucitrn). The regional commander of the four municipalities will cooperate with other regional commanders. 
#The judicial authorities will be integrated and operate within the Kosovo legal framework. The Appellate Court in Pristina will establish a panel composed of a majority of K/S judges to deal with all Kosovo Serb majority municipalities. A division of the Appellate Court, composed both by administrative staff and judges, will sit permanently in northern Mitrovica (Mitrovica District Court). Each panel of the above division will be composed by a majority of K/S judges. Appropriate judges will sit dependent on the nature of the case involved. 
#Municipal elections shall be organized in the northern municipalities in 2013 with the facilitation of the OSCE in accordance with Kosovo law and international standards. 
#An implementation plan including time frame shall be produced by April 26. In implementing this agreement the principle of transparent funding will be addressed. 
#Discussions on Energy and Telecoms will be intensified by the two sides and completed by June 15. 
#It is agreed that neither side will block, or encourage others to block, the other side's  progress in their respective EU paths. 
#An implementation committee will be established by the two sides, with the facilitation of the EU.

==Later talks==
After the Brussels Agreement, meetings are held regularly to bring about implementation of the provisions in different areas. In February 2015 a Justice agreement was concluded, followed by agreements on energy and telecom operators. On Aug. 25, 2015, an agreement was reached for the establishment of the Association of Serbian Comunitiers, the core of the Brussels Agreement. The statutes have yet to be drafted. 

There were also concerns about how the [[Kosovan local elections, 2013|2013 local government elections in Kosovo]] would be administered; the government of Serbia objected to any mention of "the state of Kosovo" on ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbia and Kosovo hold talks in Brussels|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/08/27/serbia-and-kosovo-hold-talks-in-brussels/|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Euronews|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Serbia agreed that it should encourage Serbs in [[North Kosovo|northern Kosovo]] to get involved in these local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbian PM claims Kosovo breaches Brussels agreement: media|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-10/05/c_132772853.htm|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Xinhua|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, arrangements were made for Serbian officials to visit North Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Belgrade, Pristina overcome dispute ahead of Kosovo local polls|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/serbia-kosovo.qs4/|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=EUbusiness|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was agreed that electoral bodies in Kosovo would include Kosovo Serb representatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brussels Deal: Serbian Officials Free To Enter Kosovo|url=http://inserbia.info/news/2013/10/brussels-deal-serbian-officials-free-to-enter-kosovo/|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=inSerbia|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[List of country calling codes|international dialing code]] [[+383]] would be attributed to Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serbia allocated calling code to Kosovo|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=87597|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=B92|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new code was expected to go into effect in late 2015 but has again been delayed by Serbia until  March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini following the meeting of the EU-facilitated dialogue|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/statements-eeas/2015/150825_02_en.htm|publisher=EEAS - European Union|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Telephone numbering plan|geographic phone code]] was implemented in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/383-kosovo-s-dial-code-12-15-2016|title=Kosovo Hails Receipt of Own Telephone Code|author=|date=|website=balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Some scholars, including [[Smilja Avramov]] and [[Elena Guskova]], stated that the Brussels Agreement violates the [[Constitution of Serbia]] and the [[United Nations Charter]] and represents an indirect recognition of the independence of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Смиља Аврамов: Споразум Београда и Приштине индиректно признање самопроглашеног Косова|url=http://www.novinar.de/2013/04/20/smilja-avramov-sporazum-beograda-i-pristine-indirektno-priznanje-samoproglasenog-kosova.html|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=Novinar Online|agency=SRNA|quote=Српски експерт за међународно право Смиља Аврамов оцијенила је да споразум између Београда и Приштине представља индиректно признање самопроглашеног Косова и поручила да је њиме погажена Повеља УН која Србији гарантује територијални интегритет....Јелена Гускова: Споразум Београда и Приштине је уговор о признању независности Косова}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assembly of Kosovo]] has ratified the agreement, accepting it into a law, and treating it as an "international agreement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuvendikosoves.org/common/docs/ligjet/Zakon%20o%20ratifikaciji%20sporazuma%20normalizacija%20odnosa%20Kosova%20-%20Serbije.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Assembly (Serbia)|National Assembly of Serbia]] has not treated the agreement as international, and has not ratified it into a binding law, which is a procedure required for international agreements in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlament.gov.rs/upload/archive/files/lat/pdf/zakoni/2013/299-13Lat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has, however, merely accepted the government report about the "hitherto process of political and technical dialog with the temporary institutions in Pristina with the mediation of EU, including the process of implementation of the achieved agreements".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlament.gov.rs/upload/archive/files/lat/pdf/ostala_akta/2013/RS21-13Lat.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutional court in Belgrade, did not answer the question about constitutionality of the agreement, stating in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=936315|title="Briselski sporazum je politički" - B92.net|work=B92.net|access-date=2017-03-20|language=sr-Latn-RS}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the issue raised is a political question, and not a legal one.

Serbia has accepted, however, that progress in implementing the Brussels agreement is a prerequisite for EU accession talks within the opening of Chapter 35 negotiations in December 2015.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

:''Not to be confused with a different [[Central Music Hall (Steinway Hall)|Central Music Hall]] in Chicago''

'''Central Music Hall''' (1879&amp;ndash;1900) was a mixed-use commercial building and theater in Chicago, situated on the southeast corner of State and Randolph Streets. It was designed by celebrated German-born American architect [[Dankmar Adler]]. It was the first important building designed by the famous architect, in which he made initial use of his knowledge of acoustics. The building was demolished in 1900, around the same time Adler died, in order to build the [[Marshall Field &amp; Company]] store, now [[Macy's, Inc.|Macy's]].

==History==

The idea for Central Music Hall was conceived by [[George B. Carpenter]], a local promoter of concerts and lectures.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Carpenter was a member of Reverend [[David Swing]]'s popular nondenominational [[Central Church]], and he imagined a building to be named in its honor that would provide a home for the church and also feature a concert hall, stores, and offices.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Construction began in the Spring of 1879 and the auditorium (not yet fully complete) opened on December 5, immediately becoming the city's premier auditorium.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; It was the first significant music hall to be built following the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.&lt;ref name=shou&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shou |first1=Anthony |last2= |first2= |date=Spring 2001 |title=Dankmar Adler's Acoustics |journal=The Temple Observer |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=2 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://starofdavidfoundation.org/newsletters/nl3/nl3.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed-use building included a theater, six stories of office space and street-level storefronts.&lt;ref name=lmd&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Ebenezer_Missionary_Baptist_Church.pdf Landmark Designation Report: Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church], Final Landmark Recommendation adopted by the [https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Chicago_Landmark_Address_List_September2018.pdf Commission on Chicago Landmarks], landmarks designated as of June 6, 2018, City of Chicago. Pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater became nationally known for its excellent acoustics.&lt;ref name=lmd/&gt; Prior to Central Music Hall's design, Carpenter had researched acoustics through the works of Scottish engineer [[John Scott Russell]] who had studied how sound travels in large interiors.&lt;ref name=lmd/&gt; Carpenter gave his findings to Adler who used the knowledge in the hall's design by slanting the audience floor upward away from the stage, thus eliminating obstruction between the stage and audience.&lt;ref name=lmd/&gt; He also aligned projecting ceiling beams in the direction of the stage so that sound would be directed off the ceiling.&lt;ref name=lmd/&gt; Adler would refine these features in later auditorium designs,&lt;ref name=lmd/&gt; including most famously the [[Auditorium Theater]] completed in 1890.&lt;ref name=shou/&gt;

Adler said Central Music Hall "has proved in many respects one of the most successful buildings ever erected in Chicago, and I shall always consider it the foundation of whatever professional standing I acquire."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Norman D. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=A Tale of Two Columns |journal=Chicago Jewish History |volume= |issue=Summer 2011 |pages=8–9 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://chicagojewishhistory.org/pdf/2011/CJH.3.2011_web.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 1901,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Last of Central Music Hall: Wreckers Will Attack the Building at Close of Special Entertainment This Evening |work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]] |author= |date=April 30, 1901}} Pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; the building was demolished to make way for the main store of [[Marshall Field &amp; Company]], now Macy's, which still occupies the site.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Adler died around the same time, in 1900, and a tall, reddish granite column (visible in [[:File:Central Music Hall - front picture.jpg|picture]], main right side entrance) from the State Street entrance was preserved and placed at Adler's grave at [[Mount Mayriv Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; The second column was also saved and now marks the grave of Edwin Walker (1833-1910) at [[Rosehill Cemetery]], however it was heavily modified and doesn't look like the original Adler-designed column.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt; Walker was a friend of Adler, the two often ate dinner together, and he was a stone quarry contractor who probably had provided the granite for the columns when Central Music Hall was built.&lt;ref name=schwartz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6937">The '''Colossal Baroque''' style is a name which has been coined to describe a number of compositions from the 17th and 18th centuries composed in an opulent, magnificent and large-scaled style.  Such works frequently make use of [[polychoral]] techniques and often feature instrumental forces considerably larger than the norm for the Baroque period.  The Colossal Baroque had its roots in Italy, in the resplendent multiple polychoral music of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], in the sumptuous, extravagant productions of the Medici court, for example the 40- and 60-voice ''[[Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno]]'' by [[Alessandro Striggio]], and in the large polychoral works of the [[Roman School]], many of which were written long after the Venetian School had vanished.  An impetus for this music was the Council of Trent [Counter-Reformation].  Some attendees of the Council held the unofficial point of view that music should be subservient to text, as both exemplified as well as idealized in the choral music of Palestrina. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} Some critics held that this was not as achievable in larger choral textures.  

==Background==

Some of the roots of the Colossal Baroque style were in the opulent Florentine [[Intermedio|Intermedii]] of the 16th century, commissioned and attended by the powerful [[Medici]] family.  ''[[La Pellegrina]]'', performed for the wedding of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand de' Medici]] to the French princess, [[Christina of Lorraine|Christine of Lorraine]], in 1589, featured music for up to seven choirs, by [[Cristofano Malvezzi]] in Intermedio VI.

Yet another city that cultivated large sonorities was Rome.  Composers there were not as adventurous with harmony and rhythm as the Venetians, but they had spacious churches with elaborate interiors which demanded music to match.  Composers such as [[Orazio Benevoli]], who began his career in Rome, helped spread the style elsewhere, especially across the Brenner Pass into the Austrian lands.&lt;ref name="Dyer, Grove online"&gt;Dyer, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Austrian area, multi-part pieces were written for special occasions but not always published.  There is a long list of missing and incomplete works by [[Giovanni Valentini]], (some in 17 choirs), Priuli, Bernadi, (the mass for consecration of Salzburg Cathedral used 16 choirs), and others.  Some of Valentini's trumpet parts survive; they have few changes of note, and many rests.  It is possible that the brass may have made dovetailed mass volume answering phrases in a multichoir texture similar to the effects exploited by [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and the other composers of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]].

Pieces were typically in 12 or more parts but there is evidence that the polychoral aspects did not always involve wide spacing.  For example, in Ugolini's ''Exultate Omnes'' there are trio passages for all the sopranos, tenors and altos from each choir together. This would have been impractical if the singers were widely separated, due to the physical limitation imposed by the [[speed of sound]].  On the other hand, some pieces were very likely to have been performed with singers and players distributed widely, in venues such as Salzburg Cathedral; for maximum effect and practicality, much of this music was antiphonal or exploited echo effects.

[[Orazio Benevoli]] became confused with [[Heinrich Biber]] and [[Stefano Bernadi]] in the celebrated mixup over the authorship of the [[Missa Salisburgensis]], now assigned to Biber and provisionally dated to 1682.&lt;ref name="Dyer, Grove online"/&gt;

Works we may consider to be examples of the Colossal Baroque style were frequently ceremonial works, composed for special occasions (coronations, weddings, religious festivals, municipal functions, victory celebrations, et cetera). These works were frequently performed with unusually large musical forces. From time to time the scores of such works may have been presented to the aristocrat hosting or the subject of the event. As a result, many scores of large-scale 16th- and 17th-century works have been lost. [[Heinrich Schütz]] composed a musical setting of [[Psalm 136]], ''Danket dem Herren, denn er ist freundlich'' which included three vocal choirs, 12 cornetti and 18 trumpets.  This score is also now lost.

{{refimprove|date=October 2013}}

A '''cook-off''' is a [[cooking]] [[competition]] where the contestants each prepare dishes for judging either by a select group of judges or by the general public. Cook-offs are very popular among competitors (such as restaurants) with very similar dishes and serves as a way to decide which recipe is the best for that particular dish.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Chili cook-off ==
[[File:2008 Clarksville Chili Cook-Off.jpg|thumb|Clarksville chili cook-off in 2008]]
A '''chili cook-off''' is a social event, similar to a [[barbecue]], in which competitors prepare their own particular recipe for [[chili con carne]] and submit it for taste testing. A cook-off may be an informal gathering with the simple goal of sharing recipes and enjoying food, or it may be a large-scale event with an official panel of judges and substantial prizes for winners.

The Chili Appreciation Society International (CASI) sanctions over 550 cook-offs annually that raise over $1,000,000 for charity. Corporate CASI, which has the function of sanctioning all of these cook-offs, doing the necessary work to tabulate cookoff results, and putting on the annual Terlingua International Chili Championship, has an annual income of approximately $250,000. Out of this annual income around $60,000 goes to charity. The CASI is a [[501(c)|501(c)(3) corporation]].

The International Chili Society (ICS) organizes chili cook-offs as [[fundraiser]]s. Its annual cook-offs are on a grand scale, with regional qualifying events that attract tens of thousands of participants and a "World Championship" cook-off held in October. The ICS has raised millions of dollars for charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chilicookoff.com/History/History_Home.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820072811/http://chilicookoff.com/History/History_Home.asp |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while still awarding hundreds of thousands of dollars to winners.

As early as 1970, many communities have hosted non-ICS cook-offs, leading to a competing "World Championship" cook-off in [[Terlingua, Texas|Terlingua]], [[Texas]]. 

The UK Chilli Cook-off Association organises chilli cook-offs as throughout the UK as fundraisers, culminating in the UK grand final at the Upton Cheyney Chili Festival near Bath, UK - Winners qualify for the [[World Food Championships]] Chili Cookoff 

Notable cook-offs include(d):
* the Tustin Chili Cook Off (in Tustin, CA)- the biggest 1-Day chili cook off in the world{{cn|date=November 2018}}
* the ''[[Chilympiad]]'' in [[San Marcos, Texas]] (for men only; ended in 2002)
* the ''Hell Hath No Fury Like A Woman Scorned'' cook off in [[Luckenbach, Texas]]
* the Chili Appreciation Society International Chili Championship in Terlingua, Texas
* the Frank X. Tolbert/Wick Fowler World Chili Championships in Terlingua, Texas
* the [[Lone Star Chili Cook-off]] in New York City
* the Reunion Church Braggin' Rights Chili Cook-Off in Plainfield, Indiana

The '''Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville''' is an annual international music festival held in [[Victoriaville]], [[Quebec]] that showcases contemporary music.

The festival is known for its small scale (usually no more than 20 performances per year), as well as its emphasis on unique collaborations between musicians. Several of these collaborations have been issued on records, on the Victo record label.

Despite its location in rural Quebec, the festival has attracted several international artists every year, many of them coming back several times to play at the festival. This list includes [[John Zorn]], [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Lee Ranaldo]] of [[Sonic Youth]], [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor|Godspeed You Black Emperor]] and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]]. Frequent collaborators also includes [[René Lussier]], [[Fred Frith]] and [[Chris Cutler]] of [[Art Bears]], [[Jean Derome]], [[Cecil Taylor]] and [[Peter Brötzmann]].

[[Image:1975-07-12 Formel Super V Nr. 17 u. 13 = Kaimann, Nr. 39 Lola T 320.jpg|thumb|250px|Formula Super Vee racing at [[Nürburgring]] in 1975.]]
'''Formula Super Vee''' was a type of [[open-wheel]] motor created to act as a platform for the promotion of [[Volkswagen|VW]] products, playing much the same role in the 1970s as formulae such as [[Formula Renault]] play today.

Initially it was seen as a simple step up from [[Formula Vee]], using the same type 3 air-cooled VW engines, but in 1600cc. However it soon transformed to using the very different and more powerful fuel injected water-cooled engines from the VW Golf/Rabbit.

==History==
To assist the launch of the new formula Hopen commissioned Gene Beach, an established constructor of [[Formula Vee]] cars, to design and build the first Super Vee and put this car on display at the [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] 24 hour race. Beach was one of the first three constructors of Formula Vees, along with Autodynamics and Formcar. It is therefore appropriate that a Super Vee designed and built by Ray Caldwell’s Autodynamics concern soon joined the Beach Super Vee. This second Super Vee (the Caldwell D-10) was put on display at the New York Auto Show. Other manufacturers soon followed suit, with Formula Vee constructors such as [[Zink Cars]] joined by more mainstream firms such as [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]]. John Zeitler also built his first cars around the same time as Beach and Caldwell. As a matter of fact, John Zeitler won the very first Super Vee race at [[Lime Rock Park]] in 1970. This race was run with the [[Formula Ford]] class.

Initially the series allowed 1600cc air-cooled engines of either type 3 (as used in the VW 1500 and 1600) or type 4 (as used in the VW 411, 412 and the VW-Porsche 914/4 sports car), however at a late stage VW had a change of heart and decided that the type 4 engines would be a better option. The type 4 engine is without doubt a better engine. However, this motor was never produced in a 1600cc version so VW decided to produce a "special" 1600cc version through their industrial engines division (the 127V unit), with smaller pistons and barrels, which reduced the capacity to 1600cc.

As with any formula, Formula Super Vee progressed through a number of changes during its life. Initially, for example, the cars ran without wings and used drum brakes at the rear. Later the regulations allowed the use of 8-inch rear wheels, rear disc brakes and 34&amp;nbsp;mm exhaust valves (1973) and then rear wings (1975). Since slick tyres had yet to be introduced into racing, the cars ran with treaded racing tyres, such as the Firestone "No-DOT", but later moved onto slicks.

The original regulations specified a non-[[Hewland]] [[gearbox]] and cars ran with fixed ratio VW boxes. In Europe a company called Metso began building Hewland-like boxes which provided the ability to change ratios to suit each circuit and exploited the wording of the regulations, which had simply banned Hewland boxes rather than explicitly specifying the fixed ratio VW box. Once the cars started to use Metso boxes the regulations were changed and Hewland Gearboxes were also allowed. This change, combined with start money being offered by Hewland to drivers using its products, effectively put Metso out of business, although the company did build boxes for other formula cars such as Formula Fords.[[Image:Mark Smith Formula Super Vee Grand Prix of Cleveland 1988.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mark Smith (American racing driver)|Mark Smith]] leading [[Robbie Groff]] in a Super Vee race at the 1988 [[Grand Prix of Cleveland]].]]

Much later, engine regulations were also opened up, allowing fuel injected water-cooled engines from the Volkswagen Golf (or Rabbit as the Mk1 was known in North America). The water-cooled engines inevitably replaced the air-cooled, which were rendered uncompetitive, and many air-cooled cars were converted to accept the water-cooled engine. Some constructors, such as Lola, offered "conversion kits" which allowed the fitment of the Golf/Rabbit engine to earlier air-cooled chassis. The SCCA in the USA did allow 1700cc air-cooled engines towards the end of the air-cooled period, to remain competitive while the water-cooled cars joined the grid.

Ultimately the most developed version of Super Vee was to be found in the USA, since they continued with a Super Vee series years after the formula had died away elsewhere. Indeed, by late 70s Super Vee in the USA had become the feeder formula for Indy cars, referred to as the "Mini-Indy" series.  This series was run in conjunction with the much older VW-Bosch "Gold Cup" for Super V.  This series lasted until 1990 and, unlike the oval track USAC Mini Indy Series, was a road racing series.  Each series crowned its own champion each year. In the late 70s the [[Ron Tauranac]] designed the [[Ralt]] RT1 and RT5, based on his Formula 3 designs, had a virtual monopoly in the USA series.

==The original Formula Super Vee series specifications==
* Engine: Type 3 1600cc (actually a stroke of 69&amp;nbsp;mm and a bore of 85.5&amp;nbsp;mm for a displacement of 1582cc). Dry sump not allowed.
* Cooling: air, with external oil coolers and oil filters.
* Carburetion: free, however most used Weber 48 IDA or Solex 40P11 dual downdraft. Some use of Weber IDF and DCNF. (Note: two dual down draft carbs allowed, any manufacturer with dual port VW or aftermarket intake manifolds).
* Transmission: stock VW from the 1969 Square back/fastback series. However, gear ratios were open and almost immediately Webster and Hewland gear sets were adopted for the VW transaxle.
* Ignition: coil and distributor.
* Clutch: VW stock, with Hydraulic linkage.
* Brakes: Girling hydraulic with VW discs front, VW Drums in the rear.
* Wheels: 6" X 13" front and rear. Magnesium allowed.
* Tires: 5:00/8:30 X 13 front, Treaded (no slicks) 5:50/9/20 X 13 rear, Treaded (no slicks)
* Steering: Rack and Pinion
* Suspension: free, front and rear
* Shocks: free, front and rear
* Sway bars: free, front and rear
* Rear uprights: free (and usually proprietary by car manufacturer)
* Curb Weight: Dry, without driver, 825&amp;nbsp;lbs minimum.
* Wheelbase: free (most manufacturers were between 88" and 94")
* Track, Front/Rear: Up to 92"
* Fuel Tank Capacity: Free, but most manufacturers located the tank under and behind the driver but in front of the firewall, which pretty much limited the capacity to 6.0 gallons.
* Construction: tubular space frame, flat bottom, no wings or tabs to induce downforce.
* Body: any material, but full coverage (including engine compartment) required.

The '''Fuzz Club''' was an [[indie (music)|indie]] rock night hosted by [[University of Sheffield Union of Students]], which ran from 1999 to 2009. It claimed to be the biggest students union rock night in the UK outside [[London]]. 

The night ran weekly on Thursdays throughout termtime and hosts new bands; sometimes local, sometimes national. The club provided a variety of music from heavy rock in the ''Bleach'' room to [[indie (music)|indie]] in the main fuzz room.

Fuzz Club was part of the circuit for new bands trying to make a name for themselves. In recent years, it had hosted [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[The Long Blondes]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], [[The Zutons]], [[The Killers]], [[Bloc Party]], [[The xx]], [[La Roux]], [[Future of the Left]], [[British Sea Power]], [[65daysofstatic]], [[Ida Maria]], [[Hot Chip]], [[Florence and the Machine]] and [[The Others (band)|The Others]].

The club night ran since 1999 and initially alternated with ''Bleach'', a heavier rock night, which instead became resident in the Fuzz Club's second room - essentially part of Fuzz Club.

At the end of the academic year 2008/09, the Fuzz Club is ended, with the last night held on 11 June 2009.  The night has now been replaced with Live Wire, opening 23 September 2010.

It is a gathering of people for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 24 and 72 hours,  and some even longer.  Participants are generally made up of programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and others in game development-related fields.

Traditionally, game jams focus on video games;&lt;ref name="Localizing Game Jam"&gt;Shin, Kaneko, Matsui, Mikami, Nagaku, Nakabayashi, Ono, Yamane,and lovesplayingslender.[https://www.academia.edu/1141660/Localizing_Global_Game_Jam_Designing_Game_Development_for_Collaborative_Learning_in_the_Social_Context Localizing Global Game Jam]. Retrieved February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[board game]]s have also been the subject of game jams.&lt;ref name="Global Game Jam"&gt;[http://globalgamejam.org/faq Global Game Jam]. Retrieved February 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''game jam'' is a [[Compound (linguistics)|composition]] of the words [[game]] and [[jam session]]. A jam session describes the musical act of producing music with little to no prior preparation in an effort to develop new material or simply to practice. In the same way, game jams are events in which game developers [[prototype]] experimental ideas into playable games.&lt;ref name="Game Jam Central"&gt;Jagnow, Rob. [http://www.gamejamcentral.com/ Game Jam Central], Retrieved February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, [[video game developer]]s [[Chris Hecker]] and [[Sean Barrett (programmer)|Sean Barrett]], interested in the capability of modern hardware in [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] a large number of [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], worked with [[Doug Church]], [[Jonathan Blow]], and [[Casey Muratori]] in developing a specialized [[game engine]] capable of rendering a massive number of sprites. Hecker and Barrett invited a small group of video game developers to meet in Hecker's office in [[Oakland, California]] for the purpose of creating innovative video games using this newly built engine. Hecker and Barrett named this gathering the [[Indie Game Jam|0th Indie Game Jam]], a game design and programming event "designed to encourage experimentation and innovation in the game industry".&lt;ref name="0th Indie Game Jam"&gt;Hecker, Chris.

===Time constraint===
Game jams typically have restrictive time limits, ranging from a few hours to several days. This time constraint is meant to simulate the pressure of a deadline and to encourage creativity among ideas produced by game jam teams.&lt;ref name="Global Game Jam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Jam Central" /&gt;

===Theme===
A game jam may be centered on a theme, which all games developed within the jam must adhere to. The theme is usually announced shortly before the event begins, in order to discourage participants from planning for the event beforehand and from using previously-developed material.&lt;ref name="Game Jam Central" /&gt; In addition, themes are meant to place restrictions on developers, which encourages creativity.&lt;ref name="STL Game Jam"&gt;[http://www.stlgamejam.com/what%E2%80%99s-a-game-jam/ STL Game Jam].

[[Ludum Dare]] 24, a competitive game jam event, featured the theme of "Evolution". As stated by the Ludum Dare rules, all participants in the competition were required to create a game based on this theme. However, the rules also stated that this theme was open to interpretation, which allowed for exploration of the theme in unconventional ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview Ludum Dare 24 - Evolution].

===Technology===
The type of technology can vary depending on the type of game being developed, and among the different disciplines involved.

In a video game jam, teams are generally made up of at least a programmer and an artist.&lt;ref name="Game Jam Central" /&gt; A programmer would work in a development environment such as [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] for development in a [[.NET Framework]] application or [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] for a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based application. An artist may use tools such as [[Adobe Photoshop]] or [[Autodesk Maya]]. Other tools used by developers include videogame frameworks such as the [[Unreal Engine]], [[CryEngine]], [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]], and [[Microsoft XNA]] Framework. In the last couple of years Unity has become exponentially more popular.

The '''Grozny OMON fratricide incident''' took place on March 2, 2000, when an [[OMON]] (Russian special-purpose police) unit from [[Podolsk]], supported by paramilitary police from the [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] in armored vehicles, opened fire on a motorized column of OMON from [[Sergiyev Posad]] ([[Moscow Oblast]]), which had just arrived in [[Chechnya]] to replace them.

More than 20 were killed and more than 30 injured in [[friendly fire]] between the Russian units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=815097&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=Case Of Baysayeva V. Russia |publisher=Cmiskp.echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechen rebels, allegedly helped by the local militia, were initially blamed for the attack,&lt;ref name="rebel"/&gt; but independent journalists uncovered the facts, forcing the authorities to admit the truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-invented-ambush-by-chechens-to-hide-friendly-fire-massacre-5362498.html Russia invented ambush by Chechens to hide friendly-fire massacre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ambush==
The ''Omonovtsy'' (OMON officers) from Sergiyev Posad were travelling in a marked convoy of nine trucks, a bus, and a command car, with no protection by armored vehicles and no helicopter cover, to an Interior Ministry forces outpost in the Podgornoye area of the Staropromyslovsky city district of the Chechen capital, [[Grozny]]. Their approach had been reported, but they had not been identified, and they were suspected to be either Chechen guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the city or reinforcements for the pro-Moscow Chechen militia, which was also in conflict with the Sverdlovsk police. The Podolsk and Sverdlovsk policemen were waiting to ambush them, and when the column approached an improvised roadblock made with a wrecked bus, it suddenly and without warning came under shoot-to-kill fire, including from heavy machine guns and grenade launchers.

Of the 98 troops in the convoy, at least 22 were reported killed (including the unit's commander, Colonel Dimitry Markelov, killed in the first minutes of the attack) and 31 (or 38) were wounded. At least two members of the Podolsk unit were reported to have been killed by return fire.&lt;ref name=begins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=6294 |title=Chechen Friendly-Fire Trial Begins |publisher=Sptimes.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow officials stated at first that only 12 men had been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/features/2000/03/F.RU.000307182439.asp |title=Chechnya: Russia Provides Conflicting Reports On Casualties |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later the chief-of-staff of the Russian military in the North Caucasus said that the death toll had risen to 37.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/03/03/russia.chechnya.01/ |title=Rebel ambush leaves 37 Russians dead in Chechnya |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211121835/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/03/03/russia.chechnya.01/ |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack lasted for over an hour and was videotaped by a Russian officer.

==Official whitewash and reprisals in Chechnya==
Immediately after the incident, [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) officials reported that the convoy had been ambushed by Chechen rebels and that the other Russian forces were reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael R. Gordon |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DF1738F937A35750C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Chechens Ambush Russian Convoy Near Grozny, Killing 20 |location=Russia; Chechnya (Russia) |publisher=New York Times |date=2000-03-04 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baultdin Bakuyev, a Chechen field commander, also took responsibility, saying the attack was an act of revenge for the OMON's atrocities in Chechnya.

Dozens of local men were detained after the incident. Some were killed by Russian OMON troops during the course of the hunt for the alleged Chechen attackers; others were [[forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]]. One of the detainees, [[Shakhid Baysayev]], was videotaped. His body has never been found, but he was declared legally dead by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2007, presumed to have been killed by Russian forces while in custody.

Interior Minister [[Vladimir Rushailo]] attended the funeral of the dead troops and vowed that the rebels responsible for their deaths would be identified and "retribution dealt out accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/03/06/russia.chechnya/ Russia insists it's winning Chechnya war despite losses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211122748/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/03/06/russia.chechnya/ |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that any Interior Ministry superiors responsible would also be punished. It was soon announced that three suspected rebels alleged to have been involved in the attack had been charged with murder, and foreign journalists received supposed video footage of the attack on the convoy. However, the detained "rebels" were later discharged and the video was said to be footage of a different ambush.&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehl |first=Martin |url=http://www.tol.cz/look/TOL/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=10&amp;NrIssue=226&amp;NrSection=1&amp;NrArticle=3052 |title=Senior Russian Officers Stand Trial for Negligence in Chechnya |publisher=Tol.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal negligence trial==
In a closed trial in 2002, a court acquitted two senior Interior Ministry officers, Major-General Boris Fadeyev (former deputy head of the [[Moscow Oblast]] Interior Ministry department and head of the Moscow traffic police) and Colonel Mikhail Levchenko (former head of the command group of the Interior Ministry's force in Chechnya), of [[criminal negligence]].&lt;ref name=begins/&gt;&lt;ref name=trial/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2002/01/16/OMON.shtml |title=Friendly Fire Trial of OMON Officers Opens |publisher=Gazeta.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court instead laid blame posthumously on Colonel Markelov. Major Igor Tikhonov, ex-commander of Podolsk OMON, was excused from the proceedings on health grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2002/03/25/012.html Court Acquits OMON Officers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316174337/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2002/03/25/012.html |date=March 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/03/22/russia.grozny/index.html |title=Russian friendly-fire police cleared |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210011342/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/03/22/russia.grozny/index.html |archivedate=2008-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hollywood Daffy''''' is a 1946 [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[cartoon]], directed by an uncredited [[Friz Freleng]], written by [[Michael Maltese]], and starring [[Daffy Duck]].

==Plot==
The film begins with a pack of wolves howling in the center of Hollywood  (a pun on the greed of Hollywood executives, often called "wolves" in those days). Daffy, having travelled to [[Hollywood]], attempts to get into the "Warmer Bros." studio to see movie stars.  However, the abrasive [[Keystone Kops]]-like security guard  with a [[Joe Besser]]-like voice  will not let him pass through the gate. After unsuccessfully endeavoring to enter the studio by way of various disguises and being thrown out each time, culminating with Daffy posing as a [[film director]], but ultimately this disguise is exposed as well. Daffy finally declares that he won't leave until he literally "sees (movie) stars." The guard agrees to figuratively show him the stars, then bashes Daffy over the head and throws him out of the studio, where the dazed Daffy can see all the stars he wants...circling his head.

==Hollywood celebrities featured in the cartoon==
* Daffy says he would love to meet [[Lauren Bacall]].
* The cop allows [[Bette Davis]] and [[Johnny Weissmuller]] (swinging from a vine dressed as [[Tarzan]]) to enter the studio, because they're employees of the studio.
* When trying to enter the studio, Daffy disguises himself as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Bing Crosby]] and an Academy Award statue. When the cop questions whether Daffy is really an Oscar, Daffy dares him to ask [[H.J. Whitley]] to acknowledge this. Whitley was a real estate developer, widely considered to be the ''"father of Hollywood"''.
* When Daffy drives the cop through the studio, he passes the dressing rooms of [[Abbott and Costello]] (with the same shape as their bodies), [[Ann Sheridan]] (surrounded by several bear traps) and [[Jimmy Durante]] (whose house has the same shape as his profile, including his famous, large nose), who has a bear trap on his leg.
* [[Jack Benny]] is seen trying to get an Oscar statue by playing a [[Claw crane|gaming machine]].
* Daffy compares the cop with [[Errol Flynn]].
* When Daffy literally sees stars after being hit on the head, he claims that he recognizes [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Alexis Smith]], [[Dorothy Lamour]], [[Baby Snooks]] and [[Ann Sheridan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20872">In [[contract theory]] and [[economics]], '''information asymmetry''' deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better [[information]] than the other. This asymmetry creates an imbalance of power in transactions, which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry, a kind of [[market failure]] in the worst case. Examples of this problem are [[adverse selection]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wilson (2008). "adverse selection," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'' 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000040&amp;edition=&amp;field=keyword&amp;q=asymmetric%20information&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[moral hazard]], and [[monopolies of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;John O. Ledyard (2008). "market failure," &amp;nbsp;''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed. &amp;nbsp;[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000056&amp;q=failure&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information asymmetry extends to non-economic behavior.  [[International relations theory]] has recognized that wars may be caused by asymmetric information{{sfn|Jackson and Morelli|pp=35, 40-43}} and that "Most of the great wars of the modern era resulted from leaders miscalculating their prospects for victory".{{sfn|Ikenberry|p=128}}  There is asymmetric information between national leaders, wrote Jackson and Morelli, when there are differences "in what they know [i.e. believe] about each other's armaments, quality of military personnel and tactics, determination, geography, political climate, or even just about the relative probability of different outcomes" or where they have "incomplete information about the motivations of other agents".{{sfn|Jackson and Morelli|pp=40, 42}}

Information asymmetries are studied in the context of [[principal–agent problem]]s where they are a major cause of [[misinformation|misinforming]] and is essential in every [[communication]] process.&lt;ref&gt;Christozov D., Chukova S., Mateev P., Chapter 11. Informing Processes, Risks, Evaluation of the Risk of Misinforming, in [https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;id=3qtlYfQut1wC Foundations of Informing Science], ISI, 2009, pp. 323-356&lt;/ref&gt;  Information asymmetry is in contrast to [[perfect information]], which is a key assumption in [[neo-classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/stiglitz-lecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] was awarded  to [[George Akerlof]], [[Michael Spence]], and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] for their "analyses of markets with asymmetric information".&lt;ref name="officialpressrelease"&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2001/press.html "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2001: Information for the Public"], press release from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], [[Nobel Foundation]], ''nobelprize.org'', October 2001, accessed November 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Information asymmetry models assume that at least one party to a transaction has relevant information, whereas the other(s) do not. Some asymmetric information models can also be used in situations where at least one party can enforce, or effectively retaliate for breaches of, certain parts of an agreement, whereas the other(s) cannot.

In [[adverse selection]] models, the ignorant party lacks information while negotiating an agreed understanding of or contract to the transaction, whereas in [[moral hazard]] the ignorant party lacks information about performance of the agreed-upon transaction or lacks the ability to retaliate for a breach of the agreement.  An example of adverse selection is when people who are high-risk are more likely to buy [[insurance]] because the insurance company cannot effectively discriminate against them, usually due to lack of information about the particular individual's risk but also sometimes by force of law or other constraints. An example of moral hazard is when people are more likely to behave recklessly after becoming insured, either because the insurer cannot observe this behavior or cannot effectively retaliate against it, for example by failing to renew the insurance.

== Adverse selection ==
The classic paper on [[adverse selection]] is [[George Akerlof]]'s "[[The Market for Lemons]]" from 1970, which brought informational issues to the forefront of [[economic theory]].

It discusses two primary solutions to this problem, [[Signaling (economics)|signaling]] and [[Screening (economics)|screening]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Hörne (2008). "signalling and screening" ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000129&amp;edition=&amp;field=keyword&amp;q=asymmetric%20information&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=12 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signaling ===
[[Michael Spence]] originally proposed the idea of [[Signalling (economics)|signaling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spence |first1=Michael |title=Job Market Signaling |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |date=August 1973 |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=355 |doi=10.2307/1882010 |url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/87/3/355/1909092 |language=en |issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposed that in a situation with information asymmetry, it is possible for people to signal their type, thus believably transferring information to the other party and resolving the asymmetry.

This idea was originally studied in the context of matching in the job market.  An employer is interested in hiring a new employee who is "skilled in learning".  Of course, all prospective employees will claim to be "skilled at learning", but only they know if they really are.   This is an information asymmetry.

Spence proposes, for example, that going to college can function as a credible signal of an ability to learn.  Assuming that people who are skilled in learning can finish college more easily than people who are unskilled, then by finishing college the skilled people signal their skill to prospective employers.  No matter how much or how little they may have learned in college or what they studied, finishing functions as a signal of their capacity for learning.  However, finishing college may merely function as a signal of their ability to pay for college, it may signal the willingness of individuals to adhere to orthodox views, or it may signal a willingness to comply with authority.

===Screening===
[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] pioneered the theory of [[Screening (economics)|screening]]. In this way the underinformed party can induce the other party to reveal their information. They can provide a menu of choices in such a way that the choice depends on the private information of the other party.

Examples of situations where the seller usually has better information than the buyer are numerous but include [[used-car salespeople]], [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] brokers and loan originators, [[stockbroker]]s and [[real estate agent]]s.

Examples of situations where the buyer usually has better information than the seller include [[estate sale]]s as specified in a [[last will and testament]], [[life insurance]], or sales of old [[art]] pieces without prior professional [[assessor (property)|assessment]] of their value. This situation was first described by [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] in an article on health care in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arrow |first=Kenneth J. |year=1963 |title=Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care |periodical=American Economic Review |volume=53 |issue=5 |pages=941–973 |jstor= 1812044|doi= |publisher=American Economic Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Akerlof]] in ''[[The Market for Lemons]]'' notices that, in such a market, the average value of the [[commodity]] tends to go down, even for those of perfectly good [[Quality (business)|quality]]. Because of information asymmetry, unscrupulous sellers can "[[Forgery|spoof]]" items (like replica goods such as watches) and defraud the buyer. As a result, many people not willing to risk getting ripped off will avoid certain types of purchases, or will not spend as much for a given item. Akerlof demonstrates that it is even possible for the [[Market (economics)|market]] to decay to the point of nonexistence.

==Application in research==
Since the seminal contributions of Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz, the pervasive effects of information asymmetry in markets have been documented and studied in numerous contexts.  In particular, a substantial portion of research in the field of accounting can be framed in terms of information asymmetry, since accounting involves the transmission of an enterprise's information from those who have it to those who need it for [[decision-making]]. Likewise, financial economists apply information asymmetry in studies of differentially informed financial market participants ([[insider]]s, stock analysts, investors, etc.) or in the cost of finance for MFIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garmaise, M. &amp; G. Natividad|title=Information, the Cost of Credit, and Operational Eﬃciency: An Empirical Study of Microfinance|journal=Review of Financial Studies|date=2010|volume=23|issue=6|pages=2560-2590 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhq021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information asymmetry has also seen some use in behavioral economics.

==Information gathering==
Most models in traditional contract theory assume that asymmetric information is exogenously given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=David P.|last2=Myerson|first2=Roger B.|date=1982|title=Regulating a Monopolist with Unknown Costs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1912769|journal=Econometrica|volume=50|issue=4|pages=911–930|doi=10.2307/1912769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskin|first=Eric|last2=Riley|first2=John|date=1984|title=Monopoly with Incomplete Information|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2555674|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=171|doi=10.2307/2555674|issn=0741-6261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, some authors have also studied contract-theoretic models in which asymmetric information arises endogenously, because agents decide whether or not to gather information. Specifically, Crémer and Khalil (1992) and Crémer, Khalil, and Rochet (1998a) study an agent’s incentives to acquire private information after a principal has offered a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cremer|first=Jacques|last2=Khalil|first2=Fahad|date=1992|title=Gathering Information before Signing a Contract|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v82y1992i3p566-78.html|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=82|issue=3|pages=566–578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crémer|first=Jacques|last2=Khalil|first2=Fahad|last3=Rochet|first3=Jean-Charles|date=1998a|title=Contracts and Productive Information Gathering|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/game.1998.0651|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=25|issue=2|pages=174–193|doi=10.1006/game.1998.0651|issn=0899-8256|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a laboratory experiment, Hoppe and Schmitz (2013) have provided empirical support for the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Eva I.|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2013|title=Contracting under Incomplete Information and Social Preferences: An Experimental Study|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v80y2013i4p1516-1544.html|journal=Review of Economic Studies|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=1516–1544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several further models have been developed which study variants of this setup. For instance, when the agent has not gathered information at the outset, does it make a difference whether or not he learns the information later on, before production starts?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Eva I.|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2010|title=The costs and benefits of additional information in agency models with endogenous information structures|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2009.12.026|journal=Economics Letters|volume=107|issue=1|pages=58–62|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2009.12.026|issn=0165-1765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What happens if the information can be gathered already before a contract is offered?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crémer|first=Jacques|last2=Khalil|first2=Fahad|last3=Rochet|first3=Jean-Charles|date=1998b|title=Strategic Information Gathering before a Contract Is Offered|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/jeth.1998.2415|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=81|issue=1|pages=163–200|doi=10.1006/jeth.1998.2415|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What happens if the principal observes the agent’s decision to acquire information?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Eva I.|date=2013|title=Observability of information acquisition in agency models|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.01.015|journal=Economics Letters|volume=119|issue=1|pages=104–107|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.01.015|issn=0165-1765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the theory has been applied in several contexts such as public-private partnerships and vertical integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoppe|first=Eva I.|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2013|title=Public-private partnerships versus traditional procurement: Innovation incentives and information gathering|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1756-2171.12010|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=56–74|doi=10.1111/1756-2171.12010|issn=0741-6261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khalil|first=Fahad|last2=Kim|first2=Doyoung|last3=Shin|first3=Dongsoo|date=2006|title=Optimal Task Design: To Integrate or Separate Planning and Implementation?|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9134.2006.00107.x|journal=Journal of Economics &lt;html_ent glyph="@amp;" ascii="&amp;amp;"/&gt; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=457–478|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9134.2006.00107.x|issn=1058-6407|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sources==
Information asymmetry within societies can be created and maintained in several ways. Firstly, [[media outlet]]s, due to their ownership structure or political influences, may fail to disseminate certain viewpoints or engage in [[propaganda]] campaigns. Furthermore, an educational system relying on substantial tuition fees can generate information imbalances between the poor and the affluent. Imbalances can also be fortified by certain organizational and legal measures, such as [[document classification]] procedures or [[non-disclosure]] clauses. Exclusive information networks that are operational around the world further contribute to the asymmetry. Lastly, [[mass surveillance]] helps the political and industrial leaders to amass large volumes of information, which is typically not shared with the rest of the society.&lt;ref&gt;The tools used to create information asymmetries are described in the following article http://ssrn.com/abstract=2383166&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect of blogging ==

Blogging on financial websites provides bottom-up communication among investors, analysts, journalists, and academics, as financial blogs help prevent people in charge from withholding financial information from their company and the general public.{{Citation-needed|date=February 2018}} Compared to traditional forms of media such as newspapers and magazines, blogging provides an easy-to-access venue for information. A 2013 study by Saxton and Anker concluded that more participation on blogging sites from credible individuals reduces information asymmetry between corporate insiders, additionally reducing the risk of [[insider trading]].&lt;ref name="Saxton, G. D 2013"&gt;Saxton, G. D. and A. E. Anker (2013). "The Aggregate Effects of Decentralized Knowledge Production: Financial Bloggers and Information Asymmetries in the Stock Market." Journal of Communication 63(6): 1054-1069. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Information asymmetry and artificial intelligence ==
[[Tshilidzi Marwala]] and [[Evan Hurwitz]] in their study of the relationship between information asymmetry and artificial intelligence observed that there is less level of information asymmetry between two artificial intelligent agents than between two human agents. Thus intelligent agents in the market make the markets more efficient. They furthermore observed that the more artificial intelligent buying and selling agents there are in the market the less is the volume of trades in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marwala |first1= Tshilidzi| last2=Hurwitz |first2= Evan |title=Artificial Intelligence and Economic Theory: Skynet in the Market |year=2017 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=London |isbn=978-3-319-66104-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2015/11/26/artificial-intelligence-can-reduce-information-asymmetry/|title=Artificial Intelligence can Reduce Information Asymmetry : Networks Course blog for INFO 2040/CS 2850/Econ 2040/SOC 2090|author=|date=|website=blogs.cornell.edu|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is primarily because information asymmetry of the perceptions of value of goods and services is the basis of trade.

== Background ==

Each year more than 13 million hectares (32 million acres) of forests are lost, an area roughly the size of [[England]].&lt;ref name=loss&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/forest/reforestation-the-easiest.html|title= Reforestation: the easiest way to combat climate change |publisher=UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As go the forests, so grow the plant and animal species that they embrace – 80% of all terrestrial [[biodiversity]]. Most importantly, forests play a critical role in [[climate change]] including [[global warming]]: [[deforestation]] results in 12-18 percent of the world's carbon emissions – almost equal to all the CO2 from the global transport sector.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Equally crucial, healthy forests are one of the world's primary '[[carbon sink]]s.'{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Today, forests cover more than 30% of the world's land and contain more than 60,000 tree species, many as of yet unidentified.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Forests provide [[non-timber forest product|food, fiber, water and medicines]] for approximately 1.6 billion of the world's poorest people, including [[indigenous peoples]] with unique cultures.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== History ==

In November 1971, the "States members" at the 16th session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization, voted to establish "World Forestry Day" on March 21 of each year.&lt;ref name=declaration /&gt; From 2007-2012, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) convened a series of six Forest Days, in conjunction with [[United Nations Climate Change conference|annual meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties]]. CIFOR organized these events on behalf of and in close cooperation with other members of the [[United Nations Forum on Forests#Collaborative Partnership on Forests|Collaborative Partnership on Forests]] (CPF). Following the [[International Year of Forests]] in 2011, the International Day of Forests was established by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 28, 2012.

=== Forest Day ===

The catalyst for Forest Day was a casual conversation in [[Oxford, England]], in February 2007, between two scientists who felt the world was underestimating the importance of forests in mitigating [[carbon emissions]] and saw a glaring need for the latest forestry research and thinking to inform global policy makers and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] negotiators. They did not foresee that the conference would become one of the most influential global events on forests and climate change today.&lt;ref name=his&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/history.html |title=History of Forest Day |publisher=CIFOR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905024652/http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/history.html |archivedate=September 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Forest Day 1: Bali, Indonesia (2007) ====
[[File:Forest day 1 image.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Journalists interview [[Center for International Forestry Research]] scientist Daniel Murdiyarso]]

The inaugural Forest Day was one of the major vents at [[United nation network Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|(COP) 13]] in [[Bali, Indonesia]] on 8 December 2007. More than 800 people participated in Forest Day, including scientists, members of national delegations, and representatives from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=fd1&gt;

|title= Forest Day 1: Shaping the Global Agenda for Forests &amp; Climate Change
|publisher=CIFOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major feature of Forest Day was four parallel panel discussions focusing on cross-cutting themes related to forests and climate change. These well-attended discussions examined such issues as setting baselines and methodological challenges in estimating [[forest carbon stock|forest carbon]]; markets and governance challenges associated with [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD+); adaptation to climate change; and equity-efficiency trade-offs.

Areas of consensus emerging from the discussions included the following:
* While there are significant methodological challenges to be surmounted, current methods are “good enough” to proceed with the design of mechanisms for reducing emissions from both [[deforestation]] and degradation.
* Governance-related challenges pose the greatest risks for both international investors and local stakeholders in the context of new mechanisms.
* Mechanisms should be simple, and should not repeat the mistakes of the [[Clean Development Mechanism]].
* The success of any REDD+ mechanism will depend on the political will to address the drivers of deforestation, including drivers that originate beyond the forestry sector.
* Adaptation efforts need to shift from responsive to anticipatory, and should be focused on the most vulnerable, including forest-dependent people.

==== Forest Day 2: Poznań, Poland (2008) ====
[[File:Forest day 2 image.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Sub-plenary 1, organized by [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations|IUFRO]], [[Center for International Forestry Research|CIFOR]], [[World Agroforestry Centre|ICRAF]] and PROFOR-World Bank, discussed the cross-cutting theme "adaptation of forests to climate change." Panelists included (L-R): Bruno Locatelli, CIFOR; Gerhard Dieterle, [[World Bank]]; Markku Kanninen, CIFOR; Balgis Osman-Elasha, IUFRO; and Dennis Garrity, World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF).]]

Building on the positive response to the first Forest Day, Forest Day 2, held in [[Poznań]], Poland, on December 8, 2008, brought together nearly 900 participants to discuss the opportunities and challenges of bringing forests into global and national strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

Participants stressed the broad importance of forest ecosystems and noted that forests comprise an inter-dependent web of animals, plants and [[microorganisms]], which together provide a wide range of goods and services beyond [[carbon sequestration]]. These include [[biodiversity]] conservation, rainfall generation and products that are crucial to the livelihoods of local forest dependent and indigenous peoples as well as to the economies of many countries.

Those attending recognized the importance of building on the vast knowledge and experience that exists on [[sustainable forest management]] (SFM) and called on negotiators to consult with forest stakeholders as they develop climate policy.

Frances Seymour, Director General of CIFOR delivered a summary of Forest Day 2&lt;ref name=fd2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifor.org/fileadmin/templatesnew/res/documents/events/2008/Summary-Forest-Day-2.pdf |title= Summary of Forest Day 2 |publisher=Committee representing members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Yvo de Boer]], Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC. This summary was drafted by a committee representing members of the CPF, and included points of consensus as well as points of disagreement that emerged during the course of the day. Seymour highlighted the need to:

* Include forests in climate mitigation and adaptation mechanisms and strategies
* Ensure full inclusion and participation of civil society in international, regional, national and local decision-making processes
* Recognize and respect the rights of women, poor people and Indigenous Peoples

==== Forest Day 3: Copenhagen, Denmark (2009) ====
Nearly 1500 stakeholders attended Forest Day 3 held in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] on 13 December 2009 including 34 donors, government representatives, 88 journalists, 500 NGO representatives, indigenous leaders, 188 private sector representatives and hundreds of scientists and forestry experts. Their goal was to ensure that the design and implementation of forest-related [[climate change mitigation|climate mitigation]] and adaptation measures under consideration in the Climate Change Agreement would be effective, efficient and equitable.

Although the UNFCCC failed to agree on binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/world/asia/15prexy.html?_r=2/ |title= Leaders Will Delay Deal on Climate Change |publisher=New York Times | first=Helene |last=Cooper |date=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; significant progress was achieved in negotiating the outlines of a REDD+ mechanism. The [[Copenhagen Accord]] that emerged was the first international agreement to recommend that financial resources be raised to support REDD+. [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] offered a US$3.5 billion funding package for REDD+ preparation.

Moreover, one of the indicators of the relevance of Forest Day – its ability to attract world leaders – became clear at Copenhagen. Key speakers at the event included:
* [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]], Chair of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]
* [[Wangari Maathai]], founder of the [[Green Belt Movement]] and Nobel laureate
* [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], former Norwegian Prime Minister
* [[Hilary Benn]], the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]
* [[Sir Nicholas Stern]], head of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]].

Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] appeared via video and Nobel Prize winner [[Elinor Ostrom]] was among the keynote speakers.

==== Forest Day 4: Cancún, Mexico (2010) ====
[[File:Forest day 4 dan nap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Daniel Nepstad during Forest Day 4, [[Cancún, Mexico]]]]
Forest Day 4 took place on 5 December 2010 in [[Cancún, Mexico]]. More than 1,500 people including over 280 Climate negotiators were in attendance.

The theme for Forest Day 4 was "Time to Act," highlighting the urgency of ensuring the survival of the world's forests, the [[biodiversity]] they embrace and the hundreds of millions of people who depend on them. The event served as a bridge between the [[International Year of Biodiversity]] and the [[International Year of Forests|2011 International Year of Forests]]. Forest Day 4 was hosted by the [[Government of Mexico]], through the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), CPF and CIFOR.

President [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]], in his opening speech at FD4, told the plenary “… it’s time for all of us to push, and push hard for the full incorporation of [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD+]] into a long-term international climate change agreement.” In a passionate plea, the Mexican president also stressed, “Either we change our way of life now, or climate change will change it for us.”

Keynote speeches by Daniel Nepstad, Director of the International Program at the [[Amazon Environmental Research Institute]] and [[Myrna Cunningham|Mirna Cunningham Kain]], Chair of the [[Center for Autonomy and Development of Indigenous Peoples]], emphasized the critical needs for both sound forestry and climate change science, and pro-active engagement with indigenous people and forest-dependent communities as the de facto and de jure custodians of land and forest resources to secure equitable outcomes. UN Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs [[Sha Zukang]] provided an important forward-looking perspective, drawing participants' attention to the multiple benefits of forests and the [[International Year of Forests]] in 2011.

Key issues discussed at FD4 included:

* Harnessing REDD+ to sustainably manage forests and reduce poverty: The day saw the emergence of a robust consensus that the risks of no action on protecting the world’s forests are far greater than the risks of moving ahead with less-than-perfect agreements.
* REDD+ provides a key and cost-effective opportunity to mitigate climate change: FD4 participants reaffirmed that through REDD+ we may significantly reduce, remove and avoid global emissions at reasonable cost, as long as we take due account of the rights and livelihoods of indigenous people and local communities, biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]], whilst assisting developing forest countries adapt to climate change.
* The rights of indigenous people and forest-dependent communities need to be protected: Communities would be more willing to engage with REDD+ initiatives if they were to participate in all aspects of REDD+ design and implementation, if they are granted rights to the carbon in their forests, if they play a central role in the design of local rules, and if REDD+ does not permit more powerful competitors to threaten local interests.
* Additional financing is needed to implement REDD+ at scale: An agreement on a robust and predictable system for mobilizing financial resources from various sources is needed, primarily in developed countries. This will be needed to stimulate and pay for early REDD+ action at scale, technology transfers, capacity building and the development of national and sub-national monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, among others.
* Biodiversity conservation is a prerequisite for the success of REDD+: More than 90 percent of FD4 participants polled said that biodiversity safeguards are either “very important” or “essential” for the success of REDD+, and more than 95 percent said that it is important to monitor co-benefits.
* REDD+ and agricultural drivers of deforestation: FD4 participants proposed several options to increase agricultural intensification whilst reducing net annual rates of deforestation including: increasing production efficiencies; promoting multifunctional landscapes; directing REDD+ financing to increase efficiencies in agronomic practices; and shifting extensive production systems to low carbon landscapes.
* Promoting synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation across landscapes: More research is needed to explore linkages between adaptation and mitigation in forests at different scales. Two specific challenges – agreement on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, and continued improvements in forest governance were also discussed.
* Strengthen linkages between national and subnational MRV systems for REDD+:  Challenges remain for monitoring forest degradation and peatland emissions but these may be overcome with significant additional capacity building and technology transfer, including the application of novel technologies. Examples include Google’s [[Google Earth Engine|Earth Engine]] (demonstrated by Rebecca Moore, Head of Google’s Global Outreach Program prior to the Closing Plenary of FD4), Open Data Kit and androids for forest [[biomass]] measurements with communities.
* Improve accounting rules for forest management in developed countries: More comprehensive accounting on forests will be beneficial both for the climate and for forests. Participants acknowledged that this is a complex and controversial issue, but success in reaching agreement on new rules would help smooth the way for agreement on new emission reduction commitments by developing countries for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
* The success of REDD+ strategies and projects will depend on whether they influence governance reforms or are shaped by existing governance failures: The ability of developing countries to enhance the role of their forest resources in mitigating climate change is closely linked with their commitment to governance reform. There are also huge challenges to reform the embedded structures of past poor governance. However, the legality and legitimacy of REDD+ are likely to depend on a balance between central oversight and decentralized decision making, clear tenure and transparent and equitable benefit-sharing arrangements.
* Reinforcing the UNFCCC momentum on forestry and climate change : A key challenge of [[COP16]] in Cancún is how existing mitigation and financing pledges made through the [[Copenhagen Accord]] can now be transformed into official commitments under the UNFCCC. This may require abandoning the “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” global climate change architecture approach to ensure that a balanced cluster of decisions can be made in negotiating areas that remain close to agreement. This will ensure that commitments can be translated into actions in 2011.

===== Comments =====

* Virgilio Viana, CEO of [[Fundação Amazonas Sustentável|Amazonas Sustainable Foundation]], Brazil: “Forest Day has become a venue for in depth discussion relating to forests and climate change, filling a gap in the meeting spaces. A source of inspiration for policy making at national and international level.”
* Yemi Katerere, [[UN REDD]]: “FD provides the forum, agenda and a theme to draw together practitioners, policy makers, researchers and NGOs involved in forestry. FD is the place to get the experts’ view on forestry at COP… The CPF has a broad range of constituents; FD reflects this multi-faceted range of stakeholders.”
* Felician Kilahama, [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism]], [[Tanzania]]: “FD is unique: It brings environmental stakeholders, policy makers, private sector, etc together. For some countries, FD provides a rare chance to interact internationally, exchange knowledge, lessons learned on forests and climate change.”
* David Diaz, [[Ecosystem Marketplace]] ([[Forest Trends]]), USA: “There’s a lot of positive energy surrounding forestry right now and FD channels that energy. President Calderon’s presence has an impact. The participation of high profile figures means that other presidential/ministerial level people may get a louder voice or take an interest at that level.”
* Tony la Vina, Dean, [[Ateneo School of Government]], [[Manila University]], Philippines: “FD is important because of the range of people who come: negotiators, practitioners, policy makers, advocates – the range is impressive. Here you can help shape the agenda for forestry. I would like to see a strong appeal to negotiators that things are already running on the ground. There’s a sense of urgency. The negotiations need to be relevant to things already happening on the ground.”
* Niels Elers Koch, President, [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]]: “Forest Day (FD) is the single most important science–policy interface in the forest sector, where researchers and policy makers meet."

==== Forest Day 5: Durban, South Africa (2011) ====

The 2011 COP 17 was hosted by [[Durban, South Africa]], from 28 November to 9 December 2011.&lt;ref name=cop17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/africa/en/News/news/Durban-to-Host-Climate-Conference/ |title= Durban to Host Climate Conference |publisher=greenpeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest Day 5 took place on 4 December 2011 in [[Durban, South Africa]]. [[CIFOR]] convened the event, which was co-hosted by 11 members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests and the [[Government of South Africa]] through the [[Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (South Africa)|Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]]. More than 1,100 people from 82 countries attended, including 214 official climate-change negotiators and 65 media representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/events/forest-day/forest-day-5.html/ |title= Forest Day 5 |publisher= forestsandclimatechange.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for Forest Day 5 was ‘From Policy to Practice’, aiming to inform the COP agenda and forest stakeholders on ways to implement the REDD+ agreement reached in Cancún in 2010 to produce social and environmental benefits, and to integrate forests into adaptation strategies on the ground. Organisers gave special attention to issues relevant to sub-Saharan Africa, to REDD+ issues facing the humid tropical forests of the Congo Basin, and to the improved management and use of Africa’s dry forests areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.ca/climate/cop17/fd/ |title= Forest Day Bulletin: a summary report of Forest Day 5 |publisher= International Institute for Sustainable Development Reporting Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between forests and [[food security]] was also one of the main themes of the day. The organisers of Forest Day 5 and Agriculture and Rural Development Day (which was held on 3 December 2012) coordinated in the months leading up to the events to identify opportunities for tie-ups between the two events. A number of joint, similar-themed discussion forums were held on [[climate-smart agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatesmartagriculture.org/72610/en/ |title= climate-smart agriculture |publisher=climatesmartagriculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[agroforestry]] and food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/events/forest-day/forest-day-5/forests-and-agriculture.html/ |title= Forests and Agriculture: Link with Agriculture and Rural Development Day |publisher=forestsandclimatechange.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in past years, Forest Day 5 attracted several high-level speakers. In all, more than 60 speakers and panellists took part in Forest Day 5, with six of the ten keynotes presented by women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17956">The '''International Rostrum of Composers''' ('''IRC''') is an annual forum organized by the [[International Music Council]] that offers [[broadcasting]] representatives the opportunity to exchange and publicize pieces of [[contemporary classical music]]. It is funded by contributions from participating national radio networks.

The first Rostrum took place in 1954 and involved delegates from the German, French, Belgian and Swiss national broadcasting companies. From then until 2002 the Rostrum's sessions were held at UNESCO's headquarters in [[Paris]], with the exception of 2000 when they were hosted by [[Muziek Groep Nederland]] and the [[Gaudeamus Foundation]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Since 2003, a rotation system has been in place, where the Rostrum is hosted every other year by [[Radio France]] and in the intervening year visits a European venue. Starting from 2010 the Rostrum is travelling around Europe by invitation of National Radio Broadcasters.

Over thirty national radio networks now send delegates, presenting in total sixty or so works each year that have been composed no more than five years previously. Following sessions of listening and discussion, the delegates highlight one of the works submitted (that year's "selected work") and recommend a number of the others. They also highlight one or two works by composers under the age of thirty and recommend one or two others. These selected and recommended works are those most likely to be broadcast or played in concerts sponsored by the participating networks or others that follow the Rostrum's deliberations. All works presented are offered by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] to its members via satellite. Copies of recordings, scores and notes featured during the forum are kept at the Gaudeamus Foundation.

From 1991 until 2003 the composer of each year’s selected work was awarded the [[UNESCO Mozart Medal]]. Since 2004 the composer of each year’s selected work is awarded the UNESCO Picasso-Miró Medal and the composer or composers under the age of thirty whose work or works are selected are awarded the Guy Huot [[Bursary]] for young composers.

Since 2015, the International Rostrum of Composers is part of a large project called Rostrum+ a cooperation project co-funded by the Creative Europe programme of the European Union which aims to rethink the ways in which contemporary music connects with audiences through radio network by exploring new strategies to develop audiences, promote new music, enhance the skills of radio professionals and inspire cooperation between musicians, higher music education institutions and broadcasting companies throughout Europe and beyond.

The selected composer in the General Category of each edition receive a joint commission  Radio France / IMC for an Alla Breve composition that are performed by musicians of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, recorded and broadcast by Radio France in a special program called Alla Breve.

Swedish Radio and IMC jointly commission a work to the composer selected in the “Under 30” category. The composer is invited to Sweden for an introductory 2-day workshop with a local ensemble and then write a work for them which is broadcast live by the Swedish Radio.

== List of winners ==
The International Rostrum of Composers has two main categories:

'''Jimmy Roberts''' (born 1957) is a sportscaster for [[NBC Sports]]. Roberts joined NBC in May 2000 after serving as a sports reporter for almost 12 years at [[ESPN]], where he won 11 [[Sports Emmy Awards]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Roberts grew up in White Plains, New York, and graduated from White Plains High School in 1975. In high school, he played varsity lacrosse, was the school's morning announcer (originating the morning joke of the day), and occasionally wrote columns for his high-school newspaper, ''The Orange''.

His journalism career began in 1975 when he started as a newspaper reporter. Roberts also worked under [[Howard Cosell]] as a writer and producer at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. His writing is regarded as some of the best in all of broadcast journalism.

He is a graduate of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. During his time at Maryland, Roberts worked at the popular campus hangout [[R.J. Bentley's Filling Station]]; one of his sports Emmys is on display there.

===NBC Sports===
Roberts is the interviewer for NBC's [[Golf Channel on NBC|golf]] coverage, in addition to hosting the halftime show for [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame]] [[American football|football]], being one of the main anchors for NBC's weekend sports updates, anchoring the network's coverage of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], and working as a field reporter for NBC's [[Major League Baseball on NBC|coverage]] of the [[2000 American League Championship Series]]. He also reported on [[Thoroughbred Racing on NBC|horse racing]]. Roberts has won two Emmys since joining NBC.

Roberts has worked 10 [[Olympic Games]] in his broadcasting career. At the Olympics for [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]], he has hosted a nightly feature called the ''[[Chevy]] Olympic Moments'', which talk about a different athlete or the history of a certain place at an Olympics. Roberts served as a correspondent for [[NBC Sports]] coverage of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/mediumwell/blog/2008/07/your_nbc_olympics_lineup.html Medium Well: Your NBC Olympics lineup – A blog on sports media, news and networks – baltimoresun.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803182204/http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/mediumwell/blog/2008/07/your_nbc_olympics_lineup.html |date=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Roberts hosted and narrated the [[Outdoor Life Network]]'s coverage of the 2005 [[Dakar Rally]].

In April 2009, Roberts published his first book, ''Breaking the Slump'' ([[HarperCollins]]), which detailed the struggles of many famous golfers, including [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[George Herbert Walker Bush]], and others and how they found their way through the inevitable challenges that plague anyone who plays the game.
Roberts also did field reporting for ABC's coverage of the [[Little League World Series]].

===Personal life===
Roberts and his wife, Sandra Mayer, have three sons, and they all live in [[Westchester County, New York]].

Roberts' sister-in-law, Debbie Mayer, worked in the south tower on the 56th floor at New York City's [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Immediately after [[American Airlines Flight 11]] (the first aircraft of the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]) struck the north tower, Mayer began going downstairs to leave the building. She had gotten to the 29th floor when the second aircraft struck, hitting the building she worked in. However, Mayer escaped safely before the towers collapsed.

Roberts told of the ordeal to ''[[USA Today]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We had a couple of very anxious hours. My wife couldn't get through to Debbie. Finally, she went to her Manhattan apartment to wait for her. And she found her there. Turns out when the first explosion occurred in Building 1, Debbie started down the stairs. She had made it to the 29th floor when the building was shaken when the second plane hit. She was terrified but made it out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy''' (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), commonly referred to by his initials '''JFK''', was an American politician who served as the 35th [[President of the United States]] from January 1961 until [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|his assassination]] in November 1963. He served at the height of the [[Cold War]], and the majority of his presidency dealt with managing relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] prior to becoming president.

Kennedy was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], the second child of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] and [[Rose Kennedy]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1940 and joined the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] the following year. During [[World War II]], he commanded a series of [[PT boats]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] and earned the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for his service. After the war, Kennedy represented the [[11th congressional district of Massachusetts]] in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, he published his book entitled ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]], Kennedy narrowly defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent vice president. At age 43, he became the second-youngest man to serve as president (after [[Theodore Roosevelt]]), the youngest man to be elected as U.S. president, as well as the only [[Roman Catholic]] to occupy that office.

Kennedy's time in office was marked by high tensions with [[communist states]] in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisers in [[South Vietnam]] by a factor of 18 over President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In April 1961, he authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the [[Cuba]]n government of [[Fidel Castro]] in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;de Quesada, Alejandro ''The Bay of Pigs: Cuba 1961'' (2011) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently rejected [[Operation Northwoods]] plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate [[false flag]] attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. In October 1962, U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]] and supported the [[civil rights movement]], but he was largely unsuccessful in passing his [[New Frontier]] domestic policies.

On November 22, 1963, Kennedy [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was arrested for the [[state crime]], but he was never prosecuted due to his murder by [[Jack Ruby]] two days later; Ruby was sentenced to death and died while the sentence was on appeal in 1967. Pursuant to the [[Presidential Succession Act]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was sworn in as president later that day. Both the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Warren Commission]] officially concluded that Oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups challenged the findings of the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy]]. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1964|Revenue Acts]] of 1964. Kennedy continues to rank highly in [[historians' polls of U.S. presidents]] and with the general public. His average approval rating of 70% is the highest of any president in [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s history of systematically measuring job approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/165902/americans-rate-jfk-top-modern-president.aspx |title=Americans Rate JFK as Top Modern President |work=[[Gallup Poll]] |date=November 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801184550/http://www.gallup.com/poll/165902/americans-rate-jfk-top-modern-president.aspx|archivedate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, at [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy National Historic Site|83 Beals Street]] in suburban [[Brookline, Massachusetts]],{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=20}} to businessman/politician [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy]] and philanthropist/socialite [[Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy]]. His paternal grandfather [[P. J. Kennedy]] was a member of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts state legislature]]. His maternal grandfather and namesake [[John F. Fitzgerald]] served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as [[Mayor of Boston]]. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org misc"/&gt; Kennedy had an elder brother, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.|Joseph Jr.]], and seven younger siblings: [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rosemary]], [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen "Kick"]], [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]], [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]], [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert "Bobby"]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith|Jean]], and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward "Ted"]].

Kennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life and attended the local [[St. Aidan's Church (Brookline, Massachusetts)|St. Aidan's Church]], where he was baptized on June 19, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyjfk.com/days/june-19-1917/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Fast-Facts/Churches.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Edward Devotion School]] in Brookline, the [[Noble and Greenough School|Noble and Greenough Lower School]] in nearby [[Dedham, Massachusetts]], and the [[Dexter School]] (also in Brookline) through the 4th grade. His father's business had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures were concentrated on [[Wall Street]] and Hollywood. In September 1927, the family moved from Brookline to [[Riverdale, Bronx]], New York.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=21}}&lt;ref name="John F. Kennedy: Early Years"&gt;{{Cite web | title = John F. Kennedy: Early Years | accessdate = April 17, 2017 | url = http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/jfk/section1.rhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young John attended the lower campus of [[Riverdale Country School]], a private school for boys, from 5th to 7th grade. Two years later, the family moved to suburban [[Bronxville, New York]], where Kennedy was a member of [[Boy Scout]] Troop 2 and attended [[Church of St. Joseph (Bronxville, New York)|St. Joseph's Church]].&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org misc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bronxville.dailyvoice.com/lifestyle/looking-back-on-jfks-time-in-bronxville/512600/|title=Looking Back on JFK's Time in Bronxville|last=Failla|first=Zak|date=November 18, 2013|work=[[The Daily Voice (U.S. hyperlocal news)|The Daily Voice]]|access-date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kennedy family spent summers and early autumns&lt;ref name=Kennedy37&gt;{{cite book|title=True Compass: A Memoir|first=Edward M.|last=Kennedy|page=37.|year=2009|isbn=978-0446539258|publisher=Twelve; First Edition edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Kennedy Compound|their home]] (rented in 1926, then purchased in 1929)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = John F. Kennedy's Residences| accessdate = April 17, 2017 | url = https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Fast-Facts/Homes.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], and Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter retreat in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], later purchased in 1933. In September 1930, Kennedy—then 13 years old—attended the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an [[appendectomy]], after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=34}}

In September 1931, Kennedy started attending [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], a prestigious boarding school in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother Joe Jr. had already been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow, and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. They carried out their most notorious stunt by exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain "muckers" who would "spit in our sea". The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group "The Muckers Club", which included roommate and lifelong friend [[Lem Billings|Kirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings]].{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=11}}

During his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at [[Yale–New Haven Hospital|New Haven Hospital]], where doctors thought he might have had leukemia.&lt;ref name = "Dallek"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dallek|first1=Robert|title=The Medical Ordeals of JFK|journal=The Atlantic|date=December 2002|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/12/the-medical-ordeals-of-jfk/305572/?single_page=true|accessdate=March 29, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801185019/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/12/the-medical-ordeals-of-jfk/305572/?single_page=true|archivedate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1934, he was admitted to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]; the ultimate diagnosis there was [[colitis]].&lt;ref name = "Dallek"/&gt; Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students.&lt;ref name="John F. Kennedy: Early Years"/&gt; He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the "most likely to succeed".{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=11}}

In September 1935, Kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to London with his parents and his sister Kathleen. He intended to study under [[Harold Laski]] at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to the United States in October of that year, when he enrolled late and attended [[Princeton University]] but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John F.

In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at [[Harvard College]] and his application essay stated: "The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a 'Harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/jfks-very-revealing-harvard-application-essay/281699/|title=JFK's Very Revealing Harvard Application Essay|first=Eleanor|last=Barkhorn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced that year's annual "Freshman Smoker", called by a reviewer "an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world."&lt;ref name="Harvard Crimson 1937"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1937/5/5/memorial-hall-auditorium-filled-to-capacity/ | title = Memorial Hall Auditorium Filled to Capacity at Annual Freshman Smoker | work = The Harvard Crimson | date = May 5, 1937 | accessdate =February 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|p=7}} Kennedy also sailed in the [[Star (keelboat)|Star class]] and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=John|last=Clarke|title=Selling J.F.K.'s Boat|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/selling-j-f-k-s-boat|date=May 19, 2015| work = [[The New Yorker]] | accessdate = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France—taking his convertible—and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=49}} In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the [[U.S. Embassy, London|American embassy in London]], where his father was President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s U.S. Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]].{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=54}}

In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Balkans]], and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went to [[Czechoslovakia]] and Germany before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] to mark the beginning of [[World War II]]. Two days later, the family was in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the [[SS Athenia|SS ''Athenia'']] before flying back to the U.S. from [[Foynes|Foynes, Ireland]], to [[Port Washington, New York]], on his first transatlantic flight.

When Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. He made the [[Dean's List]] in his junior year.&lt;ref name="Harvard Presidents"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ | title = Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees | work = Harvard Gazette | publisher = [[Harvard University]] | date = November 6, 2008 | accessdate =February 24, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190338/http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/|archivedate=August 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, "Appeasement in Munich", about British participation in the [[Munich Agreement]]. The thesis eventually became a bestseller under the title ''[[Why England Slept]]''.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=61–66}} In addition to addressing Britain's failure to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an [[Special Relationship|Anglo-American alliance]] against the rising totalitarian powers. While Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom, creating a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=15–17}}

In 1940, Kennedy graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from Harvard College with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in government, concentrating on [[international relations|international affairs]]. That fall, he enrolled at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and audited classes there.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=18}} In early 1941, Kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his time as an American ambassador. He then traveled throughout South America; his itinerary included Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=68}}{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=21}}

In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|Officer Candidate School]], but was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. He exercised for months to straighten his back. On September 24, 1941, with the help of the director of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI)—who was the former naval [[attaché]] to Joseph Kennedy—Kennedy joined the United States Naval Reserve.

Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's base commander, Commander Thomas G. Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese Naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1.  Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PT's, not one hit the Japanese convoy.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=99, 100}} On that dark and moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading North on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when ''PT-109'' was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the [[Japanese destroyer Amagiri (1930)|destroyer ''Amagiri'']], costing two ''PT-109'' crew members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/pt_boats/uss_pt_109_final_crew_list.htm | title=USS PT-109 Final Crew List | publisher=Michael W.

Kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to "fight or surrender". Kennedy stated: "There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose." Shunning surrender, around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on August 2, the men swam towards Plum Pudding island {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} southwest of the remains of the ''PT-109''.&lt;ref name="history.navy.mil"/&gt;{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=106–107, 119}} Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=106–107, 124}} Kennedy made an additional two mile swim the night of August 2, 1943, to Ferguson Passage to attempt to hail a passing American PT boat to expedite his crew's rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on Naru Island where he had swum with Ensign George Ross to look for food.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=66-106, 134–139}}

On August 4, he and Lenny Thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim {{convert|3.75|mi|km}} southeast to Olasana Island, which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on Plum Pudding Island. They swam against a strong current, and once again Kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist "Pappy" MacMahon by his life vest.

Kennedy and Ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty gallon drum of drinkable water left by the Japanese, which Kennedy paddled another half mile back to Olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew. Lieutenant "Bud" Liebenow, a friend and former tentmate of Kennedy's, rescued Kennedy and his crew on Olasana Island on August 8, 1943 aboard his ship, the ''PT-157'', with the help of coast watcher Lieutenant Reginald Evans and several native coast watchers, particularly [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]].{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=143–148}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/pt_boats/uss_pt_109_ens_leonard_j_thom.htm | title=Leonard Jay "Lenny" Thom (1917–1946) | publisher=Michael W.

===Commanding the ''PT-59''===
Taking only a month to recover, on September 1, 1943, Kennedy returned to duty and took command of the ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-59|PT-59]]'', first removing the torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitting her in one month into a heavily armed gunboat bristling with two large automatic 40 cal and ten automatic 50 caliber guns. The plan was to attach one gunboat to each PT boat section to add gun range and power against barges and shore batteries which the ''59'' encountered on several occasions in mid October through mid November.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=181, 187}} On October 8, Kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|p=182}} On November 2, Kennedy's ''PT-59'' took part with two other PT's in the successful rescue of 40-50 marines.  The ''59'' acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at [[Raid on Choiseul|Choiseul Island]], taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=172–184}}{{sfn|Donovan|2001|pp=189}} Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of ''PT-59'' on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.{{sfn|Doyle|2015|pp=193}} From there he returned to the United States in early January 1944.

Kennedy was hospitalized at the [[Chelsea Naval Hospital]] in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] from May to December 1944.&lt;ref name="maritimequest.com"/&gt; On June 12, he was presented the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his heroic actions on August 1–2, 1943, and the Purple Heart Medal for his back injury while on ''PT-109''.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/111199/JFK/timeline.shtml | title=JFK: A Timeline of His Life 1917–1963 | publisher=St. Petersburg Times. | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801205613/http://www.sptimes.com/News/111199/JFK/timeline.shtml | archivedate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at [[Castle Hot Springs (Arizona)|Castle Hot Springs]], a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|pp=179, 180}}&lt;ref name="peoriaaz.gov"&gt;{{cite web| title=Peoria Open Space Master Plan: Chapter 4 - Historic and Cultural Resources| work=| url=http://www.peoriaaz.gov/uploadedFiles/NewPeoriaAZ/About_Peoria/Sonoran_Preservation_Program/Chapter4_HistoricCulturalResources.pdf| date=| year=| accessdate=January 22, 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201191814/http://www.peoriaaz.gov/uploadedFiles/NewPeoriaAZ/About_Peoria/Sonoran_Preservation_Program/Chapter4_HistoricCulturalResources.pdf| archivedate=February 1, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the [[Silver Star Medal]] for which he had been recommended initially.

In 1950, The [[Department of the Navy]] offered Kennedy a [[Bronze Star Medal]] in recognition of his meritorious service, which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/jfk-received-non-combat-recognition-for-wartime-action/ | title=John F.

On August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe Jr.]], a navy pilot, was killed while volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission. His [[Operation Aphrodite|explosive-laden plane]] blew up when the plane's bombs detonated prematurely while the aircraft was flying over the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.history.com/topics/joseph-kennedy-jr | title=Joseph Kennedy Jr | publisher=A+E Networks Corp. | accessdate=August 1, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801215357/http://www.history.com/topics/joseph-kennedy-jr | archivedate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of [[lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"/&gt; When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: "It was easy. They cut my [[PT boat]] in half."{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=98}}

===Military awards===
Kennedy's military decorations and awards include the Navy and Marine Corps Medal; Purple Heart Medal; [[American Defense Service Medal]]; [[American Campaign Medal]]; [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with three [[service star|{{frac|3|16}}" bronze stars]]; and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org misc" /&gt;

Unmindful of personal danger, Lieutenant (then [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]]) Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore.

==Journalism==
In April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of [[William Randolph Hearst]], arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for [[Hearst Newspapers]]; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and "expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career."{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=180}} He worked as a correspondent that May, covering the [[Potsdam Conference]] and other events.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=104}}

==Congressional career (1947–1960)==
JFK's elder brother Joe had been the [[Kennedy family|family's political standard-bearer]] and had been tapped by their father to seek the Presidency. Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the task now fell to the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings – John F. Kennedy.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=118}}

===House of Representatives (1947–1953)===
At the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative [[James Michael Curley]] vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic [[11th congressional district of Massachusetts]] to become mayor of Boston in 1946. With his father financing and running his campaign, Kennedy won the Democratic primary with 12 percent of the vote, defeating ten other candidates. Though Republicans took control of the House in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1946|1946 elections]], Kennedy defeated his Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote. Along with [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Joseph McCarthy]], Kennedy was one of several World War II veterans first elected to Congress that year.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=24–26}}

He served in the House for six years, joining the influential [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs Committee]]. He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the [[Truman Doctrine]] as the appropriate response to the emerging [[Cold War]]. He also supported [[public housing]] and opposed the [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947]], which restricted the power of [[labor union]]s. Though not as vocal an anticommunist as McCarthy, Congressman Kennedy supported the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], which required Communists to register with the government, and he deplored the "[[Loss of China]]."{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=26–29}} Having served as a Boy Scout during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the [[Scouting in Massachusetts|Boston Council]] from 1946 to 1955: as District Vice Chairman, member of the Executive Board, Vice-President, as well as a National Council Representative.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/JFK-Fast-Facts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyjfk.com/boy-scouts/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Massachusetts Senate Election Results by County, 1952.png|thumb|upright=1.1|County results of the 1952 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts]]

As early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952]] against Republican three-term incumbent [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] with the campaign slogan "Kennedy Will Do ''More'' for Massachusetts".{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=254}} Joseph Kennedy again financed and managed his son's candidacy, while John Kennedy's younger brother [[Robert Kennedy]] emerged as an important member of the campaign.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=29–31}} In the presidential election, General [[Dwight D.

Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic [[Anointing of the Sick|last rites]]. During his convalescence in 1956, he published ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Jean3" /&gt; Rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and [[speechwriter]], [[Ted Sorensen]], were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tofel | first = Richard J. | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121029817046479539?mod=2_1167_1 | title = Wall Street Journal, May&amp;nbsp;9, 2008, p.

At the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]], Senator Kennedy gave the nominating speech for the party's presidential nominee, [[Adlai Stevenson II]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=34–35}} Stevenson let the convention select the Vice Presidential nominee.

One of the matters demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]].{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=370}} Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this, which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=370}} Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|pp=370, 371}} Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the "Jury Trial Amendment". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=372}} A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=374}} The following year, Kennedy authored ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]'' (later published in 1964), which analyzed the importance of immigration in the country's history as well as proposals to re-evaluate [[immigration law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book by President Kennedy To Be Published on Oct. 7 |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 3, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, by a wide margin of 874,608 votes; this represented the largest ever margin in Massachusetts politics.&lt;ref name="John F. Kennedy"/&gt; It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at the time, [[Robert E. Thompson]], put together a film entitled ''The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story'', which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPPP-64.aspx|title=The U.S. Senator John F.

While Kennedy's father was a strong supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy, McCarthy was also a friend of the Kennedy family. Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy sister Patricia. In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy, and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized at the time. The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by "pairing" his vote against that of another senator. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] community, including [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], in the 1956 and 1960 elections.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|pp=274–79, 394–99}}

==1960 presidential election==
{{main|Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|United States presidential election, 1960}}
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|left|Kennedy campaigns with his wife Jacqueline in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], March 1960]]

On January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1960|Democratic presidential nomination]]. Though some questioned Kennedy's youth and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. His greatest obstacle to winning the nomination may have been his religion. Many Americans held [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic attitudes]], but Kennedy's vocal support of the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] helped defuse the situation. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]], and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38–45}}

[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|Kennedy and Richard Nixon participate in the nation's first televised [[United States presidential election debates#1960 Kennedy–Nixon debates|presidential debate]], Washington, D.C., 1960]]

When Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. Stevenson—the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president [[Harry S. Truman]], who was concerned about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to Johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=45–47}} Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960|last=Cosgrave|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2014|website=Time Magazine|access-date=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other liberal supporters when he [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 1960|chose Johnson]] as his vice presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator could help him win support from the [[Southern United States|South]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|p=47}} The choice infuriated many in labor. AFL-CIO President [[George Meany]] called Johnson "the arch foe of labor," while Illinois AFL-CIO President [[Reuben G.

At the start of the fall general election campaign, Republican nominee and incumbent vice president Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|p=49}} Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the [[Cuban Revolution]], and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: "I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters&amp;nbsp;– and the Church does not speak for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html | title = Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association | accessdate =September 17, 2007 | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | date = June 18, 2002 | work = American Rhetoric | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802122054/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html | archivedate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that "[n]o one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=15}}

Between September and October, Kennedy squared off against Nixon in the first televised [[U.S. presidential election debates|presidential debates]] in U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon had an injured leg, "[[five o'clock shadow]]", and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. Conversely, Kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner. On average radio listeners thought that Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/K/htmlK/kennedy-nixon/kennedy-nixon.htm | title = The Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debates, 1960 | accessdate =September 18, 2007 | last = Tyner Allen | first = Erika | work = museum.tv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.&lt;ref name="Jean3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1967/mar-apr/smith.html | title = Kennedy and Defense The formative years | accessdate =September 18, 2007 | last = Edward Smith | first = Dr. Jean | date = March 1967 | work = Air University Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1960.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|1960 electoral vote results]]

Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote#1960 Alabama results ambiguity|by most accounts]], Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).{{sfn|Dudley|Shiraev|2008|p=83}} Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the [[civil rights movement]]; they voted for Senator [[Harry F.

John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|his inaugural address]], he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the "common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself."&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org Inaugural Address"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inaugural Address |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Quotations/Inaugural-Address.aspx |date=January 20, 1961 |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |publisher=[[John F.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin." In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: "Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you."&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org Inaugural Address"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=52}}

[[File:JFKRiceUniversity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|John F. Kennedy speaking at [[Rice University]] in Houston on September 12, 1962. Lyndon Johnson can be seen behind him.]]

Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-General Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=22}} Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. "We can learn our jobs together", he stated.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=23, 25}}

Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=56}} Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. [[Deputy National Security Advisor (United States)|Deputy National Security Advisor]] [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, "What do you want me to do about that today?"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=66}}

Kennedy approved [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]]'s controversial decision to award the contract for the [[F-111]] TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to [[General Dynamics]] (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over [[Boeing]] (the choice of the military).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Art|first=Robert J.|year=1968|title=The TFX decision; McNamara and the military|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown|oclc=294546|pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of Senator [[Henry M.

During the summer of 1962, Kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the White House, most likely to aid his future memoir. It recorded many conversations with Kennedy and his Cabinet members, including those in relation to the "Cuban Missile Crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-john-f-kennedy|title=10 Things You May Not Know About John F.

===Foreign policy===
{{main|Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration}}
[[File:US President John Kennedy Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|Foreign trips of John F. Kennedy during his presidency]]

President Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the [[Cold War]]. In 1961, he anxiously anticipated a summit with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the [[Vienna summit]] of June 1961.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|pp=76–78}}

On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet [[Charles de Gaulle]], who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as "the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=145}}

[[File:JFKWHP-KN-C19113.jpg|thumb|left|The Kekkonens from [[Finland]] visited the United States and met John F. Kennedy in 1961. From left: President [[Urho Kekkonen]], [[Sylvi Kekkonen]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] and John F. Kennedy.]]

On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and [[East Berlin]]. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S access rights in [[West Berlin]] would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161–171}}

Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=175}}

[[File:President John F. Kennedy Meets with the President of the Republic of Ghana, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (JFKWHP-AR6409-B).jpg|thumb|Kennedy with [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first head of an independent [[Ghana]], March 1961]]
[[File:John F. Kennedy and Amintore Fanfani.jpg|thumb|Kennedy with the Italian Prime Minister [[Amintore Fanfani]], at the [[White House]], in 1963]]

In the weeks immediately following the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}} In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&amp;nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.25|1961|r=2}}&amp;nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}}

A month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]]. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued. This course was altered when West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}}

Kennedy gave a speech at [[Saint Anselm College]] on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War. The address detailed how the American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying, "For we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule."&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org Saint Anselm's College"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/Saint-Anselms-College-NH_19600305.aspx | title = Remarks of Senator John F.

====Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion====
{{main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}
The Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]'s regime in Cuba. Led by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, the plan was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=233, 238}}&lt;ref&gt;Gleijeses (1995), pp. 9–19&lt;/ref&gt; led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people, hoping to remove Castro from power.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=69–73}} Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.

[[File:President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson prior to ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|The President and Vice President take a leisurely stroll on the White House grounds]]

The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed [[Brigade 2506]], landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Director of the CIA|director]] [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]] later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=71, 673}}

By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. Twenty months later, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53&amp;nbsp;million worth of food and medicine.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=268–294, 838–839}} The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Edward Smith]], "Bay of Pigs: The Unanswered Questions", ''The Nation'', April 13, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=95–97}} He took responsibility for the failure, saying, "We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it."{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=290, 295}}

In late 1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including [[Edward Lansdale]], Secretary [[Robert McNamara]], and others. The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=264}}

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
{{listen | filename = John F Kennedy Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba.ogg | title = Address on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba | description = Kennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962, about the buildup of arms on Cuba}}
{{Wikisource|Cuban Missile Crisis}}

On October 14, 1962, CIA [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}

Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}}

[[File:John Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and Kennedy confer in [[Vienna]], 1961]]

More than a third of [[United States National Security Council|U.S. National Security Council]] (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of "[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in reverse".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=387}} There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=388}} In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22, he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=389}}

The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The [[Organization of American States]] gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=390}} [[United Nations]] (UN) Secretary General [[U Thant]] requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy didn't.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=403}}

One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=426}} The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184–186}}

This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. In the end, "the humanity" of the two men prevailed.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=189}} The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=425}}

====Latin America and communism====

''Public Papers of the Presidents''&amp;nbsp;– John F. Kennedy (1962), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in [[Latin America]] by establishing the [[Alliance for Progress]], which sent aid to some countries and sought greater [[human rights]] standards in the region.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=788, 789}} He worked closely with [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican Governor]] [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] for the development of the Alliance of Progress, and began working towards [[Puerto Rico]]'s autonomy.

The Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and [[Rafael Trujillo]] in the [[Dominican Republic]]. When President Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=140–142}} In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State [[Chester Bowles]] led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles "a gutless bastard" to his face.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=152}}

When briefing Kennedy, Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered [[Laos]] to be "the cork in the bottle" regarding the regional threat. In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a "free" Laos to a "neutral" Laos, indicating privately that [[Vietnam]], and not Laos, should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=75}} In May, he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnamese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].

During his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the South Vietnamese government.{{sfn|Dunnigan|Nofi|1999|p=257}} In late 1961, the [[Viet Cong]] began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=240}} Kennedy increased the number of military advisors and [[U.S. Special Forces|special forces]] in the area, from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=242}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm | title=Brief Overview of Vietnam War | publisher=Swarthmore College Peace Collection | accessdate=August 2, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803124531/http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/conscientiousobjection/OverviewVietnamWar.htm | archivedate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year and three months later on March 8, 1965, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, committed the first combat troops to Vietnam and greatly escalated U.S. involvement, with forces reaching 184,000 that year and 536,000 in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanwarlibrary.com/vietnam/vwatl.htm | title=Vietnam War Allied Troop Levels 1960–73 | publisher=The American War Library | accessdate=August 2, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802134052/http://www.americanwarlibrary.com/vietnam/vwatl.htm | archivedate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1961, President Kennedy sent [[Roger Hilsman]], then director of the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]], to assess the situation in Vietnam. There, Hilsman met [[Sir Robert Thompson]], head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam, and the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was formed. It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. By November 1963, the program waned and officially ended in 1964.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=1070}}

In early 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum&amp;nbsp;– "Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=281}} "[[Operation Ranch Hand]]", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=259}} Depending on which assessment Kennedy accepted (Department of Defense or State), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded U.S. involvement.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=283}}

[[File:John F. Kennedy and Harold Holt.jpg|thumb|Kennedy with future [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Harold Holt]] in [[Oval Office|the Oval Office]] in 1963]]

In April 1963, Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam, saying, "We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re-elect me."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=484}}

On August 21, just as the new U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] arrived, Diem and his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] ordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations. The crackdowns heightened expectations of a [[coup d'état]] to remove Diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=558}} Lodge was instructed to try getting Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country. Diem would not listen to Lodge.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=559}} [[Cable 243]] (DEPTEL 243) followed, dated August 24, declaring that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu's actions, and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=562–563}} Lodge concluded that the only option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=573}} At week's end, orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to "destroy all coup cables".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=577}} At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=560}}

A White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after [[Krulak Mendenhall mission|personal inspections on the ground]] by the Departments of Defense (General [[Victor Krulak]]) and State ([[Joseph Mendenhall]]). Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. Kennedy reacted, asking, "Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?" The president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=595}}

In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] to a Vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the [[McNamara Taylor mission]] "emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=602}} In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=609}} Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]] (choice of many to succeed Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=610}} At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered to be a "strategic fantasy".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=613}}

In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General [[Duong Van Minh]] (also known as "Big Minh"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=617}} On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by "Big Minh", [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|overthrew the Diem government]], arresting [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|and then killing Diem and Nhu]]. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=650}}

News of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in America and in South Vietnam—that the war might be won.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=651}} [[McGeorge Bundy]] drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told [[Michael Forrestal]] that "after the first of the year&amp;nbsp;... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there&amp;nbsp;... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top." When asked what he thought the president meant, Forrestal said, "it was devil's advocate stuff."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=660}}

Also known as "A Strategy of Peace", not only did the President outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also "laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Joy Y.|title=Obama to follow in John F.

&lt;blockquote&gt;to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace&amp;nbsp;... I speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War&amp;nbsp;... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn&amp;nbsp;... I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men&amp;nbsp;... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance&amp;nbsp;... our problems are man-made—therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=513–514}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor [[Adenauer]].{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=534}} At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=de+gaulle+and+germany+european+counterweight|title=Christian Democracy in Europe Since 19455|isbn=9781135753856|author1=Gehler|first1=Michael|last2=Kaiser|first2=Professor of European Studies Wolfram|last3=Kaiser|first3=Wolfram|date=August 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4U6yAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=de+gaulle+and+germany+european+counterweight|title=The Militant Face of Democracy|isbn=9781107037403|author1=Geis|first1=Anna|last2=Müller|first2=Harald|last3=Schörnig|first3=Niklas|date=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6s7Rbo2L3UC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=de+gaulle+and+germany+european+counterweight|title=De Gaulle and the World|author1=Kulski|first1=W.

On June 26, President Kennedy gave a public speech in [[West Berlin]]. He reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=624}} Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: "Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us." The speech is known for its famous phrase ''"[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]"'' ("I am a citizen of Berlin"). A million people were on the street for the speech.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=624}} Kennedy remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards: "We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=537}}

====Israel====
In 1960, Kennedy stated, "Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom."&lt;ref&gt;John F. Kennedy: "Speech by Senator John F. Kennedy, Zionists of America Convention, Statler Hilton Hotel, New York, NY," August 26, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, as president, Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents). Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a "special relationship" (as he described it to [[Golda Meir]]) between the US and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Balancing Act: US Foreign Policy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Shannon, Vaughn P. | year=2003 | location=Aldershot | page=55 | isbn=978-0754635918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kennedy-Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|upright|Kennedy with [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Golda Meir]], December 27, 1962]]

Kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (the [[MIM-23 Hawk]]) as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors; those policies included Israel's water project on the [[Jordan River]].&lt;ref&gt;Walt, Stephen M. (1987). ''The Origins of Alliances'', Cornell University Press, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

As result of this newly created security alliance, Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in [[Dimona]], which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government, [[David Ben-Gurion]] stated in a speech to the Israeli [[Knesset]] on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant at [[Beersheba]] was for "research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna."{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}} When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes "for the time being."{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}}

In a May 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion, Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, Ben-Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspections. In 1962, the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attaché at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}}

According to [[Seymour Hersh]], the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated: "It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on [an inspection]."{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it "guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''Samson Option'', pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Trachtenberg]] argued that "[a]lthough [he was] well aware of what the Israelis were doing, Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with America's non-proliferation policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trachtenberg, Marc|title=A Constructed Peace: The Making of the European Settlement, 1945–1963|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|date=February 8, 1999|page=403, Appendix Eight (Chapter Nine, Note 134)|url= http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/appendices/appendixVIII.html|accessdate=November 20, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803125625/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/trachtenberg/appendices/appendixVIII.html | archivedate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find "ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel's nuclear weapons program."&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''Samson Option'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodger Davies]], the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing [[nuclear weapons]]. He reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968–1969.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=203}} On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.{{sfn|Salt|2008|pp=201–205}}

====Iraq====

Relations between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]].{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=3-5}} On June 25, 1961, Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and [[Kuwait]], declaring the latter nation "an indivisible part of Iraq" and causing a short-lived "Kuwait Crisis". The United Kingdom—which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was heavily dependent on Kuwaiti oil—responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the UK (at the urging of the Kennedy administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}

In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the British- and American-owned [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[Concession (contract)|concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed were connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might "grab Kuwait" (thus achieving a "stranglehold" on Middle Eastern oil production) or "throw himself into Russian arms." Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to "get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel."{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37, 40-42}}

In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA—under the direction of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.]]—to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=43-45}}

The anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] [[Ramadan Revolution|overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=45, 57-58}} The Kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=60-61, 80}}

&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2006, the Irish [[Department of Justice and Equality|Department of Justice]] released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as Kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit.&lt;ref name="Cowell 2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650218799/JFK-faced-3-death-threats-during-63-visit-to-Ireland.html |title=JFK faced 3 death threats during '63 visit to Ireland|agency=New York Times News Service |newspaper=Deseret News|location=Salt Lake City |date=December 29, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803130019/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650218799/JFK-faced-3-death-threats-during-63-visit-to-Ireland.html | archivedate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear Test Ban Treaty====
{{main|Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}

Troubled by the long-term dangers of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=552}} In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. In response, the United States conducted tests five days later.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=229}} Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}}

In July 1963, Kennedy sent [[W. Averell Harriman]] to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to [[Andrei Gromyko]]. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=548}}

Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=550}}

===Domestic policy===
[[File:Fort Worth rally, 22 November 1963.jpg|thumb|President Kennedy in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], on Friday morning, November 22, 1963]]
Kennedy called his domestic program the "New Frontier". It ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. He also promised an end to [[racial discrimination]],&lt;ref name="Jaikumar 2011"&gt;{{cite news | last=Jaikumar| first=Arjun| title=On taxes, let's be Kennedy Democrats. Or Eisenhower Republicans. Or Nixon Republicans. | url = http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/07/10/992860/-On-taxes,-lets-be-Kennedy-Democrats-Or-Eisenhower-Republicans-Or-NixonRepublicans- | work=Daily Kos | date=July 10, 2011 | accessdate=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although his agenda, which included the endorsement of the [[Voter Education Project]] (VEP) in 1962, produced little progress in areas such as Mississippi, where the "VEP concluded that discrimination was so entrenched".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_voter_education_project/index.html|title=Voter Education Project|website=kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_kennedy_john_fitzgerald_1917_1963/index.html|title=Kennedy, John Fitzgerald (1917-1963)|website=kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 [[State of the Union address]], he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20–90% to a range of 14–65% as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%. Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners.&lt;ref name="Jaikumar 2011"/&gt; Congress did not act until 1964, a year after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to 70%, and the top corporate rate was set at 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why Budgets Matter: Budget Policy and American Politics |last=Ippolito |first=Dennis |year=2004 |publisher=Penn State Press |pages=173–175|isbn=978-0-271-02260-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[Economic Club of New York]], he spoke in 1963 of "...&amp;nbsp;the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=453}} Congress passed few of Kennedy's major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in 1964 and 1965 under his successor Johnson.{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=8}}

====Economy====
Kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep [[interest rate]]s down and to encourage growth of the economy.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=293}} He presided over the first government budget to top the $100&amp;nbsp;billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession [[Government budget deficit|deficit]].{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=324}} The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. Despite low inflation and interest rates, the [[GDP]] had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Economic Analysis"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Qtr&amp;FirstYear=1953&amp;LastYear=1964&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no | title = BEA: Quarterly GDP figures by sector, 1953–1964 | publisher = United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis | accessdate =February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy turned around and prospered during Kennedy's years as President. The GDP expanded by an average of 5.5% from early 1961 to late 1963,&lt;ref name="Bureau of Economic Analysis" /&gt; while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased.&lt;ref name="GDP 1913 to 2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-36.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511134314/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-36.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 11, 2005 |title=Consumer and Gross Domestic Price Indices: 1913 to 2002 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |format=PDF |year=2003 |accessdate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales increased by 40%.&lt;ref name="Statistical Abstract 1964"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1964-01.pdf | title = Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1964 | publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce| format = PDF | date = July 1964 | accessdate =March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until 1969, and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Economic Analysis" /&gt;

Attorney General Robert Kennedy took the position that [[Roger Blough|steel executives]] had illegally colluded to fix prices. He stated, "We're going for broke. ... . their expense accounts, where they've been and what they've been doing. ... . the FBI is to interview them all. ... . we can't lose this."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=298}} The administration's actions influenced [[U.S. Steel]] to rescind the price increase.&lt;ref name="Time 1962"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Presidency: Smiting the Foe | date = April 20, 1962 | work = TIME | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873526-3,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that the administration had acted "by naked power, by threats, [and] by agents of the state security police."{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=645}} Yale law professor [[Charles Reich]] opined in ''[[The New Republic]]'' that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U.S. Steel for collusion so quickly.{{sfn|O'Brien|2005|p=645}} An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Kennedy's actions and said that the steel industry's price increase "imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation."&lt;ref name="NY Times 1962"&gt;{{cite news | title = Inflation in Steel | date = April 12, 1962 | work = New York Times | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00615FD3F5C117B93C0A8178FD85F468685F9&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Inflation%20in%20Steel&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the GDP as well as a net budget surplus.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=300}} The stock market, which had steadily declined since Kennedy's election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry took place.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=318–320}}

====Federal and military death penalty====
During his administration, Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/DATA%20FEDERAL.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030413002030/http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/DATA%20FEDERAL.htm | archivedate = April 13, 2003 | title = Executions 1790 to 1963 | publisher = Web.archive.org | date = April 13, 2003 | accessdate =February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Feguer]] was sentenced to death by an Iowa federal court and was executed on March 15, 1963.&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2001"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/06/us/federal-executions-have-been-rare-but-may-increase.html | title = Federal Executions Have Been Rare but May Increase | date = May 6, 2001 | last = Goldberg |first = Carey | work = The New York Times | accessdate =February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12, 1962, changing the penalty to life in prison.&lt;ref name="Riechmann 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=5468945 | title = Bush: Former Army cook's crimes warrant execution | work = [[ABC News]] | last = Riechmann | first= Deb | agency = Associated Press | date = July 29, 2008 | accessdate =February 23, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731085456/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=5468945 | archivedate = July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law HR5143 (PL87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for [[First degree murder in the United States|first degree murder]] suspects in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty.&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org leg"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/Ready-Reference/Legislative-Summary-Main-Page/District-of-Columbia.aspx | title = Legislative Summary: District of Columbia | accessdate =June 8, 2015 | publisher = [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957, and has now been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.norton.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=478 | title = Norton Letter to U.S. Attorney Says Death Penalty Trial That Begins Today Part of Troubling and Futile Pattern | date = January 8, 2007 | accessdate =February 23, 2012 | publisher = Office of Congresswoman [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil Rights Movement====
[[File:Thurgood Marshall 1957-09-17.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thurgood Marshall]], appointed to the federal bench by Kennedy in May 1961]]
The turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. [[Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] was the established law in the [[Deep South]].&lt;ref name=Grantham_p156&gt;Grantham (1988), ''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] had ruled in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that [[racial segregation]] in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=292–293}}

Kennedy verbally supported [[racial integration]] and civil rights; during his 1960 presidential campaign, he telephoned [[Coretta Scott King]], wife of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=292–293}} Upon taking office in 1961, Kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats controlled congressional legislation.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} Historian Carl M. Brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} During his first year in office, Kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his May appointment of civil rights attorney [[Thurgood Marshall]] to the federal bench. {{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}}

In his first State of the Union Address in January 1961, President Kennedy said, "The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race – at the ballot box and elsewhere – disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage."&lt;ref&gt;"John F. Kennedy", Urs Swharz, Paul Hamlyn, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, including anti-poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|pp=60, 66}}

Kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the Cold War, Bay of Pigs fiasco, and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated by his brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to "keep the president out of this civil rights mess." Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm, {{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} especially concerning the [[Freedom Riders]], who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. Kennedy assigned [[federal marshal]]s to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to "get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=123–126}} Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up "hated memories of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]" after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] among conservative Southern whites.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}}

On March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 10925]], which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Executive Order 10925|wikisource – Executive Order No. 10925]]&lt;/ref&gt; It established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission#Background|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]]. Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King, Jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of [[Second Emancipation Proclamation]]. Kennedy did not execute the order.&lt;ref name=kennedyandking1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_emancipation_proclamation_1893/|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=September 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031012658/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_emancipation_proclamation_1893/|archive-date=October 31, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1962, [[James Meredith]] enrolled at the [[University of Mississippi]] but was prevented from entering. In response to that, Robert Kennedy, now U.S. Attorney General, sent 400 federal marshals, while President Kennedy reluctantly sent 3,000 troops after the situation on campus turned out violent.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=71}} The [[Ole Miss riot of 1962]] left two people dead and a dozen others injured, but Meredith did finally enroll for class. Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began doubting as to whether the "evils of Reconstruction" of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=490}} The instigating subculture at the Old Miss riot, and at many other racially ignited events, was the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Gitlin_p29&gt;Gitlin (2009), ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed [[Executive Order 11063]], which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or "related facilities".{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=580}}

Both the President and the Attorney General were concerned about King's ties to suspected Communists [[Jack O'Dell]] and [[Stanley Levison]]. After the President and his civil rights expert [[Harris Wofford]] pressed King to ask both men to resign from the SCLC, King agreed to ask only O'Dell to resign from the organization and allowed Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain.&lt;ref name=kennedyandking2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_kennedy_robert_francis_19251968/index.html |title=Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King, Jr., his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: "If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=467}} Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.&lt;ref&gt;In the first week of June there were 160 incidents of violence. {{harvnb|Reeves|1993|p=515}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Robert and Ted Sorenson pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=515}}

[[File:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Kennedy's [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]], June 11, 1963]]

On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] blocked the [[Stand in the Schoolhouse Door|doorway]] to the [[University of Alabama]] to stop two African American students, [[Vivian Malone]] and [[James Hood]], from attending. Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama [[United States National Guard|U.S. National Guard]], which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening Kennedy gave his famous [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=521–523}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkcivilrights.htm | title = Civil Rights Address | accessdate =September 20, 2007 | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | work = AmericanRhetoric.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His proposals became part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader, [[Medgar Evers]], in front of his home in Mississippi.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|p=966}} As the president had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=524}} When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complemented Kennedy on his remarks, the latter bitterly replied, "Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House." He then added, "But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did."{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=357}} On June 16, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially "moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment" in regards to civil rights he "now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life."{{sfn|Goduti Jr.|2012|p=206}}

Earlier, Kennedy had signed the executive order creating the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] on December 14, 1961.&lt;ref name="executive order"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=58918/ | title = John F. Kennedy: Executive Order 10980 | accessdate =January 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission. The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in October 1963.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=433}} Further, on June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] and abolished wage disparity based on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.html |title=The Equal Pay Act Turns 40 |publisher=Archive.eeoc.gov |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626131413/http://archive.eeoc.gov/epa/anniversary/epa-40.html |archivedate=June 26, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of Meeting with Leaders of the March on Washington August 28, 1963 - NARA - 194276.jpg|thumb|Kennedy meets with leaders of the [[March on Washington]] in the Oval Office, August 28, 1963]]

Over a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans gathered in Washington for the civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|N.A.A.C.P.]] and Martin Luther King's [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580–584}}

To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580–584}}

Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb exploded]] on Sunday, September 15, at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599–600}} Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=628–631}} Gaining Republican support, Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|Senate filibuster]].{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=492}} The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B. Johnson, prompted by Kennedy's memory, after his assassination in November, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=492}}

===Civil liberties===

In February 1962,&lt;ref name=kingandkennedy3 /&gt; FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who was suspicious of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker,&lt;ref name="american public radio"&gt;{{cite news | title = The FBI's War on King | publisher = American Public Radio | url = http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/d1.html | accessdate = November 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented the Kennedy Administration with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists. Concerned by these allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months.&lt;ref name=kingandkennedy3 /&gt; Robert Kennedy and the president also both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations. After the associations continued, Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's civil rights organization, in October 1963.&lt;ref name=kingandkennedy3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi/ | title=Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so",{{sfn|Herst|2007|p=372}} Hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.{{sfn|Herst|2007|pp=372–374}} The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.&lt;ref name="the atlantic"&gt;{{cite news | title = The FBI and Martin Luther King | last = Garrow | first = David J. | authorlink = David Garrow | date = July 8, 2002 | publisher = The Atlantic Monthly | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200207/garrow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===

During the 1960 campaign Kennedy proposed an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin. He saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=60440 | title = From Press Office: Senator John F.

Woolley, The American Presidency Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms later became [[United States Code|law]] through the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia. The policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification. The late-president's brother, Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] helped steer the legislation through the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5393857 | title = Q&amp;A: Sen.

===Native American relations===

{{further|Kinzua Dam#Native Americans|Seneca nation#Kinzua Dam}}

Construction of the [[Kinzua Dam]] flooded {{convert|10000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of [[Seneca nation]] land that they had occupied under the [[Treaty of Canandaigua|Treaty of 1794]], and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to [[Salamanca (town), New York|Salamanca, New York]]. Kennedy was asked by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.{{sfn|Bilharz|2002|p=55}}&lt;ref name="Kennedy letter 1961"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = John F. | url = http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8279 | title = 320—Letter to the President of the Seneca Nation of Indians Concerning the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River | publisher = The American Presidency Project | date = August 11, 1961 | accessdate =February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space policy===
{{further|Space Race|Space policy of the United States}}

The [[Apollo program]] was conceived early in 1960, during the Eisenhower administration, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]], to be used as a shuttle to an Earth-orbital [[space station]], flights around the Moon, or landing on it. While [[NASA]] went ahead with planning for Apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;Murray and Cox, ''Apollo'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; As senator, Kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=138}}

In constructing his Presidential administration, Kennedy elected to retain Eisenhower's last science advisor [[Jerome Wiesner]] as head of the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]]. Wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration,{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=145}} having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, ''Future of the US Space Program'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Anold S. (1982). [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4102/ch2.htm ''Managing NASA in the Apollo Era'', chapter 27, "The Lunar Landing Decision and Its Aftermath". NASA SP-4102.]&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for NASA administrator before the post was accepted by [[James E. Webb]], an experienced Washington insider who served President Truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. Webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress, the President, and the American people.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}} Kennedy also persuaded Congress to amend the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President,
{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}}{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=115–116}} both because of the knowledge of the space program Johnson gained in the Senate working for [[the creation of NASA]], and to help keep the politically savvy Johnson occupied.{{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=146}}

In Kennedy's January 1961 State of the Union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=502}} Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program, but postponed any decision out of deference to Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=138}} Kennedy's advisors speculated that a Moon flight would be prohibitively expensive,{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=392}} and he was considering plans to dismantle the Apollo program due to its cost.&lt;ref&gt;Sidey, Hugh (1964), ''John F. Kennedy'', pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|Kennedy proposing a program to Congress that will land men on the Moon, May 1961. Johnson and Sam Rayburn are seated behind him.]]
However, this quickly changed on April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=393}} Kennedy now became eager for the U.S. to take the lead in the [[Space Race]], for reasons of national security and prestige. On April 20, he sent a memo to Johnson, asking him to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.&lt;ref name="jfkmemo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/6XnAYXEkkkSMLfp7ic_o-Q.aspx |title=Memorandum for Vice President |last=Kennedy |first=John F. |authorlink=John F.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...  I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.

After Congress authorized the funding, Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a [[Kennedy Space Center|Launch Operations Center]] for the [[Saturn V|large Moon rocket]] northwest of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], and a [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] on land donated through [[Rice University]] in [[Houston]], Texas. Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another [[We choose to go to the Moon|speech]] at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ...&amp;nbsp;We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.&lt;ref name="Kennedy at Rice 1961"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcast.rice.edu/speeches/19620912kennedy.html |title=President John F.

On November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JFK and the Space Race |last=Selverstone |first=Marc |publisher=White House Tapes–Presidential Recordings Program, Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |url=http://whitehousetapes.net/exhibit/jfk-and-space-race |accessdate=February 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205812/http://whitehousetapes.net/exhibit/jfk-and-space-race |archivedate=March 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well.

In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space, specifically recommending that Apollo be switched to "a joint expedition to the Moon".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:John F. Kennedy's Address Before the 18th General Assembly of the United Nations|Wikisource: John F.

[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The Kennedys and the Connallys in the presidential limousine moments before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] in Dallas]]

President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|Central Standard Time]] on Friday, November 22, 1963. He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals [[Ralph Yarborough]] and [[Don Yarborough]] (no relation) and conservative [[John Connally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Russ |url=http://www.lifeinlegacy.com/display.php?weekof=September |title=26, 2009#P12844 Life in Legacy |publisher=Lifeinlegacy.com |accessdate=March 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512002820/http://lifeinlegacy.com/display.php?weekof=September |archivedate=May 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling in a presidential [[motorcade]] through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/press.htm|title=Doctors attending to Kennedy reported.|accessdate=May 15, 2018|date=November 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was taken to [[Parkland Hospital]] for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later. He was 46 years old and had been in office for 1,036 days. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], an order filler at the [[Texas School Book Depository]] from which the shots were suspected to have been fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer [[J.D. Tippit]], and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a [[wikt:patsy|patsy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZYAIiErTNg Lee Oswald claiming innocence (film)], Youtube.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 20, p. 366, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh20/html/WH_Vol20_0193b.htm Kantor Exhibit No. 3—Handwritten notes made by Seth Kantor concerning events surrounding the assassination]&lt;/ref&gt; and was killed by [[Jack Ruby]] on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.

President Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the [[Warren Commission]]—chaired by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]—to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=497}} The results of this investigation are disputed by many.&lt;ref name="Russo"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/did-castro-ok-kennedy-assassination Gus Russo and Stephen Molton] "Did Castro OK the Kennedy Assassination?," ''American Heritage'', Winter 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in [[history of the United States|U.S. history]] because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions.

A [[Requiem Mass]] was celebrated for Kennedy at the [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] on November 25, 1963. The funeral was officiated by Father [[John J. Cavanaugh]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=211}} Afterwards, Kennedy was interred in a small plot, 20&amp;nbsp;by 30&amp;nbsp;ft., in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Over a period of three years (1964–1966), an estimated 16&amp;nbsp;million people visited his grave. On March 14, 1967, Kennedy's remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial. It was from this memorial that the graves of both Robert and Ted Kennedy were modeled.

The [[honor guard]] at Kennedy's graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of the [[Irish Army]]. Kennedy was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to Ireland, so much so that Jackie Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at her husband's funeral.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=312}}

Kennedy's wife Jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot. JFK's brother Robert [[Robert F. Kennedy assassination|was buried nearby]] in June 1968. In August 2009, Ted was also buried near his two brothers. John F. Kennedy's grave is lit with an "[[John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame|Eternal Flame]]".

The Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, [[Vietnam]], and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby]], as well as his 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other.

Kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the [[media culture]] in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast [[Live television|live]] and made good use of the medium.&lt;ref name="american chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |publisher=American Chronicle |date=March 15, 2006 |title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference—93 years young! |first=Robert |last=Rouse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |archivedate=September 13, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio-Television News Directors Association]] presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]] Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/article/rtdna_s_kennedy_connections#.U4VGzi8-Ngc |title=RTDNA's Kennedy connections|publisher=[[Radio Television Digital News Association]], November 26, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House, and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.

The president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as "[[Twist (dance)|Twisting]] at the White House". [[Vaughn Meader|Vaughn Meader's]] ''First Family'' comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. On May 19, 1962, [[Marilyn Monroe]] sang "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" at a large party in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]], celebrating Kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday.

==="Camelot Era"===
{{other uses|Camelot|King Arthur}}
The term "Camelot" came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the Kennedy administration, and the charisma of Kennedy and his family. The term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] interview with [[Theodore H. White]], in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary [[Camelot (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]], particularly the closing lines of the title song:&lt;ref name="JFKlibrary.org White. Series 11. Camelot Documents"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060906065903/http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical%2BResources/Archives/Archives%2Band%2BManuscripts/fa_white_theodore.htm The Personal Papers of Theodore H.

===Health===
In 2002 [[Robert Dallek]] wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955–1963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of White House physician Dr. [[Janet Travell]]. According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a "Medicine Administration Record," cataloguing Kennedy's medications: "injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and [[Tuinal]] to help him sleep."&lt;ref name = "Dallek"/&gt;

Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at [[The London Clinic]] with [[Addison's disease]], a rare endocrine disorder. In 1966 Dr. Travell revealed that Kennedy also had [[hypothyroidism]]. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had [[autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2]] (APS 2).&lt;ref name="Mandel, Lee R. 2009 350–354"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel, Lee R. | title = Endocrine and Autoimmune Aspects of the Health History of John F. Kennedy | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | year = 2009 | issue = 151(5) | pages = 350–354 | url = http://www.annals.org/content/151/5/350.full#xref-ref-9-1 | pmid = 19721023 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-151-5-200909010-00011 | volume = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the [[American Medical Association]]'s ''Archives of Surgery''. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 [[Vienna Summit]] with Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, [[hypertension]], impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=213}} Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, [[Max Jacobson]], was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/dr-feelgood/20251/ New York Sun September 20, 2005: "Dr. Feelgood"] Retrieved July 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=42, 158-159}}

Into late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. The president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}} During that time, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=244}} Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Online NewsHour with Senior Correspondent [[Ray Suarez]] and physician Jeffrey Kelman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20021122141641/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec02/jfk_11-18.html "Pres. Kennedy's Health Secrets"], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' transcript, November 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The President's primary White House physician, George Burkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care.&lt;ref name="jfkwhmd"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghaemi M.D., M.P.H.|first1=Nassir|title=What Jackie Kennedy Didn't Say—and Didn't Know|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mood-swings/201109/what-jackie-kennedy-didnt-say-and-didnt-know|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later observed that President Kennedy's leadership (e.g. the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis and other events during 1963) improved greatly once the treatments of Jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under Burkley. Dr. Ghaemi, who studied Kennedy's medical records, concluded there was a "correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either".&lt;ref name="jfkwhmd"/&gt;

===Personal tragedies===

[[File:The Kennedys by Toni Frissell, 1953.jpg|thumb|right|The newlyweds surrounded by Jack's siblings on their wedding day in Newport, Rhode Island in 1953]]
Kennedy and his family have experienced a number of personal tragedies. His older brother [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]] was killed in action in 1944 at age 29, when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a first attack execution of [[Operation Aphrodite]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/08/operation-aphrodite/|title=Operation Aphrodite ‹ HistoricWings.com :: A Magazine for Aviators, Pilots and Adventurers|work=historicwings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's younger sister [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy]] was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal [[lobotomy]] at age 23, leaving her  incapacitated for the rest of her life, until her death in 2005. His younger sister [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen Agnes "Kick" Kennedy]] died in a plane crash en route to France in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a [[miscarriage]] in 1955 and a [[stillbirth]] in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstladies.org/blog/the-children-of-jacqueline-kennedy/|title=The Children of Jacqueline Kennedy|website=www.firstladies.org|access-date=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A son, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], died two days after birth in August 1963.

===Affairs, extramarital relationships and friendships===

Kennedy was single in the 1940s when he had affairs with Danish journalist [[Inga Arvad]]{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=83-85}} and actress [[Gene Tierney]].{{sfn|Osborne|2006|p=195}} Before and after he assumed the presidency, Kennedy reportedly had extramarital affairs with a number of women, including [[Marilyn Monroe]],{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=315–316}} [[Gunilla von Post]],&lt;ref&gt;Bone, James (February 17, 2010), [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7029661.ece "How JFK's Riviera romance led to years of longing"], ''[[The Times]]'', London.

The extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at [[Bing Crosby]]'s house.{{sfn|Leaming|2006|pp=379-380}} Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=581}} J.

Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=116}} According to Reeves, this included "the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians."{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=291}} Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|p=478}}

Though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, Kennedy would often, and even when married, share a bedroom with his lifelong and close friend [[Lem Billings]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara A. Perry]] in ''Rose Kennedy, the Life and Times of a Political Matriarch'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-06895-5}} p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical evaluations and legacy==
The [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Special Forces]] had a special bond with Kennedy. "It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret," said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' who served with Special Forces in Vietnam.{{efn|name=Green Beret|Kennedy reversed the Defense Department rulings that prohibited the Special Forces wearing of the Green Beret. {{harvnb|Reeves|1993|p=116}}.}} This bond was shown at [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's funeral]]. At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General [[Michael D. Healy]], the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jfks-personal-connection-to-armys-green-berets/ | title=JFK's personal connection to Army's Green Berets | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidents Who Served in the U.S. Navy |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-1.htm |date=January 11, 2007 |work=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Naval History &amp; Heritage Command]] |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505163726/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-1.htm |archivedate=May 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another [[special forces]] command, the [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Navy SEALs Were Launched in the JFK 'Man on the Moon' Speech | url = http://www.life.com/gallery/60031/image/1597398#index/1 | work = 11 Facts About Navy SEALs | publisher = [[Time Inc.]] | accessdate =May 12, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.&lt;ref name="Salinger p97"&gt;{{cite book | title = John F.

Kennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=594-606, 644}} President Lyndon B.

Many of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as Abraham Lincoln, [[George Washington]], and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington. In 2018, ''[[The Times]]'' published an audio recreation of the "watchmen on the walls of world freedom" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the [[Dallas Market Center|Dallas Trade Mart]] on November 22, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jfk-video-hear-kennedys-lost-dallas-speech-in-his-own-voice-xtkvhm255 |title=JFK video: hear Kennedy's 'lost' Dallas speech in his own voice |author=Rogan, Aaron |date=March 15, 2018 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/Dallas-TX-Trade-Mart-Undelivered_19631122.aspx |title=Remarks Prepared for Delivery at the Trade Mart in Dallas, TX, November 22, 1963 [Undelivered] |author=Kennedy, John F. |date=November 22, 1963 |publisher=John F.

He was posthumously awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award|''Pacem in Terris'' Award]] ([[Latin]]: Peace on Earth). It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations.

Kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father. He is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent. His maternal grandmother, Mary Josephine "Josie" Hannon, died in August 1964, nine months after his assassination.

Throughout the [[English-speaking world]], the given name ''[[Kennedy (given name)|Kennedy]]'' has sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy, as well his brother Robert.&lt;ref name="Hanks-157"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hanks |first1=Patrick |last2=Hardcastle |authorlink1=Patrick Hanks |first2=Kate |last3=Hodges |first3=Flavia | title = A Dictionary of First Names |edition=2nd |series=Oxford Paperback Reference | year = 2006 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford]] | isbn = 978-0-19-861060-1| page = 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of assassination===
Television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy's assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Walter Cronkite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cronkite|first=Walter|title=A Reporter's Life|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A.

Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event of its kind. TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Carter | first = Bill | title = Viewers Again Return To Traditional Networks |newspaper=The New York Times | date = September 15, 2001 | page = A14 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/us/after-the-attacks-television-viewers-again-return-to-traditional-networks.html?pagewanted=print }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the U.S. but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, before it and the [[September 11 attacks]] after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination: "all of us. ... . will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours." Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the Vietnam War.

Ultimately, the death of President Kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment—a point made by commentators from [[Gore Vidal]] to [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] and implied by [[Oliver Stone]] in several of his films, such as his landmark 1991 [[JFK (film)|''JFK'']].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''John Frederick Parker''' (May 19, 1830 – June 28, 1890) was an American [[police officer]] for the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]]. Parker was one of four men detailed to act as [[United States]] President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s bodyguard on April 14, 1865, the night Lincoln was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated at Ford's Theatre]].

==Career==
Parker was born May 19, 1830, in [[Winchester, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Could Have Saved Lincoln's Life.|date=August 11, 1890|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] where he worked as a [[carpenter]]. He became one of Washington's original [[police officers]] when the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] was created in 1861.&lt;ref name=missing1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/lincolns-missing-bodyguard-12932069/?no-ist=&amp;page=1|title=Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard|last=Martin|first=Paul|date=April 8, 2010|publisher=smithsonianmag.com|page=1|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as an officer, he was charged with [[dereliction of duty]] and [[conduct unbecoming an officer]] several times for being drunk on duty, sleeping on streetcars while at work, and visiting a [[brothel]] (Parker claimed the madam had sent for him). Parker was typically reprimanded for these acts but never fired.&lt;ref name=missing1 /&gt;

==Lincoln's assassination==
[[File:John Frederick Parker grave - Glenwood Cemetery - 2014-09-19.jpg|thumb|Unmarked grave of John Frederick Parker at Glenwood Cemetery.]]
On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln, his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], [[Major]] [[Henry Rathbone]] and his fiancée [[Clara Harris]] were attending the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]]. Parker was assigned to guard the entrance to the President's box where the four were seated.  He is known to have, at first, stayed at his assigned post, but he later told family members that he was then released by Lincoln until the end of the play.  During the intermission, Parker went to a nearby tavern with Lincoln's [[footman]] and [[coachman]].&lt;ref name=missing1 /&gt;

It is unclear whether Parker ever returned to the theater, but he was not at his post when [[John Wilkes Booth]] shot the President. Parker was charged with neglect of duty and tried on May 3, 1865 but no transcripts of the case were kept. The complaint was dismissed on June 2, 1865. Despite leaving his post the night Lincoln was shot, Parker was still assigned to work security at the [[White House]]. Before Mary Todd Lincoln moved out of the White House following her husband's death, Parker was assigned as her bodyguard. Mrs. Lincoln's dressmaker [[Elizabeth Keckley]] overheard Mrs. Lincoln yell to Parker, "So you are on guard tonight, on guard in the White House after helping to murder the President."&lt;ref name=missing2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/lincolns-missing-bodyguard-12932069/?no-ist=&amp;page=2 |title=Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard |last=Martin |first=Paul |date=April 8, 2010 |publisher=smithsonianmag.com |page=2 |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker attempted to defend himself stating that he "could never stoop to murder much less to the murder of so good and great a man as the President. I did wrong, I admit, and have bitterly repented." Mrs. Lincoln told Parker that she would always think he was responsible for the President's death and angrily dismissed him from the room.&lt;ref name=missing2 /&gt;

==Later years and death==
Parker remained on the police force until 1868 when he was fired for sleeping on duty. He later went back to work as a carpenter.&lt;ref name=missing2 /&gt;

He died of [[pneumonia]] complicated by [[asthma]] and [[Fatigue (physical)|exhaustion]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 28, 1890. He was buried in an unmarked grave at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Glenwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funerals|newspaper=The Evening Star|date=June 30, 1890|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, Mary America Maus, was buried next to him upon her death in 1904 as were their three children. There are no known images of him and his grave is unmarked to signify his contribution to the president’s death.&lt;ref name=missing2 /&gt;

The image turned out to be a politically motivated [[forgery]], intended to link Kerry with Fonda, who many consider a [[Treason|traitor]] after her [[Jane Fonda#Controversial visit to Hanoi|controversial visit to Hanoi]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

==Forgery==

The image is a composite of two different images: one of Kerry taken on June 13, 1971, at an anti-war rally in [[Mineola, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.corbis.com/popup/Enlargement.aspx?mediauids={338a3aeb-1175-4b9d-af11-24813cd42c33}&amp;#124;{ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff}&amp;qsPageNo=1&amp;fdid=&amp;Area=Search&amp;TotalCount=48&amp;CurrentPos=5|title= Image of Kerry at anti-war rally, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Fonda taken in August, 1972, speaking at a [[Miami Beach, Florida]] rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.corbis.com/popup/Enlargement.aspx?mediauids={d869c683-c8c8-48cd-9bd0-d5bab723c75c}&amp;#124;{ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff}&amp;qsPageNo=4&amp;fdid=&amp;Area=Search&amp;TotalCount=198&amp;CurrentPos=19 |title=Image of Jane Fonda at anti-war rally, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="famouspictures"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.famouspictures.org/altered-images/#KerryFondaRally2004|title = Famous Pictures Magazine - Altered Images|publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-10-01 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The images were combined and then further altered to appear as if the combined image was from an old newspaper clipping.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |date=1 March 2004|url = http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp|title = John Kerry|publisher = [[Snopes]]| accessdate = 2007-10-01 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A caption was also added stating, "Actress And Anti-War Activist Jane Fonda Speaks to a crowd of Vietnam Veterans as Activist and Former Vietnam Vet John Kerry (LEFT) listens and prepares to speak next concerning the war in Vietnam (AP Photo)" even though Fonda was not present when Kerry gave his speech.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web |date= February 20, 2004|url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/02/20/MNG4S54RGO1.DTL|title = Doctored Kerry photo brings anger, threat of suit|publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| accessdate = 2007-10-01 |first=Carla |last=Marinucci |authorlink=Carla Marinucci |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential media outlet to publish the forgery was ''[[The New York Times]]'', which cited the image in a Sheryl Gay Stolberg story on February 13, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/politics/campaign/13VETS.html?pagewanted=all&amp;gwh=E4DCFE295B3F8220B598DED490D46FFF Conservatives Shine Spotlight on Kerry's Antiwar Record].  February 13, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The image received further attention on many websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2004-02-17/article/18291 Berkeley Daily Planet - Tuesday February 17, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing opponents of Kerry, meanwhile, claimed that the original image of him was fabricated and that the combined image is the real image.

Ken Light, the [[copyright]] owner of the original Kerry image,&lt;ref name="pdnonline"/&gt; has the original [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] and was quoted when asked on what the lesson to be learned from the story:

{{Roman government}} 
The '''King of Rome''' ({{lang-la|Rex Romae}}) was the [[chief magistrate]] of the [[Roman Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/history/morey04.html ''Outline of Roman History''] William C. Morey, Ph.D., D.C.L. New York, Cincinnati, Chicago: American Book Company (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roman mythology|legend]], the first king of Rome was [[Romulus]], who founded the city in 753 BC upon the [[Palatine Hill]]. Seven legendary kings are said to have ruled Rome until 509 BC, when the last king was overthrown. These kings ruled for an average of 35 years.

The kings after [[Romulus]] were not known to be [[Dynasty|dynasts]] and no reference is made to the hereditary principle until after the fifth king [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Tarquinius Priscus]]. Consequently, some have assumed that the Tarquins and their attempt to institute a [[Roman Kingdom|hereditary monarchy]] over this conjectured earlier [[elective monarchy]] resulted in the formation of the [[Roman Republic|republic]].

==Overview==

Early Rome was not self-governing, and was ruled by the king (rex). The king possessed absolute power over the people. The [[Senate of the Roman Kingdom|senate]] was a weak oligarchy, capable of exercising only minor administrative powers, so that Rome was ruled by its king who was in effect an [[absolute monarch]]. The senate's main function was to carry out and administer the wishes of the king. After Romulus, Rome's first legendary king, Roman kings were elected by the people of Rome, sitting as a [[Curiate Assembly]], who voted on the candidate that had been nominated by a chosen member of the senate called an [[interrex]]. Candidates for the throne could be chosen from any source. For example, one such candidate, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]] was originally a citizen and migrant from a neighboring [[Etrusca]]n [[city-state]]. The people of Rome, sitting as the Curiate Assembly, could then either accept or reject the nominated candidate-king.

The insignia of the king was twelve [[lictor]]s wielding the [[fasces]], a throne of a [[Curule chair]], the purple [[Toga|Toga Picta]], red shoes, and a white [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]] around the head. Only the king could wear a purple toga. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The supreme power of the state was vested in the [[king|rex]], whose position gave the following powers:

===Chief Executive===
Beyond his religious authority, the king was invested with the supreme military, executive, and judicial authority through the use of [[imperium]]. The imperium of the king was held for life and protected him from ever being brought to trial for his actions. As being the sole owner of imperium in Rome at the time, the king possessed ultimate [[executive power]] and unchecked military authority as the [[commander-in-chief]] of all Rome's [[Roman legion|legions]]. His executive power and his sole imperium allowed him to issue [[decrees]] with the force of law. Also, the laws that kept citizens safe from the misuse of magistrates owning imperium did not exist during the times of the king.

Another power of the king was the power to either appoint or nominate all officials to offices. The king would appoint a [[Tribune|tribunus celerum]] to serve as both the tribune of Ramnes tribe in Rome but also as the commander of the king's personal bodyguard, the [[Celeres]]. The king was required to appoint the tribune upon entering office and the tribune left office upon the king's death. The tribune was second in rank to the king and also possessed the power to convene the Curiate Assembly and lay legislation before it.

Another officer appointed by the king was the [[praefectus urbi]], which acted as the warden of the city. When the king was absent from the city, the prefect held all of the king's powers and abilities, even to the point of being bestowed with imperium while inside the city. The king even received the right to be the sole person to appoint patricians to the Senate.

===Chief Judge===
The king's imperium granted him both military powers as well as qualified him to pronounce legal judgment in all cases as the chief justice of Rome. Although he could assign pontiffs to act as minor judges in some cases, he had supreme authority in all cases brought before him, both civil and criminal. This made the king supreme in times of both war and peace. While some writers believed there was no appeal from the king's decisions, others believed that a proposal for appeal could be brought before the king by any [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] during a meeting of the [[Roman assemblies|Curiate Assembly]].

To assist the king, a council advised the king during all trials, but this council had no power to control the king's decisions. Also, two criminal detectives (Quaestores Parridici) were appointed by him as well as a two-man criminal court (Duumviri Perduellionis) which oversaw for cases of [[treason]].

===Chief Legislator===
Under the kings, the Senate and Curiate Assembly had very little power and authority; they were not independent bodies in that they possessed the right to meet together and discuss questions of state. They could only be called together by the king and could only discuss the matters the king laid before them. While the Curiate Assembly did have the power to pass laws that had been submitted by the king, the Senate was effectively an honorable council. It could advise the king on his action but, by no means, could prevent him from acting. The only thing that the king could not do without the approval of the Senate and Curiate Assembly was to declare war against a foreign nation. These issues effectively allowed the King to more or less [[rule by decree]] with the exception of the above-mentioned affairs.

==Election==
Whenever a Roman king died, Rome entered a period of ''[[interregnum]]'' (literally: between kings).  Supreme power in the state would be devolved to the Senate, which had the task of finding a new king. The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own members as the [[interrex]] to serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome. After the five-day period, the interrex would appoint (with the Senate's consent) another Senator for another five-day term. This process would continue until the election of a new king. Once the interrex found a suitable nominee for the kingship, he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Senate would examine him.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If the Senate confirmed the nomination, the interrex would convene the Curiate Assembly and preside as its chairman during the election of the King.

Once a candidate was proposed to the Curiate Assembly, the people of Rome could either accept or reject the King-elect. If accepted, the King-elect did not immediately take office: two additional acts had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power. First, it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the [[auspices]], since the king would serve as high priest of Rome. An [[augur]] performed this ceremony by conducting the King-elect to the citadel where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below. If the King-elect was found worthy of the kingship, the augur announced that the gods had given favourable tokens, thus confirming the King-elect’s priestly character. Second the [[imperium]] had to be conferred upon the King. The Curiate Assembly's vote only determined who was to be King, but that act did not bestow the powers of the king upon him. Accordingly, the King himself proposed to the Curiate Assembly a bill granting him imperium, and the Curiate Assembly, by voting in favour of the law, would grant it.

In theory, the people of Rome elected their leader, but the Senate had most of the control over the process.

==Kings of Rome (753–509 BC)==
Since Rome's records were destroyed in [[Battle of the Allia|390 BC when the city was sacked]], it is impossible to know for certain how many kings actually ruled the city, or if any of the deeds attributed to the individual kings, by later writers, are accurate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Titus Tatius]], King of the Sabines, was also joint king of Rome with Romulus for five years, until his death. However he is not traditionally counted among the seven kings of Rome.

==During the Republic==
[[file:Roman kings family tree by shakko.jpg|thumb|Family relations]]
{{main|Roman Republic}}
The [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy]] of Tarquinius Superbus led, in only a very limited way, to the separation of the powers mentioned above.

The actual title of king was retained for the ''rex sacrorum'', who formally remained Rome's first priest. He was forbidden any political or military career, except indeed a seat in the senate. However, the Roman desire to hinder the kingship from becoming important went so far that, even in the area of religion, the king of sacrifices was formally, in all but protocol, subordinated to the first of the [[pontiffs]], the [[pontifex maximus]] (whose position in origin, rather than with the name of priest, is better described as "minister of religion"), to the point that at some point in history, the ''regia'' or royal palace at the Forum Romanum, originally inhabited by the king of sacrifices,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome: From Prehistory to the First Punic War'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. 136 [https://books.google.com/books?id=aEfvR1Qcd0gC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=%22rex+sacrorum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rex%20sacrorum%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; was ceded to the pontifex maximus.&lt;ref&gt;as it is well known that [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] inhabited it&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly enough, one of his major appearances in the public scene was the festival of [[Regifugium]], where he impersonated the king in his being thrown out of the city; also, the consuls themselves retained religious roles vital enough that the office of ''interrex'' was retained for the opening prayer of electional assemblies in case that both consuls had died in office, and the ritual of driving a nail into the temple of Jupiter sometimes even induced a dictatorship. Nor was the rex sacrorum elected publicly, but chosen by the pontifical college.

The king of sacrifices retained some religious rites only he could perform, and acted as quasi-[[flamen]] to [[Janus]]. He seems to have existed until the official adoption of the Christian religion. To qualify for the office, [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] ancestry was necessary; however it was once performed by a member of a family otherwise known as plebeian, the ''Marcii'', earning for himself and his descendants the [[cognomen]] ''Rex''.

As has been mentioned, the administrative functions in religion, including at some point the housing in the ancient royal court, were ceded to the supreme pontiff.

The previous role of the king in choosing new [[Roman Senate|senators]] and dismissing people from the senate was ceded to the [[Roman Censor|censors]], albeit in the late republic, the first of these functions was rather limited as all magistrates down to the rank of quaestor gradually had gained admission to the senate after the office's expiration.

The modern concept of a head of state, insofar as the republican times excepting the dictatorships are concerned, can hardly be translated to Roman conceptions, but basically all other powers—the [[imperium]]—were ceded to the [[Roman consul|consul]]s (the etymology suggests that these were originally the king's chief counsellors) and, after the creation of the office (about 367, according to [[Livy]], thereby at least roughly separating the judiciary from the executive), the praetors ("leaders"&lt;ref&gt;Before the formal establishment of the office of praetor below the consulate, this was at least another generic name, and quite possibly another title, of the consuls, cf. the names "praetorium" for the military leader's tent etc.&lt;/ref&gt;). According to tradition (which is disputed by historians for the first decades), the consulate was however always entrusted to two persons for hindering dominance; for emergency situations a [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] was introduced. Later, also [[proconsul]]s and [[propraetor]]s could be given an imperium by appointment of the [[senate]]. Whoever used the ''imperium'' to victoriously lead an army could acquire the title of [[imperator]], which later became chief title to the emperors, who were technically included in the system as proconsuls over [[Imperial provinces|most]] (and the strategically most important parts) of the empire, [[princeps senatus|chief senator]]s, and [[Tribune#Plebeian tribune|popular tribune]]s without the title. The republican idea that all promagisterial imperium ends upon entering the city was not observed in the emperors' case.

At the same time, the legislation was practically passed from the [[Curiate Assembly]] to the [[Centuriate Assembly]] (and [[Tribal Assembly]]), exception the more-or-less formality of a [[lex curiata de imperio]] which ratified the elections of the previous Centuriate Assembly. The consuls did however retain the power to rule by ordinance.

[[Image:I-45 &amp; Louetta Rita Evacuation.jpg|thumb|Evacuees fleeing [[Hurricane Rita]] in Texas, United States]]

This '''list of mass evacuations''' includes [[emergency evacuation]]s of a large number of people in a short period of time. An emergency evacuation is the movement of persons from a dangerous place due to the threat or occurrence of a disastrous event whether from [[Natural disaster|natural]] or [[Man-made hazards|man made]] causes or as the result of [[war]].

==Ancient times==
* 480 BC – The [[Greece|Greek]] officer of state and navy commander [[Themistocles]] ordered the evacuation of [[Athens]] as a strategic countermeasure to the approaching [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army, leading to 100,000 inhabitants being displaced in the late summer.

==1st century==
* 60–61 – [[Boudica's uprising]] results in the mass evacuation of numerous [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlements in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. 
* 79 – Eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] causes evacuation of [[Pompeii]] and surrounding areas.

==5th century==
* 410 – [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] by [[Visigoths]] under [[Alaric I]]. Many [[Rome, Italy|Romans]] were either taken captive and sold into slavery or later fled the devastated city.

==13th century==
* 1237–1293 – [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]: Many thousands in eastern [[Europe]] are displaced or flee before each of several Mongol expeditions.

==14th century==
* 1351 – Peak of the [[Black Death]], which [[Consequences of the Black Death|led to mass evacuations]] in numerous cities, ports, and villages in Asia, Europe, and [[Egypt]].

==19th century==
* 1836 – The [[Battle of the Alamo|Fall of the Alamo]] results in a mass evacuation of American, [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Tejano]], and [[Texian]] persons in what is known as the [[Runaway Scrape]].

==20th century==
[[File:Evacuees from Mount Pinatubo board the USS Abraham Lincoln.jpg|thumb|U.S. military dependents board {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}} in the aftermath of the [[Mount Pinatubo#The 1991 eruption|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]].]]
* April 20, 1906 – The resultant fire of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] leads to evacuation by sea of 20,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of the San Francisco Earthquake|publisher=The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/06timeline.html|accessdate=2007-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Between March 1937 and October 1938, nearly 3,000 children were evacuated from [[Spain]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Most of the children were from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Asturias]], and [[Cantabria]]. On June 12, 1937 over 1,500 children and 75 tutors (teachers, doctors, and nurses) left the Port of [[Santurtzi]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] province of [[Bizkaia]] on board the ship "Habana." Similarly, nearly 4,000 children were evacuated to the United Kingdom, also on the "Habana", with the [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS Hood]] as an escort. They became, and are still known as, "los niños de la guerra" ("the war children") or the "Gernika Generation" (as regards Basques).
* September 1939 – The [[evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II]]; at the outset of [[World War II]], [[London]] and major [[Great Britain|British]] cities were evacuated, with 1.5 million displaced in the first three days of the official evacuation. The final number of evacuees reached 3.75 million.
* 1939–1940 and June 1944 – The entire population of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Karelia]], 522,000 people, was [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|evacuated]] during the [[Winter War]]. Some 260,000 of these returned home during the [[Continuation War]], but were evacuated again in June 1944.
* May–June 1940 – [[Operation Dynamo]] was implemented, with around 439,000 British and French troops evacuated from [[Dunkirk, France]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18lsxFcDrjo&lt;/ref&gt;
* 20–23 June 1940 – 24,600 people, a third of the population, are evacuated from the [[Channel Islands]] to [[England]] and [[Scotland]] ahead of the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands#Invasion|German invasion]].
* October 1940 – 1945 – [[Evacuations of children in Germany during World War II]]
* October 1941 – A mass evacuation of [[Moscow]] was ordered in the face of the threat of the war estimated 1.5 million to 3 million [[Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]]. Two million inhabitants were displaced within two weeks.
*1942 – 1945 – Evacuation and deportation of [[Ingrian Finns]] from [[Ingria]] during and after World War II. About the entire population of Ingrian Finns (estimating 70,000 people) was evacuated from [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad oblast]], [[Russia]] to [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]]. Those who returned after the war faced deportations to other parts of Russia.
* Autumn 1944-Spring 1945 – [[Evacuation of East Prussia]] (1.8 million people) and [[Pomerania]] (various estimates range between 3 and 7 million; see [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II]])

This is a list of '''professional sports leagues'''.

A [[sports league]] is a [[professional sports league organization|professional body]] that governs the competition of its teams.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} They make the rules for competition and behavior and disciplines its members as necessary. This is done through a structure that varies by league. Some are made up of a board of governors that have a commissioner or president, while others are single entity organizations where the league owns the franchises and therefore does not have a board of governors.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}

This list attempts to show those sports leagues for which all players and teams are paid to play. In other words, these players can be considered to play their chosen sport as their [[profession]]. Some leagues don't pay well enough to allow players to use them as their primary or only source of income, but because the players are paid, it's still considered [[professional#Sports| professional]], or [[semi-professional]]. As such, some leagues listed here may not be fully professional.

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 1973''' was the selection for the 14th song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 13th time that this system of picking a song had been used. 10 songwriters were selected by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] for the competition. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1|TV1]] but was not broadcast on radio.

The third place act, Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Björn &amp; Benny, returned to take part in Melodifestivalen 1974 under their new moniker [[ABBA]].

This year (1973) was completely erased from the Swedish archives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13830">The '''''Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno''''' is a musical setting of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]], for 40 and 60 voices, by [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] composer [[Alessandro Striggio]].  It probably dates from 1565–6, during the reign of his employer [[Cosimo I de' Medici]].  Lost for more than 400 years, it was recently rediscovered in Paris.  Most of the mass is for five separate choirs of 8 voices each, with the closing [[Agnus Dei]] being for five separate choirs of 12 voices each; all of the voice parts are fully independent.  With its huge [[polychoral]] forces, climaxing on sixty fully independent parts, it is the largest known [[polyphony|polyphonic]] composition from the entire era.

==Background==

[[File:FrancescoI-BR.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco I de' Medici]], Striggio's correspondent regarding his Mass setting during his diplomatic journey. Portrait by [[Agnolo Bronzino]].]]The court of the [[Medici]] was long known for its patronage of the arts, including music, and the Medici rulers, from [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]] to Cosimo I de' Medici, were particularly noted for their love of music.  Keenly aware that their status depended on not only employing the most talented artists and musicians, but having them create spectacular works and having them disseminated, they encouraged composers to write music which exceeded that of their contemporaries in size and scope.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1530s and 1540s, [[Francesco Corteccia]], who was the principal composer for the first part of Cosimo's reign, wrote series of elaborate [[intermedio|intermedii]]—groups of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s designed to be performed between the acts of plays, sung by actors in costume and accompanied by instruments.  This musical form was one of the predecessors of opera.&lt;ref&gt;Nutter, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;

In the realm of sacred music, the desire of the Medici for opulence was no less.  Instead of decorating plays with madrigals interspersed between the acts, however, the Medici's court composer – who was Striggio by the 1560s – chose to create works for larger groups of voices than had been attempted before, and to accompany these already massive vocal forces with instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Fenlon, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;  His first attempt was apparently the ''Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno'', and some time later he followed this with a 40-voice motet setting, ''[[Ecce beatam lucem]]'', a piece which has long been known.  Some other gigantic polychoral works from the same time include [[Thomas Tallis]]'s famous and often-performed ''[[Spem in alium|Spem in alium nunquam habui]]'', for 40 voices, which may have been a response to hearing either the motet or the Mass in 1567; [[Stefano Rossetto]]'s 50-voice motet ''Consolamini popule meus''; and Cristofano Malvezzi's 30-voice intermedio for another Medici marriage, ''O fortunato giorno''.  Both Rossetto and Malvezzi were associated with the Medici court.  Preceding these works was a 40-voice motet produced in Munich in 1564 by [[Orlande de Lassus]], which has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

When Striggio completed the enormous mass setting, he carried it with him during a diplomatic trip across Europe to strengthen the dynastic relation brought on by the recent marriage of Francesco de' Medici to Johanna of Austria, who was a [[Habsburg]].  His trip consisted of a series of visits to new Medici in-laws, including [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], the Holy Roman Emperor.  It was necessary to give them something splendid, and this was likely a performance of the colossal 40 and 60 voice mass, along with a copy for their archives.  Leaving [[Florence]] in December 1566, he visited [[Mantua]], and then made the difficult winter trek over the [[Brenner Pass]], visiting [[Vienna]], [[Brno]], [[Munich]], and [[Paris]].  In June 1567 he made his way to [[London]] with the specific purpose of meeting "the virtuosos in the profession of music that were there" (as he wrote in a letter to [[Francesco I de' Medici]], dated 18 May 1567).  While in England, he almost certainly met [[Thomas Tallis]], and it is now considered likely that the ''Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno'' was performed in a private residence – likely the London seat of the [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]], [[Arundel House]] – in order not to offend the authorities (since performance of the [[Roman Catholic]] Mass was at that time prohibited in Protestant England).&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, pp. 17–19, p. 30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss and recovery===

After Striggio's exhausting 1567 European tour with his work, it disappeared for more than four centuries.  While he left copies of it at several locations he visited – the court of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]], the court of [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht V]] in Munich, the court of [[Charles IX of France]] – all copies had been lost.  However, a copy of the mass was made in the early 17th century in France, presumably from the copy Striggio left in Paris for Charles IX.  Because of several corruptions and copyist errors both on the manuscript and in the card catalogue, when the enormous document, which had been transferred to [[Louis XV]] in 1726, from the library of composer [[Sébastien de Brossard]], and then passed to the Paris ''[[Bibliothèque nationale]]'', the mass was attributed to an "Alessandro Strusco" and the "40 voices" had been amended to "4 voices" (presumably the copyist thought the "40" was in error, and removed the extra zero).&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 55-62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davitt Moroney]] claims that it was only in July 2005 that he recovered and identified the work.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  What was subsequently publicised as its first performance in modern times was on 17 July 2007 at a [[The Proms|Proms]] concert in [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where it was sung by the BBC Singers and [[Tallis Scholars]], with His Majestys Sagbutts &amp; Cornetts, conducted by Moroney. However, the website of the Spanish record company Glossa states that their recording of the work uses an edition made in 1978 by French counter-tenor [[Dominique Visse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GlosaaMusic Newsletter|url=http://www.glossamusic.com/glossa/reference.aspx?id=256.html|publisher=glossamusic.com|accessdate=9 November 2014|date=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not stated there whether Visse identified the piece as being by Striggio, or whether he performed it, at that time. In 2011 what was claimed as the "World premiere recording" of the Mass had been issued by Decca; it is performed by [[I Fagiolini]] under the direction of [[Robert Hollingworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Fagiolini Website|url=http://www.ifagiolini.com/recordings/striggio-mass-in-40-parts.html|publisher=ifagiolini.com|accessdate=9 November 2014|date=9 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third CD recording, by Moroney himself, has not yet been issued.

==Music==

Unlike the massive polychoral compositions of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], in which performance groupings were positioned in lofts across from each other in a large space, the choirs in ''Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno'' were probably not meant to be significantly spatially separated.  Although Striggio left no performance directions, the most likely arrangement was for the singers to be positioned in a large semicircle, with the instrumentalists in its center, in view of the singers.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact instruments used, and their number, is not known, but probably varied from performance to performance.  An unusual feature of the mass is the existence of two partbooks for a ''Bassus ad organum'', a part which doubles the composite bass line of the entire composition.  Presumably Striggio used this as a compositional tool, to keep track of the harmonies as he wrote forty to sixty voice parts above it; it also foreshadowed the development of the [[basso continuo]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno'' is probably a [[parody mass]], i.e. one based on a pre-existing polyphonic work, in this case named "Ecco sì beato giorno".  However, no song of this name has yet been found:  it may be a lost work of Striggio himself, or may even be a reference to his similarly titled 40-voice motet ''Ecce beatam lucem''.  The repetition of musical phrases at certain key points in the Mass suggests use of the parody technique, but it has also been suggested that parts of the mass are ''contrafacta'' – music originally written with different words.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 33-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most settings of the Ordinary of the Mass, the work is in five major divisions:

# [[Kyrie]]
# [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]
# [[Credo]]
# [[Sanctus]] – [[Sanctus Benedictus|Benedictus]]
# [[Agnus Dei]]

Striggio saves the full complement of 40 and 60 voices for climactic sections.  The opening "Kyrie Eleison" begins with only one choir of eight voices; the "Christe Eleison" uses two choirs, totalling 16 voices; and the return of the "Kyrie" brings in yet another choir, totalling 24.  The full 40 voices sing together for the first time in the "Gloria", at the words ''Glorificamus te'' (we glorify Thee), presenting the work's first climax.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

Textural contrasts abound.  The "Credo", typically the longest section of any mass setting, uses 40 voices in many places, but intersperses many passages for smaller units.  Sections of the mass which normally have a fuller, more exuberant musical setting, such as the "Et Resurrexit" (and He was resurrected) have all 40 voices, while those which more sedate or sorrowful, for example the "Crucifixus", have the smallest groupings (in this case, only eight voices of one choir sing).&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The closing "Agnus Dei", with 60 voices in five groups of 12, has more independent parts than any other polyphonic composition of the Renaissance.  It begins with all sixty voices entering, one after another, in imitation; once they have all entered, they all sing until the end of the piece, forming a climax to the entire work.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

The enormous work impressed many of its listeners, beginning in Munich, where [[Orlande de Lassus]] was in attendance; the event was similar to one a year later, described by [[Massimo Troiano]], in which another Striggio piece for 40 voices was heard.  After Munich, the piece was performed in Paris, at the house of Luigi Ludovico Gonzaga, [[Duke of Nevers]], and then it was performed in England, where it was heard by English composer [[Thomas Tallis]].  Only Tallis, however, seems to have been inspired to match or out-do it, with his 40-voice ''[[Spem in alium]]''.  In this motet, the singers were probably arranged in a full circle around the listeners.  The imitation pattern that begins ''Spem in alium'' is the same as that which begins this closing Agnus Dei in the Striggio mass, which has been seen as evidence that it was indeed this piece which Tallis heard in London in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Moroney, p. 28-33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
A commercial recording featuring voices and period instruments was released by the British ensemble [[I Fagiolini]] in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Striggio: Mass in 40 Parts; Tallis: Spem in alium, CD review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalcdreviews/8364225/Striggio-Mass-in-40-Parts-Tallis-Spem-in-alium-CD-review.html|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 March 2011|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Sister, My Love''''' is a 2008 novel by [[Joyce Carol Oates]], her 37th published novel. It reimagines the [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey|JonBenét Ramsey]] murder, with the ice-skating champion Bliss Rampike standing in for JonBenét, and is narrated by her surviving older brother, Skyler Rampike.

The book received generally positive reviews, with ''[[USA Today]]'' noting, "Employing her powerful imagination, the gifted Oates gets inside her fictional characters’ tormented souls to solve the case…as a literary exercise, it deserves a rave…she brilliantly depicts status-obsessed parents who alternately push and ignore their deeply unhappy children."

The '''''National Network''''' is an [[English language]] [[List of Nigerian newspapers|Nigerian weekly newspaper]] founded 25 November 2004.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itvradionigeria.com/news/nigerian-media/nigerian-newspapers-2/|title=Nigerian Newspapers|work=Itvradionigeria.com|publisher=Independent Television and Radio|date= |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published by  Network Printing and Publishing Company and has its headquarters in the [[Diobu, Port Harcourt|Diobu]] area of [[Port Harcourt]], [[Rivers State]]. Topics the newspaper covers include local and national main news, sports, business, political events  and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalnetworkonline.com/contact.html|title=National Network Newspapers-  Contact Information| publisher=''Nationalnetworkonline.com''|date= |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''National Network'' celebrated the "seventh" anniversary of its foundation.

Despite its name, the event itself has never been held in [[New Haven]]; instead, it has been held in other Connecticut cities while carrying the slogan "So underground that it's not even in New Haven."&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[http://www.courant.com/entertainment/movies/hc-nhuff.art0sep25,0,6050409.story “Underground Film Festival Moves To West Hartford,” Hartford Courant, September 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

This festival has hosted premieres and screenings of independent, underground and experimental productions from around the world, including a mix of narrative and non-fiction features and shorts. Among the more notable films presented at the festival were ''[[My Big Fat Independent Movie]]'', ''[[Flatland (2007 film)|Flatland]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/tag/new-haven-underground-film-festival/ Underground Film Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Plan 9 from Syracuse]]''.&lt;ref name=HC /&gt;

A '''representative town meeting''', also called "limited town meeting", is a form of municipal legislature particularly common in  [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]], and permitted in [[Maine]] and [[New Hampshire]].

Representative town meetings function largely the same as [[open town meeting]]s, except that not all registered voters can participate or vote.  The townspeople instead elect town meeting members by precinct to represent them and to vote on the issues for them, much like a U.S. Representative votes on behalf of their constituents in [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]].

==Connecticut==
Representative town meetings (RTMs) vary from town to town, and can vary widely in terms of rules and [[bylaws]]. The town of [[Westport, Connecticut]] has non-partisan RTMs, where while a member may belong to a party, it may not be advertised as such, and the [[First Selectman]] may veto any legislation passed excepting for [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://library.municode.com/index.aspx?clientID=14484&amp;stateID=7&amp;statename=Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]], however, requires "minority representation" so that no one party can control the RTM.&lt;ref&gt;http://wethersfieldct.com/government/code-regulations/minority-representation&lt;/ref&gt; [[Groton, Connecticut]] specifically allows for a valid meeting to take place with no less than half the body present, that the meeting must be open to the public, and that senior town officials such as the [[town clerk]] or Superintendent of Schools have all the same rights as members except for voting or raising motions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.town.groton.ct.us/town_gov/EntireCharterRevised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], with a representative town meeting and a Select Board, is the largest town in Connecticut (61,171 population as of 2010 census) with a town meeting / Select Board style of government.

==Maine==
As of January 1, 2013, when [[Sanford, Maine|Sanford]] re-incorporated as a city and eliminated its representative town meetings, no Maine cities or towns operate under a representative town meeting form of government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kjonline.com/news/sanford-becomes-maines-newest-city-two-months-after-vote-by-residents_2013-01-02.html "Sanford Becomes Maine's Newest City"], KJ Online, Jan. 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Open town meeting remains the most common form of local government, dominating in the 431 towns and 34 plantations, while council-manager dominates in the 23 cities.

==Massachusetts==

In 1934, the Representative Town Meeting was introduced in Massachusetts, joining open town meeting, mayor-council, council-manager, and city commission as accepted local governances for municipalities having at least 6,000 inhabitants.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Representative or “Limited” Town Meeting consists of Town Meeting Members elected from election districts or precincts and Members-at-Large. Representative Town Meetings may be formed through a special act of the state legislature, by petitioning the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] to enact a special legislation which applies solely to the individual town, or by using the Home Rule Charter process.  Under the Special Act or charter change processes, even communities of less than 6,000 may adopt a representative town meeting if the residents vote to accept the Special Act or approve a [[town charter|charter]]-change process.&lt;ref name="CGTM"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Hampshire==
[http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/III/49-D/49-D-3.htm NH RSA 49-D-3 III.] provides for Representative Town Meeting, though no town has adopted this form of government.  The representative town meeting is similar to that of the [[Town council#New Hampshire|town council]] form of government, which acts under a charter and is the legislative and governing board of the town, but have different requirements for their respective charters.  

The representative town meeting follows the procedures of a regular town meeting, and have the authority to address all matters which can be legally addressed at the annual or a special town meeting.  Those matters which the law or charter states must be placed on the official ballot of the town, cannot be decided by the representative meeting. To have a representative town meeting, the town must approve a charter which includes the following: 
*the manner of [[district]] representation
*the manner of filling vacancies 
*powers of [[nomination]], appointment, and [[confirmation]]
*requirements for attendance and quorum
*any [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] or eligibility requirements of up to one year in the town or district and continued domicile during term 
*specific procedures for the preparation, presentation, public hearing, and adoption of annual budgets and designation of a [[fiscal year]] 
*an annual municipal election date pursuant to [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIII/669/669-1.htm RSA 669:1]
*bonding of certain town officials and employees where not required by general law
*requirements for periodic independent [[audits]] of all town financial matters by a [[certified public accountant]].

Each elected town official, and the board of selectmen, [[town clerk]], and chairman of the town budget committee are members-at-large.

'''Robert J. O'Neill''' (born April 10, 1976) is a former [[United States Navy]] sailor. A former [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] and [[United States Navy SEALs#Special warfare ratings|special warfare operator]], O'Neill has claimed to have fired the head shots that [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killed]] [[Osama bin Laden]] during the raid on his [[Abbottabad]] compound on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2014-11-06"&gt;{{cite web|title=Osama bin Laden Shooter ID'ed Ahead of Fox Interview|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/militaryintelligence/2014/11/05/bin-laden-shooter-identified/18563131|work=USA Today|first=Meghann|last=Myers|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
O'Neill was born April 10, 1976 in [[Butte, Montana]], where he was raised.&lt;ref name="USA Today 2014-11-06"/&gt; In his youth, his father, Tom, took him hunting and taught him [[sharpshooting]]. In 1995, at age 19, a year after graduating from [[Butte Central Catholic High School]], O'Neill enlisted in the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/butte-community-reacts-to-news-of-local-man-who-killed-bin-laden/29590398|title=Friends describe Butte man who killed Osama bin Laden|author=NBCMontana|work=NBCMontana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
O'Neill initially sought to become a sniper in the [[United States Marine Corps]] where he had known some friends. On the day he arrived at the recruitment office, the Marine recruiter was not in. Instead, a [[United States Navy|Navy]] recruiter suggested that O'Neill enlist in the U.S. Navy, telling him that he could be a sniper in the U.S. Navy SEALs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadingauthorities.com/speakers/robert-oneill.html|title=Robert O'Neill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
O'Neill graduated from Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) Training class 208. O'Neill served with SEAL Team Two from 1997 to 2001 and SEAL Team Four from 2001 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/robert-oneills-military-record-14110/|title=FRobert O’Neill’s Military Record|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, O'Neill joined the elite [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] and completed numerous deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq over the next eight years.

As a member of the U.S. Navy SEALs, O'Neill was reportedly involved in more than 400 missions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert O'Neill: The Man Who Shot bin Laden|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/11212782/Rob-ONeill-The-man-who-shot-bin-Laden.html|work=The Telegraph|first=Harriet|last=Alexander|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the mission to save Captain [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Richard Phillips]] during the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking]], and [[Operation Red Wings]] in which O'Neill helped save [[Marcus Luttrell]].&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2824136/Fellow-SEALs-turn-Team-Six-member-going-public-bin-Laden-killing-Rob-O-Neill-not-truthful-telling-fired-three-bullets-terror-mastermind-s-head.htm|title=Profile|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, having served 16 years, O'Neill left the U.S. Navy, feeling that the choice was best for his family.&lt;ref&gt;https://radio.foxnews.com/podcast/tom-sullivan-show/|Tom Sullivan Show, 4/24/2017: "What, just go to war five more times, and I get $1,200 a month?"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his retirement, he was reportedly earning over $50,000 a year. He is now a public speaker employed by Leading Authorities, a [[speakers bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Kulish, Christopher Drew &amp; Sean D. Naylor, (Nov 07, 2014). [http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/nyt/Another_ex-commando_says_he_shot_Bin_Laden.html Another ex-commando says he shot bin Laden]. Star Advertiser.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill was hired as a contributor for Fox News Channel in 2015 to lend "his military expertise across the cable channel’s daytime and primetime programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/03/12/former-navy-seal-rob-oneill-joins-fox-news.html|title=Former Navy SEAL Rob O’Neill joins FOX News|date=2015-03-12|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Decorations and awards}}O'Neill rose to the rate of [[Senior chief petty officer|senior chief]] special warfare operator (E-8). His 52 decorations include two [[Silver Star]]s, four [[Bronze Star Medal]]s with Valor device, a [[Joint Service Commendation Medal]] with Valor device, three [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citations]], and two [[Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal]]s with Valor device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbir.com/story/entertainment/events/2014/11/06/robert-oneill-in-blount-county/18608263 "Osama bin Laden shooter speaks at Blount Co. event"], wbir.com, November 6, 2014; accessed November 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, O'Neill published ''The Operator'', in which he describes his deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, life as a Navy SEAL, and killing Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Operator/Robert-ONeill/9781501145032|title=The Operator: Firing the Shots that Killed Osama bin Laden and My Years as a SEAL Team Warrior {{!}} Simon &amp; Schuster|date=2017-04-27|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims about participation in Operation Neptune Spear===
{{anchor|Bin Laden killing claim}}The claims that O'Neill killed bin Laden came on October 5, 2014, in anticipation of a [[Fox News]] special called ''The Man Who Killed Osama bin Laden'',&lt;ref name="businessinsider"&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT: The Navy SEAL Who Shot bin Laden Has Been Identified|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/report-the-navy-seal-who-shot-bin-laden-has-been-identified-2014-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918040321/http://www.businessinsider.com/report-the-navy-seal-who-shot-bin-laden-has-been-identified-2014-11|archivedate=2015-09-18|work=Business Insider|first=Hunter|last=Walker|date=November 3, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expected to reveal his identity and details of the mission [[Operation Neptune Spear]]. He had previously been interviewed anonymously in an ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine article in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man Who Killed bin Laden... Is Screwed|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/man-who-shot-osama-bin-laden-0313|work=Esquire Magazine|first=Phil|last=Bronstein|date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-SEAL Says He Fired Final bin Laden Shot|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/06/politics/seal-bin-laden-shooter-identified/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Justin|last=Peligri|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neill's statements resulted in criticism by fellow Navy SEALs. [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Brian L. Losey|Brian Losey]] and [[Master chief petty officer|Force Master Chief]] Michael Magaraci issued a public statement, stating that "a critical tenant {{sic|nolink=y|expected=tenet}} of our ethos is 'I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.'"&lt;ref name=People&gt;Johnny Dodd (November 7, 2014). [http://www.people.com/article/controversy-over-bin-laden-shooter-interview "Alleged Osama bin Laden Shooter Accused of 'Violating' Navy SEAL 'Ethos' for Going Public"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Matt Bissonnette]], using the pseudonym "Mark Owen", wrote a book called [[No Easy Day|''No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden'']] documenting his participation in the raid. In his book, he does not identify the man who fired the fatal shots at Bin Laden, referring to him as simply the "Point Man". Bisonnette himself admits to firing his weapon at bin Laden after the fatal shots were fired by the "Point Man" when bin Laden was already "in his death throes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Mark |date=September 4, 2012 |title=No Easy Day |url= |location= |publisher=Dutton Penguin |page=170 |isbn=978-0525953722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has, however, refused to respond directly to O'Neill's claims, adding that he believed the team effort was more important than one person pulling the trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/navy-seals-robert-oneill-matt-bissonnette-public-dispute-over-who-killed-osama-bin-1720499|title=Navy SEALs Robert O'Neill, Matt Bissonnette In Public Dispute Over Who Killed Osama Bin Laden|date=7 November 2014|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] launched a criminal investigation into whether Bissonnette leaked classified material.&lt;ref name="businessinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]] (November 4, 2014). [http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/04/opinion/bergen-seals-bin-laden-killing/index.html "Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden?"]. [[CNN]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014|reason=source mentions no investigation}} O'Neill has also been criticized by other former Navy SEALs for disclosing his role.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

==Legal issues==
In April 2016, O'Neill was charged with [[DUI]] after police found him unconscious behind the wheel of a car at a gas station in [[Butte, Montana]]. He failed a [[Field sobriety testing|field sobriety test]] and refused to undergo a [[Breathalyzer|breathalyzer test]]; he denied being intoxicated, saying that him falling asleep was the result of him taking a prescription [[sleep aid]]. The Butte-Silver Bow County Attorney's office opted to downgrade charges from driving under the influence to endangerment and defer prosecution for 12 months, agreeing to drop the charges completely so long as O'Neill sought treatment for unspecified medical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nbcmontana.com/news/local/butte-residents-discuss-rob-oneill-dui-arrest_20160512151139613|title=Butte residents discuss Rob O'Neill DUI arrest|last=Lester|first=Tiffany|work=KECI|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecutors-drop-dui-charge-against-osama-bin-laden-shooter-rob-oneill/|title=Prosecutors drop DUI charge against Navy SEAL who said he killed Bin Laden|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mtstandard.com/crime-and-courts/dui-charge-against-rob-o-neill-dropped-amended-prosecution-deferred/article_c1409cf0-8f0f-5997-91f2-6814be72ed61.html|title=DUI charge against Rob O'Neill dropped; amended prosecution deferred|last=hunter.pauli@mtstandard.com|first=Hunter Pauli|work=Montana Standard|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In September 2017, O'Neill, then 41, married Jessica Halpin, then 27, in a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] ceremony held on [[Cape Cod, MA|Cape Cod, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4918202/Navy-SEAL-killed-bin-Laden-reveals-wedding-joy.html|title=Navy SEAL who killed bin Laden reveals wedding joy and love story|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously married to Amber O'Neill, with whom he has children; O'Neill blamed the breakdown of his first marriage on stress and alcoholism caused by his time in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.projectrepublictoday.com/2017/04/30/robert-oneill-retired-navy-seal-shot-osama-bin-laden-describes-moment-gruesome-detail/|title=Robert O'Neill, Retired Navy SEAL Who Shot Osama Bin Laden, Describes The Moment In Gruesome Detail|date=2017-04-30|work=Project Republic {{!}} Headlines, News, Politics|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/518914/killing-bin-laden-wrecked-my-life/|title=Navy Seal says ‘Killing Bin Laden wrecked my life’|date=2014-11-16|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sir Thomas More''''' is an [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan play]] and a dramatic biography based on particular events in the life of the Catholic martyr [[Thomas More]], who rose to become the Lord Chancellor of England during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]. The play is considered to be written by [[Anthony Munday]] and [[Henry Chettle]] and revised by several writers. The manuscript is particularly notable for a three-page handwritten revision now widely attributed to [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''. Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. (1989) {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. page 49-54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeares-life |title=Shakespeare's life |publisher=''British Library'' |last=Dickson |first=Andrew |date=2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
This play is not simply biographical, because, for example, significant facts of More's life are not described: There is no mention of his literary career, his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', or the dispute between Henry VIII and the Pope in Rome. Also the life of More is at times expanded beyond what actually occurred and beyond the sources that were used, in order to suit the drama. What the play is about has been debated, but the issues revolve around obedience to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace becomes stirred up in an anti-alien fervor. Even More must obey; when he does not he loses his life.&lt;ref&gt;Long, William B. ''The Occasion of the Book of Sir Thomas More''. Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989) {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. pages 49-54&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three primary actions in the drama: First is the uprising of 1517 known as [[Ill May Day]] and More’s quelling of the rioters. Second is the portrayal of More’s private life, his family and friendships, demonstrating his generosity, kindness, and wit. Third is his service as Privy Councillor and Lord Chamberlain, and the principled stand he took in opposition to the king, which leads to More’s execution.

The particular articles More refuses to sign are never described, so the play avoids the specific conflict that occurred between the church in Rome and the English Church, allowing the story to focus on the issue of freedom of an individual conscience from worldly authority. This explains why Munday, who fought against the Catholic Church, would be an author of a play that vindicates More, a Catholic martyr. Munday’s abiding interest, as demonstrated in his other plays, was in speaking out against attacks on an individual’s freedom, attacks that came from both church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Melchiori|Melchiori, Giorgio]]. ''The Book of Sir Thomas More: Dramatic Unity'' Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989) {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered in terms of theatrical performance, it is seen as effective and dramatic in the scenes dealing with the rioting, it is warm and human when dealing with More's private life, and it is sympathetic and admiring as More sticks to his principles in the conclusion of the play. It is considered to be the best of the dramatic biographies that were written in Elizabethan times. Even with these qualities it would not have attracted as much interest if it were not for the association this play has with Shakespeare.

==Characters==
''Sir Thomas More'' has an unusually high total of 59 speaking parts, including 22 in the first 500 lines of the play; this, plus crowd scenes, would have taxed the ability of any [[playing company]] of the time to stage it. The job could only be managed through complex doubling and more-than-doubling of roles by the actors. Out of necessity, the play is structured to allow for this multiple doubling of roles: it is set up in three phases—More's rise; More's Chancellorship; More's fall—with very limited overlap between the thirds. Only three characters, More himself and the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, appear in all three portions; six other characters—Lady More, Palmer, Roper, Sergeant Downes, the Lord Mayor, and a sheriff—appear in two of the three segments.

== Synopsis ==

===Act I===

The play dramatises events in More's life, and it deals with issues of obedience to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace has become stirred up in an anti-alien fervour. It consists of 17 scenes, four of them cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greg|1990|pp=xxvi–xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the [[Ill May Day]] events of 1517: Foreign nationals, who have immigrated to England from Lombardy, which is the northern region of what is now known as Italy, are misbehaving in a variety of ways, and are treating the citizens of London with abuse and disrespect. This is outraging the workers of London, who decide to join together on Mayday and seek revenge on the newcomers. London noblemen are having difficulty deciding what to do about this, when rioting breaks out all across London, and even the Mayor of London is endangered. The noblemen decide to engage Sheriff Thomas More, who is popular and respected by the people, to try and calm the civil unrest.

===Act II===

A group of native Londoners plan to set fire to the foreigners' homes.  Others urge a military response.  More decides the best way is for him to speak to the rioters.

More arrives at St. Martin's gate.  The rioters express their complaints, then agree to hear from More. More begins by saying that the riots are disgracing England, and that if disorder prevails, civil society will fall apart, and none of the rioters will live to an old age. He tells them that when they rebel against the law, they rebel against God. More offers a deal to the rioters: If they will behave, and go to prison in peace, he promises that they will be given a pardon. The only other option for them is death. The rioters accept More's offer, and are taken away.

===Act III===
The rioters are about to be hanged. One of their leaders, Lincoln, has already been executed. Then Surrey arrives to announce that the execution order has been stayed by order of the King, because More has pleaded for their lives.

===Act IV===
More is knighted and promoted to Privy Councilor for his role in ending the riots.

At home, More is visited by his friend, the Dutch philosopher and theologian, Erasmus. More then hosts a visit by the Mayor of London. For the guests' entertainment, a play is performed,  ''The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom''.

Later in Whitehall, the Privy Council, including More, is meeting, when Sir Thomas Palmer enters with undisclosed articles from the King, King Henry VIII, who wants them signed. More refuses to sign, because he is conscientiously opposed. Rochester, who also refuses to sign, is taken away to the [[Tower of London]]. More resigns his office and is placed under house arrest. His fellow Privy Councilors urge him to change his mind and sign, but he will not.

More goes home and informs his family.  He discusses the situation and how it will affect them, and he comforts them, all the while maintaining a positive demeanor and his moral position. The Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury arrive to encourage More to sign the articles; he will not and is taken away to the Tower.

===Act V===
Catesby goes to More's house to inform the family that More has been sentenced to death.

More's family arrives at the Tower on the eve of his execution. They urge him to change his mind, but he is resolute. The next day, on Tower Hill, More is positive and resolved as he mounts the scaffold and prepares to die by beheading. More has thoughtful and considerate exchanges with the noblemen, who are present, and his executioner, and then is taken off-stage to his fate.&lt;ref&gt;Munday, Anthony.

==Manuscript==

The original manuscript, involving so many revisions, has reinforced the incorrect idea that the play has been pieced together or is in poor condition.  Instead, the revisions should be considered in recognizable theatrical terms as a script’s natural progression towards its being readied for production.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Harold G.

''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989)  {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. page 49-54&lt;/ref&gt;

The original manuscript is a handwritten text, now owned by the [[British Library]]. The manuscript is notable for the light it sheds on the collaborative nature of Elizabethan drama and theatrical censorship of the era.

Now MS. Harley 7368 in the collection of the [[British Library]], the manuscript's provenance can be traced back to 1728, when it belonged to a London book collector named John Murray. He donated it to the collection of [[Edward Harley, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], who bequeathed it to the [[British Museum]] with the rest of his manuscript collection in 1753. Some time between 1728 and 1753 the play was bound with another manuscript, ''The Humorous Lovers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in poor condition, the original manuscript probably consisted of 16 leaves—31 handwritten pages of a working draft of the play ([[foul papers]]), with the last page blank. Two or three of the original leaves have been torn out, and seven leaves and two smaller pieces of paper have been inserted.

Aside from folios 1 and 2, the wrapper of the manuscript proper, the revised extant manuscript comprises the following:

1) Folios 3–5, Hand S: the first three scenes of the play, through page 5a; censored by [[Edmund Tylney]], the [[Master of the Revels]], but otherwise intact. On page 5b, all text after the first 16 lines is marked for deletion. At least one, and probably two, of the leaves immediately following (the original leaves 6 and 7) are missing.

2) Folio 6, Addition I, Hand A: a single leaf, written on only one side. The addition is misplaced, and belongs later in the play, with page 19a.&lt;br&gt;
3) Folios 7–9, Addition II: three leaves replacing the excised material on 5b and the original 6 and probable 7. Each of the three leaves is in a different hand.

*Folio 7a, Addition IIa, Hand B: a scene to replace a short deleted scene on 5b.
*Folio 7b, Addition IIb, Hand C: another complete scene, with stage directions leading to its successor.
*Folios 8–9, Addition IIc, Hand D: a three-page scene (page 9b being blank), with about a dozen corrections in Hand C.
4) Folios 10–11, Hand S: back to the original manuscript, though with some insertions on pages 10a and 11a in Hand B.

5) Folio 11c, Addition III, Hand C: the first of the two insertions on smaller pieces of paper, formerly pasted over the bottom of page 11b, and consisting of a single 21-line soliloquy meant to begin the next scene.

6) Folios 12–13, Addition IV, Hands C and E: four pages to replace excised or cancelled material, written mainly in Hand C but with input from Hand E on page 13b.

7) Folio 14a Hand S: the original again, and the whole page cancelled for deletion. Addition IV, directly previous, replaces this material.

8) Folio 14c, Addition V, Hand C: the second of the insertions on smaller sheets of paper, formerly pasted over the bottom of page 14a.

9) Folios 14b and 15, Hand S: the original again.

10) Folio 16, Addition VI, Hand B: the last of the six Additions.

11) Folios 17-22a, Hand S: the conclusion of the play in the original version. On page 19a a long passage is cut, and this is the place where the mislocated Addition I, folio 6, actually belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bald|1949|pp=47–52}}, {{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|pp=13–33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand C attempted to provide corrections to the whole, enhancing its coherence; yet some stage directions and speech prefixes are missing, and the stage directions that exist are sometimes incorrect. (In Additions III and IV, More speaks his soliloquy before he enters.)

Scholars, critics, and editors have described the text as "chaotic" and "reduced to incoherence", but in 1987 Scott McMillin maintained that the play could be acted as is;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one production of the play has ensued, by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 2005.

The manuscript was first printed and published in 1844, two and a half centuries after it was written, by the Shakespeare Society, edited by [[Alexander Dyce]]; and again in 1911 by [[the Malone Society]], edited by [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]].

Part of the need for revisions of the play was clearly due to purely practical concerns of stagecraft, apart from the demands of political censorship. Much of the point of the revision was to streamline the play, to make it more actable; though even the revised version would have needed a minimum cast of 18—13 adults and five boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|pp=74–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the Additions, III and VI, occur at the beginning and end of the middle third respectively, giving more time for costume changes. Addition III provides a soliloquy by More and a 45-line dialogue between two actors; Addition VI provides a similar breathing-space for the actors to get ready for the play's final phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|pp=44–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing for a range of uncertainties, it is most likely true that the original text of ''Sir Thomas More'' was written ca. 1591-3, with a special focus on 1592-3 when the subject of hostility against "aliens" was topical in London. Edmund Tylney censored the play when it was submitted to him for approval at that time, for this topicality as well as for more general considerations of controlling political expression on the stage. The effort at revision is difficult to date; many scholars have favoured ca. 1596, though a date as late as ca. 1604 is also possible.

== Authorship ==

The manuscript is a complicated text containing many layers of collaborative writing, revision, and censorship. Scholars of the play think that it was originally written by playwrights [[Anthony Munday]] and [[Henry Chettle]] and some years later heavily revised by another team of playwrights, including [[Thomas Heywood]], [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[William Shakespeare]].

The most common identifications for the six hands:

* HAND S – Anthony Munday, the original manuscript;
* HAND A – Henry Chettle;
* HAND B – Thomas Heywood;
* HAND C – A professional scribe who copied out a large section of the play;
* HAND D – William Shakespeare;
* HAND E – Thomas Dekker.

Munday, Chettle, Dekker, and Heywood wrote for the Admiral's Men during the years before and after 1600, which may strengthen the idea of a connection between the play and that company. Shakespeare, in this context, seems the odd man out. In his study of the play, Scott McMillin entertains the possibility that Shakespeare's contribution might have been part of the original text from the early 1590s, when Shakespeare may have written for the Lord Strange's Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|pp=135–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence for Shakespeare's contribution ===

In 1871, [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]] proposed that some additions to the play had been written by Shakespeare, and a year later [[James Spedding]], editor of the works of Sir [[Francis Bacon]], while rejecting some of Simpson's suggestions, supported the attribution to Shakespeare of the passage credited to Hand D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the [[Palaeography|paleographer]] Sir [[Edward Maunde Thompson]] published a minute analysis of the handwriting of the addition and judged it to be Shakespeare's. The case was strengthened with the publication of ''Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5W57hrE_6dkC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare’s+Hand+in+the+Play+of+Sir+Thomas+More.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MkwEhLfzv9&amp;sig=i-Io3Awfm5jnMNl8jPtQt4ACopQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCGoVChMIk9aErZ3oxgIVRM2ACh1DCg3V#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shakespeare’s%20Hand%20in%20the%20Play%20of%20Sir%20Thomas%20More.%22&amp;f=false] Greg, W.W. editor. ''Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|9781108015356}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by five noted scholars who analysed the play from multiple perspectives, all of which led to the same affirmative conclusion. A second significant gathering of scholars to consider ''Sir Thomas More'' grew out of a seminar that was held during the meeting of the [[Shakespeare Association of America]] at Ashland, Oregon in 1983.  It resulted in a second book of essays, eight by eight different authors, that was published as ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; Essays on the Play and its Shakespearean Interest''.  It is a comprehensive study of the manuscript, and states that it appears more likely than ever that Shakespeare did indeed contribute to the revision of this play.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989)  {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This would make it the only surviving manuscript text written by Shakespeare. Although some dissenters remain, the attribution has been generally accepted since the mid-20th century and most [[Complete Works of Shakespeare|authoritative editions of Shakespeare's works]], including ''[[The Oxford Shakespeare]]'', include the play. It was performed with Shakespeare's name included amongst the authors by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 2005.

The suggestion that passages in Hand D were by Shakespeare was first made in 1871 by [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1916|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was supported and disputed over a long period on the evidence of literary style and [[William Shakespeare's handwriting|Shakespeare's distinctive handwriting]]. The lines in Hand D "are now generally accepted as the work of Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1997|p=1775}}; {{Harvnb|Woodhuysen|2010|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Shakespearean identification is correct, these three pages represent the only surviving examples of Shakespeare's handwriting, aside from a few signatures on documents. The manuscript, with its numerous corrections, deletions and insertions, enables us to glimpse Shakespeare in the process of composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|2008|p=334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for identifying Shakespeare as Hand D is of various types:

* Handwriting similar to the six existing signatures of Shakespeare;
* Spellings characteristic of Shakespeare;
* Stylistic elements similar to Shakespeare's acknowledged works.

The original perceptions of Simpson and Spedding in 1871-2 were based on literary style and content and political outlook, rather than palaeographic and orthographic considerations. Consider one example of what attracted attention to the style of Hand D.

First, from ''Sir Thomas More,'' Addition IIc, 84-7:

:::For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,
:::With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,
:::Would ''shark'' on you, and men like ravenous ''fishes''
:::''Would feed on one another.''

Next, from ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]],'' I,i,184-8:

:::::What's the matter,
:::That in these several places of the city
:::You cry against the noble Senate, who
:::(Under the gods) keep you in awe, which else
:::''Would feed on one another?''

Thirdly, ''[[Troilus and Cressida]],'' I,iii,121-4:

:::And appetite, an universal wolf
:::(So doubly seconded with will and power)
:::Must make perforce an universal prey,
:::''And last eat up himself.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Halliday|1964|p=457}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]],'' II,i,26–32:

:::''3rd Fisherman:''...Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
:::''1st Fisherman:'' Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up
:::the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly
:::as to a ''whale'': 'a plays and tumbles, driving the poor ''fry'' before him,
:::and at last ''devour them all at a mouthful.''

Many features like this in the Hand D addition to ''Sir Thomas More'' first attracted the attention of Shakespeare scholars and readers, and led to more intensive study from a range of specialised perspectives.

According to Mark Brown of ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[British Library]] curator Zoe Wilcox argued that "all the evidence suggested the writing was by the hand of Shakespeare,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/william-shakespeare-handwritten-plea-for-refugees-online-sir-thomas-more-script-play-british-library-exhibition |title=William Shakespeare's handwritten plea for refugees to go online |last=Brown |first=Mark |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=March 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the library has posted the text online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/shakespeares-handwriting-in-the-book-of-sir-thomas-more|title=The Book of Sir Thomas More: Shakespeare's only surviving literary manuscript - The British Library Shop|website=The British Library|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audience perception===

It has been reported that audiences "find that the play speaks with more urgency" in the pages attributed to Shakespeare.  While Shakespeare's supposed contribution is consistent with the overall theme and develops the plot, there is an impression of  a virtuoso piece inserted, but not completely integrated, into the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|pp=18–22}}: "Compared with the rest of the play, the passage is exceptionally dynamic, poetically resonant and vividly etched. Even audience members who are unaware of the authorship issue often find that the play speaks with more urgency here."&lt;/ref&gt; Some editors go as far as to question whether Shakespeare had read any of the other contributions at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wells|2010|pp=813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==

The play was most likely written to be acted by [[Lord Strange's Men]], the only company of the time that could have mounted such a large and demanding production, at Philip Henslowe's [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], which possessed the special staging requirements (large-capacity second-level platform and special enclosure) called for by the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMillin|1987|pp=464–73, 113–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive lead role of More, 800-plus lines, was designed for [[Edward Alleyn]], the only actor up to that time who is known to have played such large-scale roles. After the re-organization of the playing companies in 1594, the manuscript may well have passed into the possession of the [[Admiral's Men]].

Whether or not the play was performed in the Elizabethan or Jacobean age is unsettled, and there are indications to support both sides of the question.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Harold G. ''{{'}}Voice and Credyt{{'}}: The Scholars and Sir Thomas More''.  Howard-Hill, T.H. editor. ''Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; essays on the play and its Shakespearean Interest''. Cambridge University Press. (1989)  {{ISBN|0 521 34658 4}}. page 38&lt;/ref&gt; By the nature of the revisions and the mention of the actor Thomas Goodale in 3.1 it is clear that it was written for the public stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Gabrieli|Melchiori|1990|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time no recorded performance of ''Sir Thomas More'' took place until a three-night student production by the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, University of London]], in December 1922. The play was staged with more than 40 students at [[the King's School, Canterbury]], 4–6 November 1938, with P. D. V. Strallen in the title role. The first known professional staging of the play was 22–29 June 1954 at the London Theatre Centre for the Advance Players Association. It was first performed in Elizabethan costumes and then in modern dress, with Michael Beint as More.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gabrieli|Melchiori|1990|pp=33–4}}; {{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sir Thomas More'' has been acted in whole or in part several times as a radio play, twice by the [[BBC Third Programme]] (1948, 1956), by the Austrian public radio [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] in 1960, and then again by [[BBC Radio 3]] in 1983 with [[Ian McKellen]] playing the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jowett|2011|pp=108–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; McKellen also played the role at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] 10 June-4 July 1964, taking over from [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] on short notice, when the latter had artistic differences with director [[Frank Dunlop (director)|Frank Dunlop]] during rehearsals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKellen}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has been infrequently revived since, [[Nigel Cooke]] playing More for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 2005.

Sir Ian McKellen performed the Shakespeare monologue regarding immigrants on the Marc Maron podcast in response to the Trump phenomenon.

The '''Six-Day War''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|מלחמת ששת הימים}}, ''Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim''; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|النكسة}}, ''an-Naksah'', "The Setback" or {{lang|ar|حرب ۱۹٦۷}}, ''Ḥarb 1967'', "War of 1967"), also known as the '''June War''', '''1967 Arab–Israeli War''', or '''Third Arab–Israeli War''', was fought between 5 and 10 June 1967 by [[Israel]] and the neighboring states [[Egypt]] (known at the time as the [[United Arab Republic]]), [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]].

Relations between Israel and its neighbours wasn't fully normalised after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. In 1956 [[Suez Crisis#The Israeli operation Kadesh in Sinai|Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula]] in Egypt, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the [[Straits of Tiran]] that Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was eventually forced to withdraw, but was guaranteed that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. While the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] was deployed along the border, there was no [[demilitarisation]] agreement.&lt;ref name="Rikhye2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Major General Indar Jit Rikhye|title=The Sinai Blunder: Withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force Leading....|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teHWAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-27985-0|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months prior to June 1967, [[Origins of the Six-Day War|tensions became dangerously heightened]]. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping would be a cause for war (a ''[[casus belli]]''). In May Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] announced that the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels and then mobilised its Egyptian forces along its border with Israel. On 5 June, Israel launched what it claimed were a series of [[Preemptive war|preemptive]] airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. Which side caused the war is one of a number of [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War|controversies relating to the conflict]].

The Egyptians were caught by surprise, and nearly the entire Egyptian air force was destroyed with few Israeli losses, giving the Israelis [[air supremacy]]. Simultaneously, the Israelis launched a ground offensive into the [[Gaza Strip]] and the Sinai, which again caught the Egyptians by surprise. After some initial resistance, Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward in pursuit of the Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and conquered the Sinai.

Nasser induced Syria and Jordan to begin attacks on Israel by using the initially confused situation to claim that Egypt had repelled the Israeli air strike. Israeli {{cns|counterattacks resulted in|date=December 2018}} the capture and occupation of the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], from the Jordanians and the [[Golan Heights]] from [[Syria]].

Egypt and Jordan agreed to a ceasefire on 8 June, and Syria agreed on 9 June; a ceasefire was signed with Israel on 11 June. In the aftermath of the war, Israel had crippled the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian militaries, having killed over 20,000 troops while only losing fewer than 1,000 of its own. The Israeli success was the result of a well-prepared and enacted strategy, the poor leadership of the Arab states, and their poor military leadership and strategy. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel's international standing greatly improved in the following years. Its victory humiliated Egypt, Jordan and Syria, leading Nasser to resign in shame; he was later reinstated after protests in Egypt against his resignation. The speed and ease of Israel's victory would later lead to a dangerous overconfidence within the ranks of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), contributing to initial Arab successes in the subsequent 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], although ultimately Israeli forces were successful and defeated the Arab militaries. The displacement of civilian populations resulting from the war would have long-term consequences, as 300,000 [[Palestinians]] fled the West Bank and about 100,000 Syrians left the Golan Heights to become refugees. Across the Arab world, Jewish minority communities fled or were expelled, with refugees going mainly to Israel or Europe.

After the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], Egypt agreed to the stationing of a [[United Nations Emergency Force]] (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure all parties would comply with the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Rauschning, Wiesbrock &amp; Lailach 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;30; Sachar 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;504, 507–08 |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html |title=First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) – Background (Full text)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years there were numerous minor border clashes between Israel and its Arab neighbors, particularly Syria.

On 30 May, Jordan and Egypt signed a defense pact. The following day, at Jordan's invitation, the Iraqi army began deploying troops and armoured units in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill po. 52 and 77&lt;/ref&gt; They were later reinforced by an Egyptian contingent. On 1 June, Israel formed a [[National Unity Government]] by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched [[Operation Focus]], a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six-Day War.

=== Military preparation ===
Before the war, Israeli pilots and ground crews had trained extensively in rapid refitting of aircraft returning from [[sortie]]s, enabling a single aircraft to sortie up to four times a day (as opposed to the norm in Arab air forces of one or two sorties per day). This enabled the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) to send several attack waves against Egyptian airfields on the first day of the war, overwhelming the Egyptian Air Force, and allowed it to knock out other Arab air forces on the same day. This has contributed to the Arab belief that the IAF was helped by foreign air forces (see [[Controversies relating to the Six-Day War#Combat support|Controversies relating to the Six-Day War]]). Pilots were extensively schooled about their targets, and were forced to memorize every single detail, and rehearsed the operation multiple times on dummy runways in total secrecy.

The Egyptians had constructed fortified defenses in the Sinai. These designs were based on the assumption that an attack would come along the few roads leading through the desert, rather than through the difficult desert terrain. The Israelis chose not to risk attacking the Egyptian defenses head-on, and instead surprised them from an unexpected direction.

James Reston, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 23 May 1967, noted, "In discipline, training, morale, equipment and general competence his [Nasser's] army and the other Arab forces, without the direct assistance of the Soviet Union, are no match for the Israelis. ... Even with 50,000 troops and the best of his generals and air force in Yemen, he has not been able to work his way in that small and primitive country, and even his effort to help the Congo rebels was a flop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reston, James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/05/24/archives/washington-nassers-reckless-maneuvers-cairo-and-moscow-the-us.html |title=Washington: Nasser's Reckless Maneuvers; Cairo and Moscow The U.S. Commitment The Staggering Economy Moscow's Role |work=The New York Times |date=24 May 1967 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the war, Israel believed it could win a war in 3–4 days. The United States estimated Israel would need 7–10 days to win, with British estimates supporting the U.S. view.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, ''The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defence'', p. 60. (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armies and weapons ==
=== Armies ===
The Israeli army had a total strength, including reservists, of 264,000, though this number could not be sustained, as the reservists were vital to civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 2004, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against Jordan's forces on the West Bank, Israel deployed about 40,000 troops and 200 tanks (eight brigades).{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=294}} Israeli Central Command forces consisted of five brigades. The first two were permanently stationed near [[Jerusalem]] and were the [[Jerusalem Brigade]] and the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]]. [[Mordechai Gur]]'s [[55th Paratroopers Brigade]] was summoned from the Sinai front. The 10th Armored Brigade was stationed north of the [[West Bank]]. The Israeli Northern Command comprised a division of three brigades led by Major General [[Elad Peled]] which was stationed in the [[Jezreel Valley]] to the north of the West Bank.

On the eve of the war, Egypt massed approximately 100,000 of its 160,000 troops in the Sinai, including all seven of its divisions (four infantry, two armoured and one mechanized), four independent infantry brigades and four independent armoured brigades. Over a third of these soldiers were veterans of Egypt's continuing intervention into the [[North Yemen Civil War]] and another third were reservists. These forces had 950 tanks, 1,100 APCs, and more than 1,000 artillery pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=59}}

Syria's army had a total strength of 75,000 and was deployed along the border with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Ehteshami and Hinnebusch 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[David W. Lesch]] wrote that "One would be hard-pressed to find a military less prepared for war with a clearly superior foe", since Syria’s army had been decimated in the months and years prior through coups and attempted coups that had resulted in a series of purges, fracturings and uprisings within the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) pp. 86-87: “Syria was severely unprepared for war. Despite the bombastic and jingoistic rhetoric, the Bathist regime viewed its actions against Israel as low-level warfare that was not meant to lead to all-out war. The months and years prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war were filled with military purges associated with actual and attempted coups that decimated and further fractured the military and party, resulting in an inexperienced officer corps as well as a deep distrust between the rank and file and officers in the army. In addition, there were uprisings by discontented elements of the Syrian population, less than satisfactory encounters with Israeli forces, and lukewarm Soviet support... One would be hard-pressed to find a military less prepared for war with a clearly superior foe.”&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jordanian Armed Forces]] included 11 brigades, totalling 55,000 troops.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=42}} Nine brigades (45,000 troops, 270 tanks, 200 artillery pieces) were deployed in the [[West Bank]], including the elite armoured 40th, and two in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. They possessed sizable numbers of [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113]] APCs and were equipped with some 300 modern Western tanks, 250 of which were U.S. [[M48 Patton]]s. They also had 12 battalions of artillery, six batteries of 81&amp;nbsp;mm and 120&amp;nbsp;mm mortars,&lt;ref name=segevs /&gt; a [[paratrooper]] battalion trained in the new U.S.-built school and a new battalion of [[mechanized infantry]]. The [[Jordanian Army]], then known as the [[Arab Legion]], was a long-term-service, professional army, relatively well-equipped and well-trained. Israeli post-war briefings said that the Jordanian staff acted professionally, but was always left "half a step" behind by the Israeli moves. The small [[Royal Jordanian Air Force]] consisted of only 24 British-made [[Hawker Hunter]] fighters, six transports, and two helicopters. According to the Israelis, the Hawker Hunter was essentially on par with the French-built [[Dassault Mirage III]] – the IAF's best plane.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|pp=293–94}}

100 Iraqi tanks and an infantry division were readied near the Jordanian border. Two squadrons of Iraqi fighter-aircraft, Hawker Hunters and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21s]], were rebased adjacent to the Jordanian border.&lt;ref name=segevs&gt;Segev 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;82,&amp;nbsp;175–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab air forces were reinforced by some aircraft from Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to make up for the massive losses suffered on the first day of the war. They were also aided by volunteer pilots from the [[Pakistan Air Force]] acting in an independent capacity. PAF pilots shot down several Israeli planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Warriors|url=http://www.paf.gov.pk/air_warriors.html|website=Pakistan Air Force|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eagle Biography – Saiful Azam|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2000/azam_2000.asp|website=Air University|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weapons ===
With the exception of Jordan, the Arabs relied principally on Soviet weaponry. Jordan's army was equipped with American weaponry, and its air force was composed of British aircraft.

Egypt had by far the largest and the most modern of all the Arab air forces, consisting of about 420 combat aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Oren, 176; Benny Morris, ''Righteous Victims'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; all of them Soviet-built and with a heavy quota of top-of-the-line [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]]. Of particular concern to the Israelis were the 30 [[Tupolev Tu-16|Tu-16 "Badger"]] [[medium bomber]]s, capable of inflicting heavy damage on Israeli military and civilian centers.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=58}}

Israeli weapons were mainly of Western origin. Its air force was composed principally of French aircraft, while its armoured units were mostly of British and American design and manufacture. Some infantry weapons, including the ubiquitous [[Uzi]], were of Israeli origin.

The first and most critical move of the conflict was a surprise Israeli attack on the [[Egyptian Air Force]]. {{cns|Initially, both Egypt and Israel announced that they had been attacked by the other country.|date=November 2018}}

On 5 June at 7:45 Israeli time, as [[civil defense siren]]s sounded all over Israel, the IAF launched [[Operation Focus]] (''Moked''). All but 12 of its nearly 200 operational jets&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; launched a mass attack against Egypt's [[airfield]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, p. 99 (author interview with Moredechai Hod, 7 May 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian defensive infrastructure was extremely poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with [[Hardened Aircraft Shelter|hardened aircraft shelters]] capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes. Most of the Israeli warplanes headed out over the [[Mediterranean Sea]], flying low to avoid radar detection, before turning toward Egypt. Others flew over the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Oren 2002"&gt;Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section "The War: Day One, June 5".&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defense by effectively shutting down their entire air defense system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the [[Sinai]] to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In any event, it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian [[radar]] cover and well below the lowest point at which its [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2003, pp. 114–15 (author interview with General Salahadeen Hadidi who presided over the first court martial of the heads of the air force and the air defense system after the war).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the powerful Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] detected waves of aircraft approaching Egypt and reported the code word for "war" up the Egyptian command chain, Egyptian command and communications problems prevented the warning from reaching the targeted airfields.&lt;ref name="Oren 2002" /&gt; The Israelis employed a mixed-attack strategy: bombing and [[strafing]] runs against planes parked on the ground, and bombing to disable runways with special [[tarmac-shredding penetration bomb]]s developed jointly with France, leaving surviving aircraft unable to take off. The runway at the [[Arish]] airfield was spared, as the Israelis expected to turn it into a military airport for their transports after the war. Surviving aircraft were taken out by later attack waves. The operation was more successful than expected, catching the Egyptians by surprise and destroying virtually all of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground, with few Israeli losses. Only four unarmed Egyptian training flights were in the air when the strike began.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002 p.&amp;nbsp;171&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 338 Egyptian aircraft were destroyed and 100 pilots were killed,{{sfn|Pollack|2005|p=474}} although the number of aircraft lost by the Egyptians is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, 176, says 282 out of 420. Morris, 318, says 304 out of 419. Mark Tessler, ''A History of the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict'' (Indiana, 1994), p. 396, says over 350 planes were destroyed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Egyptian planes lost were all 30 [[Tu-16]] bombers, 27 out of 40 [[Ilyushin Il-28|Il-28]] bombers, 12 [[Su-7]] fighter-bombers, over 90 [[MiG-21]]s, 20 [[MiG-19]]s, 25 [[MiG-17]] fighters, and around 32 assorted transport planes and helicopters. In addition, Egyptian radars and SAM missiles were also attacked and destroyed. The Israelis lost 19 planes, including two destroyed in air-to-air combat and 13 downed by anti-aircraft artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Long 1984, p. 19, Table 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One Israeli plane, which was damaged and unable to break radio silence, was shot down by Israeli [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk missiles]] after it strayed over the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]].&lt;ref name="Oren178"&gt;Oren, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Another was destroyed by an exploding Egyptian bomber.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack guaranteed Israeli [[air supremacy]] for the rest of the war. Attacks on other Arab air forces by Israel took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts.

The large numbers of Arab aircraft claimed destroyed by Israel on that day were at first regarded as "greatly exaggerated" by the Western press. However, the fact that the Egyptian Air Force, along with other Arab air forces attacked by Israel, made practically no appearance for the remaining days of the conflict proved that the numbers were most likely authentic. Throughout the war, Israeli aircraft continued strafing Arab airfield runways to prevent their return to usability. Meanwhile, Egyptian state-run radio had reported an Egyptian victory, falsely claiming that 70 Israeli planes had been downed on the first day of fighting.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;

=== Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula ===
[[File:1967 Six Day War - conquest of Sinai 5-6 June.jpg|thumb|350px|Conquest of Sinai. 5–6 June 1967]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16401 Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|People in a bomb shelter at [[Kfar Maimon]]]]

The Egyptian forces consisted of seven [[division (military)|divisions]]: four [[Division (military)#Armored division|armoured]], two [[Division (military)#Armored division|infantry]], and one [[mechanized infantry]]. Overall, Egypt had around 100,000 troops and 900–950 [[tank]]s in the Sinai, backed by 1,100 [[Armored personnel carrier|APCs]] and 1,000 [[artillery]] pieces.{{sfn|Pollack|2004|p=59}} This arrangement was thought to be based on the Soviet doctrine, where mobile armour units at [[strategic depth]] provide a dynamic defense while infantry units engage in defensive battles.

Israeli forces concentrated on the border with Egypt included six armoured [[brigade]]s, one infantry brigade, one mechanized infantry brigade, three [[paratrooper]] brigades, giving a total of around 70,000 men and 700 tanks, who were organized in three armoured divisions. They had massed on the border the night before the war, camouflaging themselves and observing radio silence before being ordered to advance.

The Israeli plan was to surprise the Egyptian forces in both timing (the attack exactly coinciding with the IAF strike on Egyptian airfields), location (attacking via northern and central Sinai routes, as opposed to the Egyptian expectations of a repeat of the 1956 war, when the IDF attacked via the central and southern routes) and method (using a combined-force flanking approach, rather than direct tank assaults).

==== Northern (El Arish) Israeli division ====
On 5 June, at 7:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., the northernmost Israeli division, consisting of three brigades and commanded by Major General [[Israel Tal]], one of Israel's most prominent armour commanders, crossed the border at two points, opposite [[Nahal Oz]] and south of [[Khan Yunis]]. They advanced swiftly, holding fire to prolong the element of surprise. Tal's forces assaulted the "Rafah Gap", a seven-mile stretch containing the shortest of three main routes through the Sinai towards [[El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. The Egyptians had four divisions in the area, backed by minefields, pillboxes, underground bunkers, hidden gun emplacements and trenches. The terrain on either side of the route was impassable. The Israeli plan was to hit the Egyptians at selected key points with concentrated armour.&lt;ref name="Oren178" /&gt;

Tal's advance was led by the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Shmuel Gonen]]. The Israeli plan called for the 7th Brigade to outflank Khan Yunis from the north and the 60th Armored Brigade under Colonel Menachem Aviram would advance from the south. The two brigades would link up and surround Khan Yunis, while the paratroopers would take [[Rafah]]. Gonen entrusted the breakthrough to a single battalion of his brigade.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 180"&gt;Oren, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the advance was met with light resistance, as Egyptian intelligence had concluded that it was a diversion for the main attack. However, as Gonen's lead battalion advanced, it suddenly came under intense fire and took heavy losses. A second battalion was brought up, but was also pinned down. Meanwhile, the 60th Brigade became bogged down in the sand, while the paratroopers had trouble navigating through the dunes. The Israelis continued to press their attack, and despite heavy losses, cleared the Egyptian positions and reached the [[Khan Yunis]] railway junction in little over four hours.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 180" /&gt;

Gonen's brigade then advanced nine miles to Rafah in twin columns. Rafah itself was circumvented, and the Israelis attacked [[Sheikh Zuweid]], eight miles to the southwest, which was defended by two brigades. Though inferior in numbers and equipment, the Egyptians were deeply entrenched and camouflaged. The Israelis were pinned down by fierce Egyptian resistance, and called in air and artillery support to enable their lead elements to advance. Many Egyptians abandoned their positions after their commander and several of his staff were killed.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 180" /&gt;

The Israelis broke through with tank-led assaults. However, Aviram's forces misjudged the Egyptians' flank, and were pinned between strongholds before they were extracted after several hours. By nightfall, the Israelis had finished mopping up resistance. Israeli forces had taken significant losses, with Colonel Gonen later telling reporters that "we left many of our dead soldiers in Rafah, and many burnt-out tanks." The Egyptians suffered some 2,000 casualties and lost 40 tanks.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 180" /&gt;

==== Advance on Arish ====
[[File:6 Day War-Amos.jpg|thumb|Israeli reconnaissance forces from the "Shaked" unit in Sinai during the war.]]

On 5 June, with the road open, Israeli forces continued advancing towards [[Arish]]. Already by late afternoon, elements of the 79th Armored Battalion had charged through the seven-mile long Jiradi defile, a narrow pass defended by well-emplaced troops of the Egyptian 112th Infantry Brigade. In fierce fighting, which saw the pass change hands several times, the Israelis charged through the position. The Egyptians suffered heavy casualties and tank losses, while Israeli losses stood at 66 dead, 93 wounded and 28 tanks. Emerging at the western end, Israeli forces advanced to the outskirts of Arish.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; As it reached the outskirts of Arish, Tal's division also consolidated its hold on Rafah and Khan Yunis.

The following day, 6 June, the Israeli forces on the outskirts of Arish were reinforced by the 7th Brigade, which fought its way through the Jiradi pass. After receiving supplies via an airdrop, the Israelis entered the city and captured the airport at 7:50&amp;nbsp;am. The Israelis entered the city at 8:00&amp;nbsp;am. Company commander [[Yossi Peled]] recounted that "Al-Arish was totally quiet, desolate. Suddenly, the city turned into a madhouse. Shots came at us from every alley, every corner, every window and house." An IDF record stated that "clearing the city was hard fighting. The Egyptians fired from the rooftops, from balconies and windows. They dropped grenades into our half-tracks and blocked the streets with trucks. Our men threw the grenades back and crushed the trucks with their tanks."&lt;ref name="Oren202"&gt;Oren, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iweapons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeli-weapons.com/history/six_day_war/SixDayWar.html|title=Six Day War |publisher=Israeli-weapons|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonen sent additional units to Arish, and the city was eventually taken.

Brigadier-General [[Avraham Yoffe]]'s assignment was to penetrate Sinai south of Tal's forces and north or Sharon's. Yoffe's attack allowed Tal to complete the capture of the Jiradi defile, Khan Yunis. All of them were taken after fierce fighting. Gonen subsequently dispatched a force of tanks, infantry and engineers under Colonel Yisrael Granit to continue down the Mediterranean coast towards the [[Suez Canal]], while a second force led by Gonen himself turned south and captured Bir Lahfan and Jabal Libni.

Further south, on 6 June, the Israeli 38th Armored Division under Major-General [[Ariel Sharon]] assaulted [[Um-Katef]], a heavily fortified area defended by the Egyptian 2nd Infantry Division under Major-General Sa'adi Nagib, and consisting of some 16,000 troops. The Egyptians also had a [[battalion]] of [[tank destroyer]]s and a tank regiment, formed of Soviet World War II armour, which included 90 [[T-34 tank|T-34-85]] tanks, 22 [[SU-100]] tank destroyers, and about 16,000 men. The Israelis had about 14,000 men and 150 post-World War II tanks including the [[AMX-13]], [[Centurion tank|Centurions]], and [[M50 Super Sherman]]s (modified [[M-4 Sherman]] tanks).

Two armoured brigades in the meantime, under Avraham Yoffe, slipped across the border through sandy wastes that Egypt had left undefended because they were considered impassable. Simultaneously, Sharon's tanks from the west were to engage Egyptian forces on Um-Katef ridge and block any reinforcements. Israeli infantry would clear the three trenches, while heliborne paratroopers would land behind Egyptian lines and silence their artillery. An armoured thrust would be made at al-Qusmaya to unnerve and isolate its garrison.

[[File:AMX-13-latrun-2.jpg|thumb|left|Israeli Armor of the Six Day War: pictured here the [[AMX 13]]]]
As Sharon's division advanced into the Sinai, Egyptian forces staged successful delaying actions at Tarat Umm, Umm Tarfa, and Hill 181. An Israeli jet was downed by anti-aircraft fire, and Sharon's forces came under heavy shelling as they advanced from the north and west. The Israeli advance, which had to cope with extensive minefields, took a large number of casualties. A column of Israeli tanks managed to penetrate the northern flank of Abu Ageila, and by dusk, all units were in position. The Israelis then brought up ninety 105&amp;nbsp;mm and 155&amp;nbsp;mm artillery guns for a preparatory barrage, while civilian buses brought reserve infantrymen under Colonel [[Yekutiel Adam]] and helicopters arrived to ferry the paratroopers. These movements were unobserved by the Egyptians, who were preoccupied with Israeli probes against their perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

As night fell, the Israeli assault troops lit flashlights, each battalion a different color, to prevent [[friendly fire]] incidents. At 10:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Israeli artillery began a barrage on Um-Katef, firing some 6,000 shells in less than twenty minutes, the most concentrated artillery barrage in Israel's history.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Dunstan,[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESv1lwg537AC&amp;pg=PT125 ''The Six Day War 1967: Sinai''], Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Stein,[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT181 ''The Making of Modern Israel: 1948–1967''], Polity Press, 2013 p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli tanks assaulted the northernmost Egyptian defenses and were largely successful, though an entire armoured brigade was stalled by mines, and had only one mine-clearance tank. Israeli infantrymen assaulted the triple line of trenches in the east. To the west, paratroopers commanded by Colonel [[Danny Matt]] landed behind Egyptian lines, though half the helicopters got lost and never found the battlefield, while others were unable to land due to mortar fire.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 201"&gt;Oren, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammel 1992, p. 239"&gt;Hammel 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;239&lt;/ref&gt; Those that successfully landed on target destroyed Egyptian artillery and ammunition dumps and separated gun crews from their batteries, sowing enough confusion to significantly reduce Egyptian artillery fire. Egyptian reinforcements from Jabal Libni advanced towards Um-Katef to counterattack, but failed to reach their objective, being subjected to heavy air attacks and encountering Israeli lodgements on the roads. Egyptian commanders then called in artillery attacks on their own positions. The Israelis accomplished and sometimes exceeded their overall plan, and had largely succeeded by the following day. The Egyptians took heavy casualties, while the Israelis lost 40 dead and 140 wounded.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammel 1992, p. 239" /&gt;

Yoffe's attack allowed Sharon to complete the capture of the Um-Katef, after fierce fighting. The main thrust at Um-Katef was stalled due to mines and craters. After IDF engineers had cleared a path by 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Israeli and Egyptian tanks engaged in fierce combat, often at ranges as close as ten yards. The battle ended in an Israeli victory, with 40 Egyptian and 19 Israeli tanks destroyed. Meanwhile, Israeli infantry finished clearing out the Egyptian trenches, with Israeli casualties standing at 14 dead and 41 wounded and Egyptian casualties at 300 dead and 100 taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other Israeli forces ====
Further south, on 5 June, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] under Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], initially positioned as a ruse to draw off Egyptian forces from the real invasion routes, attacked the fortified bunkers at Kuntilla, a strategically valuable position whose capture would enable Mandler to block reinforcements from reaching Um-Katef and to join Sharon's upcoming attack on [[Nekhel|Nakhl]]. The defending Egyptian battalion, outnumbered and outgunned, fiercely resisted the attack, hitting a number of Israeli tanks. However, most of the defenders were killed, and only three Egyptian tanks, one of them damaged, survived. By nightfall, Mendler's forces had taken Kuntilla.&lt;ref name="Oren202" /&gt;

With the exceptions of Rafah and Khan Yunis, Israeli forces had initially avoided entering the [[Gaza Strip]]. Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] had expressly forbidden entry into the area. After Palestinian positions in Gaza opened fire on the Negev settlements of [[Nirim]] and [[Kissufim]], IDF Chief of Staff [[Yitzhak Rabin]] overrode Dayan's instructions and ordered the 11th Mechanized Brigade under Colonel Yehuda Reshef to enter the Strip. The force was immediately met with heavy artillery fire and fierce resistance from Palestinian forces and remnants of the Egyptian forces from Rafah.

By sunset, the Israelis had taken the strategically vital Ali Muntar ridge, overlooking [[Gaza City]], but were beaten back from the city itself. Some 70 Israelis were killed, along with Israeli journalist Ben Oyserman and American journalist [[Paul Schutzer]]. Twelve members of [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] were also killed. On the war's second day, 6 June, the Israelis were bolstered by the 35th Paratroopers Brigade under Colonel [[Rafael Eitan]], and took Gaza City along with the entire Strip. The fighting was fierce, and accounted for nearly half of all Israeli casualties on the southern front. However, Gaza rapidly fell to the Israelis.

Meanwhile, on 6 June, two Israeli reserve brigades under Yoffe, each equipped with 100 tanks, penetrated the Sinai south of Tal's division and north of Sharon's, capturing the road junctions of Abu Ageila, Bir Lahfan, and Arish, taking all of them before midnight. Two Egyptian armoured brigades counterattacked, and a fierce battle took place until the following morning. The Egyptians were beaten back by fierce resistance coupled with airstrikes, sustaining heavy tank losses. They fled west towards Jabal Libni.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Egyptian Army ====
During the ground fighting, remnants of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] attacked Israeli ground forces, but took losses from the Israeli Air Force and from Israeli anti-aircraft units. Throughout the last four days, Egyptian aircraft flew 150 sorties against Israeli units in the Sinai.

Many of the Egyptian units remained intact and could have tried to prevent the Israelis from reaching the [[Suez Canal]], or engaged in combat in the attempt to reach the canal. However, when the Egyptian Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer]] heard about the fall of [[Abu-Ageila]], he panicked and ordered all units in the Sinai to retreat. This order effectively meant the defeat of Egypt.

Meanwhile, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], having learned of the results of the Israeli air strikes, decided together with Field Marshal [[Abdel Hakim Amer|Amer]] to order a general retreat from the Sinai within 24 hours. No detailed instructions were given concerning the manner and sequence of withdrawal.&lt;ref name="ahram1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2007/848/sc1.htm |title=The road to Naksa |work=Al-Ahram |author=Mubasher, Abdou |date=7–13 June 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Next fighting days ====
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

[[File:1967-06-06 Mid-East.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:56|Newsreel from 6 June about the first Israeli-Egyptian fighting.]]
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Israeli Gun Boat.jpg|thumb|An Israeli gunboat passes through the Straits of Tiran near Sharm El Sheikh.]]
As Egyptian columns retreated, Israeli aircraft and artillery attacked them. Israeli jets used [[napalm]] bombs during their sorties. The attacks destroyed hundreds of vehicles and caused heavy casualties. At Jabal Libni, retreating Egyptian soldiers were fired upon by their own artillery. At Bir Gafgafa, the Egyptians fiercely resisted advancing Israeli forces, knocking out three tanks and eight half-tracks, and killing 20 soldiers. Due to the Egyptians' retreat, the Israeli High Command decided not to pursue the Egyptian units but rather to bypass and destroy them in the mountainous passes of West Sinai.

Therefore, in the following two days ( 6 and 7 June), all three Israeli divisions (Sharon and Tal were reinforced by an armoured brigade each) rushed westwards and reached the passes. Sharon's division first went southward then westward, via [[An-Nakhl Fortress|An-Nakhl]], to [[Mitla Pass]] with air support. It was joined there by parts of Yoffe's division, while its other units blocked the [[Gidi Pass]]. These passes became killing grounds for the Egyptians, who ran right into waiting Israeli positions and suffered heavy losses. According to Egyptian diplomat [[Mahmoud Riad]], 10,000 men were killed in one day alone, and many others died from hunger and thirst. Tal's units stopped at various points to the length of the Suez Canal.

Israel's blocking action was partially successful. Only the Gidi pass was captured before the Egyptians approached it, but at other places, Egyptian units managed to pass through and cross the canal to safety. Due to the haste of the Egyptian retreat, soldiers often abandoned weapons, military equipment, and hundreds of vehicles. Many Egyptian soldiers were cut off from their units had to walk about 200 kilometers on foot before reaching the Suez Canal with limited supplies of food and water and were exposed to intense heat. Thousands of soldiers died as a result. Many Egyptian soldiers chose instead to surrender to the Israelis. However, the Israelis eventually exceeded their capabilities to provide for prisoners. As a result, they began directing soldiers towards the Suez Canal and only taking prisoner high-ranking officers, who were expected to be exchanged for captured Israeli pilots.

According to some accounts, during the Egyptian retreat from the Sinai, a unit of [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Soviet Marines]] based on a Soviet warship in [[Port Said]] at the time came ashore and attempted to cross the Suez Canal eastward. The Soviet force was reportedly decimated by an Israeli air attack and lost 17 dead and 34 wounded. Among the wounded was the commander, Lt. Col. Victor Shevchenko.&lt;ref name=ginor&gt;Ginor, Isabella and Remez, Gideon: ''The Soviet-Israeli War, 1967-1973: The USSR's Military Intervention in the Egyptian-Israeli Conflict'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

During the offensive, the [[Israeli Navy]] landed six [[frogman|combat divers]] from the [[Shayetet 13]] naval commando unit to infiltrate [[Alexandria]] harbour. The divers sank an Egyptian [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] before being taken prisoner. Shayetet 13 commandos also infiltrated into [[Port Said]] harbour, but found no ships there. A planned commando raid against the [[Syrian Navy]] never materialized. Both Egyptian and Israeli warships made movements at sea to intimidate the other side throughout the war, but did not engage each other. However, Israeli warships and aircraft did hunt for Egyptian submarines throughout the war.

On 7 June, Israel began the conquest of [[Sharm el-Sheikh]]. The [[Israeli Navy]] started the operation with a probe of Egyptian naval defenses. An aerial reconnaissance flight found that the area was less defended than originally thought. At about 4:30&amp;nbsp;am, three Israeli [[missile boat]]s opened fire on Egyptian shore batteries, while paratroopers and commandos boarded helicopters and [[Nord Noratlas]] transport planes for an assault on Al-Tur, as Chief of Staff Rabin was convinced it was too risky to land them directly in Sharm el-Sheikh.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 248"&gt;Oren, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; However, the city had been largely abandoned the day before, and reports from air and naval forces finally convinced Rabin to divert the aircraft to Sharm el-Sheikh. There, the Israelis engaged in a pitched battle with the Egyptians and took the city, killing 20 Egyptian soldiers and taking 8 prisoner. At 12:15&amp;nbsp;pm, Defense Minister Dayan announced that the Straits of Tiran constituted an international waterway open to all ships without restriction.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 248" /&gt;

On 8 June, Israel completed the capture of the Sinai by sending infantry units to [[Ras Sudar]] on the western coast of the peninsula.

Several tactical elements made the swift Israeli advance possible: first, the surprise attack that quickly gave the [[Israeli Air Force]] complete air superiority over the [[Egyptian Air Force]]; second, the determined implementation of an innovative battle plan; third, the lack of coordination among Egyptian troops. These factors would prove to be decisive elements on Israel's other fronts as well.

=== West Bank ===
{{See also|Jordanian campaign (1967)}}
[[File:1967 Six Day War - The Jordan salient.jpg|thumb|400px|The Jordan [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]], 5–7 June.]]
Jordan was reluctant to enter the war. [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] used the [[Fog of war|confusion]] of the first hours of the conflict to convince [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] that he was victorious; he claimed as evidence a radar sighting of a squadron of Israeli aircraft returning from bombing raids in Egypt, which he said was an Egyptian aircraft en route to attack Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Jordanian brigades stationed in the [[West Bank]] was sent to the [[Hebron]] area in order to link with the Egyptians. Hussein decided to attack.

The IDF's strategic plan was to remain on the defensive along the Jordanian front, to enable focus in the expected campaign against Egypt.

Intermittent machine-gun exchanges began taking place in Jerusalem at 9:30&amp;nbsp;am, and the fighting gradually escalated as the Jordanians introduced mortar and recoilless rifle fire. Under the orders from General Narkis, the Israelis responded only with small-arms fire, firing in a flat trajectory to avoid hitting civilians, holy sites or the Old City. At 10:00&amp;nbsp;am on 5 June, the [[Jordanian Army]] began shelling Israel. Two batteries of 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[155 mm Long Tom|Long Tom]] cannons opened fire on the suburbs of [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The commanders of these batteries were instructed to lay a two-hour barrage against military and civilian settlements in central Israel. Some shells hit the outskirts of [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="Washington Institute for Near East Policy 2002"&gt;"On June 5, Israel sent a message to Hussein urging him not to open fire. Despite shelling into West Jerusalem, Netanya, and the outskirts of Tel Aviv, Israel did nothing." [http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2080 The Six Day War and Its Enduring Legacy]. Summary of remarks by Michael Oren at the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], 29 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10:30&amp;nbsp;am, Eshkol had sent a message via [[Odd Bull]] to [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] promising not to initiate any action against Jordan if it stayed out of the war.&lt;ref name="Neff1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Neff|title=Warriors for Jerusalem: the six days that changed the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Linden Press/Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-45485-2|p=205|quote=Odd Bull: "[the message] was a threat, pure and simple and it is not the normal practice of the U.N. to pass on threats from one government to another." However, as "…this message seemed so important… we quickly sent it…and King Hussein received the message before 10:30 the same morning."}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Hussein replied that it was too late, "[[alea iacta est|the die was cast]]".&lt;ref name="Shlaim2000p243" /&gt; At 11:15&amp;nbsp;am, Jordanian howitzers began a 6,000-shell barrage at Israeli Jerusalem. The Jordanians initially targeted [[kibbutz]] [[Ramat Rachel]] in the south and [[Mount Scopus]] in the north, then ranged into the city center and outlying neighborhoods. Military installations, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the [[Knesset]] compound were also targeted. Israeli civilian casualties totalled 20 dead and about 1,000 wounded. Some 900 buildings were damaged, including [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital]].&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 185-187"&gt;Oren, pp. 185–87&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:50&amp;nbsp;am, sixteen Jordanian Hawker Hunters attacked [[Netanya]], [[Kfar Sirkin]] and [[Kfar Saba]], killing one civilian, wounding seven and destroying a transport plane. Three Iraqi Hawker Hunters strafed civilian settlements in the Jezreel Valley, and an Iraqi [[Tupolev Tu-16]] attacked [[Afula]], and was shot down near the Megiddo airfield. The attack caused minimal material damage, hitting only a senior citizens' home and several chicken coops, but sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed, most of them when the Tupolev crashed.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 185-187" /&gt;

==== Israeli cabinet meets ====
When the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] convened to decide what to do, [[Yigal Allon]] and [[Menahem Begin]] argued that this was an opportunity to take the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], but [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]] decided to defer any decision until [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] could be consulted.&lt;ref name="Shlaim p244"&gt;Shlaim, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uzi Narkiss]] made a number of proposals for military action, including the capture of [[Latrun]], but the cabinet turned him down.
Dayan rejected multiple requests from Narkiss for permission to mount an infantry assault towards Mount Scopus. However, Dayan sanctioned a number of more limited retaliatory actions.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 187-188"&gt;Oren, pp. 187–88&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Initial response ====
Shortly before 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the [[Israeli Air Force]] attacked Jordan's two airbases. The Hawker Hunters were refueling at the time of the attack. The Israeli aircraft attacked in two waves, the first of which cratered the runways and knocked out the control towers, and the second wave destroyed all 21 of Jordan's Hawker Hunter fighters, along with six transport aircraft and two helicopters. One Israeli jet was shot down by ground fire.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 187-188" /&gt;

Israeli aircraft also attacked H-3, an [[Iraqi Air Force]] base in western Iraq. During the attack, 12 MiG-21s, 2 MiG-17s, 5 Hunter F6s, and 3 Il-28 bombers were destroyed or shot down. A [[Saiful Azam|Pakistani pilot stationed at the base]] shot down an Israeli fighter and a bomber during the raid. The Jordanian radar facility at [[Ajloun]] was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike. Israeli [[Fouga Magister]] jets attacked the Jordanian 40th Brigade with rockets as it moved south from the [[Damia Bridge|Damiya Bridge]]. Dozens of tanks were knocked out, and a convoy of 26 trucks carrying ammunition was destroyed. In Jerusalem, Israel responded to Jordanian shelling with a missile strike that devastated Jordanian positions. The Israelis used the L missile, a [[surface-to-surface]] missile developed jointly with [[France]] in secret.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 187-188" /&gt;

==== Jordanian battalion at Government House ====
{{Further|Battle of Ammunition Hill}}
A Jordanian battalion advanced up Government House ridge and dug in at the perimeter of Government House, the headquarters of the United Nations observers,&lt;ref name="UNISPAL1347"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |title=United Nations June 5, 1967 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226202011/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/CD0BEBA6A1E28EFF0525672800567B2C |archivedate=26 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shlaim p245"&gt;Shlaim 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt; and opened fire on Ramat Rachel, the Allenby Barracks and the Jewish section of [[Abu Tor]] with mortars and recoilless rifles. UN observers fiercely protested the incursion into the neutral zone, and several manhandled a Jordanian machine gun out of Government House after the crew had set it up in a second-floor window. After the Jordanians occupied [[Jabel Mukaber]], an advance patrol was sent out and approached Ramat Rachel, where they came under fire from four civilians, including the wife of the director, who were armed with old Czech-made weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificamilitary.com/books/f-sixDaysInJune.html |title=Pacifica Military History – Free Samples |publisher=Pacificamilitary.com |date=5 June 1967 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010036.JPG|thumb|Israeli paratroopers flush out Jordanian soldiers from trenches during the [[Battle of Ammunition Hill]].]]
[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010039.JPG|thumb|Silhouette of Israeli paratroops advancing on Ammunition Hill.]]
The immediate Israeli response was an offensive to retake Government House and its ridge. The Jerusalem Brigade's Reserve Battalion 161, under Lieutenant-Colonel Asher Dreizin, was given the task. Dreizin had two infantry companies and eight tanks under his command, several of which broke down or became stuck in the mud at Ramat Rachel, leaving three for the assault. The Jordanians mounted fierce resistance, knocking out two tanks.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 191-192"&gt;Oren, pp. 191–92&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israelis broke through the compound's western gate and began clearing the building with grenades, before General [[Odd Bull]], commander of the UN observers, compelled the Israelis to hold their fire, telling them that the Jordanians had already fled. The Israelis proceeded to take the Antenna Hill, directly behind Government House, and clear out a series of bunkers to the west and south. The fighting, often conducted hand-to-hand, continued for nearly four hours before the surviving Jordanians fell back to trenches held by the Hittin Brigade, which were steadily overwhelmed. By 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm, the Jordanians had retreated to [[Bethlehem]], having suffered about 100 casualties. All but ten of Dreizin's soldiers were casualties, and Dreizin himself was wounded three times.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 191-192" /&gt;

==== Israeli invasion ====
During the late afternoon of 5 June, the Israelis launched an offensive to encircle Jerusalem, which lasted into the following day. During the night, they were supported by intense tank, artillery and mortar fire to soften up Jordanian positions. Searchlights placed atop the Labor Federation building, then the tallest in Israeli Jerusalem, exposed and blinded the Jordanians. The Jerusalem Brigade moved south of Jerusalem, while the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] and [[55th Paratroopers Brigade]] under [[Mordechai Gur]] encircled it from the north.&lt;ref name="Oren, p.222"&gt;Oren, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

A combined force of tanks and paratroopers crossed no-man's land near the [[Mandelbaum Gate]]. One of Gur's paratroop battalions approached the fortified Police Academy. The Israelis used [[bangalore torpedo]]es to blast their way through barbed wire leading up to the position while exposed and under heavy fire. With the aid of two tanks borrowed from the Jerusalem Brigade, they captured the Police Academy. After receiving reinforcements, they moved up to attack [[Ammunition hill|Ammunition Hill]].&lt;ref name="Oren, p.222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordanian Front"&gt;http://www.sixdaywar.org/contest/easternfront.asp{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian defenders, who were heavily dug-in, fiercely resisted the attack. All of the Israeli officers except for two company commanders were killed, and the fighting was mostly led by individual soldiers. The fighting was conducted at close quarters in trenches and bunkers, and was often hand-to-hand. The Israelis captured the position after four hours of heavy fighting. During the battle, 36 Israeli and 71 Jordanian soldiers were killed.&lt;ref name="Oren, p.222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordanian Front" /&gt;

The battalion subsequently drove east, and linked up with the Israeli enclave on [[Mount Scopus]] and its [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] campus. Gur's other battalions captured the other Jordanian positions around the [[American Colony, Jerusalem|American Colony]], despite being short on men and equipment and having come under a Jordanian mortar bombardment while waiting for the signal to advance.&lt;ref name="Oren, p.222" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordanian Front" /&gt;

At the same time, the mechanized [[Harel Brigade]] attacked the fortress at [[Latrun]], which the Jordanians had abandoned due to heavy Israeli tank fire. The brigade attacked [[Har Adar]], but seven tanks were knocked out by mines, forcing the infantry to mount an assault without armoured cover. The Israeli soldiers advanced under heavy fire, jumping between stones to avoid mines. The fighting was conducted at close-quarters, often with knives and bayonets.

The Jordanians fell back after a battle that left two Israeli and eight Jordanian soldiers dead, and Israeli forces advanced through [[Beth-Horon|Beit Horon]] towards [[Ramallah]], taking four fortified villages along the way. By the evening, the brigade arrived in Ramallah. Meanwhile, the 163rd Infantry Battalion secured [[Abu Tor]] following a fierce battle, severing the Old City from Bethlehem and Hebron.

Meanwhile, 600 Egyptian commandos stationed in the West Bank moved to attack Israeli airfields. Led by Jordanian intelligence scouts, they crossed the border and began infiltrating through Israeli settlements towards [[Ramla]] and [[Hatzor]]. They were soon detected and sought shelter in nearby fields, which the Israelis set on fire. Some 450 commandos were killed, and the remainder escaped to Jordan.&lt;ref name="Oren203"&gt;Oren, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

From the American Colony, the paratroopers moved towards the Old City. Their plan was to approach it via the lightly defended Salah al-Din Street. However, they made a wrong turn onto the heavily defended Nablus Road. The Israelis ran into fierce resistance. Their tanks fired at point-blank range down the street, while the paratroopers mounted repeated charges. Despite repelling repeated Israeli charges, the Jordanians gradually gave way to Israeli firepower and momentum. The Israelis suffered some 30 casualties – half the original force – while the Jordanians lost 45 dead and 142 wounded.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 222-223"&gt;Oren, pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Israeli 71st Battalion breached barbed wire and minefields and emerged near Wadi Joz, near the base of Mount Scopus, from where the Old City could be cut off from Jericho and East Jerusalem from Ramallah. Israeli artillery targeted the one remaining route from Jerusalem to the West Bank, and shellfire deterred the Jordanians from counterattacking from their positions at Augusta-Victoria. An Israeli detachment then captured the [[Rockefeller Museum]] after a brief skirmish.&lt;ref name="Oren, p. 222-223" /&gt;

Afterwards, the Israelis broke through to the Jerusalem-Ramallah road. At Tel al-Ful, the Israelis fought a running battle with up to thirty Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians stalled the advance and destroyed a number of half-tracks, but the Israelis launched air attacks and exploited the vulnerability of the external fuel tanks mounted on the Jordanian tanks. The Jordanians lost half their tanks, and retreated towards [[Jericho]]. Joining up with the 4th Brigade, the Israelis then descended through [[Shuafat]] and the site of what is now [[French Hill]], through Jordanian defenses at Mivtar, emerging at Ammunition Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ammunition Hill Museum Exhibits P1010035.JPG|thumb|An Israeli airstrike near the Augusta-Victoria Hospital]]
With Jordanian defenses in Jerusalem crumbling, elements of the Jordanian 60th Brigade and an infantry battalion were sent from Jericho to reinforce Jerusalem. Its original orders were to repel the Israelis from the Latrun corridor, but due to the worsening situation in Jerusalem, the brigade was ordered to proceed to Jerusalem's Arab suburbs and attack [[Mount Scopus]]. Parallel to the brigade were infantrymen from the Imam Ali Brigade, who were approaching [[Al-Issawiya|Issawiya]]. The brigades were spotted by Israeli aircraft and decimated by rocket and cannon fire. Other Jordanian attempts to reinforce Jerusalem were beaten back, either by armoured ambushes or airstrikes.

Fearing damage to holy sites and the prospect of having to fight in built-up areas, Dayan ordered his troops not to enter the Old City.&lt;ref name="Shlaim p244" /&gt; He also feared that Israel would be subjected to a fierce international backlash and the outrage of Christians worldwide if it forced its way into the Old City. Privately, he told [[David Ben-Gurion]] that he was also concerned over the prospect of Israel capturing Jerusalem's holy sites, only to be forced to give them up under the threat of international sanctions.

==== The West Bank ====
Israel was to gain almost total control of the West Bank by the evening of 7 June,{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}} and began its [[military occupation]] of the West Bank on that day, issuing a military order, the "Proclamation Regarding Law and Administration (The West Bank Area) (No. 2)—1967", which established the military government in the West Bank and granted the commander of the area full legislative, executive, and judicial power.&lt;ref name="Weill2014"&gt;{{citation|author=Sharon Weill|title=The Role of National Courts in Applying International Humanitarian Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDnnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=February 2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-968542-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weill2007 /&gt; Jordan had realised that it had no hope of defence as early as the morning of 6 June, just a day after the conflict had begun.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138-139}} At Nasser’s request, Egypt’s [[Abdul Munim Riad]] sent a situation update at midday on 6 June:{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=138}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The situation on the West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. A concentrated attack has been launched on all axes, together with heavy fire, day and night. Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi air forces in position H3 have been virtually destroyed. Upon consultation with King Hussein I have been asked to convey to you the following choices:
:1. A political decision to cease fighting to be imposed by a third party (the USA, the Soviet Union or the Security Council).
:2. To vacate the West Bank tonight.
:3. To go on fighting for one more day, resulting in the isolation and destruction of the entire Jordanian Army.&lt;br&gt;
King Hussein has asked me to refer this matter to you for an immediate reply."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An Egyptian order for Jordanian forces to withdraw across the Jordan River was issued at 10am on June 6; however that afternoon King Hussein learned of the impending [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 233]] and decided instead to hold out in the hope that a ceasefire would be implemented soon. It was already too late, as the counter-order caused confusion and in may cases it was not possible to regain positions which had previously been left.{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=139}} 

On 7 June, Dayan had ordered his troops not to enter the Old City; however, upon hearing that the UN was about to declare a ceasefire, he changed his mind, and without cabinet clearance, decided to capture it.&lt;ref name="Shlaim p244" /&gt; Two paratroop battalions attacked Augusta-Victoria Hill, high ground overlooking the Old City from the east. One battalion attacked from Mount Scopus, and another attacked from the valley between it and the Old City. Another paratroop battalion, personally led by Gur, broke into the Old City, and was joined by the other two battalions after their missions were complete. The paratroopers met little resistance. The fighting was conducted solely by the paratroopers; the Israelis did not use armour during the battle out of fear of severe damage to the Old City.

In the north, one battalion from Peled's division was sent to check Jordanian defenses in the Jordan Valley. A brigade belonging to Peled's division captured the western part of the West Bank. One brigade attacked Jordanian artillery positions around [[Jenin]], which were shelling [[Ramat David Airbase]]. The Jordanian 12th Armored Battalion, which outnumbered the Israelis, held off repeated attempts to capture Jenin. However, Israeli air attacks took their toll, and the Jordanian [[M48 Patton]]s, with their external fuel tanks, proved vulnerable at short distances, even to the Israeli-modified Shermans. Twelve Jordanian tanks were destroyed, and only six remained operational.&lt;ref name="Oren203" /&gt;

[[File:Soldiers Western Wall 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[David Rubinger]]'s famed photograph of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] paratroopers at [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall]] shortly after its capture. From left to right: Zion Karasenti, Yitzhak Yifat, and Haim Oshri.{{ref label|reference_name_A|a|none}}]]
Just after dusk, Israeli reinforcements arrived. The Jordanians continued to fiercely resist, and the Israelis were unable to advance without artillery and air support. One Israeli jet attacked the Jordanian commander's tank, wounding him and killing his radio operator and intelligence officer. The surviving Jordanian forces then withdrew to Jenin, where they were reinforced by the 25th Infantry Brigade. The Jordanians were effectively surrounded in Jenin.&lt;ref name="Oren203" /&gt;

Jordanian infantry and their three remaining tanks managed to hold off the Israelis until 4:00&amp;nbsp;am, when three battalions arrived to reinforce them in the afternoon. The Jordanian tanks charged, and knocked out multiple Israeli vehicles, and the tide began to shift. After sunrise, Israeli jets and artillery conducted a two-hour bombardment against the Jordanians. The Jordanians lost 10 dead and 250 wounded, and had only seven tanks left, including two without gas, and sixteen APCs. The Israelis then fought their way into Jenin, and captured the city after fierce fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Old City fell, the Jerusalem Brigade reinforced the paratroopers, and continued to the south, capturing [[Judea]] and [[Gush Etzion]]. [[Hebron]] was taken without any resistance. Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the [[1929 Hebron massacre|1929 massacre]] of the city's Jewish community, Hebron's residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops, and voluntarily gave up their weapons. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Harel Brigade proceeded eastward, descending to the [[Jordan River]].

On 7 June, Israeli forces seized [[Bethlehem]], taking the city after a brief battle that left some 40 Jordanian soldiers dead, with the remainder fleeing. On the same day, one of Peled's brigades seized [[Nablus]]; then it joined one of Central Command's armoured brigades to fight the Jordanian forces; as the Jordanians held the advantage of superior equipment and were equal in numbers to the Israelis.

Again, the air superiority of the IAF proved paramount as it immobilized the Jordanians, leading to their defeat. One of Peled's brigades joined with its Central Command counterparts coming from Ramallah, and the remaining two blocked the Jordan river crossings together with the Central Command's 10th. [[Combat Engineering Corps|Engineering Corps]] sappers blew up the Abdullah and Hussein bridges with captured Jordanian mortar shells, while elements of the Harel Brigade crossed the river and occupied positions along the east bank to cover them, but quickly pulled back due to American pressure. The Jordanians, anticipating an Israeli offensive deep into Jordan, assembled the remnants of their army and Iraqi units in Jordan to protect the western approaches to [[Amman]] and the southern slopes of the [[Golan Heights]].

As Israel continued its offensive on 7 June, taking no account of the UN ceasefire resolution, the Egyptian-Jordanian command ordered a full Jordanian withdrawal for the second time, in order to avoid an annihilation of the Jordanian army.&lt;ref name=Mutawi140&gt;{{harvnb|Mutawi|2002|p=140}}: "Shortly after the order for the withdrawal had been issued [10.00 a.m. on 6 June], the Jordanians were informed that the UN Security Council was meeting to consider a resolution for an unconditional ceasefire. On learning of this the Jordanian command decided that the order for withdrawal had been premature, since if a ceasefire went into effect that day they would still be in possession of the West Bank. Consequently, the order was countermanded and those forces which had already withdrawn were asked to return to their original positions... The Security Council ceasefire resolution was passed unanimously at 11.00 p.m. on 6 June. However, Jordan's hope that this would enable it to hold the West Bank was destroyed when Israel continued its offensive. On learning of this Riad once again ordered a complete withdrawal from the West Bank as he feared that failure to do so would result in the annihilation of the remains of the Jordanian Army. By nightfall on 7 June most elements of the army had withdrawn to the East Bank and by mid-day on 8 June Jordan was once again the Transjordan of King Abdullah, while Israel completed total occupation of historical Palestine."&lt;/ref&gt; This was complete by nightfall on 7 June.&lt;ref name=Mutawi140/&gt;

After the Old City was captured, Dayan told his troops to "dig in" to hold it. When an armoured brigade commander entered the West Bank on his own initiative, and stated that he could see [[Jericho]], Dayan ordered him back. It was only after intelligence reports indicated that Hussein had withdrawn his forces across the Jordan River that Dayan ordered his troops to capture the West Bank.&lt;ref name="Shlaim p245" /&gt; According to Narkis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, the Israeli government had no intention of capturing the West Bank. On the contrary, it was opposed to it. Second, there was not any provocation on the part of the IDF. Third, the rein was only loosened when a real threat to Jerusalem's security emerged. This is truly how things happened on June 5, although it is difficult to believe. The end result was something that no one had planned.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Golan Heights ===
[[File:1967 Six Day War - Battle of Golan Heights.svg|thumb|400px|The Battle of Golan Heights, 9–10 June.]]

In May–June 1967, in preparation for conflict, the Israeli government planned to confine the confrontation to the Egyptian front, whilst taking into account the possibility of some fighting on the Syrian front.&lt;ref name="Shlaim2000p243" /&gt;

==== Syrian front 5–8 June ====
Syria largely stayed out of the conflict for the first four days.&lt;ref name=Shlaim9293&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) pp. 92-93: "Except for some sporadic Syrian shelling of Israeli settlements along the border, Syria stayed pretty much out of the war for the first four days... the Syrians were confused by what they slowly learned was the scale of the destruction on the Egyptian front. They were astounded. They did not understand what was going on, nor did they have the military experience and capability, especially in the officer corps, to react to the new situation. With no air support, how could they move forward against Israel? They reasoned that if they sat tight, they could emerge from this with little damage."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mutawi|2002|p=182|ps=: “When it came to war, Syria stood aside despite its defence pact with Egypt, while Israel overran Gaza, Sinai and the West Bank. Throughout the critical days between 5 and 8 June 1967 the Egyptian political and military leadership begged Syria to fulfil its commitments and to support Jordan's efforts, but it refused to respond even though Jordan had entered the war in the belief that it would be supported by Syria and Egypt.”}}

False Egyptian reports of a crushing victory against the Israeli army&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html |title=Part 4: The 1967 Six Day War |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forecasts that Egyptian forces would soon be attacking [[Tel Aviv]] influenced Syria's decision to enter the war – in a sporadic manner – during this period.&lt;ref name=Shlaim9293/&gt; Syrian artillery began shelling northern Israel, and twelve Syrian jets attacked Israeli settlements in the [[Galilee]]. Israeli fighter jets intercepted the Syrian aircraft, shooting down three and driving off the rest.&lt;ref name=Knopf642&gt;Sachar 1976. p.&amp;nbsp;642.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Hawker Hunter]] jets, two of the twelve Lebanon had, crossed into Israeli airspace and began strafing Israeli positions in the Galilee. They were intercepted by Israeli fighter jets, and one was shot down.&lt;ref name="Oren, P. 237" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 2006, p. 336." /&gt;

On the evening of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force attacked Syrian airfields. The [[Syrian Air Force]] lost some 32 [[MiG 21]]s, 23 [[MiG-15]] and MiG-17 fighters, and two Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, two-thirds of its fighting strength. The Syrian aircraft that survived the attack retreated to distant bases and played no further role in the war. Following the attack, Syria realised that the news it had received from Egypt of the near-total destruction of the Israeli military could not have been true.&lt;ref name="Knopf642" /&gt;

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7250 Kids in the shelter kibbutz Dan.JPG|thumb|People in a bomb shelter at [[Dan, Israel|Kibbutz Dan]]]]
On June 6, a minor Syrian force tried to capture the water plants at [[Tel Dan]] (the subject of a fierce escalation two years earlier), [[Dan, Israel|Dan]], and [[She'ar Yashuv]]. These attacks were repulsed with the loss of twenty soldiers and seven tanks. An Israeli officer was also killed. But a broader Syrian offensive quickly failed. Syrian reserve units were broken up by Israeli air attacks, and several tanks were reported to have sunk in the Jordan River.&lt;ref name="Knopf642" /&gt;

Other problems included tanks being too wide for bridges, lack of radio communications between tanks and infantry, and units ignoring orders to advance. A post-war Syrian army report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our forces did not go on the offensive either because they did not arrive or were not wholly prepared or because they could not find shelter from the enemy's planes. The reserves could not withstand the air attacks; they dispersed after their morale plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section "Damascus and Jerusalem".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{cns|The Syrians abandoned hopes of a ground attack and began a massive bombardment of Israeli communities in the [[Hula Valley]] instead.|date=December 2018}}

==== Israelis debate whether the Golan Heights should be attacked ====
On 7 and 8 June, the Israeli leadership debated about whether to attack the Golan Heights as well. Syria had supported pre-war raids that had helped raise tensions and had routinely shelled Israel from the Heights, so some Israeli leaders wanted to see Syria punished.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section "The War: Day Five, June 9".&lt;/ref&gt; Military opinion was that the attack would be extremely costly, since it would entail an uphill battle against a strongly fortified enemy. The western side of the Golan Heights consists of a rock escarpment that rises 500 meters (1,700&amp;nbsp;ft) from the [[Sea of Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]], and then flattens to a gently sloping plateau. Dayan opposed the operation bitterly at first, believing such an undertaking would result in losses of 30,000 and might trigger Soviet intervention. Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]], on the other hand, was more open to the possibility, as was the head of the Northern Command, [[David Elazar]], whose unbridled enthusiasm for and confidence in the operation may have eroded Dayan's reluctance.

Eventually, the situation on the Southern and Central fronts cleared up, intelligence estimated that the likelihood of Soviet intervention had been reduced, [[reconnaissance]] showed some Syrian defenses in the Golan region collapsing, and an intercepted cable revealed that Nasser was urging the President of Syria to immediately accept a cease-fire. At 3&amp;nbsp;am on 9 June, Syria announced its acceptance of the cease-fire. Despite this announcement, Dayan became more enthusiastic about the idea and four hours later at 7&amp;nbsp;am, "gave the order to go into action against Syria"{{ref label|reference_name_H1|i|none}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; without consultation or government authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2001, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian army consisted of about 75,000 men grouped in nine brigades, supported by an adequate amount of artillery and armour. Israeli forces used in combat consisted of two brigades (the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]] and the [[Golani Brigade]]) in the northern part of the front at [[Givat HaEm]], and another two (infantry and one of Peled's brigades summoned from Jenin) in the center. The Golan Heights' unique terrain (mountainous slopes crossed by parallel streams every several kilometers running east to west), and the general lack of roads in the area channeled both forces along east-west axes of movement and restricted the ability of units to support those on either flank. Thus the Syrians could move north-south on the plateau itself, and the Israelis could move north-south at the base of the Golan escarpment. An advantage Israel possessed was the excellent intelligence collected by [[Mossad]] operative [[Eli Cohen]] (who was captured and executed in Syria in 1965) regarding the Syrian battle positions. Syria had built extensive defensive fortifications in depths up to 15 kilometers,&lt;ref&gt;Hammel 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;387&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the [[Maginot Line]].

As opposed to all the other campaigns, IAF was only partially effective in the Golan because the fixed fortifications were so effective. However, the Syrian forces proved unable to put up effective defense largely because the officers were poor leaders and treated their soldiers badly; often officers would retreat from danger, leaving their men confused and ineffective. The Israelis also had the upper hand during close combat that took place in the numerous Syrian bunkers along the Golan Heights, as they were armed with the [[Uzi]], a [[submachine gun]] designed for close combat, while Syrian soldiers were armed with the heavier [[AK-47]] assault rifle, designed for combat in more open areas.

==== Israeli attack: first day (9 June)====
[[File:Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967. D327-098.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli tanks advancing on the Golan Heights. June 1967]]
On the morning of 9 June, Israeli jets began carrying out dozens of sorties against Syrian positions from Mount Hermon to Tawfiq, using rockets salvaged from captured Egyptian stocks. The airstrikes knocked out artillery batteries and storehouses and forced transport columns off the roads. The Syrians suffered heavy casualties and a drop in morale, with a number of senior officers and troops deserting. The attacks also provided time as Israeli forces cleared paths through Syrian minefields. However, the airstrikes did not seriously damage the Syrians' bunkers and trench systems, and the bulk of Syrian forces on the Golan remained in their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

About two hours after the airstrikes began, the [[8th Armored Brigade (Israel)|8th Armored Brigade]], led by Colonel [[Albert Mandler]], advanced into the Golan Heights from [[Givat HaEm]]. Its advance was spearheaded by [[Engineering Corps (Israel)|Engineering Corps]] sappers and eight bulldozers, which cleared away barbed wire and mines. As they advanced, the force came under fire, and five bulldozers were immediately hit. The Israeli tanks, with their maneuverability sharply reduced by the terrain, advanced slowly under fire toward the fortified village of Sir al-Dib, with their ultimate objective being the fortress at Qala. Israeli casualties steadily mounted. Part of the attacking force lost its way and emerged opposite Za'ura, a redoubt manned by Syrian reservists. With the situation critical, Colonel Mandler ordered simultaneous assaults on Za'ura and Qala. Heavy and confused fighting followed, with Israeli and Syrian tanks struggling around obstacles and firing at extremely short ranges. Mandler recalled that "the Syrians fought well and bloodied us. We beat them only by crushing them under our treads and by blasting them with our cannons at very short range, from 100 to 500 meters." The first three Israeli tanks to enter Qala were stopped by a Syrian bazooka team, and a relief column of seven Syrian tanks arrived to repel the attackers. The Israelis took heavy fire from the houses, but could not turn back, as other forces were advancing behind them, and they were on a narrow path with mines on either side. The Israelis continued pressing forward, and called for air support. A pair of Israeli jets destroyed two of the Syrian tanks, and the remainder withdrew. The surviving defenders of Qala retreated after their commander was killed. Meanwhile, Za'ura fell in an Israeli assault, and the Israelis also captured the 'Ein Fit fortress.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, pp. 281–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In the central sector, the Israeli 181st Battalion captured the strongholds of Dardara and Tel Hillal after fierce fighting. Desperate fighting also broke out along the operation's northern axis, where [[Golani Brigade]] attacked thirteen Syrian positions, including the formidable Tel Fakhr position. Navigational errors placed the Israelis directly under the Syrians' guns. In the fighting that followed, both sides took heavy casualties, with the Israelis losing all nineteen of their tanks and half-tracks.&lt;ref name="Oren, pp. 283–283"&gt;Oren, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli battalion commander then ordered his twenty-five remaining men to dismount, divide into two groups, and charge the northern and southern flanks of Tel Fakhr. The first Israelis to reach the perimeter of the southern approach laid bodily down on the barbed wire, allowing their comrades to vault over them. From there, they assaulted the fortified Syrian positions. The fighting was waged at extremely close quarters, often hand-to-hand.&lt;ref name="Oren, pp. 283–283" /&gt;

On the northern flank, the Israelis broke through within minutes and cleared out the trenches and bunkers. During the seven-hour battle, the Israelis lost 31 dead and 82 wounded, while the Syrians lost 62 dead and 20 captured. Among the dead was the Israeli battalion commander. The Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion took Tel 'Azzaziat, and Darbashiya also fell to Israeli forces.&lt;ref name="Oren, pp. 283–283" /&gt;

[[File:1967-06-09 Egypt Accepts UN Cease-Fire.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=1:16|[[Universal Newsreel]] from 9 June about the war and UN reactions.]]
By the evening of 9 June, the four Israeli brigades had all broken through to the plateau, where they could be reinforced and replaced. Thousands of reinforcements began reaching the front, those tanks and half-tracks that had survived the previous day's fighting were refueled and replenished with ammunition, and the wounded were evacuated. By dawn, the Israelis had eight brigades in the sector.

Syria's first line of defense had been shattered, but the defenses beyond that remained largely intact. Mount Hermon and the Banias in the north, and the entire sector between Tawfiq and Customs House Road in the south remained in Syrian hands. In a meeting early on the night of 9 June, Syrian leaders decided to reinforce those positions as quickly as possible, and to maintain a steady barrage on Israeli civilian settlements.

==== Israeli attack: the next day (10 June)====
Throughout the night, the Israelis continued their advance. Though it was slowed by fierce resistance, an anticipated Syrian counterattack never materialized. At the fortified village of Jalabina, a garrison of Syrian reservists, leveling their anti-aircraft guns, held off the Israeli 65th Paratroop Battalion for four hours before a small detachment managed to penetrate the village and knock out the heavy guns.

Meanwhile, the 8th Brigade's tanks moved south from Qala, advancing six miles to Wasit under heavy artillery and tank bombardment. At the Banias in the north, Syrian mortar batteries opened fire on advancing Israeli forces only after Golani Brigade sappers cleared a path through a minefield, killing sixteen Israeli soldiers and wounding four.

On the next day, 10 June, the central and northern groups joined in a [[pincer movement]] on the plateau, but that fell mainly on empty territory as the Syrian forces retreated. At 8:30&amp;nbsp;am, the Syrians began blowing up their own bunkers, burning documents and retreating. Several units joined by Elad Peled's troops climbed to the Golan from the south, only to find the positions mostly empty. When the 8th Brigade reached Mansura, five miles from Wasit, the Israelis met no opposition and found abandoned equipment, including tanks, in perfect working condition. In the fortified Banias village, Golani Brigade troops found only several Syrian soldiers chained to their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

During the day, the Israeli units stopped after obtaining manoeuvre room between their positions and a line of volcanic hills to the west. In some locations, Israeli troops advanced after an agreed-upon cease-fire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |year=1960 |title=Video: Cease-Fire. Uneasy Truce In Mid-East, 1967/06/13 (1967)|url=https://archive.org/details/1967-06-13_Cease-Fire |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to occupy strategically strong positions.&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section "Playing for the Brink".&lt;/ref&gt; To the east, the ground terrain is an open gently sloping plain. This position later became the cease-fire line known as the "[[Purple Line (border)|Purple Line]]".

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported: "In an effort to pressure the United Nations into enforcing a ceasefire, Damascus Radio undercut its own army by broadcasting the fall of the city of [[Quneitra]] three hours before it actually capitulated. That premature report of the surrender of their headquarters destroyed the morale of the Syrian troops left in the Golan area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Campaign for the Books |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1 September 1967 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837237,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1967-06-13 Cease-Fire.ogv|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] from 13 June about the war]]
By 10 June, Israel had completed its final offensive in the Golan Heights, and a [[ceasefire]] was signed the day after. Israel had seized the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[West Bank]] of the Jordan River (including East Jerusalem), and the [[Golan Heights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Six-Day-War|title=Six-Day War – Middle East [1967]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one million Arabs were placed under Israel's direct control in the newly captured territories. Israel's strategic depth grew to at least 300 kilometers in the south, 60 kilometers in the east, and 20 kilometers of extremely rugged terrain in the north, a security asset that would prove useful in the [[Yom Kippur War]] six years later.

Speaking three weeks after the war ended, as he accepted an honorary degree from Hebrew University, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] gave his reasoning behind the success of Israel:

:Our airmen, who struck the enemies' planes so accurately that no one in the world understands how it was done and people seek technological explanations or secret weapons; our armoured troops who beat the enemy even when their equipment was inferior to his; our soldiers in all other branches … who overcame our enemies everywhere, despite the latter's superior numbers and fortifications—all these revealed not only coolness and courage in the battle but … an understanding that only their personal stand against the greatest dangers would achieve victory for their country and for their families, and that if victory was not theirs the alternative was annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Sachar 1976. p.&amp;nbsp;660.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of contributions, Rabin was given the honour of naming the war for the Israelis. From the suggestions proposed, including the "War of Daring", "War of Salvation", and "War of the Sons of Light", he "chose the least ostentatious, the Six-Day War, evoking the days of creation".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Oren 2002, electronic edition, Section "Aftershocks".&lt;/ref&gt;

Dayan's final report on the war to the Israeli general staff listed several shortcomings in Israel's actions, including misinterpretation of Nasser's intentions, overdependence on the United States, and reluctance to act when Egypt closed the Straits. He also credited several factors for Israel's success: Egypt did not appreciate the advantage of striking first and their adversaries did not accurately gauge Israel's strength and its willingness to use it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In Egypt, according to [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal|Heikal]], Nasser had admitted his responsibility for the military defeat in June 1967.&lt;ref name="PodehWinckler2004p110" /&gt; According to historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan, Nasser's mistaken decisions to expel the international peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and close the Straits of Tiran in 1967 led to a state of war with Israel, despite Egypt's lack of military preparedness.&lt;ref name="PodehWinckler2004p105" /&gt;

After the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Egypt reviewed the causes of its loss of the 1967 war. Issues that were identified included "the individualistic bureaucratic leadership"; "promotions on the basis of loyalty, not expertise, and the army's fear of telling Nasser the truth"; lack of intelligence; and better Israeli weapons, command, organization, and will to fight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

At the commencement of hostilities, both Egypt and Israel announced that they had been attacked by the other country.&lt;ref name=Quigley&gt;{{cite book|last=Quigley|first=John|title=The Case for Palestine: An International Law Perspective|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=London|isbn=0-8223-3539-5|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government later abandoned its initial position, acknowledging Israel had struck first, claiming that it was a preemptive strike in the face of a planned invasion by Egypt.&lt;ref name=Quigley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7875000/7875655.stm |title=BBC Panorama |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Arab view was that it was unjustified to attack Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=1662 |title=Egypt State Information Service |publisher=Sis.gov.eg |accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/cd0beba6a1e28eff0525672800567b2c?OpenDocument UN Security Council meeting 1347] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319194348/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/cd0beba6a1e28eff0525672800567b2c?OpenDocument |date=19 March 2011 }} (5 June 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators consider the war as the classic case of anticipatory attack in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Szabo2011p147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quigley2012p135" /&gt;

=== Allegations of atrocities committed against Egyptian soldiers ===
It has been alleged that Nasser did not want Egypt to learn of the true extent of his defeat and so ordered the killing of Egyptian army stragglers making their way back to the Suez canal zone.&lt;ref name="Id @ pg 179"&gt;Churchill &amp; Churchill 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;179.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been allegations from both Israeli and Egyptian sources that Israeli troops killed unarmed Egyptian prisoners.&lt;ref name="bron"&gt;Bron, Gabby [http://www.umassd.edu/specialprograms/mideastaffairs/witness2.htm 'Egyptian POWs Ordered to Dig Graves, Then Shot By Israeli Army'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219220611/http://www.umassd.edu/specialprograms/mideastaffairs/witness2.htm |date=19 February 2007 }}, ''Yedioth Ahronoth'', 17 August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zohar"&gt;Bar-Zohar, Michael 'The Reactions of Journalists to the Army's Murders of POWs', ''Maariv'', 17 August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pows"&gt;Prior 1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–10; Bar-On, Morris and Golani 2002; Fisher, Ronal 'Mass Murder in the 1956 War', ''Ma'ariv'', 8 August 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laub"&gt;Laub, Karin{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastfacts.com/pow_ap.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 December 2003 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211100314/http://www.mideastfacts.com/pow_ap.html |archivedate=11 December 2003 }}, ''Associated Press'', 16 August 1995.

=== Allegations of military support from the US, UK and Soviet Union ===
There have been a number of allegations of direct military support of Israel during the war by the US and the UK, including the supply of equipment (despite an embargo) and the participation of US forces in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=envoys&gt;Smith, 15 September 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen89"&gt;Bowen 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phythian193"&gt;Phythian 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;193–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these allegations and [[Arab conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]]&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) pp. 8, 53, 60, 75, 193, 199, 297&lt;/ref&gt; have been disputed and it has been claimed that some were given currency in the Arab world to explain the Arab defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Podeh, ''Middle East Quarterly'', Winter 2004, pp. 51-62&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been claimed that the Soviet Union, in support of its Arab allies, used its naval strength in the Mediterranean to act as a major restraint on the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Hattendorf 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bg1983"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/663999751.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Sep%2016,%201983 |title=McNamara: US Near War in '67 |date=16 September 1983 |work=The Boston Globe |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

America features prominently in Arab conspiracy theories purporting to explain the June 1967 defeat. [[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal]], a confidant of Nasser, claims that President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was obsessed with Nasser and that Johnson conspired with Israel to bring him down.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The reported Israeli troop movements seemed all the more threatening because they were perceived in the context of a US conspiracy against Egypt. Salah Bassiouny of the Foreign ministry, claims that Foreign Ministry saw the reported Israeli troop movements as credible because Israel had reached the level at which it could find strategic alliance with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Cairo announced that American and British planes were participating in the Israeli attack. Nasser broke off diplomatic relations following this allegation. Nasser's image of the United States was such that he might well have believed the worst. However [[Anwar Sadat]] implied that Nasser used this deliberate conspiracy in order to accuse the United States as a political cover-up for domestic consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Lutfi Abd al-Qadir, the director of Radio Cairo during the late 1960s, who accompanied Nasser to his visits in Moscow, had his conspiracy theory that both the Soviets and the Western powers wanted to topple Nasser or to reduce his influence.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim; Louis (2012) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USS ''Liberty'' incident ===
{{Main|USS Liberty incident}}
On 8 June 1967, [[USS Liberty (AGTR-5)|USS ''Liberty'']], a [[United States Navy]] [[ELINT|electronic intelligence]] vessel sailing {{convert|13|nmi|km}} off [[Arish]] (just outside Egypt's [[territorial waters]]), was attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats, nearly sinking the ship, killing 34 sailors and wounding 171. Israel said the attack was a case of mistaken identity, and that the ship had been misidentified as the Egyptian vessel ''El Quseir''. Israel apologized for the mistake, and paid compensation to the victims or their families, and to the United States for damage to the ship. After an investigation, the U.S. accepted the explanation that the incident was friendly fire and the issue was closed by the exchange of diplomatic notes in 1987. Others however, including the then [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]] at the time, [[Thomas Hinman Moorer|Admiral Thomas Moorer]], some survivors of the attack and intelligence officials familiar with transcripts of intercepted signals on the day, have rejected these conclusions as unsatisfactory and maintain that the attack was made in the knowledge that the ship was American.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-liberty_tuesoct02,0,66005.story |title=New revelations in attack on American spy ship |author=John Crewdson |date=2 October 2007 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Fischer, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/six-days-of-war-40-years-of-secrecy/2007/05/26/1179601730257.html&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s 'Six days of war, 40 years of secrecy,'] ''[[The Age]]'' 27 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=0zEi3qGWLFIC&amp;pg=PA93 ''The Six-Day War and Israeli Self-Defense: Questioning the Legal Basis for Preventive War''], Cambridge University Press 2013 p. 93. Cf [[Dean Rusk]], ''As I Saw it: A Secretary of State's Memoirs'',  W.W. Norton, 1990 pp. 386–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The political importance of the 1967 War was immense. Israel demonstrated again that it was able and willing to initiate strategic strikes that could change the regional balance. Egypt and Syria learned tactical lessons and would [[Yom Kippur War|launch an attack in 1973]] in an attempt to reclaim their lost territory.&lt;ref&gt;Brams &amp; Togman 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;243; Youngs 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;

After following other Arab nations in declaring war, Mauritania remained in a [[Mauritania-Israel war of 1967|declared state of war]] with Israel until about 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/features/inbedwithphillip/episodes/151-amos-oz/ [[Amos Oz]] interview with [[Phillip Adams]],] 10 September 1991, re-broadcast on [[ABC Radio National]] 23 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The United States imposed an embargo on new arms agreements to all Middle East countries, including Israel. The embargo remained in force until the end of the year, despite urgent Israeli requests to lift it.&lt;ref name="Quandt2001p43" /&gt;

=== Israel and Zionism ===
Following the war, Israel experienced a wave of national euphoria, and the press praised the military's performance for weeks afterward. New "victory coins" were minted to celebrate. In addition, the world's interest in Israel grew, and the country's economy, which had been in crisis before the war, flourished due to an influx of tourists and donations, as well as the extraction of oil from the Sinai's wells.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The aftermath of the war also saw a [[baby boom]], which lasted for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/news/hmo-data-show-lebanon-war-triggered-baby-boom-in-israel-1.214803|title=HMO Data Show Lebanon War Triggered Baby Boom in Israel|first=|last=Reuters|date=6 March 2007|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aftermath of the war is also of religious significance. Under [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian rule]], Jews were expelled from Jerusalem and were effectively barred from visiting the [[Western Wall]], despite Article VIII of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Jordan|1949 Armistice Agreement]] demanded Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet No. 52, Remembering the Six Day War |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/52_Remembering67.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514225632/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/52_Remembering67.html |archivedate=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tessler |first=Mark A. |title=A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1994 |page=326 |isbn=0-253-35848-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish holy sites were not maintained, and Jewish cemeteries had been desecrated. After the annexation to Israel, each religious group was granted administration over its holy sites. For the first time since 1948, Jews could visit the Old City of Jerusalem and pray at the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are permitted to pray, an event celebrated every year during [[Yom Yerushalayim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aikman |first=David |title=Great Souls: Six Who Changed a Century |publisher=Lexington Books |year=1998 |page=349 |isbn=0-7391-0438-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Temple Mount]] being the most important holy site in Jewish tradition, the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] has been under sole administration of the Jordanian Muslim [[Waqf]], and Jews are barred from praying on the Temple Mount, although they are allowed to visit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcpa.org/article/status-quo-on-temple-mount/ The "Status Quo" on the Temple Mount] November–December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/jerusalem-in-the-unholy-grip-of-religious-fervor/ Jerusalem in the unholy grip of religious fervor], Times of Israel. 6 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Hebron, Jews gained access to the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] – the second most holy site in Judaism, after the Temple Mount – for the first time since the 14th century (previously Jews were allowed to pray only at the entrance).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/special/israel/points_of_interest_cdo/aid/588225/jewish/Cave-of-the-Patriarchs.htm Cave of the Patriarchs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318073338/http://www.chabad.org/special/israel/points_of_interest_cdo/aid/588225/jewish/Cave-of-the-Patriarchs.htm |date=18 March 2015 }} Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish holy sites, such as [[Rachel's Tomb]] in Bethlehem and [[Joseph's Tomb]] in Nablus, also became accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Selwyn|title=Contested Mediterranean Spaces: The Case of Rachel's Tomb, Bethlehem, Palestine|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeology in Israel: Joseph's Tomb |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/joetomb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war inspired the [[Jewish diaspora]], which was swept up in overwhelming support for Israel. According to Michael Oren, the war enabled American Jews to "walk with their backs straight and flex their political muscle as never before. American Jewish organizations which had previously kept Israel at arms length suddenly proclaimed their Zionism."&lt;ref&gt;Oren, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Jewish immigrants arrived from Western countries such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[France]], and [[South Africa]] after the war. Many of them returned to their countries of origin after a few years; one survey found that 58% of American Jews who immigrated to Israel between 1961 and 1972 returned to the US. Nevertheless, this immigration to Israel of Jews from Western countries, which was previously only a trickle, was a significant force for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/misc/haaretzcomsmartphoneapp/dailybrief/.premium-1.636848 The Rise – and Rise – of French Jewry's Immigration to Israel] Judy Maltz, 13 January 2015. haaretz.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/the-40th-anniversary-of-the-six-day-war-rate-of-return-1.221976|title=The 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War / Rate of return|date=1 June 2007|work=Haaretz|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the war stirred Zionist passions among Jews in the [[Soviet Union]], who had by that time been forcibly assimilated. Many Soviet Jews subsequently applied for exit visas and began protesting for their right to immigrate to Israel. Following diplomatic pressure from the West, the Soviet government began granting exit visas to Jews in growing numbers. From 1970 to 1988, some 291,000 Soviet Jews were granted exit visas, of whom 165,000 immigrated to Israel and 126,000 immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tolts, Mark.

=== Jews in Arab countries ===
{{Main|Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}
In the Arab nations, populations of minority Jews faced persecution and expulsion following the Israeli victory. According to historian and ambassador [[Michael B. Oren]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mobs attacked Jewish neighborhoods in Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Morocco, burning synagogues and assaulting residents. A pogrom in [[Tripoli, Libya]], left 18 Jews dead and 25 injured; the survivors were herded into detention centers. Of Egypt's 4,000 Jews, 800 were arrested, including the chief rabbis of both [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]], and their property sequestered by the government. The ancient communities of [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] were placed under house arrest, their leaders imprisoned and fined. A total of 7,000 Jews were expelled, many with merely a [[Satchel (bag)|satchel]].&lt;ref&gt;Oren 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;306–07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Antisemitism against Jews in Communist countries ===
Following the war, a series of antisemitic purges began in Communist countries.&lt;ref name=RE-R-2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u75GldeYqUIC&amp;pg=PA390 |title=Excel HSC Modern History|first=Ronald |last=Ringer |page=390 |publisher=Pascal Press |date=2006 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W-R"&gt;Włodzimierz Rozenbaum, CIAO: Intermarium, ''National Convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies'', Atlanta, Ga., 8–11 October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 11,200 Jews from Poland immigrated to Israel during the [[1968 Polish political crisis]] and the following year.&lt;ref name="ipn238"&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/2/238/Communiqu_Investigation_regarding_communist_state_officers_who_publicly_incited_.html Communiqué: Investigation regarding communist state officers who publicly incited hatred towards people of different nationality.] ''[[Institute of National Remembrance]]'', [[Warsaw]]. Publication on Polish site of IPN: 25 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peace and diplomacy ===
Following the war, Israel made an offer for peace that included the return of most of the recently captured territories. According to [[Chaim Herzog]]:

{{quote|On June 19, 1967, the National Unity Government [of Israel] voted unanimously to return the Sinai to Egypt and the Golan Heights to Syria in return for peace agreements. The Golans would have to be demilitarized and special arrangement would be negotiated for the Straits of Tiran. The government also resolved to open negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan regarding the Eastern border.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;253.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 19 June Israeli cabinet decision did not include the [[Gaza Strip]], and left open the possibility of Israel permanently acquiring parts of the [[West Bank]]. On 25–27 June, Israel incorporated [[East Jerusalem]] together with areas of the West Bank to the north and south into Jerusalem's new municipal boundaries.

The Israeli decision was to be conveyed to the Arab nations by the United States. The U.S. was informed of the decision, but not that it was to transmit it. There is no evidence of receipt from Egypt or Syria, and some historians claim that they may never have received the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, the [[Khartoum Resolution|Khartoum Arab Summit]] resolved that there would be "no peace, no recognition and no negotiation with Israel". However, as [[Avraham Sela]] notes, the Khartoum conference effectively marked a shift in the perception of the conflict by the Arab states away from one centered on the question of Israel's legitimacy, toward one focusing on territories and boundaries. This was shown on 22 November when Egypt and Jordan accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]].&lt;ref&gt;Sela 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with [[Israel]] were tantamount to surrender.&lt;ref name="RabinovichShakedp192"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Itamar Rabinovich|author2=Haim Shaked|title=From June to October: The Middle East Between 1967 And 1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNQ3K5HfiHAC&amp;pg=PA192|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2418-7|page=192|quote=In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.

After the war, the entire Soviet bloc of Eastern Europe (with the exception of Romania) broke off diplomatic relations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Webman |first=Esther |title=The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth |url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=xWusAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=the+Communist+states,+with+the+exception+of+Romania,+broke+off+diplomatic+relations+with+Israel&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JSrAVI7dLteHsQSIxoCACw&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20Communist%20states%2C%20with%20the%20exception%20of%20Romania%2C%20broke%20off%20diplomatic%20relations%20with%20Israel&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |page=133 |isbn=978-0-415-59892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 War laid the foundation for future discord in the region, as the Arab states resented Israel's victory and did not want to give up territory.

On 22 November 1967, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]], the "[[land for peace]]" formula, which called for Israeli withdrawal "from territories occupied" in 1967 and "the termination of all claims or states of belligerency". Resolution 242 recognized the right of "every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force." Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1978, after the [[Camp David Accords]], and disengaged from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005. Its army frequently re-enters Gaza for military operations and still retains control of the seaports, airports and most of the border crossings.

=== Occupied territories and Arab displaced populations ===

In the Golan Heights, an estimated 80,000 Syrians fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/golan_h.htm |title=Golan Heights |accessdate=8 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel allowed only the inhabitants of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights to receive full Israeli citizenship, applying its law, administration and jurisdiction to these territories in 1967 and 1981, respectively. The vast majority of the populations in both territories declined to take citizenship. See also [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and [[Golan Heights]].

In his book ''Righteous Victims'' (1999), Israeli "[[New Historian]]" [[Benny Morris]] writes:
{{quote|In three villages southwest of Jerusalem and at Qalqilya, houses were destroyed "not in battle, but as punishment ... and in order to chase away the inhabitants ... contrary to government ... policy," Dayan wrote in his memoirs. In Qalqilya, about a third of the homes were razed and about 12,000 inhabitants were evicted, though many then camped out in the environs. The evictees in both areas were allowed to stay and later were given cement and tools by the Israeli authorities to rebuild at least some of their dwellings.

But many thousands of other Palestinians now took to the roads. Perhaps as many as seventy thousand, mostly from the Jericho area, fled during the fighting; tens of thousands more left over the following months. Altogether, about one-quarter of the population of the West Bank, about 200–250,000 people, went into exile. ... They simply walked to the Jordan River crossings and made their way on foot to the East Bank. It is unclear how many were intimidated or forced out by the Israeli troops and how many left voluntarily, in panic and fear. There is some evidence of IDF soldiers going around with loudspeakers ordering West Bankers to leave their homes and cross the Jordan. Some left because they had relatives or sources of livelihood on the East Bank and feared being permanently cut off.

Thousands of Arabs were taken by bus from East Jerusalem to the [[Allenby Bridge]], though there is no evidence of coercion. The free Israeli-organized transportation, which began on June 11, 1967, went on for about a month. At the bridge they had to sign a document stating that they were leaving of their own free will. Perhaps as many as 70,000 people emigrated from the Gaza Strip to Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world.

On July 2, the Israeli government announced that it would allow the return of those 1967 refugees who desired to do so, but no later than August 10, later extended to September 13. The Jordanian authorities probably pressured many of the refugees, who constituted an enormous burden, to sign up to return. In practice only 14,000 of the 120,000 who applied were allowed by Israel back into the West Bank by the beginning of September. After that, only a trickle of "special cases" were allowed back, perhaps 3,000 in all. (328–29)}}

In addition, between 80,000 and 110,000 Syrians fled the Golan Heights,&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2001) p.&amp;nbsp;327&lt;/ref&gt; of which about 20,000 were from the city of Quneitra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487614/al-Qunaytirah|title=Al-Qunayṭirah |accessdate=18 July 2010 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to more recent research by the Israeli daily ''[[Haaretz]]'', a total of 130,000 Syrian inhabitants fled or were expelled from the territory, most of them pushed out by the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;Shay Fogelman, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-disinherited-1.304959 "The disinherited"], ''Haaretz'', 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long term ===
Israel made peace with Egypt following the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978 and completed a staged withdrawal from the Sinai in 1982. However, the position of the other [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] has been a long-standing and bitter cause of conflict for decades between Israel and the Palestinians, and the Arab world in general. Jordan and Egypt eventually withdrew their claims to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza, respectively. Israel and Jordan signed a [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty in 1994]].

After the Israeli conquest of these newly acquired territories, the [[Gush Emunim]] movement launched a [[Israeli settlement|large settlement effort]] in these areas to secure a permanent foothold. There are now hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers in the West Bank. They are a matter of controversy within Israel, both among the general population and within different political administrations, supporting them to varying degrees. Palestinians consider them a provocation. The Israeli settlements in Gaza were evacuated in August 2005 as a part of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|Israel's disengagement from Gaza]].

The fighting on the eastern front was initiated by Jordan, not by Israel. King Hussein got carried along by a powerful current of Arab nationalism. On 30 May he flew to Cairo and signed a defense pact with Nasser. On 5 June, Jordan started shelling the Israeli side in Jerusalem. This could have been interpreted either as a salvo to uphold Jordanian honour or as a declaration of war. [[Levi Eshkol|Eshkol]] decided to give King Hussein the benefit of the doubt. Through General [[Odd Bull]], the Norwegian commander of UNTSO, he sent the following message the morning of 5 June: "We shall not initiate any action whatsoever against Jordan.

As of the moment he has vastly enhanced his own prestige in Egypt and throughout the Arab world, diminished the standing of Israel and, at least for the moment, administered a serious setback to the US. Moreover, by simply standing where he is he places the Israelis in an extremely difficult position. He keeps the crisis at high pitch, and as long as this continues the Israelis must remain mobilized. This they cannot do for long without adverse effects upon their economy. 5. The Israelis face dismaying choices. Surprised and shaken by Nasser's action, they failed to take the instant military counteraction which might have been most effective. If they attack now they will face far more formidable opposition than in the rapid campaign of 1956. We believe that they would still be able to drive the Egyptians away from the entrance to the Strait of Tiran, but it would certainly cost them heavy losses of men and materiel. We are not sure that they have sufficient stockpiles of ammunition and equipment for a war lasting more than three or four weeks, and it is possible that they would not embark upon a major campaign without prior assurances from the US of adequate resupply.}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

'''Summernats''' (a portmanteau of "Summer" and "National"), is an annual car festival held in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Fuller | first =Glen | title =ASMF History | work =Event Mechanics | publisher =Event Mechanics | date =6 May 2006 | url =http://eventmechanics.net.au/2006/05/asmf-history/ | accessdate =6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summernats, which is usually held at the start of the year, is the best known car festival in Australia, and an event which attracts many tourists to Canberra, bringing in excess of $20 million in economic benefit to the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/barr/2015/summernats-returns-to-cbr-in-january-2016|title=Summernats returns to CBR in January 2016|first=Andrew|last=Barr|authorlink=Andrew Barr|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has increasingly been promoted as an event for families. The Summernats spectator attendance record was set in 2017 with 119,184 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.summernats.com.au/news/detail.aspx?ArticleID=230|title=Summernats|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summernats features many street machines with [[airbrush]]ed [[Visual arts|artwork]], and restored and modified [[Automobile|cars]].

Street cruises were stopped after the 2005 Summernats, following crowd control issues, however thanks to the support of the ACT Government and several years of exemplary crowd and entrant behaviour the City Cruise was re-introduced in 2014. The City Cruise is the first driving event at each Summernats and is limited to 300 entrant vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.summernats.com.au/pages/?ParentPageID=80&amp;PageID=132|title=Summernats|website=www.summernats.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a mob of up to 400 men was observed by journalists surrounding and harassing women, leading Australian Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner [[Elizabeth Broderick]] to comment that such conduct fosters an environment that may lead to rape. Security staff were described as "powerless" to stop the mob, although event organiser Chic Henry stated that he was happy with the performance of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/national/summernats-could-lead-to-rape/story-e6frfkwi-1111115266709|title = Summernats 'could lead to rape'|last = Maley|first = Paul|date = 8 January 2008|newspaper = The Australian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405180724/http://www.news.com.au/national/summernats-could-lead-to-rape/story-e6frfkwi-1111115266709|archivedate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The End of Serialization as We Know It'''" is the tenth episode and the [[season finale]] in the [[South Park (season 20)|twentieth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 277th episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on December 7, 2016.

The episode, while mostly concluding the season's plot, once again reiterated the season's commentary on [[Internet troll|trolling]] and [[anonymous post|Internet anonymity]].

==Plot==
The [[SpaceX]] facility has finished using [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Heidi Turner|Heidi Turner]]'s research to create a massive source of energy that can easily propel transport to Mars. But after realizing that Heidi intends to break his heart (according to his skewed perception), [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] tries to convince various SpaceX staff to cancel the Mars project by explaining that his visions of life on a Mars colony ended with the enslavement of men.

[[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] and [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]] have recruited all of their remaining classmates to restart Skankhunt42's troll network. However, their mother [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila Broflovski]] escapes from the pantry she was previously locked in, forcing Kyle and Ike to escape using a [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system|Fulton system]]. As she searches for them across a crumbling South Park, Sheila ends up at the [[List of South Park families#The Tuckers|Tuckers]]' house where a distraught Laura Tucker reveals that she has already used Troll Trace to reveal her husband Thomas' Internet history and invites Sheila to do the same. Sheila searches Ike first and discovers that he is innocent, but cannot bring herself to search Gerald.

At [[The Pentagon]], the US government realizes that the only way to stop Troll Trace is to overload the Internet with trolling to the point where it shuts down and resets itself. They coordinate with the trolling team in Denmark as well as Kyle and Ike to overload the system, but their effort cannot beat the now-active Troll Trace without a massive source of power: the Mars power source at SpaceX.

In Denmark, Gerald Broflovski escapes from the control room with the help of both the troll team and the betrayed Troll Trace workers. He is guided across the facility to overload Troll Trace's operations, attracting the attention of Troll Trace CEO Lennart Bedrager. Bedrager confronts Gerald on a bridge leading to the final overload switch, resulting in a debate over the nature of trolling that Gerald "wins" by kicking Bedrager in the crotch and throwing him over a railing to his death. At the SpaceX facility, Cartman evacuates [[Elon Musk]] and the workers with a fake bomb threat from [[NASA]] before distracting Heidi long enough for [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] and an allied SpaceX employee to rig the Internet to the Mars power source.

The combined effort to shut down the Internet works, destroying SpaceX and interrupting Sheila before she can complete her search for Gerald. Life returns to normal across the world as [[Mr. Garrison|President Garrison]] takes his seat in the [[Oval Office]] before an assembled army of [[Member Berries|member berries]]. Gerald returns home to an oblivious Sheila and a furious Kyle and Ike. An old man in Florida sends out the first e-mail in the "new Internet" – to troll his friend.

==Reception==
Jesse Schedeen from [[IGN]] rated the episode a 6.6 out of 10, summarizing his review, "There were plenty of funny moments along the way, but also a lot of plot threads left dangling and a generally anticlimactic conclusion to the TrollTrace storyline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/south-park-the-end-of-serialization-as-we-know-it-review|title=South Park: "The End of Serialization As We Know It" Review - IGN.com|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|website=[[IGN]]|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 3.0 out of 10, stating "It was a disappointing end to a disappointing season. Too many plot holes, too many things not membered, not enough funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Jeremy|title=South Park 20.10 Review – 'The End of Serialization as We Know It'|url=http://411mania.com/movies/south-park-20-10-review-the-end-of-serialization-as-we-know-it/|website=411 Mania|accessdate=December 8, 2016|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Caffrey with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated the episode a C+, commenting "Whether it's the lack of consistent message or the emphasis on convoluted plot mechanics over jokes, ''South Park'' has felt unfocused for a few weeks now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caffrey|first1=Dan|title=South Park acknowledges this season’s flaws without actually fixing them|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-acknowledges-seasons-mistakes-without-a-247100|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=December 8, 2016|date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Longo with [[Den of Geek]] gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and stated "What worked in spurts last season, one of my all-time favorites, was flat here, hence the episode title. Matt (Stone) and Trey (Parker) knew it, and they had a lot of fun saving a season that didn't wholly work by stringing together a self-deprecating season finale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longo|first1=Chris|title=South Park Season 20 Finale Review|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/south-park/260573/south-park-season-20-finale-review|website=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=December 8, 2016|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hoppings''' is an annual [[travelling funfair]] held on the [[Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne|Town Moor]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], during the last week in June. It is one of [[Europe]]'s largest travelling funfairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/millions-go-hopping-mad-1588819.html |title=Millions go hopping mad |quote=Europe's largest travelling fair, the Hoppings, is a week of frenzied activity. |publisher=The Independent |date=29 June 1995 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/news-story/plans-postpone-historic-hoppings |title=Plans to postpone historic Hoppings |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/charter/newcastle.html |title=Newcastle Town Moor Fair |publisher=National Fairground Archive |quote=In terms of size Newcastle is perhaps the biggest fair in Britain, if not in Europe |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its forerunner was The Blaydon Races, which was held in [[Blaydon]].{{citation-needed|date=March 2015}}

Several origins have been suggested for the name, most of which relate to dancing. The word “hopping”, means a dance in [[Middle English]] (Old fairs included dancing). Another idea stems from the clothing which the travellers used to wear; that being of old, sack-like tops and pants. Clothing often became infested with fleas from the animals that travelled with the fair. People were often seen “jumping” or “hopping” about itching from the bites which they received. Or the name may derive from the Anglo-Saxon word “hoppen” meaning funfair.

The fair began as a [[Temperance movement|Temperance Fair]] in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-40123610&lt;/ref&gt; It was scheduled to coincide with Race Week at [[Newcastle Racecourse]], during which the ''[[Northumberland Plate]]'' was awarded.

[[File:The Hoppings, Newcastle Town Moor, 1960 (15399747002).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Hoppings in 1960]]
The fair took place at [[Jesmond Dene]] from 1914–1918 and returned to the more spacious Town Moor, just north of the city centre, in 1919.{{citation-needed|date=March 2015}} There was no Festival on the Moor between 1920 and 1923, but it returned in June 1924, where it continued annually until 1946; a non-[[Showmen's Guild]] Fair was held that year but proved to be unpopular.{{citation-needed|date=March 2015}} The Guild showmen returned in 1947 and the Hoppings was a success with a record attendance.{{citation-needed|date=March 2015}}

The Hoppings inspired the song ''Katie Was There'' by [[Eric Boswell (songwriter)|Eric Boswell]] which was part of his 1983 musical ''[[Eric Boswell (songwriter)#Musical theatre: Catherine Cookson's "Katie Mulholland"|Katie Mulholland]]'', based on [[Catherine Cookson]]'s novel, staged by [[Northern_Stage,_Newcastle_upon_Tyne|Newcastle Playhouse]].

In 2013 after a dispute between the Showmen's Guild and Newcastle City Council over pitch and rent terms, alternate fairs were held at Nuns Moor Newcastle upon Tyne and [[Herrington|Herrington Country Park]], [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lanagan, Paul; (2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6119">'''The Science of Consciousness''' ('''TSC'''; formerly '''Toward a Science of Consciousness''') is an international [[academic conference]] that has been held [[wikt:biannually|biennially]] since 1994. It is organized by the Center for Consciousness Studies of the [[University of Arizona]]. Alternate conferences are held in Arizona (either Tucson or Phoenix), and the others in locations worldwide. Each conference attracts hundreds{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} of attendees. The conference is devoted exclusively to the investigation of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name = SEPC&gt;{{ cite web | title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/Consciousness |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/ | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Associated people==
The main organizer is [[Stuart Hameroff]], an anestheologist and the director of the center that hosts the conference. One of the speakers at the first conference, [[David Chalmers]], co-organized some of the following ones, until the event became too far away from the mainstream&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bartlett |first1=Tom |title=Out of their minds: wild ideas at the ‘Coachella of consciousness’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/19/out-of-their-minds-wild-ideas-at-the-coachella-of-consciousness |accessdate=19 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An essay review ''Toward a science of consciousness:Tucson I and II'' by J. Gray was printed in ''ISR Interdisciplinary Science Reviews'' Volume 24 Issue 4 (1 April 1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–260.&lt;ref&gt;This journal appears in both print ({{ISSN|0308-0188}}) and online ({{ISSN|1743-2790}}).{{ cite web |url= http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/030801899678911 | title=Review of conference by J.

A review of TSC 2012 may be found in the [[Journal of Consciousness Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Thousand Flowers|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|volume=19|issue=7–8|pages=247–70|date=July–August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of Consciousness Exploration &amp; Research'', Christopher Holvenstot reviewed TSC 2011, likening it to ''The Greatest Show on Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Toward a Science of Consciousness 2011: The Greatest Show on Earth |journal= Journal of Consciousness Exploration &amp; Research |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=656–665 |date=June 2011 }} See: {{ cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/793734/Toward_a_Science_of_Consciousness_2011_The_Geatest_Show_on_Earth

Michael Punt reviewed TSC 2002 in the journal ''Leonardo''.&lt;ref name=Punt&gt;{{cite journal|title=Toward a Science of Consciousness (Review)|journal=Leonardo|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=89–90|date=February 2003|doi=10.1162/leon.2003.36.1.89}} See: {{ cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/leonardo/v036/36.1punt.html | title=Review of conference by Michael Punt. |accessdate=2014-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Chapter 8 of [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]]'s book ''The Undiscovered Mind'' is entirely devoted to his experiences at the first (1994) TSC  conference.&lt;ref name=Horgan1&gt;{{cite book |last=Horgan |first=John |title=The Undiscovered Mind – How the Human Brain Defies Replication, Medication, and Explanation |year=2000 |publisher=New York: Free Press |isbn=978-0684865782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference and its main organizers were the subject of a long feature in June 2018, first in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', and re-published in ''[[The Guardian]]''. Tom Bartlett concluded that the conference was "more or less the Stuart [Hameroff] Show. He decides who will and who will not present. [...] Some consciousness researchers believe that the whole shindig has gone off the rails, that it’s seriously damaging the field of consciousness studies, and that it should be shut down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bartlett |first1=Tom |title=Out of their minds: wild ideas at the ‘Coachella of consciousness’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/19/out-of-their-minds-wild-ideas-at-the-coachella-of-consciousness |accessdate=19 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13641">'''Workplace deviance''', in [[group psychology]], may be described as the deliberate (or intentional) desire to cause harm to an organization – more specifically, a workplace. The concept has become an instrumental component in the field of [[organizational communication]]. More accurately, it can be seen as "voluntary behavior that violates institutionalized [[Norm (social)|norms]] and in doing so threatens the well-being of the organization".&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin and O'Leary-Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

=== Psychological contract ===
{{Main|Psychological contract}}
Employees often create a set of expectations about their workplace; people tend to make psychological contracts with their organizations. When his or her expectations are not met, the employee may "perceive a psychological contract breach by their employers".&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;Chiu and Peng&lt;/ref&gt; This "breach" of the psychological contract then presents potential problems, particularly in the workplace.

Workplace deviance may arise from the worker's perception that their organization has mistreated him or her in some manner. Employees then resort to misbehaving (or acting out) as a means of avenging their organization for the perceived wrongdoing. Workplace deviance may be viewed as a form of negative reciprocity. "A negative reciprocity orientation is the tendency for an individual to return negative treatment for negative treatment".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell and Ambrose&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the maxim "an eye for an eye" is a concept that some employees strongly feel is a suitable approach to their problem. However, what is critical in understanding employee deviance is that the employee perceives being wronged, whether or not mistreatment actually occurred.

=== Abusive supervision ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Workplace deviance is also closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;Bolin and Heatherly&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;Benner and Robinson&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves. The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Types==
Workplace deviance may be expressed in various ways. Employees can engage in minor, extreme, nonviolent or violent behavior, which ultimately leads to an organization's decline in productivity. Interpersonal and organizational deviance are two forms of workplace deviance which are directed differently; however, both cause harm to an organization.

=== Interpersonal deviance ===
Interpersonal deviance can occur when misconduct "target(s) specific stakeholders such as coworkers".&lt;ref name="Pulich"&gt;Pulich and Tourigny&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior falling within this subgroup of employee deviance includes gossiping about coworkers and assigning blame to them. These minor (but unhealthy) behaviors, directed at others, are believed to occur as some employees perceive "a sense of entitlement often associated with exploitation".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; In other words, they feel the need to misbehave in ways that will benefit them.

=== Organizational deviance ===
Deviant behavior typically aimed directly at the organization is often referred to as organizational deviance.&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; Organizational deviance encompasses production and property deviance. Workplace-deviant behavior may be expressed as tardiness or excessive absenteeism.&lt;ref name="Everton"&gt;Everton et al&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors have been cited by some researchers as "withdraw(al) behaviors…such behaviors allow employees to withdraw physically and emotionally from the organization".&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Silence ===
{{Main|Employee silence}}
Employee silence is also considered a deviant behavior in the workplace, falling into the realms of both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Silence becomes employee deviance when "an employee intentionally or unintentionally withholds any kind of information that might be useful to the organization".&lt;ref&gt;Tangirala and Ramanujam&lt;/ref&gt; The problem occurs if an employee fails to disclose important information, which detrimentally affects the effectiveness of the organization due to poor communication.

=== Coworker backstabbing ===
{{See also|Office politics}}
Coworker [[backstabbing]] occurs to some degree in many workplaces. It consists of an employee's doing something to another employee to get a "leg up" on the other employee. Strategies used for backstabbing include [[dishonesty]], [[blame]] (or [[false accusation]]), [[discrediting]] others and taking credit for another's work. Motives for backstabbing include disregarding others' rights in favor of one's own gain, [[self-image]] management, [[revenge]], [[jealousy]], and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Malone&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber loafing ===
{{Main|Cyber loafing}}
A novel form of workplace deviance has emerged in recent years, as technology becomes a bigger part of people's work lives. Internet workplace deviance (or "cyber loafing") has become another way for employees to avoid the tasks at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Zoghbi&lt;/ref&gt; This includes surfing the web and doing non-work-related tasks on the internet such as chatting on social-networking sites, online shopping and other activities.

=== Production deviance ===
All behaviors in which deviant employees partake ultimately have a negative impact on the overall productivity of the organization. For this reason, all are considered production deviance. Production deviance is "behavior that violates formally prescribed organizational norms with respect to minimal quality and quantity of work to be accomplished as part of one's job".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt;

=== Property deviance ===
More serious cases of deviant behavior harmful to an organization concern property deviance. Property deviance is "where employees either damage or acquire tangible assets…without authorization".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; This type of deviance typically involves theft but may include "sabotage, intentional errors in work, misusing expense accounts", among other examples.&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Other types ===
Deviant behavior can be much more extreme, involving [[sexual harassment]] and even [[workplace violence|violence]]. All these deviant behaviors create problems for the organization. It is costly for an organization to pay employees who are not working efficiently.

==Reducing==

The relationships employees have with their organization are crucial, as they can play an important role in the development of workplace deviance. Employees who perceive their organization or supervisor(s) as more caring (or supportive) have been shown to have a reduced incidence of workplace-deviant behaviors. Supervisors, managers and organizations are aware of this, and "assess their own behaviors and interactions with their employees and understand while they may not intend to abuse their employees they may be perceived as doing so…".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

'''[[Organizational justice]]''' and the organizational climate are also critical, since the quality of the work experience can impact employee behavior in the workplace. Organizational justice may be organized into three subcategories: procedural, distributive and interactional justice.

* [[Procedural justice]] is concerned with how the decision-making process was made.
* [[Distributive justice]], on the other hand, considers the actual decision.
* [[Interactional justice]] involves the interpersonal relationship and sense of fairness which employees have with supervisors and other authority figures within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Ogbonna&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that procedural justice (combined with interactional justice) is beneficial in reducing workplace-deviant behavior. Employees who are consulted (and given an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making processes at their organization) are less likely to act out, since their voices are valued.

Workplace deviance is a phenomenon which occurs frequently within an organization. Ultimately, it is the managers' and the organization's responsibility to uphold the norms to which the organization wishes to adhere; it is the organization's job to create an ethical climate.&lt;ref name="Litzky"&gt;Litzky et al&lt;/ref&gt; If organizations have authority figures who demonstrate their ethical values, a healthier workplace environment is created. "Research has suggested that managers' behavior influences employee ethical decision-making".&lt;ref name="Litzky"/&gt; Employees who perceive themselves as being treated respectfully and valued are those less likely to engage in workplace deviance.
