      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2405">The '''Alpine Pass Route''' is a long-distance hiking trail through the Alps in [[Switzerland]], part of the [[Via Alpina]] route.  It starts in [[Sargans]] in eastern Switzerland, and crosses the heart of country westwards to finish in [[Montreux]] on the shore of [[Lake Geneva]].  The total route covers over {{convert|325|km|mi}} and crosses 16 [[mountain pass]]es, and takes 15 or more walking days to complete.&lt;ref name=tita10&gt;{{cite book | title = Trekking in the Alps | first = Kev | last = Reynolds | pages = 124-135 |  chapter = Trek 10 - Alpine Pass Route | publisher = Cicerone | year = 2011 |  isbn = 978 1 85284 600 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The route==
There are a number of variations on the precise route, but the following stages are fairly standard:&lt;ref name=tita10/&gt;
* From [[Sargans]] over the [[Foo Pass]] to [[Elm, Switzerland|Elm]]
* Over the [[Richetli Pass]] to [[Linthal, Glarus|Linthal]]
* Over the [[Klausen Pass]] to [[Flüelen]]
* Over the [[Surenen Pass]] to [[Engelberg]]
* Over the [[Joch Pass]] to [[Meiringen]]
* Over the [[Grosse Scheidegg Pass]] to [[Grindelwald]]
* Over the [[Kleine Scheidegg Pass]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]]
* Over the [[Sefinenfurgge Pass]] to [[Griesalp]]
* Over the [[Hohtürli Pass]] to [[Kandersteg]]
* Over the [[Bunderchrinde Pass]] to [[Adelboden]]
* Over the [[Hahnenmoos Pass]] to [[Lenk]]
* Over the [[Trütlisberg Pass]] to [[Lauenen]]
* Over the [[Krinne]] to [[Gsteig bei Gstaad|Gsteig]]
* Over the [[Col des Andérets]] to [[Col des Mosses]]
* Over the [[Col de Chaude]] to [[Montreux]]

The central portion of the route through the Berner Oberland is the most spectacular, with many hikers choosing to hike a few passes rather than the whole route in one go.  The excellent transport connections give many possibilities for breaking it up.&lt;ref name=tita10/&gt;

==Signposting==
The signposting along the route is excellent, with countless signs, markers and arrows.  Most of the signs carry the name of the next pass or town, but increasingly the green square "[[Via Alpina]]" signs are being introduced.  This route is now called route number 1 of a collection of long-distance walking routes.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4294">The '''Benjamin Sisters''' ([[Urdu]]: بنجمن سسٹرز) were a [[Pakistan]]i singing group of three sisters, Nerissa, Beena and Shabana Benjamin. Usually they sang in [[choir|chorus]]es-singing together in performances on [[Pakistan Television]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they achieved immense popularity in both Pakistan and neighboring regions of [[North India]] in what began to be referred to as the ''Benjamin Sisters Phenomenon''.&lt;ref name="atpatp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistaniat.com/2006/12/17/benjamin-sisters-silver-jubilee/|title=Benjamin Sisters: Silver Jubilee|publisher=All Things Pakistan|accessdate=2008-06-27|quote=''... the 1980s talk-show Silver Jubilee ... is memorable because it launched the 'Benjamin Sisters phenomenon'.

They then joined the Sunday School choir at The Christ Church - this was all the musical training that they had received.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Benjamin Sisters' singing style==
The Benjamin Sisters first participated in various music learning programs aired on [[Pakistan Television]] from 1968 to 1987. These programs were conducted by [[Sohail Rana]]; a prominent music director of Pakistan, and they were aimed at educating children about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanpaedia.com/celeb/sohail/Celeb_sohail-rana.html|title=Sohail Rana: The Unmatched Music Maestro|publisher=Dawn|accessdate=2010-11-28}}, Retrieved 28 Nov 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters usually sang [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]] songs, and tended to initially provide new renderings of songs sung by other artists as opposed to developing their own material. This was partially because the sisters initially appeared in the TV talk show ''Silver Jubilee'' (1983), where old artistes were often the invited guests whose songs the sisters would perform as a tribute to them.&lt;ref name="atpatp" /&gt; The three sang in a synchronized way, in a "single voice". The sisters later achieved further fame after the release of the patriotic national songs of Pakistan, such as the ''Iss parcham kay saye taley, hum ek hain'',''Ay roohe quaid aaj ke din ham tujhe sey wada kartey hain'',''Khayal rakhna khayal rakhna'' etc. which they sang during the 1980s.

==Family background==
The Benjamin Sisters are from a [[Christianity in Pakistan|Pakistani Christian]] family.&lt;ref name="tikekar2004"&gt;{{Cite document | title=Across the Wagah: an Indian's sojourn in Pakistan | author=Maneesha Tikekar | date=2004 | publisher=Bibliophile South Asia | isbn=81-85002-34-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGqsWktyFcEC | quote=''...

The '''Caretaker Cabinet of Ioannis Grivas''' was the Cabinet of the government of Greece for the period 12 October–23 November 1989. It was sworn in on 12 October 1989 when the government of [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]] completed its work. The outgoing chairman of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]], [[Yannis Grivas|Ioannis Grivas]] formed a [[caretaker government]], which conducted the [[Greek legislative election, November 1989]]. This election resulted in a hung parliament, and the [[Ecumenical Cabinet of Xenophon Zolotas]] which formed on 23 November 1989.

The '''Coalition Wars''' (French: ''Guerres de Coalitions'', German: ''Koalitionskriege'', Dutch: ''Coalitieoorlogen'' etc.) were a series of seven wars waged by various [[military alliance]]s, known as the Coalitions, between great [[Europe]]an powers against [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]], and from 1796 onwards General and later Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grab |first=Alexander |date=2003 |title=Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=d48dBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |location= |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |page=1 |isbn=9781403937575 |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta coalitieoorlogen"&gt;{{nl icon}} Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "coalitieoorlogen". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coalition Wars were:
*[[War of the First Coalition]] (April 1792 – October 1797)
*[[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798/99 – 1801/02)
*[[War of the Third Coalition]] (1803/05 – December 1805)
*[[War of the Fourth Coalition]] (October 1806 – July 1807)
*[[War of the Fifth Coalition]] (April – October 1809)
*[[War of the Sixth Coalition]] (March 1813 – May 1814)
*[[War of the Seventh Coalition]], also known as the [[Hundred Days]] (March – July 1815)

== Terminology ==

=== Etymology ===
One of the first usages of the term can be found in the 1803 [[Tribunat]] report, titled ''Résultats des guerres, des négociations et des traités qui ont préced́é et suivi la coalition contre la France'' ("Results of the Wars, Negotiations and Treaties that preceded and followed the Coalition against France"). About the situation in April 1793, when General [[Dumouriez]] had just been [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|defeated at Neerwinden]] and defected to Austria, causing despair in France, it states: "Les événements de cette époque sont les plus pénibles à décrire de tous ceux qui ont signalé ''les guerres de la coalition''." ("The events of that time are the most painful to describe of all those that marked ''the wars of the coalition''.")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Arnould |date=1803 |title=Résultats des guerres, des négociations et des traités qui ont préced́é et suivi la coalition contre la France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeYzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 |location=Paris |publisher=Badouin |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1805, the ''Salzburger Intelligenzblatt'' was one of the first to number the Coalition Wars when it discussed "Das Staatsinteresse von Baiern bei dem dritten Koalitions-Kriege" ("The national interest of Bavaria in the Third Coalition War").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=January 1805 |title=Intelligenzblatt von Salzburg: 1805 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYxEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA143 |journal=Salzburger Intelligenzblatt |publisher=Verlag des Zeitungs-Comtoirs |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=143–4 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Third Coalition had been formed by that time, war had not yet broken out; the Austrian newspaper discussed why the neighbouring [[Electorate of Bavaria]] was likely to side with the French Republic rather than the Austrian-led Coalition. On 30 September 1805, a few days after the launch of the [[Ulm Campaign]], Emperor Napoleon addressed his troops in Strasbourg, starting his speech with the words: "Soldats, la guerre de la troisième coalition est commencée." ("Soldiers, the war of the third coalition has begun.")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Guizot |first=François |authorlink1=François Guizot |date=2015 |title=L'histoire de France depuis 1789 jusqu'en 1848 racontée à mes petits-enfants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VimiBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT491 |location= |publisher=Primento |page=491 |isbn=9782335028768 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compared to other terms ===
[[File:Nach der Völckerschlacht1.jpg|300px|thumb|The Sixth Coalition's monarchs, [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I of Russia]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis I of Austria]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], are informed that the French army has been [[Battle of Leipzig|defeated at Leipzig]].]]
The term is distinct from "[[French Revolutionary Wars]]", which covers any war involving Revolutionary France between 1792 and 1799, when Napoleon seized power with the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] (9 November 1799), which is usually considered the end of the French Revolution. Since the War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802) had already begun when Napoleon seized power, the war as a whole may&lt;ref name="Encarta coalitieoorlogen"/&gt; or may not be counted amongst the French Revolutionary Wars, which therefore may end in 1799, 1801 ([[Treaty of Lunéville]]) or 1802 ([[Treaty of Amiens]]).

It also differs from "[[Napoleonic Wars]]", which is variously defined as covering any war involving France ruled by Napoleon between 1799 and 1815 (which includes the War of the Second Coalition, 1798–1802), or not commencing until the [[War of the Third Coalition]] (1803/05, depending on periodisation). In the latter case, historians do not term the War of the Second Coalition "Napoleonic", since Napoleon did not initiate it himself, but merely "inherited" it from the Revolutionary French Directory which he overthrew during the war.

Because it only pertains to wars involving any of the Coalition parties, not all wars counted amongst the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are considered "Coalition Wars". For example, the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] (1798, between the First and Second Coalition), the [[Stecklikrieg]] (1802, between the Second and Third Coalition) and the [[French invasion of Russia]] (1812, between the Fifth and Sixth Coalition) were not "Coalition Wars", since France fought against a single opponent.
{{Timeline Coalition Wars}}

== Coalition parties ==
The main European powers who forged the various anti-French Coalitions were [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], although except for Great Britain not all of them were involved in every Coalition. Smaller powers that occasionally joined the Coalitions include [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont–Sardinia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Denmark–Norway]] and various German and Italian states. The First until Fifth Coalitions fell apart when one or more parties were defeated by France and were forced to leave the alliance, and sometimes became French allies; the Sixth and Seventh were dissolved after Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and 1815 and a new balance of power was established between the parties at the [[Congress of Vienna]].

'''Comic Boyz''' ({{zh|t=可米小子}}, 2001 - 2005) was a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[quintet|vocal quintet]] [[boy band]], composed of Kingone Wang, Figaro Tseng, Peter Chang, Shone An, and Arroy Shen. Despite the publicity and making appearance in [[Taiwanese drama]]s, Comic Boyz was not as successful as expected, especially since they kept being compared to their predecessor, [[F4 (band)|F4]].  They disbanded in 2005 after the release of their farewell album ''Goodbye Comic Boyz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.zaobao.com/pages1/kemi220105.html|script-title=zh:可米小子正式解散 推出告别专辑|accessdate=2011-04-11|publisher=|date=2005-01-22|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

===2001: Band formation===
In 2001, after the success of [[F4 (band)|F4]], Comic Ritz Production was looking to create a new group to fulfill the 'boy band craze' in [[Taiwan]]. The first selection left them with 11 potential candidates for the group. The 11 young men underwent training and part of the training was to host TV shows. After six months of training, they were evaluated based on their performance. Five members were eliminated and the remaining six formed the official group. The six men were [[Kingone Wang]], [[Figaro Tseng]], [[Shone An]], Arroy Shen, Peter Chang, and Eddie Hsu.

In 2002, right after their first album was released, Hsu slipped and fell on the floor while practicing a dance routine. He suffered several bone fractures that would require 3–4 months of absence to recover. After consideration, Hsu decided to leave the group and focus on school work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2003-03-04/1437135662.html|script-title=zh:"可米小子"组合生变故 许君豪退出后继续学业|accessdate=2011-04-11|publisher=[[Sina.com]]|date=2003-03-04|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he used to be the group leader, the management team put Wang as the leader of the group.

===2005: Split===

Since the disbandment, Wang, Tseng, and Shen remain active in the entertainment industry.  Wang became a successful actor. He won Taiwanese [[Golden Bell Awards]] for [[Golden Bell Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. Tseng is also an active actor and painter. Chang returned to school and worked for some commonplace jobs until 2012. Since 2013, he has been in the catering industry.

Shen went on to become a host in some entertainment shows but he died on 19 October 2012, due to complications that accompanied a brain injury. His funeral was attended by all 4 other members. An left the entertainment industry around 2006, but in 2009 he became a host of a talk show until his death from liver cancer on 1 June 2015. His funeral was attended by former bandmates Wang and Chang.

'''"Comme on s'aime"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "How We Love Each Other") was the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972]], performed in [[French language|French]] by the duo [[Peter McLane]] and [[Anne-Marie Godart]].

The song is a duet, in which the singers describe the unending devotion they have for one another. They explain that, despite it being ''"the same old subject"'', they still find their love fresh each day.

The song was performed fifteenth on the night, following [[Sweden]]'s [[Family Four]] with "[[Härliga sommardag]]" and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Serge &amp; Christine Ghisoland]] with "[[À la folie ou pas du tout]]". At the close of voting, it had received 65 points, placing 16th in a field of 18.

It was succeeded as Monegasque representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973 Contest]] by [[Marie-France Dufour|Marie]] with "[[Un train qui part]]".

[[Image:Dienaslapa27feb1893.png|thumb|1893 ''Dienas Lapa'' header]]'''''Dienas Lapa''''' ('Daily Sheet') was a [[Latvian language|Latvian]] newspaper published from 1886 to 1905.  It espoused progressive politics, including workers' rights and Latvian cultural autonomy. The editors of the newspaper included [[Pēteris Stučka]] (1888-91, 1895-97) and [[Rainis|Jānis Pliekšāns]] (1891-1895). In 1893, Rainis attended a socialist congress in Zurich, met August Bebel, and smuggled [[Marxism|Marxist]] and socialist literature back into Latvia. Upon his return, ''Dienas Lapa'' shifted from a progressive political bias to promoting Marxist and [[Social Democracy|Social Democratic]] ideas. Dienas Lapa became a rallying point for revolutionary intellectuals in Latvia. In 1897 the newspaper was closed down by the authorities for several months. Both Rainis and Stucka were arrested as revolutionaries and served time in prison and forced exile in Russia. It soon re-emerged, but adopted bourgeois orientation.

"Dienas Lapa" had broad circulation, but was also passed from person to person. Its influence can not be overstated because it inspired and communicated workers' strikes, uprisings against the Baltic-German land barons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="105483">The '''Flanaess''' is the eastern part of the [[continent]] of [[Oerik]], one of the four continents of the [[fictional world]] of [[Oerth]] in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' fantasy [[roleplaying game]]. The Flanaess has been the setting of dozens of adventures published between the 1970s and 2000s and continues to be the central focus of the campaign world.

==Development of the Flanaess==

In late 1972, [[Dave Arneson]] demonstrated a new type of game to a group of gamers in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, including game designer [[Gary Gygax]]. Gygax agreed to develop a set of rules with Arneson and get the game published; the game eventually became known as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. Gygax designed a set of dungeons underneath the ruins of [[Castle Greyhawk]] as a testing ground for new rules, character classes and spells. In those early days, there was no "Flanaess"; the world map of "Oerth" was developed by Gygax as circumstances dictated, the new cities and lands simply drawn over a map of North America. Gygax and his friend [[Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]] further developed this campaign setting, and by 1976, the lands within a radius of 50 miles had been mapped in depth, and the lands within a radius of approximately 500 miles were in outline form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gygax | first = Gary | authorlink = Gary Gygax | title = Letter from Gary Gygax  | journal =[[Alarums and Excursions]] | issue = 15 | pages = 5–7 | publisher = [[Lee Gold]] |date = October 1976| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, more distant lands had been roughly sketched out to accommodate various adventures. ''(For more information about the first days of Gygax's home campaign, see [[Greyhawk]].)''

Following yet more work, in 1978 Gygax agreed to publish his world and decided to redevelop Oerth from scratch. Once he had sketched out the entire planet to his satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;Q: "In Dragon 315, Jim Ward talks about the origins of the Greyhawk setting, and is quoted as having said: 'He [Gygax] had the whole world mapped out'. Does this mean you have material about the rest of Oerth hidden in your basement?" Gygax: "Yes, I had a sketch map of the remainder of the globe..." {{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part IX, Page 33) | publisher = EN World | date = 2005-06-21 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-33.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: "The exact form of the remainder of the globe was not settled upon. I wanted an Atlantis-like continent, and possibly a Lemurian-type one. Likely two large continents would have been added. The nearest would house cultures akin to the Indian, Burmese, Indonesian, Chinese, Tibetan, and Japanese. Another would likely have been the location of African-type cultures, including the Egyptian. A Lemurian culture would have been based on the Central and South American cultures of the Aztec-Mayay-Inca sort."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part II, Page 19) | publisher = EN World | date = 2003-04-06 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/38912-q-gary-gygax-continuation-thread-part-ii-19.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; one hemisphere of Oerth was dominated by a massive continent called [[Oerik]]. Gygax decided to concentrate his first efforts on the continent of Oerik and asked TSR's printing house about the maximum size of paper they could handle; the answer was 34" x 22" (86&amp;nbsp;cm x 56&amp;nbsp;cm). He found that, using the scale he desired, he could fit only the northeast corner of Oerik on two of the sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: "When I was asked to create a campaign setting for TSR to market, I did a new and compact "world"--that only in part, of course, as that was all I could fit onto the two maps allowed. So that became the World of Greyhawk." {{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part I, Page 8) | publisher = EN World | date = 2002-09-06 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/22566-q-gary-gygax-part-i-8.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gygax: "I found out the maximum map size TSR could produce, got the go-ahead for two maps of that size, then sat down for a couple of weeks and hand-drew the whole thing. After the maps were done and the features shown were named, I wrote up brief information of the features and states. Much of the information was drawn from my own personal world, but altered to fit the new one depicted on the maps."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part IV, Page 11) | publisher = EN World | date = 2003-11-05 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-11.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corner of Oerik became known as "the Flanaess", so named in Gygax's mind because of the peaceful people known as the Flannae who had once lived there. Gygax also added many more new regions, countries and cities, bringing the number of political states to 60:

*Blackmoor&lt;ref&gt;Gygax borrowed the name of Dave Arneson's campaign world, Blackmoor, for one of his regions. However, his intention was not to move any part of Arneson's campaign to his own, and the Greyhawk region of Blackmoor bore no resemblance to Arneson's world, other than a sly reference to a ruined castle and "extensive ruins are supposed to exist under these ruins". Gygax: "The Blackmoor on the Oerik maps is certainly not the same as Dave Arneson's campaign setting. I liked its ring, so I put it onto the map as I was making up names for the various states."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part X, Page 7) | publisher = EN World | date = 2006-05-29 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/161566-gary-gygax-q-part-x-7.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was set in Lakofka's home campaign setting of Lendore Island, so Gygax added that placename to the Spindrift Islands archipelago, and slyly added a reference to Lakofka in the description of the islands: "Lendore Isle is named for the Arch Mage who founded it, but tales of him and the fellowship he brought to the Spindrifts are all but lost."&lt;/ref&gt;

Needing original placenames for all of the geographical and political places on his map, Gygax sometimes resorted to wordplay based on the names of friends and acquaintances. For instance, Perrenland was named after [[Jeff Perren]], who co-wrote the rules for ''Chainmail'' with Gygax; Urnst was a homophone of Ernst (his son Ernie); and Sunndi was a near-homophone of Cindy, another of Gygax's children.&lt;ref name="Revised Greyhawk Index"&gt;{{cite web | title = Revised Greyhawk Index | publisher = TSR | url = http://www.greyhawkonline.com/canonfire/gh_index.rtf | accessdate = 2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Gygax's prototype map, [[Darlene Pekul]], a freelance artist in Lake Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Interview: Darlene | publisher = Grognardia | url = http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2009/06/interview-darlene.html| accessdate = 2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a full colour map on a hex grid. Gygax was so pleased with the end result that he quickly switched his home Greyhawk campaign over to the new world he had created.&lt;ref&gt;''Gygax: "Of course as my campaign world was active, had many players, I did not wish to detail it [for the general public], so I created Oerth, the continent of Oerik, and all that went with it for general use by other DMs. I found I liked it so well that I switched my group's play to the World of Greyhawk soon after I had finished the maps and manuscript"'' {{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q &amp; A (Part X, Page 11) | publisher = EN World | date = 2006-06-04 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/161566-gary-gygax-q-part-x-11.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This map formed the basis of the World of Greyhawk when it was published as the 32-page [[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting|''The World of Greyhawk'' folio]] in 1980.

Gygax also developed a thousand-year history for the Flanaess that involved a series of cultural and military invasions: the peaceful Flannae had been pushed out by the warlike Suloise; the Suloise in turn had been pushed out by the noble Oeridians, who set up a Great Kingdom of peace and prosperity. However, by 576 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]] (the year Gygax chose for his setting), the Oeridian empire had grown decadent and evil, and many subservient regions were rising up in rebellion.

In 1992, after Gygax had been forced out of TSR, the storyline of the Flanaess was moved forward a decade by the ''[[From the Ashes (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|From the Ashes]]'' boxed set, which dealt with the aftermath of wide-ranging conflict known as The Greyhawk Wars. In 1998, the storyline was advanced even further, to 591 CY, by ''[[The Adventure Begins]]'' softcover. The massive multiplayer ''[[Living Greyhawk]]'' campaign, which started in 2001, used ''The Adventure Begins'' as a starting point, and advanced the timeline of the campaign ahead one year for each of real-world time. For example, in 2002, the campaign year was 592 CY. In 2003, it was 593 CY.)

==Races==
As well as being home to a number of demihuman and [[Humanoid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|humanoid]] [[Character race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|races]], it is also inhabited by the [[Suloise|Suel]], [[Baklunish|Bakluni]], [[Oerid]], and [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] subraces of humanity. The Oerid once inhabited the plains of Central Oerik, but moved into what is now known as Ull starting 1,235 years ago. The Oeridians settled in much of the Flanaess, often conquering and assimilating the Flan natives and Suel settlers, though some lands, such as the Sheldomar Valley and Vale of Luna, were settled more peacefully.

== Geography ==
The Flanaess can be broken down geographically as follows: the [[Baklunish Basin]] in the northwest, the [[Iuz, Empire of|Empire of Iuz]] in the north, the [[Thillonrian Peninsula]] in the northeast, the Sea of Dust in the far west, the [[Sheldomar Valley]] in the west, old [[Ferrond]] and its southern frontier (including the City of Greyhawk) at the center of the Flanaess, old [[Sulm (Greyhawk)|Sulm]] and the [[Aerdy]] frontier to the east, the old [[Great Kingdom]] to the far east, and the [[Amedio Jungle]] to the southwest.

===Aerdy===

'''Aerdy''' properly refers to the now-defunct Kingdom of Aerdy. Sometimes "Aerdy" is used in reference to the [[Oeridians|Oeridian]] tribe which founded the kingdom, though the proper term for the tribe is "Aerdi" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛər|d|i}} {{respell|AIR|dee}})&lt;ref name="Mentzer 1985"&gt;[[Frank Mentzer|Mentzer, Frank]]. "Ay pronunseeAY shun gyd" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #93 (TSR, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; (which is also the adjectival form). "Aerdy" can also be used in reference to the [[Great Kingdom|Great Kingdom of Aerdy]], the [[empire|imperial]] successor state of the Kingdom of Aerdy.

===Ahlissa===

The ancient [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] kingdom of Ahlissa was founded over 1,700 years ago by the legendary Queen [[Ehlissa]] the Enchanter.  Modern Ahlissa is generally located in the southeastern portion of the Flanaess, and is one of the largest countries on the [[subcontinent]].  Ahlissa is a [[feudal]] [[empire]] with [[hereditary]] rulership, and is currently ruled by His Transcendent Imperial Majesty, Overking Xavener I, Grand Prince of Kalstrand, Crowned Head of House Darmen.

===Almor===
In 586 CY King [[Lynwerd I]] of [[Nyrond]] seized the western half of Almor ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|m|ɔr}} {{respell|AL|mawr}}),&lt;ref name="Mentzer 1985"/&gt; placing it under his protection and creating the '''Almorian Protectorate''', and appointing a governor to administer the new province.

===Amedio Jungle===

The '''Amedio Jungle''' is a large stretch of [[tropical]] [[rainforest]] located in the southwestern Flanaess, on the continent of [[Oerik]]. Lying east of the [[Hellfurnaces]], the Amedio extends over 300 [[League (unit)|leagues]] south from its northernmost point at [[Jeklea Bay]].  The border of the Amedio Jungle and the Hellfurnaces was the setting of ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon's]]'' [[Shackled City]] [[Adventure Path]]. This adventure detailed the history of the region between Jeklea Bay, the Amedio, and the Hellfurnaces, going back 3000 years to the time of the [[spellweavers]]' domination of the area. In that time, a battle between the [[Abyss (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Abyssal]] hordes and the forces of good took place around what is now the city of [[Cauldron (Shackled City)|Cauldron]].

===Baklunish Basin===
The '''Baklunish Basin''' is the northwestern portion of the Flanaess. Consisting chiefly of remnants of the ancient [[Baklunish Empire]], the human peoples of these lands are known as the [[Baklunish]]. The most important parts of this region include the nations of [[Ekbir]], [[Ket (Greyhawk)|Ket]], [[Tusmit]], [[Ull (Greyhawk)|Ull]], and [[Zeif]], as well as the [[Dry Steppes]] and the [[Plains of the Paynims]]. Though not technically part of the Baklunish Basin, the lands of the [[Tiger Nomads|Tiger]] and [[Wolf Nomads]] are sometimes included, as they are populated by people of [[Baklunish]] stock.

The basin is bordered to the east by the [[Crystalmist Mountains]], [[Yatil Mountains]], and [[Barrier Peaks]], and to the south by the [[Sulhaut Mountains]]. To the north, it is bordered by the [[Dramidj Ocean]] and to the west its limits are defined by the [[Tyurzi Mountains]].

===Bandit Kingdoms===

The Bandit Kingdoms are generally located in the central portion of the Flanaess. They are governed by various petty [[dictatorships]] theoretically owing fealty to Iuz.

===Bissel===
'''Bissel''', properly known as the '''March of Bissel''', is a political state of the Flanaess.

Modern Bissel is generally located in the western-central portion of the Flanaess. It is bordered by the [[Barrier Peaks]] to the north and west, by the [[Dim Forest]] to the south, and by the [[Lorridges]] to the east.

As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Thornward, and Pellak (pop. 2,300).  Thornward itself was once the capital of Bissel, but is now a town governed jointly by Bissel, Gran March, Ket, and Veluna (resulting from an agreement known as the Thornward Division).

As of 591 CY, the population of Bissel totaled 123,880 persons, over 80% being humans of [[Oeridian]], [[Suloise|Suel]], and [[Baklunish]] descent. Approximately 10% of the population is [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarven]], with other humanoid races making up the remainder of the population.

The most popular deities among Bissel's citizens are [[Heironeous]], [[Zilchus]], [[Fharlanghn]], [[Geshtai]], [[Rao (Greyhawk)|Rao]], and [[Istus]].

The most widely spoken languages in Bissel include Common, various Baklunish dialects, and Dwarven.

Bissel is a [[feudal]] [[monarchy]], and ruled by His Lofty Grace, Larrangin, the Margrave of Bissel, and owing fealty to [[Gran March]] and [[Veluna]].  The margrave is chosen by the leadership of the [[Knights of the Watch]].

In the Living Greyhawk campaign, Bissel corresponded to New England (the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine).

The country itself is divided into twenty-six knight-baronies, eight townships, and one capital township, for the national capital of Pellak.

Bissel's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Per pale indented gules and argent, over all a tower sable''.

Bissel is noted for producing foodstuffs, cloth, gold, and low-quality gems from mining operations.

Bissel's standard [[coin]]age is modeled after [[Keoland]]'s, and consists of the [[platinum]] griffon (pp), [[gold]] lion (gp), [[electrum]] eagle (ep), [[silver]] stag (sp), and [[copper]] roc (cp).

===Blackmoor===

The original Blackmoor began life in the early 1970s as the personal setting of [[Dave Arneson]], the co-creator of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', first as a setting for Arneson's miniature [[wargaming|wargames]], then as an early testing ground for what would become ''D&amp;D''.  Though published in booklet form by [[Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR) in 1975, as the [[Blackmoor (supplement)|second supplement]] to ''D&amp;D'' (the first being Greyhawk), Blackmoor actually predates Greyhawk as a campaign setting, a fact which [[Gary Gygax]] acknowledged in the foreword to the ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' supplement.&lt;ref name="blackmoor1975"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons Supplement II: Blackmoor]] | author=Arneson, Dave | year=1975 | publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR Rules]] | authorlink=Dave Arneson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackmoor as a location within the Greyhawk setting came about both as an inside-joke by Gygax, and as a way for him to acknowledge his fellow writers' creations ([[Lenard Lakofka|Len Lakofka]]'s [[Lendore Isles]] occupy a similar position in the world).  Having certain locations exist across the campaign settings of multiple [[Dungeon Master|DM]]s also became a convenient way to explain how [[player characters]] such as [[Mordenkainen]] (Gygax's character) and [[Robilar]] ([[Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]]'s character) could be adventuring in Blackmoor's City of the Gods at one sitting, while exploring the dungeons of [[Castle Greyhawk]] the next.

Modern Blackmoor is generally located in the northwestern portion of the Flanaess. It is a small and inhospitable realm lying almost completely within the boundaries of the northern reaches of the [[Cold Marshes]].  The [[Burneal Forest]] forms a western boundary of sorts, while the [[Land of Black Ice]] does the same to the north.

As of 591 CY, the population of Blackmoor totaled 110,000 persons.  Almost 40% of these inhabitants are humans of predominantly [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] and [[Oeridian]] stock, although some [[Suloise|Suel]] and [[Baklunish]] can be found as well.  Another 20% comprise [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcish]] tribes that roam the region (some under the control of the Egg of Coot, some not).  A slightly smaller percentage of [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]] is also present, while [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elves]], [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], [[half-orc]]s, half-elves, and other races make up the remainder of the population in increasingly smaller percentages.

As of 591 CY, the most populous town is [[Dantredun]] (pop. 700) on the edge of the Burneal.  Blackmoor Town, the original capital of the archbarony, was conquered and destroyed in 541 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]] by the "Egg of Coot", a mysterious being with a significant amount of magical power at his disposal.  The "town" that serves as the Egg's home contains a number of [[automaton|automata]] (some reports place the number as high as 200), though very few living beings (if any) reside there

The actual structure of Blackmoor's government is unknown.  His Luminous Preponderancy, Archbaron [[Bestmo]] of Blackmoor claims the title of "archbaron", and with it, rule over the ten underbaronies of the region.  However, [[Teuod Fent]], formerly of the [[Bandit Kingdoms]], has claimed [[Ramshorn Castle]] as his own, and with it the title of "baron".  Nonhuman tribes also roam the area, though their allegiances are usually only to themselves.  The national capital is Dantredun (the seat of Bestmo's power).

===Bone March===
The '''Bone March''' is a political state of the Flanaess. The Bone March is generally located in the eastern portion of the Flanaess. It rests in the narrow strip of land bounded by the [[Rakers]] in the west and the Teesar Torrent in the east, and curving around to encompass Johnsport on the coast of the Solnor Ocean. The cool, rocky farmland of the Bone March is relatively poor and never supported a dense population or large cities. Its farmlands are now desolate wilderness.

As of 591 CY, the population of Bone March totaled 310,000 persons, though only a large minority are human (mainly [[Oeridian]] stock, but some [[Suloise|Suel]] and [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] as well).  About 20% of the population are [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], and nearly the same number are [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]]; [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elves]], [[half-orc]]s, [[Half-elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|half-elves]], and [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]] make up decreasing numbers of the remaining citizens.

As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Knurl (13,500), Spinecastle (pop. 6,300(?)), and Johnsport (pop. 3,500(?)). The numbers above do not take into account the large number of other uncounted [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], [[gnoll]]s, etc.

The most popular deities among Bone March's inhabitants are [[Hextor]], the [[Oeridian agricultural gods]], [[Erythnul]], [[Kord (Greyhawk)|Kord]], the [[List of Greyhawk deities#Orcish deities|orc pantheon]], and [[Beltar (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Beltar]].

The most widely spoken languages in Bone March include Common, Old Oeridian, Orc, Halfling, Gnomish, and Elven.  Goblin, Gnoll, and other nonhuman languages are spoken as well, due to the large numbers of those races present in the land.

Bone March was formerly a [[feudal]] [[Marches|marchland]] of the [[Great Kingdom]], and ruled by His Nobility, Clement, the Marquis of Bone March; since 563 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], it has been controlled by a conclave of nonhuman chiefs. The national capital is Spinecastle. Bone March's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Gules, three shin-bones, two in saltire, surmounted by one in pale, argent''.

Bone March is noted for producing silver and low- to average-quality gems. Bone March's coinage is based on [[Aerdy]]'s standard, and consists of the [[platinum]] orb (pp), [[gold]] ivid (gp), [[electrum]] noble (ep), [[silver]] penny (sp), and [[copper]] common (cp).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gygax, Gary.

===Bright Lands===
The '''Bright Lands''', properly known as the '''Empire of the Bright Lands''', is a [[dictatorial]] political state of the Flanaess.

The boundaries of the Bright Lands are contained entirely within the bounds of the [[Bright Desert]].  The [[Abbor Alz]] form the northern and eastern borders, while the [[Woolly Bay]] and the [[Sea of Gearnat]] form natural boundaries to the country's west and south.

As of 591 CY, the population of the Bright Lands totaled 26,500 persons, the vast majority (almost 80%) being humans of mainly [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] descent. [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Dwarves]] account for the next largest group, with the remainder of the population (barely 1%) consisting of mostly centaurs.

There is no state sponsored religion within the country. Among the Flan tribesmen, worship of [[Beory]], [[Obad-Hai]], and [[Pelor]] is most common. [[Geshtai]] and [[Istus]] are most popular with the few [[Paynim]] in the region, while a few scattered [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblin]] tribes worship [[Maglubiyet]] and other deities of the goblin pantheon.

The most widely spoken languages in the Bright Lands are Flan and [[Ancient Suloise]] (by the native tribesmen), and various [[Baklunish]] dialects (by the Paynims).

The Empire of the Bright Lands is a [[dictatorship]] with [[Rary|Rary of Ket]] as the head of state.  The realm functions as a minor city-state administered from Rary's tower in the [[Brass Hills]].  Rary maintains his power with the assistance of [[Robilar]], a powerful warrior who serves as commander of Rary's forces in the Empire.

The state's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Gules, a gauntlet proper gripping a crescent or; on a chief azure three mullets argent''.

The Bright Lands does not currently produce its own coinage.

===Empire of Iuz===
The Empire of Iuz is an [[empire]] ruled by the demigod [[Iuz]].

The Empire of Iuz is classified by the ''Living Greyhawk Gazetteer'' as an "[[empire|imperial]] [[theocratic]] [[dictatorship]]." Though Iuz holds all power, his rule is inconsistent. Iuz's [[priesthood]] and other spellcasters manage the affairs of the empire in his name. Iuz and his servants have more control over some regions of the empire than others.

The capital of the empire is the city of Dorakaa.

====Administrative divisions====
The Empire of Iuz consists of five loosely defined political regions, though they are not considered actual provinces.

=====Land of Iuz=====
Also called the ''Homeland of Iuz'', this region lies mainly between the Dulsi and Opicim Rivers, south of the Cold Marshes, and north of Whyestil Lake.

=====Bandit Lands=====
Once referred to as the [[Bandit Kingdoms]], this region lies west of the Zumker and Artonsamay Rivers, east of the Ritensa River, and is bounded in part by the Fellreev Forest and Bluff Hills. This region is actually made up of a number of warlord fiefs.

=====Barren Lands=====
These grasslands south of the Icy Sea and the Wastes are also known as the Barrens, the Barren Plains, or the Northern Barrens. North of the Bandit Lands, the Barrens' eastern border is formed by the Forlorn Forest, western Griff Mountains, and the Bluff Hills. Their western border is formed by the Cold Marshes and Opicim River. Once ruled by the [[nomad]]ic [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] tribes known as the [[Rovers of the Barrens]], these people are but a shadow of their former glory.

=====Horned Lands=====
This region is bound by Whyestil Lake, the Veng and Ritensa Rivers, and the Fellreev Forest. These lands were for a time ruled by the [[Horned Society]], before Iuz once again took control during the [[Greyhawk Wars]].

=====[[Shield Lands]]=====
Bordered by the Ritensa river, [[Nyr Dyv]], and Rift Barrens, this land was ruled before the Greyhawk Wars by the [[chivalrous]] order known as the [[Knights of Holy Shielding]]. Though a western portion of the Shield Lands were reclaimed in the Great Northern Crusade of 586-588, the majority of the area is still under Iuz's control.

===Ferrond===
'''Ferrond''' most often refers to the former [[Great Kingdom]] province known as the [[Viceroyalty]] of Ferrond, or the general region where its successor states now lie.

The Viceroyalty of Ferrond was a vassal state of the [[Great Kingdom of Aerdy]], ruled by a [[viceroy]] in the name of the [[Overking]]. The capital of the Viceroyalty was the city of [[Dyvers]].

The Viceroyalty of Ferrond consisted of the modern-day states of [[Furyondy]] (Furyon), Highfolk, [[Perrenland]] (the Quaglands), the [[Shield Lands]], [[Veluna]] (Voll), and the hilly regions northeast of the [[Vesve Forest]], known then as part of the [[Northern Reaches]].

===Free City of Greyhawk===
{{further|Free City of Greyhawk}}

===Frost Barbarians===
The '''Frost Barbarians''', properly known as the '''Kingdom of Fruztii''', is a political state of the Flanaess. The people themselves are sometimes referred to as simply the Fruztii.  The lands of the Frost Barbarians are located in the far northeastern portion of the Flanaess, on what is known as the Thillonrian Peninsula. They occupy the coastal plains between the Griff and Corusk Mountains and the Grendep Bay. Their lands are separated from those of the Snow Barbarians by the Spikey Forest, while the Timberway Forest forms their southern border against Ratik.  As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Krakenheim (pop. 4,500) and Djekul (pop. 3,100).  The most popular deities among the Frost Barbarians are [[Kord (Greyhawk)|Kord]], [[Llerg]], [[Norebo]], [[Xerbo]], [[Vatun]], and [[Syrul]].

The Frost Barbarians maintain a hereditary feudal monarchy, currently ruled by His Most Warlike Majesty, King Hundgred Rälffson of the Fruztii.  The Frost Barbarians are also party to a political alliance with Ratik, known as the Northern Alliance.  The Frost Barbarians' coat of arms is blazoned thus: Ermine, a roundel azure.

===Furyondy===
'''Furyondy''', properly known as the Kingdom of Furyondy, is a feudal kingdom of the Flanaess, and a successor state of Ferrond.  The Kingdom of Furyondy is a hereditary feudal monarchy. The power of the kingship is limited by the Noble Council. Since 288 CY, the nation's capital has been Chendl.  Modern Furyondy is bordered by the Nyr Dyv to the east; by the Veng River, Whyestil Lake, and the Vesve Forest to the north; and by the Velverdyva River to the south and west.  The most widely spoken languages in Furyondy include Common, Velondi, Elvish, and Halfling.

In the Living Greyhawk campaign, Furyondy corresponds to the state of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Furyondy| publisher =Wizards of the Coast| url =http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=lg/region/furyondy| accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geoff===
'''Geoff''' was first described in 1983 in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]], where '''Geoff''' is properly known as the '''Grand Duchy of Geoff''', and is a [[ducal]] political state of the fictional continent called the Flanaess.&lt;ref name="Gygax, Gary 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gygax 1983"&gt;[[Gygax, Gary]]. ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being in literature and serving as a potential land of adventure for players of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign, the Grand Duchy of Geoff was selected by The RPGA and Wizards of the Coast as a region for its [[Living Greyhawk]] campaign (2000–2008). As a result, thousands of role-players enjoyed adventures and other gaming events held in Geoff.

===Gran March===
The modern Gran March is generally located in the western-central portion of the Flanaess, and is considered part of the [[Sheldomar Valley]] region. It is bordered by [[Bissel (Greyhawk)|Bissel]] to the north, the [[Lortmil Mountains]] to the north and northeast, the Lort River to the east, Sheldomar River and the [[Rushmoors]] to the south, and the Realstream River to the west. As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Hookhill (pop. 7,500), and Shiboleth (pop. 5,900).

As of 591 CY, the population of Gran March totaled 254,600 persons, the vast majority (almost 80%) being humans of mainly [[Suloise|Suel]] and [[Oeridian]] descent. [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elves]] are the next largest group (8%, mainly Sylvan), followed by [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]] (5%), [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]] (3%), and [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]] (2%); a mix of half-elves, [[half-orc]]s and other races makes up the remainder of the population.

The most popular deities among Gran March's citizens are [[Heironeous]], [[Saint Cuthbert (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|St. Cuthbert]], [[Pholtus]], [[Fharlanghn]], [[Zilchus]], the [[Oeridian agricultural gods]], [[Phyton (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Phyton]], and [[Obad-Hai]].

The most widely spoken languages in Gran March include Common, Keolandish, Elven, and Dwarven.

Gran March is a [[feudal]] [[monarchy]], ruled by His Most Resolute Magnitude, Magnus Vrianian, Commandant of Gran March; the commandant is chosen by a vote of nobles and knights every five years.  The current state owes minor fealty to [[Keoland]], and oversees the current government in Bissel.  The government and nobles are strongly militarily oriented, with many connections to the [[Knights of the Watch]]. The national capital is Hookhill.

Gran March's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Argent; on a chief party per pale gules and azure, in dexter a lion rampant sable, in sinister a sword per bend sinister of the second''.

Gran March is noted for producing a variety of foodstuffs, cloth, copper, and high-quality gems.

Gran March's standard [[coin]]age is based on Keoland's coinage and consists of the [[platinum]] griffon (pp), [[gold]] lion (gp), [[electrum]] eagle (ep), [[silver]] white owl (sp), and [[copper]] heron (cp).

The Gran March maintains its military through universal male service.  All males are conscripted at the age of fifteen, while female service is still optional.  The standing army can be reinforced by a number of specialist militia companies, including archers, cavalry, and pikemen.

Gran March is also a playable region in the [[RPGA]]'s ''[[Living Greyhawk]]'' campaign. Players who join the RPGA can create characters (PCs) from Gran March and advance in level as they explore the region through adventures ordered from the RPGA for home play or at gaming conventions.

===Keoland===
'''Keoland''', properly known as the '''Kingdom of Keoland''', is one of the oldest political states in the Flanaess. The state was founded -342 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]] (303 [[Oeridian Record|OR]] via a union of the [[Suloise|Suel]] [[royal house|houses]] of [[Rhola]] and [[Neheli]], and minor [[Oeridian]] nobles which had also settled in the [[Sheldomar Valley]].

Bordered by the ''Javan River'' to the west, the ''Azure Sea'' to the south, the ''Sheldomar River'' to the east, and the ''Rushmoors'' to the north, Keoland is the largest nation in the ''Sheldomar Valley''. The climate is normally [[temperate]] year-round.

As of 591 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], the population of Keoland totaled 1,800,000 persons, the vast majority being humans of chiefly Suel and [[Oeridian]] stock. [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elves]], [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]], and [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], make up perhaps 20% of the total population.

The most widely spoken languages in Keoland are Common, Keoish, Elvish, Gnomish, and Halfling.

The Kingdom of Keoland is a [[feudal]] [[monarchy]]. Though the monarch rules for life, succession is determined by the Noble Council of [[Niole Dra]]. The result is that the crown usually passes between two or more noble houses of the land. The national [[capital (political)|capital]] is Niole Dra. Keoland is split up into some twenty-seven major and minor duchies, counties, marches, territories, and baronies.

As of 591 CY, Keoland's chief of state is King [[Kimbertos Skotti]] of [[Grayhill]], who has ruled since 564 CY. The office of the king is known as the Throne of the Lion in Keoland. In the ''[[Living Greyhawk]]'' campaign, in late 598 CY King Skotti was killed by an assassin after a battle for the fate of Keoland.

The [[Council of Niole Dra]], often called the Court of the Land, is made up of major nobility and heads of favored guilds and societies of Keoland. Numbering approximately 100 persons, the Council deals with questions of succession, levies provincial taxes, and ratifies any changes to the kingdom's founding charter.

Keoland's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Gules, a lion rampant sable''.

Keoland's standard [[coin]]age consists of the [[platinum]] griffon (pp), [[gold]] lion (gp), [[electrum]] eagle (ep), [[silver]] hawk (sp), and [[copper]] sparrow (cp).

In addition to its well-worn roads, Keoland boasts much river traffic along the Javan and Sheldomar. The port city of [[Gradsul]] is the largest on the Azure Sea.

The royal navy, based at Gradsul, is led by the [[duke]] of that province, [[Luschan VII]], who acts as the Lord High Admiral of Keoland.

Keoland is also protected by the independent [[Knights of the Watch]] and the [[Knights of Dispatch]].

Simon Garfield commented that Keoland "has a distinctly aristocratic flavor with its many baronies, duchies and earldoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtXZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA408&amp;dq=%22Geoff%22+Greyhawk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ45C34sHUAhUK0GMKHdevA_oQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Geoff%22+Greyhawk&amp;f=false|title=On the Map: A Mind-Expanding Exploration of the Way the World Looks|first=Simon|last=Garfield|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ket===
Because '''Ket''' lies in the only gap in the north-south spine of mountains that divides the eastern Flanaess from the western Baklunish Basin, it is a nexus of important trade routes, a nation of caravans and merchants where peoples and cultures from all parts of the Flanaess mix and mingle. Various editions of material published about this region between 1980 and 2000 have changed its character from a self-serving state sometimes at odds with its neighbors to an aggressive and evil military state, and back again.

====1980 World of Greyhawk (folio edition)====
Unlike the cities of Greyhawk and Dyvers, which were created during [[Gary Gygax]]'s original [[World of Greyhawk|Greyhawk]] home campaign, Ket was created by Gygax specifically for the World of Greyhawk folio published in 1980, set in the year 576 CY. In this edition, Gygax portrayed Ket as a belligerent nation often at odds with its neighbors. Since Ket lay between Baklunish lands to the east and Oeridian lands to the west, it was considered a buffer state and a crossroads of trade and culture; its people were a mix of human races (although Baklunish culture predominated), and the court and military showed strong influences from both east and west. Other than trade, its resources were silver and gems. Militarily, Ket had been both the victim of invasion and an aggressor seeking new territory. Much of southern Ket was covered by the Bramblewood, a vast primeval forest that had one main road "and possibly some secondary tracks". Ket lay on a high plateau, and two major rivers, the Tuflik and the Fals, originated within Ket before flowing off the plateau to the north and south respectively. Ket's coat of arms in the 1980 edition was blazoned thus: Gules, a scimitar in pale argent, the point to the base.

====Sea of Death: Gygax Delineates His Vision of Ket (1987)====
Just prior to being forced out of [[TSR (company)|TSR]] in 1985, Gygax had authored two [[Gord the Rogue]] novels. In 1987, he wrote the third book of the series, ''Sea of Death''. The second chapter is set in Ket, and it highlighted the Ket that Gygax had originally envisioned: The capital, Lopolla is crowded, noisy, grimy, decadent and dangerous. The only people living in the empty countryside are Bedouin-like nomadic tribes.

====The Greyhawk Wars: Ket takes center stage (1990)====
In 1990, the ''Greyhawk Wars'' boxed set advanced the Greyhawk timeline to 585 CY, and described a war that had recently engulfed the Flanaess. As described in the ''Greyhawk Wars'' game, Ketite horsemen had invaded and conquered neighbouring Bissel, and Ket was considered Evil.

====Wizards of The Coast updates the Greyhawk campaign (1998)====
Following TSR's takeover by [[Wizards of the Coast]], Greyhawk was reset to 591 CY. Ket was again merely the belligerent state, rather than being Evil. Its evil beygraf was assassinated, and a new beygraf seized power just in time to prevent an attack on Ket's forces in Bissel by Gran March. Ket's forces were then voluntarily withdrawn from Bissel.

====Living Greyhawk Campaign (2001–2008)====
In 2001, in the ''[[Living Greyhawk]] Gazetteer'', Ket's description and details of its history and society were greatly expanded:
*The racial makeup of the population, which in Gygax's editions had been "mainly human", was divided into "Human 96%, Dwarf 2%, Halfling 1%, Other 1%"
*This edition completely replaced Gygax's concept of a country of nomadic tribes with a quiet and peaceful rural countryside: "The northern and western portion of Ket are more civilized country, with tilled fields and many villages."
*The greatly expanded history of Ket explained in detail historical details that had only been mentioned briefly in previous editions: Ket began as a province of Zeif, was invaded by a group of nomads called "The Brazen Horde", was subsequently invaded by Keoland, who constructed the Irafa Road through the Bramblewood Forest. The Ketite resistance movement eventually drove the armies of Keoland out of the country and won Ketite independence from Zeif. This was also the time when the True Faith (now linked to Al'Akbar) became the predominant religion in both the military and government.

In the run-up to the start of the Living Greyhawk campaign, Ket was assigned to all of Eastern Canada except Quebec (specifically the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) However, the volunteers fleshing out Ket for the campaign, instead of extrapolating the material that had been published by WotC over the past three years, created a pseudo-Persian feudal theocracy with unforgiving laws and harsh punishments, where the merciless and literal interpretation of statutes and decrees outweighed any considerations of justice or mercy.

During the Living Greyhawk campaign, several major storylines emerged:
*CY 594: Ket invaded Tusmit, but both armies were ambushed by a powerful rebel force, and ultimately had to ally in order to defeat the rebels.
*CY 595: As Ket withdrew from joint control of Thornward, mechanical spiders invaded the country.
*CY 597: The lost Cup &amp; Talisman of Al'Akbar were found in Ekbir, and Ket invaded in order to recover them. Bissel invaded Ket in turn and burned Lopolla to the ground, exacting revenge for their humiliating defeat during the Greyhawk Wars.
*CY 598: In Ekbir, as the Ketite army faced off against the army of Ekbir, Al'Akbar appeared, called everyone dogmatic fools, and destroyed the Cup and Talisman so they could never be used to foment war again. With nothing to show for their long journey, the Ket army headed home to rebuild Lopolla.

===Land of Black Ice===
The '''Land of Black Ice''' is an arctic wasteland located in the northwestern Flanaess, north of the ''Burneal Forest'' and [[Blackmoor (Greyhawk)|Blackmoor]], east of the ''Drawmidj Ocean'', and west of the ''Icy Sea''. The land gets its name from the vast sheet of blue-black ice that covers it as far as the eye can see.

The only humans living near the area are the [[Baklunish]] Guryik folk on the Drawmidj coast, and the [[Suloise]] Zeai, or Sea Barbarians, who dwell on a section of Icy Sea coastline known as the ''Tusking Strand''. Within the Land of Black Ice proper are said to dwell all manner of horrid arctic monsters, so few humans enter the region. Tales are told of [[Wight (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|wights]], frost men, evil spirits, black-skinned [[Troll (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|trolls]], and blue-furred [[Bugbear (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bugbears]] inhabiting the wasteland.

The fabled [[City of the Gods]] is said to lie just outside the Land of Black Ice, near Blackmoor. Those few who have entered the city and escaped alive, among them [[Mordenkainen]] and [[Sir Robilar]], tell tales of an artificially warm city of tall iron buildings, powerful magic, and strange automatons.

Legends tell of another region beyond the ice, a land of lush jungles and an unmoving sun. Such legends give some reason to believe that the [[Oerth]] is [[Hollow Earth|hollow]], containing another world within the inside of the globe, to which entry is gained via great openings in the poles.

===Nyrond===
'''Nyrond''', or more properly the '''Kingdom of Nyrond''', refers to one of the largest [[Alignment (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|good-aligned]] states in the Flanaess.

In 356 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], the opportunist junior branch of the [[Aerdy]] Celestial House of [[Rax-Nyrond]] declared independence from the Overking of the [[Great Kingdom]]. Weakened by warfare against the likes of [[Ferrond]], [[Perrenland]], and [[Tenh]], the scions of [[House Rax]] nonetheless amassed a large retribution-minded army to teach the upstart "kingdom" a lesson. At this moment, a coalition of [[Frost Barbarians|Fruztii]], [[Snow Barbarians|Schnai]] and mercenary barbarians invaded [[North Kingdom|North Province]], distracting the Overking's army and allowing Nyrond critical time to entrench and train its military to repulse Aerdy military actions. For the next two centuries relations between the two states varied from open war to preparing for war.

In 584 CY, during the [[Greyhawk Wars]], Nyrond halted an invasion by the Great Kingdom after [[Ivid V]]'s forces devastated Almor. Thereafter the Great Kingdom fell apart in magical disaster and civil war. Nyrond was in nearly as bad shape. After King [[Archbold III]] suffered a poison-induced stroke at the hands of his younger son in the fall of 585 CY, said son, Prince [[Sewarndt]] attempted to seize power. Sewarndt's coup was thwarted by his older brother, Crown Prince [[Lynwerd]],  who took the throne after Archbold abdicated in [[Greyhawk Calendar|Fireseek]] of 586 CY, possibly the most popular decision of his time as ruler.

Under Lynwerd, Nyrond has been slowly recovering, though times are good only by comparison to Archbold times. Lynwerd did take over much of Almor in 586 CY as the Great Kingdom fell apart.

Nyrond lies between the [[Nesser River]] and [[Franz River]] to the west, the [[Harp River]] and [[Flinty Hills]] to the east, [[Relmor Bay]] to the south, and the [[Pale (Greyhawk)|Theocracy of the Pale]] to the north.

Nyrond is ruled by King Lynwerd, who appoints all lesser officials.

Nyrond's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Quarterly; 1st and 4th, ermine; 2nd and 3rd, gules, a sun radiated or''.

====Nyrond in the Living Greyhawk campaign====
In the Living Greyhawk campaign, the following events took place in Nyrond: In early 595 CY another major revolt was successfully led by [[Sewarndt]]. He captured the capital city with the assistance of supernatural allies, and in the course of the assault he committed patricide. In autumn 595 CY, several campaigns around the country, led by Lynwerd's supporters and loyal nobles, succeeded in recapturing nearly all major provinces and cities. The reconquest ended in Sewarndt's death at the hands of his brother at the very gates of the Royal Palace in Rel Mord.

Lynwerd is married to Queen [[Xenia Sallavarian]] of the [[Urnst, Duchy of|Duchy of Urnst]]. Their daughter and heir was born in 595 CY.

===Pale===
At the height of the Great Kingdom, the Head of the Church of Pholtus was given the title of Holy Censor, which brought duties of oversight of the court system. Later Overkings turned against the church and removed this title, prompting many Pholtus worshippers to begin feeling persecuted and flee to the area which now is the Pale. Fighting with the early settlers was Ceril the Relentless, who founded the Council of the Nine. In 342 CY, the first Theocrat of the Pale was chosen by the Council, though the land remained theoretically under Great Kingdom rule. But in 356 CY, Nyrond declared independence, claiming the Pale, which then tried to seize its own independence, but failed, remaining under Nyrondian rule.

In 450 CY, the leaders of the cult of Pholtus convinced the King of Nyrond to grant them independence in return for promises of mutual aid and assistance. This proved a hollow assurance, as the Pale's government has largely followed a policy of leaving its neighbors to be killed and then trying to bully them into handing over lands to it. It thus remained neutral in the Greyhawk Wars. In 588 CY, the Pale's forces invaded and seized eastern Tenh.

The native folk of the Theocracy of the Pale are primarily Flan/Oeridian hybrids, and are considered particularly handsome by folk from all corners of the Flanaess.

The Pale is a theocracy administered in the name of [[Pholtus]], god of Light, Resolution, and Law, and is the official religion of the Pale.

The Pale's coat of arms is blazoned thus: ''Purpure, a pale ermine between an increscent dexter and a mullet of six points sinister or''.

===Plains of the Paynims===
The Plains of the Paynims, also known as the '''Paynims''', is a political state and may also refer to the tribes of nomadic horsemen who live there. The plains are situated in the [[Baklunish Basin]] region of the Flanaess, west of [[Ket (Greyhawk)|Ket]] and south of [[Zeif]]. The native folk are [[Baklunish]] with mixed racial characteristics absorbed from subjugated travelers or settled merchants. There is no central authority; the government consists mainly of tribal khans and amirs ruled by progressively more powerful nobles (orakhans, ilkhans, or shahs) and royalty (padishahs, tarkhans, or kha-khans). There is great variation in governments between nomadic tribes. The [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Gules, a scimitar per bend sinister or, in dexter chief a cross moline in saltire of the last''.

===Pomarj===
The '''Pomarj''' can refer either to a large [[peninsula]] located in the central Flanaess, or to the '''Orcish Empire of the Pomarj''', located in the same region.

Before the [[Great Migrations (Greyhawk)|Great Migrations]], the Pomarj was mainly a desolate region populated by primitive [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] tribespeople who revered equally primitive deities of earth and sky.  Eventually, small numbers of outcast [[Suloise|Suel]] settled the region. The region received little notice from the rest of the world for centuries, remaining largely isolated.

In 295 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], King [[Tavish I]] of [[Keoland]] and the Prince of Ulek, seeking to exploit the Pomarj's mineral wealth, raised an army to invade and subjugate the region, an endeavor which was accomplished in the span of a few years.  The Pomarj was divided up into roughly a dozen small baronies, which were awarded to favored families of the Keoish throne.  These sub[[fiefdom|fiefs]] were administered by and under the protection of the [[Principality of Ulek]]. Over the next few decades, mining brought great wealth to these petty barons.  In 305 CY, the town of [[Highport]] was constructed on the north coast to share these riches with the rest of the Flanaess.

In 461 CY, the Principality of Ulek had withdrawn from Keoland to gain [[count palatine|palatinate]] status. The barons of the Pomarj at this time, being subjects of the Prince of Ulek, had no voice in the [[Council of Niole Dra]]. Dissatisfied with their position, the Pomarj barons broke with the Principality of Ulek in 463, declaring their own independence. The barons ejected the Prince's [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarven]] garrisons and declared Highport their capital. Despite this apparent unity, however, each baron ruled his state independently, and feuds were common. Many barons assigned themselves grandiose titles, such as archbaron, duke, or prince. The baron of [[Suderham]], even went so far as to dub himself "King of the Drachensgrabs."

In 498 CY, the [[Hateful Wars]] began as an alliance between [[Celene (Greyhawk)|Celene]] and the [[Ulek States]], who sought to drive the [[Orc (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|orcs]], [[Goblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|goblins]], and other evil humanoids from Lortmil Mountains. The Prince of Ulek invited the former barons of the Pomarj to join the alliance, but the lords of the Pomarj refused, fearing reabsorption into the Principality and seeing little reason to involve themselves in what they viewed as chiefly a conflict between non-humans. By 510 CY, the Hateful Wars were over, but this conflict would have great repercussions for the Pomarj.

In 513 CY, hordes of surviving orcs, goblins, and other evil creatures from the Lortmils, having few places to hide from their [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elven]] and dwarven foes, fled to the Pomarj, emerging from the Suss and falling upon Highport in a destructive rage. In a matter of months, all of the other former baronies, save the hidden city of Suderham, also fell to the humanoid invaders.

Over the next few decades, the Pomarj became essentially a backwater filled with orcs, goblinoids, and other evil creatures, as well as a haven for human bandits, pirates, slavers, and other criminals. Various humanoid tribes carved out territories. Any good humans left lived as slaves, or else waged a losing [[guerrilla]] war against the invaders.

By 574 CY, the last king of Suderham was assassinated by the [[Slave Lords]], who turned the town into their base of operations. The Slave Lords managed to bring much of the Pomarj under their control, but by 580 CY their power was broken.

During the [[Greyhawk Wars]] of 582-584 CY, a powerful orc chieftain named [[Turrosh Mak]] united the [[Nedla]] and other humanoid tribes of the Pomarj, and invaded the surrounding lands, bringing much of the Wild Coast and the Principality of Ulek under his control. Mak named his "empire where none has stood" the Orcish Empire of the Pomarj.  Though much of the land west of the Jewel was reclaimed by the Principality of Ulek in 586 CY, Mak continues to hold power in the region, and his empire shows no signs of decline.

The Pomarj proper is a peninsula dividing the ''Azure Sea'' from the ''Sea of Gearnat''. It is bordered by the ''Jewel River'' to the west, the ''Suss Forest'' and ''Woolly Bay'' to the north, with the ''Straights of Gearnat'' to the east and the Azure to the south. The borders of the Empire are slightly larger, extending north along the [[Wild Coast (Greyhawk)|Wild Coast]], stopping only a few leagues south of ''Safeton''. The Empire's western border once stretched as far as the foothills of the [[Lortmil Mountains]], but much of this land has since been reclaimed by the [[Principality of Ulek]].

The peninsula is dominated by the [[Drachensgrab Hills|Drachensgrabs]], a range of hills which ascend to the height of [[mountains]] at their highest point. The soil of the land is poor, making cultivation of crops difficult.

''[[Artifact of Evil]]'' by [[Gary Gygax]] describes "the fair shores of the Pomarj, where snow never fell." [page 344]

As of 591 CY, the population of the Pomarj was estimated at 476,000 persons, with 43% being orcs, 28% humans (mainly of Suel and [[Oeridian]] ancestry), 15% goblin, 10% [[Hobgoblin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobgoblin]], and 4% of other races.

The orcish pantheon, led by [[Gruumsh]], is heavily favored in the Pomarj, as are [[Beltar (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Beltar]], [[Syrul]], and the goblin pantheon, led by [[Maglubiyet]].

The most widely spoken languages in the Pomarj are Orcish, Common, and Goblin.

The Orcish Empire of the Pomarj is a [[dictatorship]] which oversees various humanoid tribal leaders. The dictator's power is enforced by his large personal army made up of warriors from his own orcish tribe. The national [[capital (political)|capital]] is [[Stoneheim]].

The Orcish Empire of the Pomarj is made up of numerous territories, the vast majority ruled by non-human tribal leaders.

As of 591 CY, the Pomarj's chief of state is His Most Ferocious Majesty, the Despot Turrosh Mak, who has held power since the Greyhawk Wars.

The Pomarj's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Argent, a medusa's head caboshed gules''. This device was traditionally used by the goblins of the Pomarj, before being adopted by Turrosh Mak's government. In addition to the state's official heraldry, several of the humanoid tribes have traditionally carried their own devices:

*Hobgoblins: ''Gules, a demon's skull armed argent''
*Orcs: ''Sable, a human skull argent''

The Pomarj's resources include [[silver]], [[electrum]], [[gold]], [[gemstone|gems]], and [[slaves]].

The Pomarj has no standard national coinage, but a number of official and unofficial currencies do exist, minted by most cities, towns, and powerful non-human tribes. Note that some of these currencies are out of date.

The roads of the Pomarj are not well-maintained, which is not surprising for a nation ruled by orcs.  The land does boast a few ports however, including Highport and [[Blue (Greyhawk)|Blue]].

The Pomarj can field large numbers of non-human troops, and many are trained at the capital city of Stoneheim. The Pomarj has no [[navy]] to speak of, though a number of [[pirates]] and [[mercenaries]] are employed to harry the shipping lanes of the Sea of Gearnat and the Azure Sea. It is rumored that the Pomarj can also call upon the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] for aid.

===Rovers of the Barrens===

The '''Rovers of the Barrens''', also known as the '''Barrens''', and properly known as '''Arapahi''' (translated as "People of the Plentiful Huntinglands"), is a political state of the Flanaess. The name also applies to the tribes of nomadic horsemen who dwell within these lands.

===Scarlet Brotherhood===

The '''Scarlet Brotherhood''' most often refers to the Great and Hidden Empire of the Scarlet Brotherhood, a nation located on the [[Tilvanot Peninsula]] in the southeastern Flanaess, though it can also refer to the secretive organization which rules that land. The Scarlet Brotherhood is described in great detail in the sourcebook ''[[The Scarlet Brotherhood]]'' (1999), by [[Sean K. Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Sean K. ''The Scarlet Brotherhood'' (TSR, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea of Dust===
The '''Sea of Dust''' is a vast desert of ash and dust bound by a number of mountain ranges, including the [[Sulhaut Mountains|Sulhauts]] to the north, the [[Hellfurnaces]] to the east, and a spur of the [[Tyurzi Mountains]] to the south.

The Sea of Dust was first described in print in ''Quag Keep'' by Andre Norton, who wrote the book with [[Gary Gygax]] giving her information on the ''[[Greyhawk]]'' setting in which it was set.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andre Norton|Norton, Andre]]. ''[[Quag Keep]]''. New York: DAW Books, 1979. pp. 117-155&lt;/ref&gt; It was described more formally and familiarly in ''[[The World of Greyhawk]]'' folio (1980) with the description repeated in the ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting]]'' a few years later.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Sea of Dust was described in much greater detail in ''[[Sea of Death]]'', a non-TSR novel written by [[Gary Gygax]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gygax, Gary]]. ''Sea of Death'' ([[New Infinities]], 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Greyhawk Adventures]]'', published by TSR in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Ward (game designer)|Ward, James]]. ''[[Greyhawk Adventures]]''. Lake Geneva, WI: TSR, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a little more information published since then in the ''[[Living Greyhawk Gazetteer]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and elsewhere. The detail about thri-kreen packs was mentioned in ''Thri-Kreen of Athas'', which had a short section on the thri-kreen of [[Oerth]].&lt;ref&gt;Beach, Tim, and Dori Hein. ''Thri-Kreen of Athas''. Lake Geneva, WI: TSR, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sea of Dust is dominated by powdery gray ash immediately west of the Hellfurnaces. More ash is added every year. It becomes less ash-clogged toward the Sulhauts, where ruined fortifications and walled cities of the [[Suloise]] can still be seen. These ruined buildings have the characteristic high-angled look still favored by Suel-descended peoples in places such as the [[Lendore Isles]] and the [[Sea Princes]].

The central region of the Sea of Dust is the most alien. Rather than gray ash, the substance of the Sea is a white, caustic powder that blows around and causes those who do not protect their mouths and noses with damp cloths to cough blood. Mixed with water, it forms a strong lye. The light reflecting off the white dunes will blind those who do not protect their eyes with slitted visors or masks. Glassy depressions in the central Sea are said to correspond to former cities of the Suel.

In the southwest of the Sea of Dust there is a small amount of rainfall, and here various groups of nomads are able to survive. The dust of this region is dry soil rather than an alien alkaline material or ash, and it is extraordinarily productive for a time after the occasional rain.

The majority of the Sea of Dust is without water on the surface and has no plant life on the surface. In areas where the dust or ash lies thinner above the more stable earth the occasional [[vampire cactus]] is able to survive; their seeds were brought to the area by migrating birds. Deep beneath the dunes, some waters still flow, and burrowing creatures have been able to access it. Thus, certain creatures live in tunnels beneath the dust, including boring beetles, [[bulette]]s, giant centipedes, [[meenlock]]s, [[Derro (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|derro]], [[horgar]], [[jermlaine]]s, [[osquip]]s, [[purple worm]]s, giant rats, [[myconid]]s, [[snyad]]s, and [[ankheg]]s.

In the foothills of the Hellfurnaces, [[firenewt]]s and [[Fire lizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|fire lizards]] hunt. In the same region a short, stocky [[human]] people cover their bodies with a foul-smelling wax in order to protect themselves from caustic dust and burning sun. This matches the description of the Hek people from the adventure ''[[All That Glitters... (module)|All That Glitters]].''

Giant snakes and arachnids of various kinds can also be found in the desert.

The majority of the derro race still dwells beneath the Sea of Dust, having survived the [[Rain of Colorless Fire]] thanks to the protection of hundreds of feet of earth. A major community of them lives in the [[Forgotten City]].

Some of the nomads are of Suel descent, but most are a tall, slender, curly-haired people with blue-black skin and slanted eyes with origins to the south. They are rich in gold and gems looted from the ruined cities of the Suel.

Stories are told of packs of [[thri-kreen]] roaming the wastes of the Sea of Dust.

The nomads move frequently between wells, as they are prone to dry up or grow salty when overused.

The dustlakes, or ''Ktosor-hep'' as the local nomads call them, are pools of dust anywhere between half a mile and six miles across that have been made magical by contact with the buried towns and cities of the Suel. While the wavelike dunes of the Sea of Dust do resemble the form of a watery sea, the dustlakes are completely liquid, able to support boats, swimmers, and divers just as water does. Unlike water, they are somewhat breathable for those wearing fine cloth masks, as the fluid somehow permits the passage of air between the grains of dust. The nomads require boys to dive to the bottom and bring back a trinket from the ruins in order to be accepted by their tribes as full men.

The Forgotten City, once the capital of the [[Suel Imperium]], lies buried somewhere in the center of the desert.

This great basin was formerly home to the ancient [[Suel Imperium]], a nation of fertile lands extending some one-thousand miles west and south, before it was destroyed by the [[Rain of Colorless Fire]] in -422 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]]. The Rain of Colorless Fire was sent by the [[Baklunish Empire]] to the north, in retaliation for the [[Invoked Devastation]] which destroyed all but the remnants of that empire.

===Sheldomar Valley===
The Sheldomar Valley refers to the large swath of fertile land in southwestern Flanaess, bordered by the Barrier Peaks to the north, Crystalmists and Hellfurnaces to the west, ''Azure Sea'' to the south and the [[Lortmil Mountains|Lortmils]] to the east. The valley is named after the Sheldomar River, which runs through a good portion of its length.

A number of nations make up the Sheldomar Valley, the largest being the [[Keoland|Kingdom of Keoland]]. Other notable realms include [[Bissel (Greyhawk)|Bissel]], [[Geoff (Greyhawk)|Geoff]], the [[Gran March]], the ''Hold of the Sea Princes'', the [[Ulek States]], the ''Valley of the Mage'' and the [[Yeomanry (Greyhawk)|Yeomanry]].

===Star Cairns===
The '''Star Cairns''' are a series of stone warrens that were used in antiquity by [[Suloise]] mages as magical research centers. ''[[The Star Cairns]]'' is also the name of a 1998 adventure module in which players can explore the site.

====Location====
The Star Cairns are located to the southeast of the [[Free City of Greyhawk]] in the foothills of the [[Abbor-Alz]]. The cairns were originally set in a "V" pointing south with the apex near the town of [[Ul Bakak]] on the border of the [[Bright Desert]]. However, due to the magical disruptions of the cataclysm that brought an end to their use, the southernmost cairn is not apparent much of the time, as it is shifting between planes. The area was chosen by the Suloise mages due to a confluence of [[ley lines]] that enhanced the magic properties of the area, easing their research.

====History====
The Star Cairns were the brainchild of a court mage of the [[Great Kingdom]], [[Murtaree]], who was given a copy of [[Kevelli Mauk]]'s ''[[Tome of the Scarlet Sign]]'', written just prior to the [[Rain of Colorless Fire]] that eradicated the [[Suel Imperium]], and which served as the manifesto for the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]]. Murtaree came across his copy of the book in 167 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]].

The book affected Murtaree immensely, and inspired him to attempt his own revenge on the [[Baklunish]] people, and he soon gathered other Suel who were of a similar disposition, and took them to the Abbor-Alz, where they built five underground bunkers across the landscape in an area that was rich in magical energy. There the mages conducted research and began the construction of a major magical weapon. Murtaree attempted, and failed to become a [[lich (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|lich]] about this time and died in 174 CY.

The Cairns were devastated and abandoned in 198 CY, as a meteor strike summoned from the heavens by [[Lyzandred]] hit the Abbor-Alz, disrupting careful experiments in one cairn, ripping it from the [[Prime Material Plane]] (to return only sporadically). The surviving mages left the area, many leaving for the Great Kingdom.

Since then, the four remaining cairns have been employed by different groups of beings for different purposes. In particular, the Armor Research Cairn has been used in the past by the wealthy of Greyhawk and [[Hardby]] as a communal tomb, although the practice has by and large ceased.

The cairns are also the resting place of the components of an artifact known as the [[Doomheart]], a weapon of great power that has the capability of casting a cone that disintegrates all in its path (and which was so dangerous to its wielder that the mages also crafted a massive [[juggernaut]] to carry the weapon).&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Sean ''[[The Star Cairns]]''. TSR, 1998. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Star Cairns had been mentioned as early as ''[[From the Ashes (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|From the Ashes]]'', which presents them as burial sites for high-level Suel mages. [[Carl Sargent]], the sourcebook's author, seemed to point in the direction of the missing fifth cairn being a teleporter between the other four that went haywire and teleported itself. ''From the Ashes'' also suggested that the cairns were meant to be arranged in the shape of a pentagon or star.&lt;ref name="Sargent, Carl p. 36"&gt;Sargent, Carl. ''From the Ashes Campaign Book'' TSR, 1992 p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of cairns====
* Weapons Research Cairn. Originally, the mages of this cairn were researching weapons of great power to use on the Baklunish. Due to quirks in the magical energy of the area, all weapons created or forged were more effective in the short run, but soon became cursed. For a time, the cairn was occupied by a party of doppelganger bandits.
*Armor Research Cairn. This cairn was devoted to the creation of armor. Since the cataclysm, however, the magical energies shifted to be more beneficial for necromancy. In years past, the cairn was a popular burial site, making it a target for necromancers and grave robbers.
*Vehicle Cairn. This cairn was used for the creation of vehicles of war, including a rumored juggernaut that would have carried a powerful magical artifact into battle. An outcast [[Beholder (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|beholder]] recently took up residence in the cairn.
* Golem Cairn. As the name suggests, this cairn was used for the creation of numerous constructs designed for combat. This included rudimentary research in intelligent [[Golem (D&amp;D)|golems]]. The research created an intelligent and genocidal iron golem programmed to kill non-Suel.
* The Lost Cairn. This cairn was where the most sensitive research was conducted, including research in replicating the Rain of Colorless Fire, as well as experiments in [[Fiend (D&amp;D)|fiend]] summoning. The cataclysm affected these lines of research due to a bizarre coincidence: the meteor struck just as both wizards were activating test spells. The disruption in their work at such a critical moment caused the two spells to interact, pulling the cairn into a border area between the [[Plane (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Astral Plane|Astral]], [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] and [[Prime Material Plane|Prime Material]] planes.

===Sterich===
Sterich, properly known as the March of Sterich, is a political state generally located in the southwestern portion of the Flanaess. It lies in a broad basin formed by the Stark Mounds to the north and northwest, by the Crystalmist Mountains to the west, and by the Jotens to the south.  It is separated from the [[Keoland|Kingdom of Keoland]] by the Javan River. Sterich is ruled by Marquess Resbin Dren Emondav, a [[lawful neutral]] female human. The national capital is Istivin. The native folk of Sterich show strong [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] racial characteristics, tempered by [[Suloise|Suel]] and [[Oeridian]] influences. Sterich's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Per fess dancetty gules and sable a lion rampant counterchanged.''.&lt;ref name="Gygax, Gary 1980"&gt;Gygax, Gary.

===Sulm===
Sulm refers to an ancient [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] kingdom which once occupied much of the [[Bright Desert]], in the days when it was a fertile land. The ancestors of the Sulmi were nomads who lived in the grasslands where the Bright Desert lies today, living in harmony with the land and worshipping spirits of earth and air. Like most of the nomads in the region, they slowly became more sophisticated under the influence of the demigod [[Vathris]]. The Kingdom of Sulm came to prominence circa -1900 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]] after it was bolstered by the necromantic adepts of Caerdiralor, who taught them dark secrets and promised wealth and glory in exchange for the favor of the Sulmi royal house. Throughout its history, the kingdom spent much of its time crushing its neighbors, the rival kingdoms of Durha, Itar, Ronhass, Rhugha, and Truun. Only the Kingdom of Itar was strong enough to stand against Sulm, though it, too, would eventually fall. After centuries of expansion, Sulm began its slow decline circa -1400 CY. [[Kyuss (Greyhawk)|Kyuss]] was a powerful priest of Nerull during Sulm's imperial age, shortly before its destruction. He was exiled for his profane experiments on undead in the sacred mortuary city of Unaagh, and traveled with hundreds of followers to the [[Amedio Jungle]]. In circa -700 CY the Kingdom of Sulm fell, destroyed by its last king. The king, Shattados, used the power of a dark artifact known as the Scorpion Crown in an attempt to gain perpetual dominion over his subjects. Instead, the crown turned Shattados into a gigantic scorpion and his people into manscorpions and (possibly) dune stalkers. A few became asheratis instead due to the grace of [[Geshtai]]. The land itself was even changed, transformed into a vast wasteland now known as the Bright Desert.&lt;ref&gt;Broadhurst, Creighton. "Into the Bright Desert."

===Sunndi===
'''Sunndi''' is a political state situated in the  region of the Flanaess.

==== Developmental history====
In 1980, a brief paragraph about the County of Sunndi was published by [[Gary Gygax]] in the ''World of Greyhawk'' folio (TSR 9025). (The name "Sunndi" was a near-homophone of Cindy, one of Gygax's children.&lt;ref name="Revised Greyhawk Index"/&gt;) In this edition, Sunndi's population was listed as 50,000+, and its ruler was identified simply as the Count of Sunndi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Gygax   | first = Gary  | title = The World of Greyhawk  | publisher = TSR  | page = 16 | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-935696-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, an almost identical paragraph appeared in Gygax’s ''World of Greyhawk'' boxed set (TSR 1015); however, the ruler was now identified by name as Count Hazendel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Gygax   | first = Gary  | title = World of Greyhawk  | publisher = TSR  | page = 37 | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
After Gygax left TSR in 1985, a boxed set called ''From the Ashes'' advanced the campaign world to 585 CY, the year after the end of a continent-wide war that had taken place 582-584 CY. During the wars, Sunndi had been overrun by the armies of Ivid the Undying, but had managed to regain its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = From the Ashes: Atlas of the Flanaess  | publisher = TSR  | page = 39 | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wizards of the Coast took over TSR in 1997 and revived the moribund Greyhawk setting for their new Third Edition of Dungeons and Dragons. The storyline was advanced to 590 CY, and now dealt with the new alliances and problems that had developed in the wake of the Greyhawk Wars. Sunndi's current state at that time was a feudal hereditary monarchy of eighteen counties ruled by Olvenking Hazendel from the capital city of Pitchfield.

==== People ====
Sunndi's population numbers about 125,000, of which 79% are human of Oeridi and Suolise extraction, 9% are gray elves, 5% are mountain and hill dwarves, 3% are gnomes, 2% are halflings, 1% are half-elves, and 1% are other races. These races live in harmony and mutual self-defence.&lt;ref name = lgg&gt;{{Citation  | last = Holian   | first = Gary  | last2 = Mona  | first2 = Erik   | last3 = Reynolds  | first3 = Sean K.   | last4 = Weining  | first4 = Frederick   | title = Living Greyhawk Gazetteer  | publisher = Wizards of the Coast  | page = 110 | year = 2000  | isbn = 978-0-7869-1743-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Religion ====
No single religion dominates this region, but significant deities worshipped include [[Pelor]], [[Trithereon]], [[Lydia]], the Oeridian agricultural gods, the elvish, dwarvish and gnomish pantheons, [[Ulaa]], [[Fortubo]], [[Jascar]], [[Norebo]] and [[Boccob]].&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt;

==== Geography ====
Sunndi is a warm  and fertile land in the southeast corner of the Flanaess, lying between the Rieuwood Forest and Glorioles Mountains to the north, the Hestmark Highlands to the east, the Pawluck River to the west and the Vast Swamp to the south.

Although this is an easily defended land, its defensive strength is also its weakness, since it has no easy trade outlet for its grain, gold, electrum and gems other than the narrow Highland Trail through the Hestmark Highlands to the port of [[Dullstrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore |first=Roger E. |title=Dullstrand: The Coast, the Town, and the People |url=http://www.dracheninsel.de/dracheninsel/add/greyhawk/dullstrand.htm |accessdate=2009-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004204142/http://dracheninsel.de/dracheninsel/add/greyhawk/dullstrand.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And the Vast Swamp is both a blessing and a curse, for although it defends Sunndi's southern border, it is also home to disease, strange monsters and warlike [[bullywug]]s that emerge from the fens every 15–20 years.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt;

Given its subtropical location, Sunndi's climate is warm year-round, with plentiful rainfall in the autumn and winter, and humid heat during the spring and summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kingdom of Sunndi: Geography | url = http://www.sunndi.org/sunndi/geography.html | accessdate = 2009-02-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202103206/http://www.sunndi.org/sunndi/geography.html | archivedate = 2008-12-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow is a sure sign of magical evil afoot.&lt;ref name = ab &gt;{{Citation  | last = Moore | first = Roger E. | title = Greyhawk: The Adventure Begins  | publisher = TSR  | page = 31 | year = 1998  | isbn = 0-7869-1249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== History ====
A thousand years ago, Suloise refugees fleeing from the ruin of the Twin Cataclysms entered the fertile lands south of the Rieuwood and befriended the indigenous gray elves. Later invasions by Oeridian raiders conquered the Suloise/elven alliance, but time was on Sunnndi's side and gradually the Oeridians were integrated.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt; After Aerdy conquered all Oeridian lands following the [[Battle of a Fortnight's Length]] in -110 CY, Sunndi was made a part of the South Province of the [[Great Kingdom]]. One of the overkings subsequently made Sunndi a separate fief within the South Province, ruled by a Count who swore fealty to the Herzog (prince) of South Province. Since the Count was appointed by the Herzog, the post was usually granted to the Sunnd noble who promised to extract the most tribute from the county to send to the Herzog. The result was oppressive [[taxation]] and [[overfarming]], as well as suppression of non-human races.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt;

When the Iron League was formed by the Free City of Irongate, Idee, and Onnwal in 447 CY in opposition to the Great Kingdom, Sunndi rebelled against its masters, drove the herzog's soldiers out of Sunndi and joined the League in 455 CY. The gray elf Count Turentel Esparithen formed a government based on mutual respect for all peoples of Sunndi.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt; The herzogs of South Provinces attempted to retake Sunndi several times over the next century without success. However, in 577 CY, South Province received the backing it needed from the mad overking Ivid the Undying, and successfully invaded.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt; At the same time, bullywugs attacked from the Vast Swamp, pulling needed troops from the northern defences.  Although the bullywug invasion was contained and the monsters driven back into the swamp, the South Province army took advantage of the divided Sunnd forces, and finally took the capital of Pitchfield in 583 CY. It seemed that the battle for Sunndi was over, for nothing now stood between the herzog and Sunndi's fertile lands. However, a newly re-dedicated Sunnd army under the hero Osson met the South Province army at the Battle of Rieuwood and was triumphant, although an attempt by Osson to follow the herzog's troops across the Thelly River into South Province failed and the Sunnd army was forced to retreat back to Sunndi.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt;

Although Sunndi had regained its independence, the fall of Iron League members Idee and Onwaal to South Province in 586 CY reminded Sunndi how tenuous freedom could be. In 589 CY, Count Hazendel declared to be Sunndi a fully independent kingdom, and proclaimed that all old ties with the Great Kingdom were forever severed. Hazendel became Olvenking Hazendel the Defender. The few Aerdy-descended noble houses that remained in Sunndi were ordered to rename themselves and swear allegiance to the crown.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt; In 590 CY (the year of the current campaign setting), eighteen scions from both human and nonhuman noble houses have been appointed to a Congress of Lords to advise the olvenking. Sunndi had been subdivided into eighteen counties,&lt;ref name=counties&gt;{{cite web  | title = Kingdom of Sunndi: Counties and Nobles  | url = http://www.sunndi.org/sunndi/counties.html  | accessdate = 2009-02-21  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202101411/http://www.sunndi.org/sunndi/counties.html  | archivedate = 2008-12-02  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; and each lord of the Congress has been appointed count of one of these new regions.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt; Increased raids by monsters from the Vast Swamp remind the Sunnd government of the historic cycle of bullywug invasions, and Hazendel has ordered the construction of new forts along the edge of the swamp against an expected invasion within the next few years. Investigation suggested that followers of [[Wastri]], upset by the good relations between humans and nonhumans in Sunndi, and especially repelled by the thought of an elf on the throne, may be behind the new round of attacks.&lt;ref name = lgg /&gt;

===Thillonrian Peninsula===
The Thillonrian Peninsula, also known as Rhizia in the Cold Tongue, is a geographical area in the northeastern portion of the Flanaess. A cold, mountainous land, this region is best known for being the home of the nations of the [[Frost Barbarians|Frost]], [[Ice Barbarians|Ice]], and Snow Barbarians, as well as the nation of [[Stonehold]]. The peninsula is dominated by the Griff-Corusk mountain range, and is surrounded by the Icy Sea and the Solnor Ocean.

The Thillonrian Peninsula was mentioned by [[Stephen Colbert]] on the ''[[Colbert Report]]'' as a location travelled to by his [[player character]], Farynieth.[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3309522777432632070&amp;q=colbert+paladin&amp;total=1&amp;start=0&amp;num=10&amp;so=0&amp;type=search&amp;plindex=0]{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;ref name="Holian 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sargent 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gygax, Gary 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David "Zeb" Cook|Cook, David]].

===Ull===
'''Ull''' is a political state situated in the [[Baklunish Basin]] region of the Flanaess, south of the [[Plains of the Paynims]].

The native folk of Ull are more or less pureblooded [[Baklunish]].

===Veluna===
'''Veluna''', properly known as the '''Archclericy of Veluna''', is a [[theocratic]] political state of the Flanaess.

The Archclericy of Voll, originally a vassal to the [[Ferrond|Viceroyalty of Ferrond]], became known as Veluna and claimed independence from the [[Great Kingdom]] of Aerdy in 254 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]].  The [[Keoland|Kingdom of Keoland]] began a series of occupations of Veluna in 350 CY, only to be ultimately driven out in 438 CY by the forces of [[Furyondy]]. In 446 CY, in an agreement known as the Concordat of Eademer, the Velunese College of Bishops voted overwhelmingly to break from the kingdom of Furyondy, establishing the current state known as the Archclericy of Veluna.

Because the moon of [[Luna (Raenei)|Luna]] held special significance for the original [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]] tribes in the area, the region is also sometimes known as the "Vale of Luna", or more simply, "The Vale".

Modern Veluna is generally located in the western-central portion of the Flanaess. It is bordered by the [[Velverdyva River]] to the north and east; by the [[Fals River]] to the north and west; and by the [[Lortmil Mountains]] and the [[Kron Hills]] to the south.  Most of the original forests in the Vale have been clear cut to make way for farmland, or to supply lumber for building projects.  The only remaining woodlands of any note are the Ironwood, the Dapple Wood and the Asnath Copse. As of 591 CY, the most populous towns are Mitrik (pop. 16,200), Veluna City (pop. 11,100), and Devarnish (pop. 7,900).

As of 591 CY, the population of Veluna totaled 668,800 persons, the vast majority (almost 80%) being humans of mainly [[Oeridian]] descent. [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Elves]] make up another 10% (mostly of the high elf variety), while the remainder of the population consists of [[Gnome (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|gnomes]], [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|halflings]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarves]], half-elves, and [[half-orc]]s.

The most popular deities among Velunans are [[Rao (Greyhawk)|Rao]], [[Saint Cuthbert (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Saint Cuthbert]], [[Heironeous]], the [[Oeridian agricultural gods]], [[Fharlanghn]], [[Zilchus]], and the [[Seldarine]].

The most widely spoken languages in Veluna include Common, [[Velondi]], Flan, Elven, Halfling, and Gnome.

The Archclericy of Veluna is a theocracy devoted to the worship of Rao, and ruled by the Canon of Veluna, a powerful Raoan cleric advised by the College of Bishops and the Celestial Order of the Moons. The Canon is selected by the College of Bishops and approved by the Celestial Order when the old Canon steps down or passes on. Power to remove the Canon is shared between the College and the Celestial Order. The national capital is [[Mitrik]].

Veluna is divided into eight [[diocese]]s for the purpose of administering both church and [[secular]] functions. Seven of the dioceses are jointly ruled, half of the governing power being held by a bishop of Rao (appointed by the Canon), and the remaining power given to the most powerful secular noble family in each diocese. The eighth diocese, that of Veluna City, is governed by the Canon himself, though an archbishop is appointed to administer it.

As of 591 CY, Veluna's chief of state is Canon [[Hazen (Greyhawk)|Hazen]].

In the [[Living Greyhawk]] Campaign, in early 594 CY Canon Hazen was slain by the lich Herion.  Priffin Truft, the Archbishop of the Royal College, was chosen as his successor.

Veluna's bicameral legislature consists of the College of Bishops and the Celestial Order of the Moons.

The College of Bishops is a council that advises the Canon and maintains various religious functions in Veluna. The College consists of the Bishop of Rao from each of Veluna's seven dioceses, the Archbishop of Veluna City, the rulers of the local churches of Saint Cuthbert and Heironeous, the High Priest of the Knights of Veluna, a representative from the elven churches, and other members appointed by the Canon.

The Celestial Order of the Moons consists of 15 members: two representatives from the ruling secular noble families of each diocese, and a representative from the [[Verbobonc|Viscounty of Verbobonc]]. The nobles retain all voting power, while the representative from Verbobonc serves only as an advisor. The Order is presided over by the Archbishop of Veluna City, though he serves no other 'official' capacity.

Veluna's [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Sable, quarterly a crescent or, over all a mullet of four points argent''.

Veluna is noted for its foodstuffs, and mining operations to produce copper, silver, and gold.

The Veluna standard [[coin]]age consists of the [[platinum]] brilliant (pp), [[gold]] crook (gp), [[electrum]] staff (ep), [[silver]] tower (sp), and [[copper]] hand (cp).

===Verbobonc===

'''Verbobonc''', properly known as the [[Viscounty]] and Town of Verbobonc, is a semi-independent nation of the Flanaess. Though Verbobonc owes fealty to the Archclericy of [[Veluna]], it is nearly autonomous in practice.  In the Living Greyhawk campaign, Verbobonc corresponds to the states of Illinois and Indiana. It pioneered a system for allowing [[Living Greyhawk]] player characters to develop towns, open businesses, and establish strongholds, something previously beyond the scope of the Living Greyhawk campaign. Player-created towns tend to reflect the personalities of the player characters who pool their resources to "found" a town.

===Wild Coast===

Little more than a collection of five major [[city-states]] for most of its history, the Wild Coast has long held a reputation for being untamed. Prior to the [[Greyhawk Wars]], each city-state controlled its own affairs.  However, things changed once [[Turrosh Mak]] gained control of the [[Pomarj]].  In 584 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]], Mak's forces marched north, taking the towns of [[Elredd]], [[Badwall]], and [[Fax (Greyhawk)|Fax]], thus conquering the entire southern Wild Coast.  The remaining towns of [[Safeton]] and [[Narwell]] escaped destruction only by swearing fealty to [[Free City of Greyhawk|Greyhawk]], resulting in the northern Wild Coast being absorbed into the Free City's domain.

===Wolf Nomads===
The '''Wolf Nomads''', properly known as the '''Wegwiur''', is a political state of the Flanaess. The name also applies to the tribes of nomadic horsemen who dwell within these lands.

The Wolf Nomads are descended from the [[Relentless Horde]], which swept into the area around 320 [[Common Year (Greyhawk)|CY]]. After the death of the Kha-Khan [[Ogobanuk]], the [[Tiger Nomads]] split from the Horde and the Wolf Nomads came to be ruled by a ruler known as the ''tarkhan''. Since then, the tarkhans have ruled according to the decrees set forth in the ''Great Yassa of Ogobanuk'', which describes the traditions of illusion, leadership, and the proper way of nomadic life.

The Wolf Nomads have opposed [[Iuz]] since he first appeared on the borders of his lands. Iuz claimed the [[Howling Hills]], where the Wolf Nomads have traditionally buried their honored dead, including Ogobanuk himself. They defeated him at the Battle of Black Water Bend just before the [[Greyhawk Wars]], breaking the Old One's siege of Eru-Tovar. After the wars, [[Tang the Horrific]] encouraged them to invade Iuz's kingdom, and many of the cambion's nonhuman troops were slain.

The lands of the Wolf Nomads are situated in the [[Bitter North]] region of the Flanaess, north of [[Perrenland]] on the far shore of [[Lake Quag]].

The native folk of the Wolf Nomads are primarily [[Baklunish]] with a great deal of genetic mixture with the [[Rovers of the Barrens]], to the east. As a result of these Flan characteristics, Wolf Nomads have slightly darker complexions than their [[Tiger Nomads|Tiger Nomad]] cousins. Each Wolf Nomad warrior must capture a wild wolf cub as a rite of manhood, raising it to be his companion. "Civilized" Wolf Nomads in Eru-Tovar sometimes simply buy wolf cubs.

The Wolf Nomads revere the Baklunish deities [[Geshtai]] and [[Istus]]. From long-ago contact with the Oerids, some of whom also became part of the Relentless Horde, they revere [[Telchur]] and the Black Wolf, their name for [[Kurell]]. Ancestor worship is prevalent among them as well.

In [[Rose Estes]]' novels, the Wolf Nomads revere a deity they call the Great She Wolf, whom they refer to as the "mother of us all."

The Wolf Nomads speak [[Greyhawk languages|Ordai]], a language closely related to that of their [[Paynim]] ancestors.

The Wolf Nomads' [[coat of arms]] is blazoned thus: ''Sable, three wolves courant in pale gules.''.

===Yeomanry===

The modern Yeomanry is located in the southwestern portion of the Flanaess. It is nestled entirely within a broad basin bounded by the Jotens to the north, the Crystalmist Mountains to the west and south, and the Little Hills to the east. The valley passage between the Little Hills and the Tors leads directly into the Hool Marshes. A long cave system known as the Passage of Slerotin tunnels under the Hellfurnaces from the town of Dark Gate in the Yeomanry, finally emerging over 200 miles away into the Sea of Dust.

==Calendar==
The Common Year (CY) Reckoning is a fictional dating system used in the ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]].

In the mid-1970s, [[Gary Gygax]] created a campaign world called Greyhawk for the new fantasy roleplaying game called Dungeons and Dragons that he was helping to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Rausch  | first = Allen   | title = Magic and Memories: The Complete History of Dungeons and Dragons  | publisher = Gamespy.com  | date = 2004-08-19  | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538262p2.html  | accessdate = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980 [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] publication ''[[World of Greyhawk]]'' (TSR 9025), he included a brief timeline of twenty-one historical events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Gygax   | first = Gary  | title = The World of Greyhawk  | publisher = TSR  | page = 5 | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-935696-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described a thousand years of history in order to explain how his world—the Flanaess—had arrived at its present state of affairs. There were five major cultures involved in this timeline, each of them with their own calendar system:

* [[Suloise]]: Suloise Dating or Suloise Dominion (SD)
* [[Olven]]: Olven Calendar (OC)
* [[Bakluni]]: Baklunish Hegira or Baklunish Hierarchy (BH)
* [[Flan (Greyhawk)|Flan]]: Flan Tally (FT)
* [[Oeridian]]: Oeridian Record or Oeridian Reckoning (OR)

One of the major events of Gygax's timeline was an invasion by the Oeridian people, which forced other cultures to the peripheries of this land and led to the formation of the [[Great Kingdom of Aerdy]]. The first emperor marked the start of this new empire with a new universal calendar, Common Year Reckoning.

Gygax calculated all events that had taken place before 1 CY as negative numbers, and since there was no 0 CY—the year previous to 1 CY was -1 CY—this forced an extra calculation when attempting to convert Common Year dates prior to 1 CY to the other calendar systems. However, by the start of Gygax's campaign (set as 576 CY), the Common Year Reckoning was used almost universally by most cultures, making conversions to the other calendar systems by [[dungeon masters]] largely unnecessary.

Days, weeks, and months within the Common Year are reckoned using the [[Greyhawk Calendar]]. {{non sequitur |date=January 2018 |reason=circular reference |text= }}

==Weather==
Except in the far north, temperatures reach below zero only in the winter months of [[Greyhawk Calendar|Sunsebb]] and [[Greyhawk Calendar|Fireseek]] and sometimes at night in late autumn and early spring. Even then temperatures seldom dip far below 0. The northeast and central regions of the Flanaess are the coldest, with winters extending into [[Greyhawk Calendar|Ready'reat]] and [[Greyhawk Calendar|Readying]]. The warm currents of the [[Dramidj Ocean]] moderate the climate of the lands that border it. Summer typically lasts five or more months. Prevailing winds blow from the northeast in winter and autumn and from the southeast the rest of the year. Wintry northern winds are sometimes known as "[[Telchur]]'s breath," while easterly winds are sometimes called "[[Atroa (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Atroa]]'s laugh." Plentiful rainfall supports bountiful agriculture throughout most of the Flanaess.

'''Korean masks''' have a long tradition with the use in a variety of contexts. Masks of any type are called ''tal''  ({{lang-ko|탈}}) in Korean, but they are also known by many others names such as ''gamyeon'', ''gwangdae'', ''chorani'', ''talbak'' and ''talbagaji.'' Korean masks come with black cloth attached to the sides of the mask designed to cover the back of the head and also to simulate black hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to Korean Culture|last=|first=|publisher=Korean Culture and Information Service|year=2010|isbn=9781565912878|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
They were used in war, on both soldiers and their horses; ceremonially, for burial rites in jade and bronze and for shamanistic ceremonies to drive away evil spirits, to remember the faces of great historical figures in death masks, and in the arts, particularly in ritual dances, courtly, and theatrical plays. The present uses are as miniature masks for tourist souvenirs, or on cell-phones where they hang as good-luck talismans.

There are two ways to categorize masks: religious masks and artistic masks. Religious masks were often used to ward off evil spirits and the artistics masks were mostly used in dances and theater shows.

==Dance masks==
Masks which use for  dance in Korea are about 250 types and they vary in shape. Masks in central district usually look pretty and similar to human face more and in the southern province masks are for satire and Shamanistic.&lt;ref&gt;http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2026665&amp;cid=50826&amp;categoryId=50826  문화콘텐츠닷컴 '탈'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shamanistic masks==
The often horrifying or grotesque masks were used in [[Korean Shamanism|shamanistic practices]] for their ability to evoke fear, and humour, in ceremonial rites. The masks were often made of [[Japanese Alder|alder]] wood, with several coats of lacquer to give the masks gloss, and waterproof them for wearing. They were usually also painted, and often had hinges for mouth movement.

Typically one sees the following some of which are designated as national cultural properties.The Hahoe, Sandae and Talchum are all traditional Korean mask dramas of ritual and religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. ed. 2009. Drama from the Rim: Asian Pacific Drama Book (2nd ed.). Drama Victoria. Melbourne. p48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hahoe Byeolsin ''gut'' is a kind of exorcist play while performers wear mask such as ''[[yangban]]tal'' (nobleman), ''bunetal'', ''[[seonbi]]tal'' (scholar), ''gaksital'' (bride), ''chorangital'', ''halmital'', ''jujital'' (head monk), ''jungital'' (monk), ''[[baekjeong]]tal'' (butcher), and ''imaetal''.

==Cultural assets and national treasures==
The mask play of Hahoe Byeolsin Exorcism itself was classified as important intangible cultural asset #69 by the [[South Korea]]n government on November 17, 1980. Hahoe and Byeolsin masks themselves were also labelled [[South Korean national treasure]]  #121 at the same time. The Hahoe mask dance is one of the folk dramas of Pungcheon [[Hahoe village]] in [[Andong]] city, and dates from the [[Goryeo Dynasty]].

In [[Irish mythology]], '''Mag Mell''' (modern spelling: '''Magh Meall''', meaning "plain of joy") was a mythical realm achievable through death and/or glory. Unlike the [[underworld]] in some mythologies, Mag Mell was a pleasurable paradise, identified as either an island far to the west of Ireland or a kingdom beneath the ocean. However, Mag Mell was similar to the fields of [[Elysium]] in Greek mythology, and like the fields of Elysium, was accessible only to a select few. Furthermore, Mag Mell, like the numerous other mystical islands said to be off the coast of Ireland, was never explicitly stated in any surviving mythological account to be an afterlife. Rather, it is usually portrayed as a paradisal location populated by deities, which is occasionally visited by some adventurous mortals. In its island guise it was visited by various Irish heroes and monks forming the basis of the Adventure Myth or "[[echtrae]]" as defined by [[Myles Dillon]] in his book ''Early Irish Literature''. This otherworld is a place where sickness and death do not exist.  It is a place of eternal youth and beauty.  Here, music, strength, life and all pleasurable pursuits come together in a single place.  Here happiness lasts forever, no one wants for food or drink.  It is the Irish equivalent of the Greek [[Elysium]] or the [[Valhalla]] of the Norse.

Legends say its ruler is the [[Fomorians|Fomorian]] King [[Tethra]], or more frequently [[Manannan mac Lir]]. Mag Mell's allure extended from the pagan era to Christian times. In later stories, the realm is less an afterlife destination than an [[Earthly Paradise]] which adventurers could reach by traveling west from [[Ireland]], often blown off course by providential tempests while on an inspired mission. They typically explore many other fantastic islands before reaching their destination and returning home (or sailing on). Among these voyagers are [[St. Brendan]], [[Bran mac Febal]] (see ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]''), and [[Mael Dúin]].

'''"Mere lapsed"''' ("Children of the sea") was the [[Estonia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998]], performed in [[Estonian Language|Estonian]] by [[Koit Toome]].

The song was performed twenty-third on the night, following [[Norway]]'s [[Lars A. Fredriksen|Lars Fredriksen]] with "[[Alltid sommer]]" and preceding [[Turkey]]'s [[Tüzmen]] with "[[Unutamazsın]]". At the close of voting, it had received 36 points, placing 12th in a field of 25.

The song is a piano ballad, with Toome singing about going on a sea voyage with his lover. The voyage also serves as a metaphor for the pair striking out on their own to start a new life.

On the Eurovision stage, Koit Toome was accompanied by [[Mikko Maltis]] ([[guitar]], backing vocal), [[Ain Varts]] (guitar) and [[Jüri Mazurtšak]] ([[drums]]).

"Mere lapsed" had in fact won the ticket to Birmingham only by a hair. Earlier in 1998, during the entire voting sequence at the Estonian national final for Eurovision, [[Evelin Samuel]] had been in the anything but surprising lead with her song "[[Unistus igavesest päevast]]". The very last juror from Switzerland, however, turned the tables in favour of Koit Toome and made Evelin Samuel a dramatic runner up.

"Mere lapsed" was then succeeded as [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999 Contest]] by [[Evelin Samuel]] &amp; [[Camille (violinist)|Camille]] with "[[Diamond of Night]]".

The '''Ministry of Finance'''  ({{lang-so|Wasaaradda Maaliyadda}}),  abbreviated '''MOF''', is a [[ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Federal Government of Somalia|Government of Somalia]] that is charged with the responsibility for [[government expenditure]] and [[government revenue|revenue]] raising. The ministry's role is to develop economic policy and prepare the  federal budget. The Ministry of Finance also oversees financial legislation and regulation. Each year in October, the Minister of Finance presents the Somali federal budget to the Parliament. 

The Minister of Finance administers his functions through the Ministry of Finance and a range of other government agencies. The current Minister of Finance is [[Abdirahman Duale Beyle]].

==Duties and importance==
The Minister of Finance is the minister in charge of government revenue and expenditure. The Minister oversees [[economic policy]]: [[fiscal policy]] is within the Minister's direct responsibility, while monetary policy is implemented by the politically independent [[Central Bank of Somalia]], the head of which is appointed by the President of Somalia. The Minister of Finance also oversees financial legislation and regulation. Each year in October, the Minister of Finance presents the Somalia's federal budget to the Parliament.

The Minister of Finance is a very senior government post; historically, many Ministers of Finance have previously, concurrently or subsequently served as Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister.

'''New Guinea''' ({{Lang-tpi|Niugini}}; {{Lang-nl|Nieuw-Guinea}}; {{Lang-de|Neuguinea}}; {{lang-id|Papua}}, historically, ''{{lang|id|Irian}}'') is a large island off the continent of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. It is the [[List of islands by area|world's second-largest island]], after [[Greenland]], covering a land area of {{cvt|785753|km2}}, and the largest wholly or partly within the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and [[Oceania]].

The eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Meanwhile, the [[Western New Guinea|western half]] of the island, referred to as either [[Western New Guinea]] or [[Western New Guinea|West Papua]], has been administered by [[Indonesia]] since 1962 and comprises the provinces of [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]].

==Names==
[[File:Thevenot - Hollandia Nova detecta 1644.png|thumb|upright|A typical map from the [[Golden Age of Dutch cartography|Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography]]. [[Australasia]] during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery ({{circa}} 1590s–1720s): including [[New Guinea#European contact|Nova Guinea]] (New Guinea), [[New Holland (Australia)|Nova Hollandia]] ([[mainland Australia]]), [[Van Diemen's Land]] ([[Tasmania]]), and [[Nova Zeelandia]] ([[History of New Zealand|New Zealand]]).]]

The island has been known by various names:

{{anchor|Papua}}&lt;!--[[Etymology of Papua]] redirects here--&gt;The name ''Papua'' was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.&lt;ref name=tides/&gt; Its etymology is unclear;&lt;ref name=tides/&gt; one theory states that it is from [[Tidore language|Tidore]], the language used by the [[Sultanate of Tidore]], which controlled parts of the island's coastal region.&lt;ref name=geop/&gt; The name came from ''papo'' (to unite) and ''ua'' (negation), which means "not united" or, "territory that geographically is far away (and thus not united)".&lt;ref name=geop&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bilveer Singh|title=Papua: geopolitics and the quest for nationhood|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|page=26|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pwbO-uRZQx0C|isbn=978-1-4128-1206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Tarmidzy Thamrin|title=Boven Digoel: lambang perlawanan terhadap kolonialisme|publisher=Ciscom-Cottage|year=2001|page=424|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uEl0AAAAMAAJ|lang=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ploeg reports that the word ''papua'' is often said to derive from the Malay word ''papua'' or ''pua-pua'', meaning "frizzly-haired", referring to the highly curly hair of the inhabitants of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ploeg |first=Anton |year=2002 |title='De Papoea' What's in a name? |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=75–101 |doi=10.1080/14442210210001706216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility, put forward by Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993, is that it comes from the [[Biak language|Biak]] phrase ''sup i papwa'' which means 'the land below [the sunset]' and refers to the islands west of the [[Bird's Head Peninsula|Bird's Head]], as far as [[Halmahera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jason Macleod|title=Merdeka and the Morning Star: Civil Resistance in West Papua|publisher=University of Queensland Press|year=2015|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JtwUCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12|isbn=9780702255670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever its origin, the name ''Papua'' came to be associated with this area, and more especially with Halmahera, which was known to the Portuguese by this name during the era of their colonization in this part of the world.

When the Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived in the island via the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], they also referred to the island as ''Papua''.&lt;ref name=geop/&gt; However, the name ''New Guinea'' was later used by Westerners starting with the Spanish explorer [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez]] in 1545, referring to the similarities of the indigenous people's appearance with the natives of the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea region]] of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=geop/&gt; The name is one of several [[toponyms]] sharing similar [[Placename etymology|etymologies]], ultimately meaning "land of the blacks" or similar meanings, in reference to the [[dark skin]] of the inhabitants.

The Dutch, who arrived later under [[Jacob Le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]], called it ''Schouten island'', but later this name was used only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the [[Schouten Islands]] or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized it as part of [[Netherlands East Indies]], they called it ''Nieuw Guinea''.&lt;ref name=geop/&gt;

The name ''Irian'' was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as "Irian Jaya Province". The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo,&lt;ref name=tides&gt;{{Cite book

''Irian'' is the name used in the Biak language and other languages such as Serui, Merauke and Waropen.&lt;ref name=geop/&gt; The name was used until 2001, when the name ''Papua'' was again used for the island and the province. The name ''Irian'', which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of [[Jakarta]].&lt;ref name=tides/&gt;

New Guinea is an island to the north of [[Australia]], but south of the equator. It is isolated by the [[Arafura Sea]] to the west, and the [[Torres Strait]] and [[Coral Sea]] to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], it lies north of Australia's [[Top End]], the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] and [[Cape York peninsula]], and west of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands Archipelago]].

Politically, the [[West Papua (region)|western half of the island]] comprises two [[provinces of Indonesia]]: [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. The eastern half forms the [[mainland]] of the country of [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG).

The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a [[paradisaea|bird-of-paradise]] (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the [[Bird's Head Peninsula]] in the northwest (''Vogelkop'' in Dutch, ''Kepala Burung'' in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the [[Bird's Tail Peninsula]] in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula).

A spine of east–west mountains, the [[New Guinea Highlands]], dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over {{convert|1600|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} from the 'head' to the 'tail' of the island, with many high mountains over {{convert|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. The [[western New Guinea|western half]] of the island of New Guinea contains the highest mountains in [[Oceania]], rising up to {{convert|4884|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, which is even higher than [[Mont Blanc]] in Europe, ensuring a steady supply of rain from the equatorial atmosphere. The [[tree line]] is around {{convert|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} elevation and the tallest peaks contain permanent equatorial [[glacier]]s—which have been retreating since at least 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, M.L. and G.S. Hope (2006). "Climate of Papua". Ch. 2.3 in Marshall, A.J., and Beehler, B.M. (eds.). The Ecology of Papua. Singapore: Periplus Editions. ''The authors note that "The magnitude of the recession of the Carstensz Glaciers, its causes, and its implications for local, regional, and global climate change are only qualitatively known. The recession of the Carstensz Glaciers from ~11 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 1942 to 2.4 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by 2000 represents about an 80% decrease in ice area."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easternsnow.org/proceedings/2004/kincaid_and_klein.pdf Kincaid and Kline, "Retreat of the Irian Jaya Glaciers from 2000 to 2002 as Measured from IKONOS Satellite Images", paper presented at 61st Eastern Snow Conference, Portland, Maine, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichols.edu/DEPARTMENTS/Glacier/glacier_retreat.htm Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.

The [[List of highest mountains of New Guinea|highest peaks on the island of New Guinea]] are:
* [[Puncak Jaya]], sometimes known by its former Dutch name ''Carstensz Pyramid'', is a mist-covered limestone mountain peak on the Indonesian side of the border. At {{convert|4884|m|ft|0}}, Puncak Jaya makes New Guinea the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest landmass]] after [[Afro-Eurasia]], [[the Americas|America]] and [[Antarctica]].
* [[Puncak Mandala]], also located in Papua, is the second-highest peak on the island at {{convert|4760|m|ft|0}}.
* [[Puncak Trikora]], also in Papua, is {{convert|4750|m|0}}.
* [[Mount Wilhelm]] is the highest peak on the PNG side of the border at {{convert|4509|m|ft|0}}. Its granite peak is the highest point of the Bismarck Range.
* [[Mount Giluwe]] {{convert|4368|m|ft|0}} is the second-highest summit in PNG. It is also the highest volcanic peak in Oceania.

[[File:Mount Bosavi -rim of crater-14Oct2008.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Bosavi]]]]
Another major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland [[rainforest]]s, extensive wetlands, [[savanna]] grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of [[mangrove]] forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of [[Lorentz National Park]], also a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the [[Mamberamo River]] and its tributaries on the Indonesian side, and by the [[Sepik]] on the PNG side; the more extensive southern lowlands by a larger number of rivers, principally the [[Digul]] on the Indonesian side and the [[Fly River|Fly]] on the PNG side. These are the island's major river systems, draining roughly northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast, respectively. Many have broad areas of meander and result in large areas of [[lake]]s and freshwater swamps. The largest island offshore, [[Dolak]] (Frederik Hendrik, Yos Sudarso), lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a "creek".

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea#Geography New Guinea] contains many of the world’s ecosystem types: glacial, [[alpine tundra]], [[savanna]], [[montane]] and lowland rainforest, [[mangrove]]s, [[wetland]]s, lake and [[river ecosystem]]s, [[seagrass]]es, and some of the richest [[coral reef]]s on the planet.

Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the [[New Guinea singing dog]] were introduced with human [[colonization]].

Prior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single [[Pleistocene]] landmass by the name ''Australasia'',&lt;ref name="ballard"/&gt; although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as [[New Zealand]], which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term ''Greater Australia'' for the Pleistocene continent.&lt;ref name=ballard/&gt; Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,&lt;ref name="Allen 1977"/&gt; they extended the name ''Sahul'' from its previous use for just the [[Sahul Shelf]] to cover the continent.&lt;ref name=ballard/&gt;

==Human presence==
The human presence on the island dates back at least 40,000 years, to the oldest homo sapiens migrations out of Africa. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;"The team also dated features consistent with the planting, digging, and tethering of plants and localized drainage systems to 10,000 years ago. Mounds constructed to plant water-intolerant plants such as bananas, sugarcane, and yams are dated to about 6,500 years ago." "Was Papua New Guinea an Early Agriculture Pioneer?" By John Roach, for ''National Geographic News'', [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0623_030623_kukagriculture.html June 23, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the time depth of its inhabitation and its highly fractured landscape, an unusually high number of languages are spoken on the island, with some 1,000 languages (a figure higher than that of most continents) having been catalogued out of an estimated worldwide [[pre-Columbian]] total of more than 7,000 currently spoken human languages according to [[Ethnologue]]. Most are classified as [[Papuan languages]], a generally accepted geographical term. A number of [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken on the coast and on offshore islands.

In the 16th century, Spanish explorers arrived at the island and called it ''Nueva Guinea''. In recent history, western New Guinea was included in the [[Dutch East Indies]] colony. The Germans annexed the northern coast of the eastern half of the island as [[German New Guinea]] in their pre–World War I effort to establish themselves as a colonial power, whilst the southeastern portion was reluctantly claimed by Britain. Following the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the German portion was awarded to Australia (which was already governing the British claim, named the [[Territory of Papua]]) as a [[League of Nations]] mandate. The eastern half of the island was granted independence from Australia in 1975, as Papua New Guinea. The western half gained independence from the Dutch in 1961, but became part of Indonesia soon afterwards in [[Act of Free Choice|controversial circumstances]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB12/ (authorization required)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political divisions ==
[[File:New guinea named.PNG|thumb|Political divisions of New Guinea]]
The island of New Guinea is [[List of divided islands|divided politically]] into roughly equal halves across a north-south line:

* The [[Western New Guinea|western portion]] of the island located west of [[141st meridian east|141°E longitude]] (except for a small section of territory to the east of the [[Fly River]] which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colony]], part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. After the [[Dutch New Guinea Dispute]] it is now two [[Indonesia]]n provinces:
** [[West Papua (Indonesian province)|West Papua]] with [[Manokwari]] as its capital.
** [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] with the city of [[Jayapura]] as its capital.
* The eastern part forms the mainland of [[Papua New Guinea]], which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] governed by Australia, consisting of the [[Territory of New Guinea|Trust Territory of New Guinea]] (northeastern quarter, formerly [[German New Guinea]]), and the [[Territory of Papua]] (southeastern quarter). The country consists of four regions:
** [[Papua Region|Papua]], consisting of [[Western Province, Papua New Guinea|Western]], [[Gulf Province|Gulf]], [[Central Province, Papua New Guinea|Central]], [[Oro Province|Oro (Northern)]] and [[Milne Bay Province|Milne Bay]] provinces.
** [[Highlands Region|Highlands]], consisting of [[Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea|Southern Highlands]], [[Hela Province]], [[Jiwaka Province]], [[Enga Province]], [[Western Highlands, Papua New Guinea|Western Highlands]], [[Simbu Province|Simbu]] and [[Eastern Highlands, Papua New Guinea|Eastern Highlands]] provinces.
** [[Momase Region|Momase]], consisting of [[Morobe Province|Morobe]], [[Madang Province|Madang]], [[East Sepik]] and [[Sandaun|Sandaun (West Sepik)]] provinces.
** [[Islands Region|Islands]], consisting of [[Manus Province|Manus]], [[West New Britain]], [[East New Britain]] and [[New Ireland Province|New Ireland]] provinces, and the [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]] Autonomous Province.

{{see also|Demographics of Papua New Guinea}}
[[File:Yali man Baliem Valley Papua.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Dani people|Dani]] tribesman in the [[Baliem Valley]]]]

The current population of the island of New Guinea is about eleven million. Many believe human habitation on the island dates to as early as 50,000 [[Before Christ|BC]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/30/us-australia-png-humans-idUSTRE68T4X620100930 Anthropology Professor Glenn Summerhayes, University of Otago, New Zealand. September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. [[Ethnologue]]'s 14th edition lists 826 languages of [[Papua New Guinea]] and 257 languages of [[Irian Jaya]], total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping. They fall into one of two groups, the [[Papuan languages]] and the [[Austronesian languages]].

The separation was not merely linguistic; [[Endemic warfare|warfare]] among societies was a factor in the evolution of the ''men's house'': separate housing of groups of adult men, from the single-family houses of the women and children, for mutual protection from other tribal groups. [[Pig]]-based trade between the groups and pig-based feasts are a common theme with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most societies practice [[agriculture]], supplemented by [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]].

[[File:Kurulu Village War Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley]]

The great variety of the island's indigenous populations is frequently assigned to one of two main ethnological divisions, based on archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidence: the [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] and [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373679/Melanesian-culture/276594/Traditional-Melanesia#ref991677 Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Current evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time (either side of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], approx 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a [[land bridge]], forming the landmass known as [[Sahul continent|Sahul]]. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of [[Wallacea]] and [[Sundaland]] (the present [[Malay Archipelago]]) by at least 40,000 years ago, subsequent to the dispersal of peoples from Africa (circa) 50,000 – 70,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
[[File:KorowaiHombre01.jpg|thumb|[[Korowai people|Korowai]] tribesman]]
The ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from [[Southeast Asia]], possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]], with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like [[Transmigration program|transmigration]]. About half of the 2.4 million inhabitants of Indonesian Papua are [[Java]]nese migrants.&lt;ref name=celerier&gt;Philippe Pataud Celerier, [http://mondediplo.com/2010/06/14indonesia Autonomy isn’t independence; Indonesian democracy stops in Papua], [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Large areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] is home to an estimated 44 [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribal groups]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/2191 First contact with isolated tribes?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity and ecology ==

{{Main article|Fauna of New Guinea}}

With some 786,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense [[biodiversity]], containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]], and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see [[Australia-New Guinea]] for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.

In the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/26/new-guinea-new-species-wwf | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tracy | last=McVeigh | title=Conservationists discover more than 1,000 species in New Guinea | date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raggiana Bird-of-Paradise wild 5.jpg|thumb|The [[raggiana bird-of-paradise]] is native to New Guinea.]]
[[File:Malesia.png|thumb|The floristic region of [[Malesia]]]]

[[Biogeography|Biogeographically]], New Guinea is part of [[Australasia]] rather than the [[Indomalaya]]n realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of [[Malesia]], a floristic region that extends from the [[Malay Peninsula]] across Indonesia to New Guinea and the [[East Melanesian Islands]]. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' and ''[[Agathis]],'' as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''[[Eucalyptus]]''.

New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: [[monotremes]], three orders of [[marsupials]], [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world’s known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.

===Early history===
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The continent of Sahul before the rising ocean sundered Australia and New Guinea after the last ice age.]]
The first [[inhabitant]]s of New Guinea arrived at least 50,000 years ago, having travelled through the south-east Asian peninsula. These first inhabitants, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. This work is still in its early stages, so there is still uncertainty as to precisely what crop was being grown, or when/where agriculture arose. [[Sugar cane]] was cultivated for the first time in New Guinea around 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantcultures.org/plants/sugar_cane_history_early_origins_and_spread.html Sugar cane early origins and spread]. Plant Cultures (2004-11-18). Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens of the [[New Guinea Highlands]] are ancient, intensive [[permaculture]]s, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm/yr (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Collapse''. (German translation), Frankfurt 2005, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Collapse''. (German translation), Frankfurt 2005, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the [[silviculture]] of ''Casuarina oligodon'', a tall, sturdy native [[Casuarinaceae|ironwood]] tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. [[Palynology|Pollen studies]] show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.

In more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the [[Austronesian people]], who had spread down from [[Taiwan]], through the [[maritime Southeast Asia|South-east Asian archipelago]], colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]] to [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]], as well as coastal new Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===European contact===
The first European contact with New Guinea was by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, the Portuguese explorer [[Jorge de Meneses]] saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it ''ilhas dos Papuas''. In 1528, the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón|Álvaro de Saavedra]] also recorded its sighting when trying to return from [[Tidore]] to [[New Spain]]. In 1545, the Spaniard [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez|Íñigo Ortíz de Retes]] sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the [[Mamberamo|Mamberamo River]], near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, George The discovery of Australia, Sidney, 1895, pp.186–187&lt;/ref&gt; The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600 and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, [[Luís Vaz de Torres]] explored the southern coast of New Guinea from [[Milne Bay]] to the [[Gulf of Papua]] including [[Orangerie Bay]], which he named ''Bahía de San Lorenzo''. His expedition also discovered [[Basilaki Island]] naming it ''Tierra de San Buenaventura'', which he claimed for [[Spain]] in July 1606.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;Translation of Torres’ report to the king in Collingridge, G. (1895) ''Discovery of Australia'' p.229-237. Golden Press Edition 1983, Gladesville, NSW. {{ISBN|0-85558-956-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day [[Indonesia]], and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.

[[File:New Guinea (1884-1919).png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] controlled the western half of New Guinea, [[German Empire|Germany]] the north-eastern part, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the south-eastern part.]]
A successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. In 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], the [[British colony]] of [[Queensland]] annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when [[German Empire|Germany]] claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of [[German New Guinea]] (also called [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland]]).

The first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]]. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and [[headhunting]] within their respective territories.&lt;ref&gt;White, Osmar. ''Parliament of a Thousand Tribes'', Heinemann, London, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area "[[Territory of Papua]]"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During [[World War I]], Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the [[Territory of New Guinea]], to be administered by Australia under a [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]]. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).

Before about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when [[Richard Archbold]] discovered the [[Baliem Valley|Grand Valley]] of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the [[Dani people|Dani]], were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''The Third Chimpanzee''.

===World War II===
{{Main article|New Guinea campaign}}
[[File:Aust soldiers Finisterres.jpg|thumb|Australian soldiers resting in the [[Finisterre Range]]s of New Guinea while en route to the front line]]
Netherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories were invaded in 1942 by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The Australian territories were put under military administration and were known simply as New Guinea. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Theatre]] of [[World War II]]. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/remember.nsf/pages/NT000027A2 Remembering the war in New Guinea]". Australian War Memorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since World War II===
{{further information|Papua conflict}}
Following the return to civil administration after WW2, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]]. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.

[[File:New Guinea.png|thumb|left|Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s]]
During the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare [[Netherlands New Guinea]] for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the elected [[New Guinea Council]] took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua for the territory, along with an emblem, [[Morning Star flag|flag]], and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, the Dutch handed over the territory to the [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]], until 1 May 1963, when [[Indonesia]] took control. The territory was renamed West Irian and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 [[New York Agreement]], organised a referendum named the [[Act of Free Choice]], in which hand picked Papuan tribal elders reached a consensus to continue the union with Indonesia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

There has been resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,&lt;ref name=celerier/&gt; both through civil disobedience (such as [[Morning Star flag]] raising ceremonies) and via the formation of the [[Organisasi Papua Merdeka]] (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965. [[Amnesty International]] has estimated more than 100,000 [[Papuan languages|Papuans]], one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=651 Report claims secret genocide in Indonesia – University of Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Western New Guinea]] was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969]]
 
From 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to [[Papua New Guinea]].

In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed "The Province of [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a [[Papuan People's Assembly]] (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; [[block grants]] were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/columns/the-thinker-pending-in-papua/416800|title=The Thinker: Pending in Papua|first=Oktovianus|last=Pogau|date=2011-01-13|accessdate=2011-04-18|publisher=[[Jakarta Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court system of Indonesia|Indonesian courts]]' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] was able to create a separate [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] province in 2003 as a [[fait accompli]], plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;King, 2004, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etan.org/issues/wpapua/1207spaut.htm Special Autonomy Issue – ETAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TV Vlaanderen''' is a [[Digital data|digital]] [[satellite television]] and [[terrestrial television]] service provider for the [[Flanders]] region in [[Belgium]].

TV Vlaanderen's customers are mostly people living in [[Flanders]]. However, as TV Vlaanderen is officially available to the whole of Belgium, TV Vlaanderen also has many Flemish customers living in the French-speaking part of Belgium due to the unavailability of Dutch-language TV channels on [[Cable Television]] platform's in [[Wallonia]].

Like the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] satellite television provider [[CanalDigitaal]], TV Vlaanderen is owned by M7 Group S.A..

== History ==
Originally, TV Vlaanderen only offered a [[DVB-S2]] satellite television service, using the [[SES Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 19.2°E]] and at [[Astra 23.5°E]].

In 2017, it started a [[DVB-T2]] terrestrial service branded "Antenne TV", which uses the [[Norkring]] transmitter network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20171207_03230016 |title=TV Vlaanderen lanceert nieuw aanbod: 15 zenders voor 9,95 euro |date=7 December 2017 |publisher=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |language=Dutch |trans-title=TV Vlaanderen launches new offer: 15 channels for 9.95 euro }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.totaaltv.nl/nieuws/m7-gaat-in-belgie-op-dvbt2-uitzenden-met-tv-vlaanderen/ |title=M7 gaat in België op DVB-T2 uitzenden met TV Vlaanderen |author=Jan-Hein Visser |date=13 November 2017 |publisher=Totaal TV |language=Dutch |trans-title=M7 to start broadcasting DVB-T2 in Belgium with TV Vlaanderen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smart card ==
The Flemish public and commercial broadcasts are not freely available via satellite. To receive the Flemish broadcasts, a [[Smartcard]] is required to decipher the [[Mediaguard]] signal.

A standard [[DVB-S2]] receiver is used, which can also receive [[free-to-air]] broadcasts.

'''Takir''' ('''Takyr''') ({{lang-ru|Такыр}}, originally from [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] or another [[Turkic language]]) meaning "smooth, even, or bare", is a type of relief occurring in the deserts of [[Central Asia]], similar to a [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] in the southwestern United States.  A takyr is usually formed in a shallow depressed area with a heavy clay soil, which is submerged by water after seasonal rains. After the water evaporates, a dried [[soil crust|crust]] with fissures forms on the surface. The crust is often colonized by [[wiktionary:Filamentous|filamentous]] [[cyanobacteria]].

In the southwestern U.S. "takyrs" are known as "playas" or "salt flats", in Arab countries as "sabha".

'''''Tella''''' or '''''talla''''' ({{lang-om|farsoo}}, {{lang-ti|suwa}}, {{lang-gez|ሰዋ|translit=säwa}}) is a traditional [[beer]] from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. It is brewed from various grains, typically [[teff]] and [[sorghum]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Depending on region, [[barley]], [[wheat]], or [[maize]] may be used; spices can also be added.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Dried and ground [[Rhamnus prinoides|shiny-leaf buckthorn]] leaves are used for [[Ethanol fermentation#Alcoholic beverages|fermentation]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Due to the addition of bread and use of a fermentation vessel which has been smoked over dried olive wood or [[Abyssinian rose]] wood, tella may have a smoky flavour. The alcohol content of unfiltered Tella is usually around 2–4 Volume percent, filtered tella contains about 5–6 vol%.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Tella is often [[Homebrewing|home-brewed]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It may be offered in tella houses (''tellabet''), usually in regular homes, where people meet and talk to each other.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''''The Beginning and the End''''' (بداية ونهاية) is a novel by [[Naguib Mahfouz]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] in 1988. An [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], Naguib has been credited with modernizing Arabic literature, with his prolific writing style and his themes on [[existentialism]]. The novel is marked by very bold characterization, for the time period that the story is set in. The story moves at a prolific pace and tries to look at the world from each character's view point.

The novel is set in [[Cairo]] in the late 1930s and deals with the trials and tribulations of a [[middle class]] family in the suburbs of Cairo who are struggling to keep out of poverty, after the death of the father, the sole breadwinner.

The family comprises the mother, Samira; the eldest son, Hassan; a grown up daughter, Nefisa; and teenage sons Hussein and Hassanein. Hassan, the eldest son, leaves home and becomes a local goon managing a [[coffee house]]. His live-in relationship with a [[prostitute]] is ignored by the family so long as he is able to meet the demands of his brothers. The family does not approve of his relationship or his work. 

The daughter, Nefisa, starts out as a [[dressmaker]], turning a hobby into a full-time occupation, and - as she sees it -  degrading herself. Her faith in men takes a beating after her lover, the local grocer’s son, cheats her into sex and then marries another woman. Nefisa, the adored but plain daughter, can never get over this incident nor is able to control her sexual urges, turning her into a woman who sleeps with strangers. The money she earns from this is an added source of income. 

Hussein, the elder of the two teenagers, sacrifices his higher studies and any hope of a bright future to allow the youngest, Hassanein, to complete his education and join the War College, where education fees being exorbitant. The family gives in to this scheme, while knowing that Hassanein might not turn out to be the savior of the family once he gets a job. Hassanein is  a self-centered child, who does no harm to anyone, but sure to watch out for himself. When his amorous demands are turned down by his [[fiancée]], he lusts after women, always ready to take offense and cursing his fate. Hassanein believes that he was born into this world to lead a rich life without any troubles and it is the duty of each of his family members to put him ahead of their own interest.

The story contains hope since it begins with the knowledge that the children are grown-up, so there could be a way out of their poverty as soon as they get a job. However, Naguib has managed to weave the paralytic conditions destroying this hope at every milestone in each of the protagonists' lives. The description of the house and the building where they stay gives a [[claustrophobic]] feeling, which the reader hopes to escape with each character, again to move into a new and equally claustrophobic setting .

'''West Battery''' is an [[artillery battery]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].  It is situated on the escarpment of [[Windmill Hill, Gibraltar|Windmill Hill]] in the south of the territory.

The battery stands on the site of two emplacements originally constructed under General [[Edward Cornwallis]] between 1762–77. It takes its name from its position facing south-west. In the late 19th century it became (along with [[Buffadero Battery]] and [[Jews' Cemetery Battery]]) one of three batteries on or below Windmill Hill to be equipped with [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk I–VII|BL 9.2 inch gun Mk V]] guns, two of which were installed in 1886. These were upgraded to [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX–X|BL 9.2 inch gun Mk X]] guns in 1901, mounted on Mark V [[barbette]]s. They faced out towards the Mediterranean to cover naval traffic through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name="Hughes378" /&gt;

The 9.2-inch guns remained in service until 1950. They were subsequently replaced by three 5.25-inch dual-purpose guns for coastal and anti-aircraft defence. Although the guns have since been removed, the emplacements and the structure of the battery are still clearly visible.&lt;ref name="Hughes378"&gt;{{cite book|title=Strong as the Rock of Gibraltar|last1=Hughes|first1=Quentin|last2=Migos|first2=Athanassios|publisher=Exchange Publications|year=1995|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Sanskrit conference''' is an international conference organised at various locations globally. It has been held in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. The Delhi International Sanskrit Conference of 1972 is considered to be the first World Sanskrit Conference. So far it has been held in [[India]] four times (1972,1981,1997,2012).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanskritassociation.org/conferences.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:ANCIENT_SANSKRIT_ON_HEMP_BASED_PAPER._HEMP_WAS_A_COMMON_AND_DURABLE_FIBRE_IN_THE_PRODUCTION_OF_%22RAG%22_PAPER_FROM_200_BCE_TO_THE_1850_AD.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Sanskrit on Hemp based Paper. Hemp Fiber was commonly used in the production of paper from 200 BCE to the Late 1800's.]]
According to the official web-site of the [[International Association of Sanskrit Studies]] (IASS), several [[Sanskrit]] scholars from major Indian universities perceived that the International Congress of Orientalists "did not allow sufficient scope for full discussion of Sanskrit and allied subjects". These scholars approached the [[Government of India]], which arranged to convene the first International Sanskrit Conference at [[New Delhi]] in March 1972. The next year, at the 29th International Congress of Orientalists, Sanskrit scholars from all over the world got together to form the IASS. The main responsibility of the IASS was to organise World Sanskrit Conferences at various places around the world. The 1972 New Delhi conference was retrospectively recognised as the "First World Sanskrit Conference".&lt;ref name="IASS-20120412"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/IASS/HOME_page.htm|title=INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SANSKRIT STUDIES (IASS) |publisher=IASS |accessdate=12 April 2012|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixteenth conference in Thailand in 2015 received unprecedented support from the Indian government.&lt;ref name=ectimes24jun2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chaudhury |first1=Dipanjan Roy |last2=Venugopal |first2=Vasudha|title=Government to send 250 Sanskrit scholars to participate in World Sanskrit Conference in Thailand |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-24/news/63783144_1_indian-embassy-scholars-world-sanskrit-conference|accessdate=29 July 2015 |agency=[[The Economic Times]] |date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what some have called a "display of soft power", India sent a group of 250 Sanskrit scholars, led by [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|External Affairs Minister]] [[Sushma Swaraj]], who gave the inaugural address in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=ectimes24jun2015/&gt; The conference was also supported by and held in honor of [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]], Princess of Thailand, who has supported Sanskrit education, and had received a master's degree in [[Pali]] and Sanskrit from [[Chulalongkorn University]].&lt;ref name=princess30june/&gt;

== Controversies ==
Recent World Sanskrit Conferences have been sites of controversy.

# The 2015 conference in Bangkok was opened by Rajiv Malhotra, an author of popular books who does not hold a PhD in Indology or any related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/southasiamasala/2015/08/03/tigers-and-goats-a-quick-report-on-the-world-sanskrit-conference-bangkok-2015/|title=South Asia Masala » Tigers and Goats  A quick report on the World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok 2015|website=asiapacific.anu.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra has been accused of plagiarism and is well-known for his ad hominem attacks on Indologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/742022/upset-about-rajiv-malhotras-plagiarism-even-more-upset-about-distortions-of-my-work|title='Upset about Rajiv Malhotra’s plagiarism, even more upset about distortions of my work'|last=Nicholson|first=Andrew J.|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The 2018 conference in Vancouver featured a session titled "The Story of Our Sanskrit," where two female Sanskritists presented and a third female Sanskritist moderated.

'''Zonget''' is a [[Mansi people|Mansi]] [[Nature Goddess]].

Zonget was known as "mistress of herds", ruling over all birds, animals and the people that hunt them. Birds and animals would allow themselves to be trapped if she ordained it. [[Shamans]] of the hunting people still have to make offerings to her and make sure the creatures are treated with reverence or food supplies would cease. She appears to mortals in the form of a gray Arctic bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monaghan |first1=Patricia |title=The New Book of Goddesses &amp; Heroines |date=1997 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |isbn=9781567184655 |pages=324 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aUMNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Zonget+mansi+-wikipedia&amp;dq=Zonget+mansi+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2eukrrnbAhVIvrwKHXnyCPYQ6AEILTAB |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eason |first1=Cassandra |authorlink1=Cassandra Eason |title=Fabulous Creatures, Mythical Monsters, and Animal Power Symbols: A Handbook |date=2008 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9780275994259 |pages=2-3 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=s4AP30k4IFwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Zonget+goddess+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiysIK0r7nbAhUDv7wKHdsICg4Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Zonget%20goddess%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |quote=Zonget, it is believed, appears to mortals in the form of a gray Arctic bird.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
