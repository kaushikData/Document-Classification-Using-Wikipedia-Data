'''Advanced Placement Human Geography''' (also known as '''AP Human Geo''', '''AP Geography''', '''APHG''', '''AP HuGe''', '''HGAP''', '''AP HuGs''', '''APHUG''', '''AP HUMAN''', or '''High School Ap Human''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[social studies]] course that studies [[human geography]]. The test is administered by [[College Board]].

This college-level course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of [[Earth]]'s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analyses to analyze human social organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice.

== Exam ==
The AP Human Geography Exam consists of two sections. The first section consists of 75 [[multiple choice]] questions and the second section consists of 3 free-response questions. The sections are 60 and 75 minutes long, respectively. It is not necessary to answer the free-response questions in essay form; instead, points are awarded on certain key words, examples, and other vital aspects.

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-human-geography-course-description.pdf AP Human Geography:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Human Geography==
The curriculum consists of informational book-related homework, which often requires students to strive to learn information independently. The curriculum teaches about diffusion, human traits, religion, and population clusters.

'''Artistic license''' (also known as '''art license''', '''historical license''', '''dramatic license''', '''poetic license''', '''narrative license''', '''licentia poetica''', '''creative license''', or simply '''license''') is a colloquial term, sometimes a [[euphemism]], used to denote the distortion of fact, alteration of the conventions of [[grammar]] or language, or rewording of pre-existing text made by an [[artist]] in the name of [[art]].

==History==
The artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions, such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harvey, Thomas Wadleigh |year=2008 |title=A Practical Grammar of the English Language |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC. |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mark Antony]]'s "Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears" from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' would technically require the word "and" before "countrymen", but the conjunction "and" is omitted to preserve the rhythm of [[iambic pentameter]] (the resulting conjunction is called an [[Asyndeton|asyndetic]] [[tricolon]]). Conversely, on the next line, the end of "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him" has an extra syllable because omitting the word "him" would make the sentence unclear, but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herzberg, Max John |year=1933 |title=Off to Arcady: adventures in poetry |publisher=American book co. |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are examples of artistic license. 

Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object (for instance in a [[stylized painting|painting]] or an [[stylized animation|animated movie]]) are different from their real life counterparts, but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing. This can mean the omission of details, or the simplification of shapes and color shades, even to the point that the image is nothing more than a [[pictogram]]. It can also mean the addition of non-existing details, or exaggeration of shapes and colours, as in [[fantasy art]] or a [[caricature]].

Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable. A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface.

In summary, artistic license is:

* Entirely at the artist's discretion
* Intended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. "willing [[suspension of disbelief]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis, Tracy C. |year=2005 |title=Do you believe in fairies? The hiss of dramatic license |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gaps&lt;ref&gt;Goodsell, David S.; Johnson, Graham T. (2007). "Filling in the Gaps: Artistic License in Education and Outreach". ''PLoS Biol'' '''5''' (12). {{doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0050308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Used consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Esaak, Shelley |url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/artspeak_faqs/f/artisticlicense.htm |title=What is artistic license? |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic license==
Artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real-world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=D'sa, Benicia |year=2005 |title=Social Studies in the Dark: Using Docudramas to Teach History |journal=The Social Studies |volume=96 |number=1 |pages=9&amp;ndash;13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and other [[police procedural]] programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork, reports, administrative duties and other daily "business-oriented" aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work. They will also present other duties with much more action, suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality. The same is also true for many military-oriented adventure stories which often show high-ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality, they would usually be restricted to command-oriented and administrative duties.

==Controversy and criticism==
Artistic license often provokes [[controversy]] by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Toplin, Robert Brent |year=2002 |title=Reel history: in defense of Hollywood |publisher=University Press of Kansas |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on [[artistic merit]]. Artistic license is a generally accepted practice, particularly when the result is widely acclaimed. [[William Shakespeare]]'s historical plays, for example, are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barroll, J. Leeds |year=1975 |title=Shakespeare Studies: An Annual Gathering of Research, Criticism, Reviews |publisher=Ayer Publishing |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events. While slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted, some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible, particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality. Examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include Disney's ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', Oliver Stone's ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', the HBO series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', 20th Century Fox's ''[[The Greatest Showman]]'' and Showtime's ''[[The Tudors]]''. 

Writers adapting a work for another medium (e.g., a film screenplay from a book) often make significant changes, additions to, or omissions from the original plot in the book, on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film.&lt;ref&gt;''Film review'' (1999). Issues 14-16. Orpheus Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work.

Sample of Bak–Sneppen model evolution: on the ''x''-axis the population status, on the
''y''-axis (from top to the bottom) the history of the population. Each discontinuity
represents an evolution. The color codes the age of the species.]]

The '''Bak–Sneppen model''' is a simple model of [[co-evolution]] between interacting [[species]]. It was developed to show how [[self-organized criticality]] may explain key features of the [[fossil]] record, such as the distribution of sizes of [[extinction events]] and the phenomenon of [[punctuated equilibrium]]. It is named after [[Per Bak]] and Kim Sneppen.

The model dynamics repeatedly eliminates the least adapted species and mutates it and its neighbors to recreate the interaction between species. A comprehensive study of the details of this model can be found in [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v53/p414 ''Phys. Rev. E'' '''53''', 414–443 (1996)].   A solvable version of the model has been proposed in [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v76/p348 ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''76''', 348–351 (1996)], which [http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v54/p1082 shows] that the dynamics evolves sub-diffusively, driven by a long-range memory.

An evolutionary [[local search (optimization)|local search]] [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] based on the Bak–Sneppen model, called [[extremal optimization]], has been introduced in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TYF-40XGW6J-9&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2000&amp;_rdoc=9&amp;_fmt=summary&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=%23toc%235617%232000%23998809998%23205975!&amp;_cdi=5617&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=83eeb321ed5935b0dedda16f87ab1788 ''Artificial Intelligence'' '''119''', 275–286 (2000).] The Bak–Sneppen model has been applied to the theory of scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Langhe|first1=Rogier|title=A comparison of two models of scientific progress|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science|date=2014|volume=46|pages=94–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

We consider ''N'' species, which are associated with a '''[[fitness (biology)|fitness]]''' factor ''f''(''i''). They are indexed by integers ''i'' around a ring. The algorithm consists in choosing the least fit species, and then replacing it and its two closest neighbors (previous and next integer) by new species, with a new random fitness. After a long run there will be a minimum required fitness, below which species don't survive. These "long-run" events are referred to as avalanches, and the model proceeds through these avalanches until it reaches a state of relative stability where all species' fitness are above a certain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;Wei1, Li; Yang, Luo; YuanFang, Wang &amp; AiPing, Cai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30800">The '''British National Corpus''' ('''BNC''') is a 100-million-word [[text corpus]] of samples of written and spoken [[English language|English]] from a wide range of sources.&lt;ref name="BurnardAston1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|last2=Aston|first2=Guy|title=The BNC handbook: exploring the British National Corpus|year=1998|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-7486-1055-3|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpus covers [[British English]] of the late 20th century from a wide variety of [[genre]]s, with the intention that it be a representative sample of spoken and written British English of that time.

==History==
The project to create the BNC involved the collaboration of three publishers (with the [[Oxford University Press]] as the lead collaborator, [[Longman]] and [[W. &amp; R. Chambers]]), two universities (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University]]), and the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="LeechGarsideBryant1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Garside|first2=Roger|last3=Bryant|first3=Michael|title=The large-scale grammatical tagging of text: Experience with the British National Corpus|editor= N. Oostdjik &amp; P. Haan |chapter= Corpus-based research into language: in honour of Jan Aarts|year=1994|publisher=Rodopi Publishers|location=Netherlands|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the BNC started in 1991 under the management of the BNC consortium, and the project was finished by 1994. There have been no additions of new samples after 1994, but the BNC underwent slight revisions before the release of the second edition BNC World (2001) and the third edition BNC XML Edition (2007).&lt;ref name="natcorp"&gt;[http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml ''What is the BNC?'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC was the vision of computational linguists whose goal was a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of modern (at the time of building the corpus), naturally occurring [[language]] in the form of [[speech]] and text or [[writing]] that could be analyzed by a computer. Hence, it was compiled as a general corpus to pave the way for automatic search and processing in the field of [[corpus linguistics]]. One of the ways the BNC was to be differentiated from existing corpora at that time was to open up the data not just to academic research, but also to commercial and educational uses.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leech|first=Geoffrey|title=100 million words of English|journal=English Today|year=1993|volume=9|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1017/S0266078400006854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corpus was restricted to just [[British English]], and was not extended to cover [[World Englishes]].  This was partly because a significant portion of the cost of the project was being funded by the British government which was logically interested in supporting documentation of its own [[linguistic variety]].&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt; Because of its potentially unprecedented size, the BNC required funds from the commercial and academic institutions as well. In turn, BNC [[data]] then became available for commercial and academic research.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt;

==Description==
The BNC is a monolingual corpus, as it records samples of [[language]] use in [[British English]] only, although occasionally words and phrases from other languages may also be present. It is a [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic]] corpus, as only [[language]] use from the late 20th century is represented; the BNC is not meant to be a historical record of the development of [[British English]] over the ages.&lt;ref name="natcorp"/&gt; From the beginning, those involved in the gathering of written data sought to make the BNC a balanced corpus, and hence looked for data in various mediums.&lt;ref name="geoffreyleech1993" /&gt;

===Components and content===
[[File:British National Corpus structure.svg|thumb|right|upright=3.1|BNC structure]]
90% of the BNC is samples of ''[[written language|written corpus]]'' use. These samples were extracted from regional and national newspapers, published research journals or periodicals from various academic fields, fiction and non-fiction books, other published material, and unpublished material such as leaflets, brochures, letters, essays written by students of differing academic levels, speeches, scripts, and many other types of texts.&lt;ref name="gloriacappelli"&gt;[http://www.gloriacappelli.it/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/bnc.pdf ''British National Corpus'']. Retrieved 12 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 10% of the BNC is samples of [[spoken language]] use. These are presented and recorded in the form of orthographic transcriptions. The ''spoken corpus'' consists of two parts: one part is [[demographic]], containing the transcriptions of spontaneous natural [[conversation]]s produced by volunteers of various age groups, social classes and originating from different regions. These conversations were produced in different situations, including formal business or government meetings to conversations on radio shows and phone-ins.&lt;ref name="gloriacappelli"/&gt; These were to account for both the demographic distribution of spoken language and those of linguistically significant variation due to context.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The other part involves context-governed samples such as transcriptions of recordings made at specific types of meeting and event. All the original recordings transcribed for inclusion in the BNC have been deposited at the [[British Library Sound Archive]]. The majority of the recordings are freely available from the [[Oxford University Phonetics Lab]]oratory.

===Sub-corpora and tagging===
Two sub-corpora (subsets of the BNC data) have been released: BNC Baby and BNC Sampler. Both these sub-corpora may be ordered online via the BNC webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Products|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/index.xml?ID=products|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BNC Baby is a sub-corpus of BNC that consists of four sets of samples, each containing one million words tagged as they are in BNC itself. The words in each sample set correspond to a specific [[genre]] label. One sample set contains spoken conversation and the other three sample sets contain written text: [[academic writing]], [[fiction]] and [[newspapers]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2003|title=Reference Guide for BNC-baby|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/oldBabyDocs/index.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest (third) edition has been released and comes in XML format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New edition of BNC Baby available|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/news.xml?ID=baby2|accessdate=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNC Sampler is a two-part sub-corpora, a part each for written and spoken data; each part contains one million words. The BNC Sampler was originally used in a project to work out how to improve the tagging process for the BNC, which eventually led to the BNC World edition. Throughout the project, the BNC Sampler was improved with increasing expertise and knowledge for tagging to arrive at its current form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BNC Sampler: XML edition|year=2008|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/corpus/sampler/sampler.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNC corpus has been tagged for grammatical information ([[part of speech]]). The tagging system, named CLAWS, went through improvements to yield the latest CLAWS4 system, which is used for tagging the BNC. CLAWS1 was based on a [[hidden Markov model]] and, when employed in automatic tagging, managed to successfully tag 96% to 97% of each text analyzed. CLAWS1 was upgraded to CLAWS2 by removing the need for manual processing to prepare the texts for automatic tagging. The latest version, CLAWS4, includes improvements such as more powerful [[word-sense disambiguation]] (WSD) abilities, and the ability to deal with variation in [[orthography]] and [[markup language]]. Later work on the tagging system looked at increasing the success rates in automatic tagging and reducing the work needed for manual processing, while maintaining effectiveness and efficiency by introducing software to replace some of the manual work.&lt;ref name=LeechGarsideBryant1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name=2leechgarsidebryant1994&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Garside|first2=Roger|last3=Bryant|first3=Michael|year=1994|title=Claws4: The Tagging Of The British National Corpus|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/versions;jsessionid=75B37141A35CA4F8D290BE74B0CB4D5E?doi=10.1.1.13.3622|publisher=Paper given at COLING'94, Lancaster: UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a new program called the "Template Tagger" was introduced for a corrective function. Tags indicating ambiguity were later added. Manual tagging is still necessary, as CLAWS4 is still unable to deal with foreign words.&lt;ref name="leechsmith2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=The British National Corpus (Version 2) with Improved Word-class Tagging|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2leechsmith2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leech|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Smith|first2=Nicholas|year=2000|title=Automatic POS-Tagging of the Corpus|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/bnc2/bnc2postag_manual.htm|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TEI and access===
The corpus is marked up following the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) and includes full linguistic [[annotation]] and contextual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=1995|title=Users Reference Guide for the British National Corpus|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~csc264/teaching/NLP/practicals/bnc-doc.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence for the CLAWS4 part-of-speech tagger may be purchased to use the tagger.&lt;ref name="purchase"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining a license for the CLAWS tagger|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/purchase.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a tagging service is offered at [[Lancaster University]].&lt;ref name=service&gt;{{cite web|title=The CLAWS tagging service|url=http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/tagservice.html|publisher=UCREL, Lancaster University, UK|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNC itself may be ordered with either a personal or institutional license. The edition available is the BNC [[XML]] edition and it comes with the [[Xaira]] search engine software. Ordering may be carried out via the BNC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to order|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/getting/index.xml?ID=order|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online [[corpus manager]], BNCweb, has been developed for the BNC XML edition. The interface is designed to be easy to use, and the program offers query features and functions for corpus analysis. Users can retrieve results and data from searches and analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Sebastian|last2=Evert|first2=Stefan|year=2008|title=Corpus linguistics with BNCweb: a practical guide|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-631-56315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permission issues==
The BNC was the first [[text corpus]] of its size to be made widely available. This could be attributed to the standard forms of agreement, between rights owners and the Consortium on the one hand, and between corpus users and the Consortium on the other. [[Intellectual property rights]] owners were sought for their agreement with the standard licence, including willingness to incorporate their materials in the corpus without any fees. This arrangement may have been facilitated by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated with the project. However, it was a challenge to keep the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely removed; the alternative solution of substituting the identity of a contributor with a different name was discussed, but not considered feasible.&lt;ref name=Burnard&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnard|first=Lou|year=2002|title=Where did we go wrong? A retrospective look at the British National Corpus|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~lou/wip/silfitalk.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, contributors had earlier been asked only to incorporate transcribed versions of their [[speech]] and not the [[speech]] itself. While permission could be sought from initial contributors again, the lack of success in the anonymization process meant that it would be challenging to seek materials from initial contributors. At the same time, two factors compounded the unwillingness of rights owners to donate their materials: full texts were to be excluded, and there was no motivation for them to disseminate information using the corpus, particularly since the corpus operates on a non-commercial basis.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

==Problems and limitations==

===Categories===
By 2001, the BNC still had no text categorisation for written texts beyond that of domain, and no categorisation for spoken texts except by context and [[demographic]] or [[socio-economic]] classes. For example, a wide variety of imaginative texts ([[novels]], [[short stories]], [[poems]], and drama scripts) were included in the BNC, but such inclusions were deemed useless as researchers were unable to easily retrieve the [[subgenres]] on which they wanted to work (e.g., poetry).  Because this [[metadata]] was omitted in the file headers and in all BNC documentation, there was no way to know whether an "imaginative" text actually came from a novel, a short story, a drama script or a collection of poems unless the title actually included words such as  "novel" or "poem").&lt;ref name=Lee2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|year=2001|title=GENRES, REGISTERS, TEXT TYPES, DOMAINS, AND STYLES|url=http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/pdf/lee.pdf|pages=37–72|volume=5|issue=3|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 2002 introduction of a new version, the BNC World Edition, BNC attempted to deal with this problem. Besides domain, there are now 70 categories for genre for both spoken and written data, and so researchers can now specifically retrieve texts by genre. Even after these additions, however, implementation is still tricky, as assigning a genre or subgenre to a text is not straightforward. The divisions are less clear for spoken data than they are for written data, as there was more variation in topic and execution. Also, there will always be possible subsets of genres of each subgenre.  How far genres are subdivided is pre-determined for the sake of a default, but researchers have the option of making the divisions more general or specific according to their needs. Categorisation is also a problem, as certain texts, while deemed to belong to an interdisciplinary genre such as linguistics, include content that is subsequently categorised into either arts or science categories due to the nature of their content.&lt;ref name=davidlee2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=David|year=2002|title=NOTES TO ACCOMPANY THE BNC WORLD EDITION (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL) INDEX|url=http://pezik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BNCWIndexNotes.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923082536/http://pezik.pl/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BNCWIndexNotes.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and discourse===
Some texts were classified under the wrong category, usually because of a misleading title. Users cannot always rely on the titles of the files as indications of their real content: For example, many texts with "lecture" in their title are actually classroom discussions or tutorial seminars involving a very small group of people, or were popular lectures (addressed to a general audience rather than to students at an institution of higher learning).&lt;ref name=Lee2001 /&gt; One reason is that genre and subgenre labels can only be assigned for the majority of the texts in a category. There are subgenres within genres, and for each text the content may not be uniform throughout and may span multiple  subgenres.&lt;ref name=davidlee2002 /&gt; Also, production pressures coupled with insufficient information led to hasty decisions, resulting in inaccuracy and inconsistency in records.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt;

The proportion of written to spoken material in the BNC is 10:1, making spoken material under-represented. This is because the cost of collecting and transcribing one million words of naturally occurring speech is at least 10 times higher than the cost of adding another million words of newspaper text. Some linguists have argued that this represents a deficiency in the corpus, since speech and writing are both equally important in a language.&lt;ref name=Burnard /&gt; The BNC is not ideal for the study of many features of spoken discourse, since most of its transcripts are [[Orthography|orthographic]]. [[Paralinguistic]] features are only roughly indicated.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aston|first=Guy,|year=1998|title=Learning English with the British National Corpus|url=http://www.sslmit.unibo.it/~guy/barc.htm|publisher=Paper given at 6th Jornada de Corpus, Barcelona: UPF|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations and misappropriates===
Despite being an excellent source of [[lexicon|lexical]] information, the BNC can only really be used to study a limited set of grammatical patterns, particularly those which have distinctive lexical correlates.  While it is easy enough to find all the occurrences of "enjoy", and to sort them according to the [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] category of the following word, it requires additional work to find all cases of verbs followed by a [[gerund]], since the SARA index of the BNC does not include [[Part of speech|part-of-speech]] categories such as "all verbs" or "all V-ing forms".&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Some lexical correlates are also too ambiguous to allow them to be used in queries: any search for restrictive [[English relative clauses|relative clauses]] would provide the user with irrelevant data, given the number of other uses of wh-[[pronoun]]s and of that in the language (not to mention the impossibility of identifying relative clauses with pronoun deletion, as in "the man I saw").  Particular [[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Pragmatics|pragmatic]] categories (doubt, cognisance, disagreements, summaries, etc.) are difficult to locate for the same reason. This means, for example, that while one can compare speech by men and by women, one cannot compare speech ''to'' women and ''to'' men.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

The nature of the BNC as a large mixed corpus renders it unsuitable for the study of highly specific text-types or genres, as any one of them is likely to be inadequately represented and may not be recognisable from the encoding. For example, there are very few business letters and service encounters in the BNC, and those wishing to explore their specific conventions would do better to compile a small corpus including only texts of those types.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

==Uses==

===English language education===
There are two general ways in which corpus material can be used in language teaching.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Firstly, publishers and researchers could use corpus samples to create language-learning references, syllabuses and other related tools or materials. For example, the BNC was used by a group of Japanese researchers as a tool in their creation of an English-language&amp;ndash;learning website for learners of [[English for specific purposes]] (ESP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minn|first=Danny |author2=Sano, Hiroshi |author3=Ino, Marie |author4=Nakamura, Takahiro |title=Using the BNC to create and develop educational materials and a website for learners of English|journal=ICAME Journal|year=2005|volume=29|pages=99–113|url=http://icame.uib.no/ij29/ij29-page99-114.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website enabled English-language learners to download frequently heard and used sentence patterns, and then base their own usage of the English language on these sentence patterns. The BNC served as the source from which the frequently used expressions were extracted. In using this website, users thus relied on reference samples from the BNC to guide them in their learning of the English language. Such creation of materials that facilitate language-learning typically involves the use of very large corpora (comparable to the size of the BNC), as well as advanced software and technology. A large amount of money, time, and expertise in the field of [[computational linguistics]] are invested in the development of such language-learning material.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

Secondly, the analysis of the corpus can be incorporated directly into the language teaching and learning environment. With this method, language learners are given the opportunity to categorize language data from the corpus and subsequently form conclusions about the patterns and features of their target language from their categorizations. This method involves a greater amount of work on the part of the language leaner and is referred to as “data-driven learning” by Tim Johns. The corpus data used for data-driven learning is relatively smaller, and consequently the generalisations made about the target language may be of limited value.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt; In general, the BNC is useful as a reference source for the purposes of producing and perceiving text. The BNC can be used as a [[reference]] source when studying the use of individual words in various contexts, so that learners become familiar with the different ways to use particular words in suitable contexts.&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt; Other than language-related information, encyclopedic information is also found in the BNC. Learners perusing data from the BNC are also introduced to British cultural features and [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Aston BNC" /&gt;

===Bilingual dictionaries, tests and evaluation===
The BNC was the source of more than 12,000 words and phrases used for the production of a range of [[bilingual dictionaries]] in India in 2012, translating 22 local languages into English. This was part of a larger movement to push for improvements in education, the preservation of India's [[vernacular languages]], and the development of [[translation]] work.&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bilingual dictionaries to promote India’s mother tongues|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/featuredetail.asp?fid=120|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Times of Oman|date=14 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231004202/http://www.timesofoman.com/featuredetail.asp?fid=120|archive-date=2010-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large size of the BNC provides a large-scale resource on which to test programs.&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web|title=What can I do with the BNC?|url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/using/index.xml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used as a test bed for the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) guidelines. The BNC has also been used to provide 20 million words to evaluate English subcategorization acquisition systems for the [[Senseval]] initiative for computational analysis of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korhonen|first=Anna|year=2002|title=EVALUATION RESOURCES for English Subcategorization Acquisition Systems|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/subcat/subcat.html|accessdate=18 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213052323/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/subcat/subcat.html|archive-date=2012-12-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

==== Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus ====
Hoffman &amp; Lehmann (2000) explored the mechanisms behind speakers' ability to manipulate their large inventory of [[collocation]]s which are ready for use and can be easily expanded grammatically or syntactically to adapt to the current speech situation. Word combinations occurring in low frequency were extracted from the BNC to offer some insight into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lijcg3vt9yAC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=WSFAIABcSr&amp;pg=PA17&amp;q=%22Collocational%20Evidence%20from%20the%20British%20National%20Corpus%22|title=Corpora Galore: Analyses and Techniques in Describing English|last=Hoffman|first=Sebastian|last2=Lehmann|first2=Hans Martin|publisher=Rodopi|year=2000|isbn=9789042004191|editor-last=Kirk|editor-first=John M.|location=Amsterdam|pages=|chapter=Collocational Evidence from the British National Corpus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collocational behaviour of man and woman ====
Pearce (2008) examined the representation of men and women in this corpus by using [[Sketch Engine]]. The corpus query tool was used to explore grammatical behaviour of the noun [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] "man" and "woman" (i.e., the nouns "man"/"men" and "woman"/"women").&lt;ref name="icb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Michael|title=Investigating the collocational behaviour of MAN and WOMAN in the BNC using Sketch Engine|journal=Corpora|date=Nov 2008|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–29|doi=10.3366/E174950320800004X|url=http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627053051/http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/960/1/nsu-pap.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students ====
Lee &amp; Swales (2006) designed an experimental course in corpus-informed English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for doctoral students at the English Language Institute (ELI) of the University of Michigan in the US.&lt;ref name="eap"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=David|author2=John Swales|title=A corpus-based EAP course for NNS doctoral students: Moving from available specialized corpora to self-compiled corpora|journal=English for Specific Purposes|year=2006|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–75|doi=10.1016/j.esp.2005.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants used three main corpora as the basis of their investigations: Hyland's Research Article Corpus, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE), and academic texts from the BNC.&lt;ref name="eap" /&gt;

== Future work ==
=== Morphological processing ===
As part of ongoing work on morphological processing, a key area of [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP), data from the BNC was used to test the accuracy, reliability and swiftness of computational tools developed to facilitate the analysis and processing of morphological markers in [[British English]].&lt;ref name="Minnen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minnen|first=Guido |author2=Carroll, John |author3=Pearce, Darren |title=Applied Morphological Processing of English|journal=Natural Language Engineering|year=2001|volume=7 | issue = 3|pages=207–223|doi=10.1017/s1351324901002728|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/1213/1/minnen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The computational tools involved a program that enabled the analysis of [[inflectional morphology]] in British English (known as an analyser) and a program that generated morphological markings based on the analysis from the analyser. Data from the BNC was also used to build up an extensive  repository of information about British English morphological markers. In particular, approximately 1,100 lemmas were extracted from the BNC and compiled into a checklist which was consulted by the morphological generator before [[verbs]] that allowed consonant doubling were accurately inflected.&lt;ref name="Minnen" /&gt; Since the BNC represents a recognizable effort to collect and subsequently process such a large amount of data, it has become an influential forerunner in the field and a model or exemplary corpus on which the development of later corpora was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Čermák|first=František|title=Today's Corpus Linguistics: Some Open Questions|journal=International Journal of Corpus Linguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=265–282|doi=10.1075/ijcl.7.2.06cer}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 March 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">[[Image:Ring_Cairn.jpg|thumb|right|Ring-type cairn at Balnauran of Clava]]
The '''Clava cairn''' is a type of [[Bronze Age]] circular [[chamber tomb]] [[cairn]], named after the group of three cairns at '''Balnuaran of Clava''', to the east of [[Inverness]] in [[Scotland]]. There are about 50 cairns of this type in an area round about Inverness. They fall into two sub-types, one typically consisting of a [[corbel]]led [[passage grave]] with a single burial chamber linked to the entrance by a short passage and covered with a cairn of stones, with the entrances oriented south west towards midwinter sunset. In the other sub-type an annular [[ring cairn]] encloses an apparently unroofed area with no formal means of access from the outside. In both sub-types a [[stone circle]] surrounds the whole tomb and a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]] often runs around the cairn. The heights of the standing stones vary in height so that the tallest fringe the entrance (oriented south west) and the shortest are directly opposite it.

Where Clava-type tombs have still contained burial remains, only one or two bodies appear to have been buried in each, and the lack of access to the second sub-type suggests that there was no intention of re-visiting the dead or communally adding future burials as had been the case with [[Neolithic]] cairn tombs.

== Balnuaran of Clava ==
[[Image:Stones_and_Cairn.jpg|thumb|left|Clava cairns at Balnuaran of Clava]]
At '''Balnuaran of Clava''' itself there is a group of three [[Bronze Age]] cairns which lie close together in a line running north east to south west. The tombs at either end are of the [[passage grave]] sub-type. The central cairn is of the ring cairn sub-type, and uniquely has stone paths or causeways forming "''rays''" radiating out from the platform round the kerbs to three of the standing stones. The cairns incorporate [[cup and ring mark]] stones, carved before they were built into the structures. The kerb stones are graded in size and selected for colour, so that the stones are larger and redder to the south west, and smaller and whiter to the north east. All these elements seem to have been constructed as one operation and indicate a complex design rather than ''ad hoc'' additions.

[[Image:Cup_Marks_Cairn.jpg|thumb|right|Cup marks on the northern cairn at Balnuaran of Clava]]
The ring round the northern ''Balnuaran of Clava'' cairn was measured and analysed by Professor [[Alexander Thom]]. He found that the ring was slightly egg-shaped with a complex geometry of circles and ellipses which could be set out around a central triangle, using sizes which are close to whole multiples of what he called the [[Megalithic yard]]. While the geometry of the shape is generally accepted, the ''Megalithic Yard'' is more controversial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27591">'''Cloud robotics''' is a field of [[robotics]] that attempts to invoke cloud technologies such as [[cloud computing]], [[cloud storage]], and other [[Internet technologies]] centred on the benefits of converged infrastructure and shared services for robotics. When connected to the cloud, robots can benefit from the powerful computation, storage, and communication resources of modern [[data center]] in the cloud, which can process and share information from various robots or agent (other machines, smart objects, humans, etc.). Humans can also delegate tasks to robots remotely through [[network (computing)|network]]s. Cloud computing technologies enable robot systems to be endowed with powerful capability whilst reducing costs through cloud technologies. Thus, it is possible to build lightweight, low cost, smarter robots have intelligent "brain" in the cloud. The "brain" consists of [[data center]], [[knowledge base]], task planners, [[deep learning]], information processing, environment models, communication support, etc.&lt;ref name=RASrobot&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation A special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase/special-issues/special-issue-on-cloud-robotics-and-automation|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RoboEarth|url=http://roboearth.org/cloud_robotics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kengoldberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Ken|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/cloud-robotics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sites.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=R|title=Cloud Robotics-Enable cloud computing for robots|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ruijiaoli/blogs/page|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
A cloud for robots potentially has at least six significant components:&lt;ref name=cloudsurvey&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kehoe|first1=Ben|last2=Patil|first2=Sachin|last3=[[Pieter Abbeel|Abbeel]]|first3=Pieter|last4=Goldberg|first4=Ken|title=A Survey of Research on Cloud Robotics and Automation|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering|date=13 September 2014|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/pubs/2015-T-ASE-Cloud-Robotics-Survey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Offering a global library of images, maps, and object data, often with geometry and mechanical properties, expert system, knowledge base (i.e. semantic web, data centres)；
* Massively-parallel computation on demand for sample-based statistical modelling and motion planning, task planning, multi-robot collaboration, scheduling and coordination of system；
* Robot sharing of outcomes, trajectories, and dynamic control policies and robot learning support；
* Human sharing of "open-source" code, data, and designs for programming, experimentation, and hardware construction；
* On-demand human guidance and assistance for evaluation, learning, and error recovery;
* Augmented [[human–robot interaction]] through various way (Semantics knowledge base, Apple SIRI like service etc.).

== Applications ==
;Autonomous [[mobile robot]]s: [[Google driverless car|Google's self-driving cars]] are cloud robots. The cars use the network to access Google's enormous database of maps and satellite and environment model (like Streetview) and combines it with streaming data from GPS, cameras, and 3D sensors to monitor its own position within centimetres, and with past and current traffic patterns to avoid collisions. Each car can learn something about environments, roads, or driving, or conditions, and it sends the information to the Google cloud, where it can be used to improve the performance of other cars.
;Cloud [[medical robot]]s: a medical cloud (also called a healthcare cluster) consists of various services such as a disease archive, electronic medical records, a patient health management system, practice services, analytics services, clinic solutions, expert systems, etc. A robot can connect to the cloud to provide clinical service to patients, as well as deliver assistance to doctors (e.g. a co-surgery robot). Moreover, it also provides a collaboration service by sharing information between doctors and care givers about clinical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of Cloud Computing on Healthcare|url=http://www.cloudstandardscustomercouncil.org/cscchealthcare110512.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Assistive robots: A [[domestic robot]] can be employed for healthcare and life monitoring for elderly people. The system collects the health status of users and exchange information with cloud expert system or doctors to facilitate elderly peoples life, especially for those with chronic diseases. For example, the robots are able to provide support to prevent the elderly from falling down, emergency healthy support such as heart disease, blooding disease. Care givers of elderly people can also get notification when in emergency from the robot through network.&lt;ref name=smc&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Ruijiao|last2=Hu|first2=Huosheng|title=Towards ROS Based Multi-robot Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living|journal=Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), 2013 IEEE International Conference on|date=16 October 2013|pages=3458–3463|doi=10.1109/SMC.2013.590}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Industrial robot]]s: As highlighted by the German government's [[Industry 4.0]] Plan, "Industry is on the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution. Driven by the Internet, the real and virtual worlds are growing closer and closer together to form the Internet of Things. Industrial production of the future will be characterised by the strong individualisation of products under the conditions of highly flexible (large series) production, the extensive integration of customers and business partners in business and value-added processes, and the linking of production and high-quality services leading to so-called hybrid products." &lt;ref name=ind4.0&gt;{{cite web|title=Project of the Future: Industry 4.0|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/19955.php|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In manufacturing, such cloud based robot systems could learn to handle tasks such as threading wires or cables, or aligning gaskets from a professional knowledge base. A group of robots can share information for some collaborative tasks. Even more, a consumer is able to place customised product orders to manufacturing robots directly with online ordering systems.&lt;ref name=rcrush&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaSelle|first1=Rush|title=Automation in the Cloud|url=http://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-Industry-Insights/Automation-in-the-Cloud/content_id/2826|publisher=Robotic Industries Association|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential paradigm is shopping-delivery robot systems.

== Research  ==
'''[[RoboEarth]]''' &lt;ref name=roboearth&gt;{{cite web|title=roboearth|url=http://roboearth.org|website=|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development projects, specifically to explore the field of cloud robotics. The goal of RoboEarth is to allow robotic systems to benefit from the experience of other robots, paving the way for rapid advances in machine cognition and behaviour, and ultimately, for more subtle and sophisticated human-machine interaction.  RoboEarth offers a Cloud Robotics infrastructure. RoboEarth’s World-Wide-Web style database stores knowledge generated by humans – and robots – in a machine-readable format. Data stored in the RoboEarth knowledge base include software components, maps for navigation (e.g., object locations, world models), task knowledge (e.g., action recipes, manipulation strategies), and object recognition models (e.g., images, object models).  The RoboEarth Cloud Engine includes support for mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, and drones, which require lots of computation for navigation.&lt;ref name=robieee&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waibel|first1=M|last2=Tenorth|first2=M|last3=D'Andrea|first3=R|title=RoboEarth|journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine|volume=18|issue=2|pages=69–82|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5876227&amp;tag=1|doi=10.1109/MRA.2011.941632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rapyuta]]''' &lt;ref name=rapyuta&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapyuta|url=http://rapyuta.org/welcome|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source cloud robotics framework based on RoboEarth Engine developed by the robotics researcher at ETHZ. Within the framework, each robot connected to Rapyuta can have a secured computing environment (rectangular boxes) giving them the ability to move their heavy computation into the cloud. In addition, the computing environments are tightly interconnected with each other and have a high bandwidth connection to the RoboEarth knowledge repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunziker|first1=D|last2=D'Andrea|first2=R|last3=Gajamohan|first3=M|last4=Waibel|first4=M|title=Rapyuta: The RoboEarth Cloud Engine|journal=Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2013 IEEE International Conference on|date=May 2013|pages=438–444|doi=10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630612|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6630612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[KnowRob]]''' &lt;ref name=knowrob&gt;{{cite web|title=KnowRob|url=http://ias.in.tum.de/research/knowledge|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extensional project of RoboEarth. It is a knowledge processing system that combines knowledge representation and reasoning methods with techniques for acquiring knowledge and for grounding the knowledge in a physical system and can serve as a common semantic framework for integrating information from different sources.

'''[[RoboBrain]]''' &lt;ref name=robobrain&gt;{{cite web|title=RoboBrain Project|url=http://robobrain.me|website=|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a large-scale computational system that learns from publicly available Internet resources, computer simulations, and real-life robot trials. It accumulates everything robotics into a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base. Applications include prototyping for robotics research, household robots, and self-driving cars. The goal is as direct as the project's name—to create a centralised, always-online brain for robots to tap into. The project is dominated by Stanford University and Cornel University. And the project is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the National Robotics Initiative, whose goal is to advance robotics to help make the United States more competitive in the world economy.&lt;ref name=robocornel&gt;{{cite web|title=Robo Brain' mines the Internet to teach robots|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/08/robo-brain-mines-internet-teach-robots}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With socialising, collaborating and sharing, robots can benefit from those interactions too by sharing their sensor information giving insight on their perspective of their current state.

'''[[COALAS]]''' &lt;ref name=coalas&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hu|first1=Huosheng|last2=McDonald-Maier|first2=Klaus D|last3=Gu|first3=Dongbing|last4=Li|first4=Ruijiao|title=COLAS|url=http://coalas-project.eu/indexen.php?p=team|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is funded by the INTERREG IVA France (Channel) – England European cross-border co-operation programme. The project aims to develop new technologies for handicapped people through social and technological innovation and through the users' social and psychological integrity. Objectives is to produce a cognitive ambient assistive living system with Healthcare cluster in cloud with domestic service robots like humanoid, intelligent wheelchair which connect with the cloud.&lt;ref name="smc"/&gt;

'''[[Robot Operating System|ROS]]''' (Robot Operating System) provides an eco-system to support cloud robotics. ROS is a flexible and distributed framework for robot software development. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviour across a wide variety of robotic platforms. A library for ROS that is a pure Java implementation, called rosjava, allows Android applications to be developed for robots. Since Android has a booming market and billion users, it would be significant in the field of Cloud Robotics.&lt;ref name=rosjava&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSjava-Cloud Robotics|url=http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[http://www.c2ro.com C2RO]''' (C2RO Cloud Robotics) is a platform that processes real-time applications such as collision avoidance and object recognition in the cloud. Previously, high latency times prevented these applications from being processed in the cloud thus requiring on-system computational hardware (e.g. Graphics Processing Unit or GPU). C2RO published a peer-reviewed paper at IEEE PIMRC17 showing its platform could make autonomous navigation and other AI services available on robots- even those with limited computational hardware (e.g. a Raspberry Pi)- from the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C2RO Cloud Robotics|date=2017-10-18|title=Real-Time Cloud Robotics in Practical Smart City Applications|url=https://www.slideshare.net/c2ro/realtime-cloud-robotics-in-practical-smart-city-applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; C2RO eventually claimed to be the first platform to demonstrate cloud-based [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|SLAM]] (simultaneous localization and mapping) at RoboBusiness in September 2017.

'''[https://noos.cloud Noos]''' is a cloud robotics service, providing centralised intelligence to robots that are connected to it. The service went live in December 2017. By using the Noos-API, developers could access services for computer vision, deep learning, and SLAM. Noos was developed and maintained by '''[http://robotics.ortelio.co.uk Ortelio Ltd]'''.

== Limitations of cloud robotics ==
Though robots can benefit from various advantages of cloud computing, cloud is not the solution to all of robotics.&lt;ref name=roadmap&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robotics-vo|title=A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics From Internet to Robotics 2013 Edition|url=https://robotics-vo.us/sites/default/files/2013%20Robotics%20Roadmap-rs.pdf|website=|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Controlling a robot’s motion which relies heavily on ([[real-time computing|real-time]]) sensors and feedback of controller may not benefit much from the cloud.
* Tasks that involve real-time execution require on-board processing.
* Cloud-based applications can get slow or unavailable due to high-latency responses or network hitch. If a robot relies too much on the cloud, a fault in the network could leave it “brainless.”

== Challenges ==
The research and development of cloud robotics has following potential issues and challenges:&lt;ref name="roadmap"/&gt;

*[[scalability|Scalable]] [[parallelisation]]-[[grid-computing]], parallelisation schemes scale with the size of automation infrastructure.
*Effective [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]: Balancing operations between local and cloud computation.
*[[Knowledge base]]s and [[knowledge representation|representations]]
*[[Collective learning]] for automation in cloud
*Infrastructure/Platform or [[Software as a Service]]
*[[Internet of Things]] for robotics
*Integrated and collaborative [[fault-tolerant]] control
*[[Big Data]]: Data, collected and/or disseminated over large, accessible networks can enable decisions for classification problems or reveal patterns.
*[[Wireless communication]], Connectivity to the cloud
*System architectures of robot cloud
*[[Open-source]], [[open-access]] infrastructures
* [[Load balancing (computing)|Workload-sharing]]
* Standards and Protocols

== Risks ==
'''Environmental security''' - The concentration of computing resources and users in a cloud computing environment also represents a concentration of security threats. Because of their size and significance,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=https://artificial-future.com/cloud-robotics/| title=Linking of cloud robotics to server }}&lt;/ref&gt; cloud environments are often targeted by virtual machines and bot malware, brute force attacks, and other attacks.

'''[[Information privacy|Data privacy]] and security''' - Hosting confidential data with cloud service providers involves the transfer of a considerable amount of an organisation's control over data security to the provider. For example, every cloud contains a huge information from the clients include personal data. If a household robot is hacked, users could have risk of their personal privacy and security, like house layout, life snapshot, home-view, etc. It may be accessed and leaked to the world around by criminals. Another problems is once a robot is hacked and controlled by someone else, which may put the user in danger.

'''Ethical problems''' - Some ethics of robotics, especially for cloud based robotics must be considered. Since a robot is connected via networks, it has risk to be accessed by other people. If a robot is out of control and carries out illegal activities, who should be responsible for it.

== History ==
The term "Cloud Robotics" first appeared in the public lexicon as part of a talk given by [[James Kuffner]] in 2010 at the IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics entitled "Cloud-enabled Robots".
&lt;ref name=Kuffner2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuffner|first1=James|title=Cloud-Enabled Robots|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47486324/Cloud-Enabled-Robots|publisher=IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robotics |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, "Cloud Robotics" has become a general term encompassing the concepts of information sharing, distributed intelligence, and fleet learning that is possible via networked robots and modern cloud computing.

From the early days of robot development, it was common to have computation done on a computer that was separated from the actual robot mechanism, but connected by wires for power and control.  As wireless communication technology developed, new forms of experimental "remote brain" robots were developed controlled by small, onboard compute resources for robot control and safety, that were wirelessly connected to a more powerful remote computer for heavy processing.
&lt;ref name=inaba1997remote&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Inaba |first1=Masayuki |title=Remote-brained robots |book-title=Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Joint Conference on Artifical Intelligence-Volume 2 |pages=1593-1606 |date=1997 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[cloud computing]]" was popularized with the launch of [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud|Amazon EC2]] in 2006.  It marked the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of [[hardware virtualization]] and [[service-oriented architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14637206 |title= Cloud Computing: Clash of the clouds |date= 2009-10-15 | work = The Economist |accessdate= 2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an correspondence with Popular Science in July 2006, Kuffner wrote that after a robot was programmed or successfully learned to perform a task it could share its model and relevant data with all other cloud-connected robots:
&lt;ref name=popsci2006&gt;
{{cite magazine |date=September 2006 |pages=55-71 |title=The Future of Robots |magazine=Popular Science }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text="...the robot could then 'publish' its refined model to some website or universal repository of knowledge that all future robots could download and utilize.  My vision is to have a 'robot knowledge database' that will over time improve the capabilities of all future robotic systems.  It would serve as a warehouse of information and statistics about the physical world that robots can access and use to improve their reasoning about the consequences of possible actions and make better action plans in terms of accuracy, safety, and robustness.  It could also serve as a kind of 'skill library'.  For example, if I successfully programmed my butler robot how to cook a perfect omelette, I could 'upload' the software for omelette cooking to a server that all robots could then download whenever they were asked to cook an omelette.  There could be a whole community of robot users uploading skill programs, much like the current 'shareware' and 'freeware' software models that are popular for PC users."

Founded in 1975, the '''Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment''' sought to replace the [[Massachusetts]] State ERA Coalition and carry out the mission of ratifying the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment replaced the Massachusetts State ERA Coalition because, as a coalition, the organization could not legally raise funds for any cause. The campaign created by the Committee ended with success at the ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu//oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&amp;uniqueId=sch00522|title=Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment. Records of the Committee to Ratify the Massachusetts State Equal Rights Amendment, 1975-1976: A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee then became the ERA Implementation Project, which lobbied for reconciliation of existing laws with the ERA vis a vis legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.harvard.edu/schlesinger_equal_rights_amendment |title=Home - Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) - Research Guides at Harvard Library |publisher=Guides.library.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ch.megacephala wiki.jpg|thumb|A female Oriental latrine fly (''[[Chrysomya megacephala]]'') feeds on feces.]]
'''Coprophagia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|p|r|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ|dʒ|i|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia "Coprophagia"]. [[Dictionary.com]]. September 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''coprophagy''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|f|ə|dʒ|i}}) is the consumption of [[feces]]. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'', "feces" and φαγεῖν ''phagein'', "to eat". ''Coprophagy'' refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, coprophagia has been observed in individuals with mental illnesses, as well as an unconventional sexual act. Some animal [[species]] eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular in the [[Lagomorpha]] (rabbits, hares, and pikas) doing so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more efficiently by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|do so only under unusual conditions]].

==Humans==
Coprophagia has been observed in some people with [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | page = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pica (disorder)|pica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rose, E.A. | author2 = Porcerelli, J.H. | author3 = Neale, A.V. | last-author-amp = yes | title = Pica: Common but commonly missed | journal = The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice | year = 2000 | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–358 | pmid = 11001006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==

===Invertebrates===

Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]], particularly in the case of [[herbivore]]s, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' [[Digestion|digestive systems]]. Two feces-eating insects are certain species of [[fly]] and the [[dung beetle]]. In regards to the [[dung beetle]], their diet is mainly in the form of the microorganism-rich liquid component that is present in the dung of mammals, while they take advantage of the fibrous material in the dung for the female to lay her fertilized eggs in.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, E.;Spector, S.;Louzada, J.;Larsen, T.;Amezquita, S.;Favila, M.E. "Ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by Scarabaeinae dung beetles".  Biological Conservation.'''141'''(6).1461–1474.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus ''Pseudotrichonympha'' in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists (Pseudotrichonympha spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial endosymbionts.|author=Noda, S.|author2=Kitade, O.|author3=Inoue, T.|author4=Kawai, M.|author5=Kanuka, M.|author6=Hiroshima, K.|author7=Hongoh, Y.|author8=Constantino, R.|author9=Uys, V.|author10=Zhong, J.|author11=Kudo, T.|author12=Ohkuma, M.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=6|year=2007|pages=1257–1266|url=http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/17391411/Cospeciation_in_the_triplex_symbiosis_of_termite_gut_protists__Pseudotrichonympha_spp___their_hosts_and_their_bacterial_endosymbionts_|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03219.x|pmid=17391411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertebrates===
Domesticated and wild mammals are sometimes coprophagic, and in some species this forms an essential part of their method of digesting tough plant material.
[[File:Green glazed toilet with pigsty model. Eastern Han dynasty 25 - 220 CE.jpg|thumb|left|Green glazed toilet with pigsty model. China, Eastern Han dynasty 25–220 CE]]
Dogs may be coprophagic, possibly to rebalance their [[microbiome]] or to ingest missing nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=Everyone Poops. Some Animals Eat It. Why?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/everyone-poops-some-animals-eat-it-why-180961020/|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species within the [[Lagomorpha]] ([[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, and [[pika]]s) produce two types of fecal pellets: hard ones, and soft ones called [[cecotrope]]s. Animals in these species reingest their cecotropes, to extract further nutrients. Cecotropes derive from chewed plant material that collects in the [[cecum]], a chamber between the large and small intestine, containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. After [[egestion|excretion]] of the soft [[cecotrope]],  it is again eaten whole by the animal and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables these animals to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrients are derived from the food they eat.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process serves the same purpose within these animals as [[ruminant|rumination]] (cud-chewing) does in cattle and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R. M. Lockley, 1964. Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This reference is for the whole section, as written 30 July 2007 --&gt;

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]]. There are concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A. Times&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/feeds/regulatory-guidance/rg-2/eng/1328859106165/1328859287377|website=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|title=Feeding of Poultry Manure to Cattle Prohibited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young of [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|giant pandas]], [[koala]]s and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd, in order to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found in their ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&amp;nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such animals are born, their [[intestine]]s are sterile and do not contain these bacteria. Without doing this they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]], [[chinchillas]], [[hedgehogs]] and [[naked mole-rat]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by gut bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Gorilla]]s have been recorded to consume their feces extremely rarely, possibly out of boredom, a desire for warm food, or to reingest seeds contained in the feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of [[commensalism|commensal]] animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8552000/8552157.stm|title=BBC - Earth News - Giant meat-eating plants prefer to eat tree shrew poo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/51501-pitcher-plants-lure-pooping-bats.html|title=How Hungry Pitcher Plants Get the Poop They Need|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lewin reported that "...&amp;nbsp;consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centuries ago, physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition.&lt;ref&gt;notes to ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Coprophagia is sometimes depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page= 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in 1785, is full of detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s award-winning 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' contains a detailed scene of coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pynchon (1973) ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Part 2, episode 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. This in turn comes from the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], who often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕφάγος'').&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian actor and pornographic director {{ill|Simon Thaur|de}} created the series "Avantgarde Extreme" and "Portrait Extrem", which explores coprophagy, coprophilia and urolagnia. Modern Russian writer [[Vladimir Sorokin]]'s novel ''Norma'' describes a society where coprophagia is institutionalised and mandatory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2896">The '''David Florida Laboratory'''  is  the [[Canadian Space Agency]]'s spacecraft assembly, integration and testing centre, in [[Shirleys Bay]], just west of [[Ottawa]]. It is operated by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] and rented out to Canadian and foreign aerospace and telecommunications companies and organizations for qualifying space bound equipment such as communication or [[scientific satellites]], or components made to be placed on satellites or installed in a space station. The laboratory was named to honour [[C. David Florida]], a leading Canadian pioneer in space research.

Officially opened in September, 1972, the lab has been expanded over the years to accommodate the demand for its services. There are many support facilities such as storage areas, [[clean room]]s, electrodynamic shakers, [[anechoic chamber]]s, space (thermal and vacuum) simulation chambers and in-house mechanical, electrical and electronic shops.

In the past the David Florida Laboratory has tested satellites for [[Brazil]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[European Space Agency]]. [[Inmarsat]] has designated it as their authorized antenna test house. It has also tested Canadian satellites such as [[RADARSAT-1]] and previously tested the [[Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator]] (Dextre) which now forms part of the [[Mobile Servicing System]] of the [[International Space Station]]. It completed work on the [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] which first flew on [[Shuttle Discovery]] during [[STS-114]].  The Laboratory worked on [[RADARSAT-2]] prior to launch in 2007.

Recently the David Florida Laboratory has completed the integration and environmental testing of the [[Maritime Monitoring and Messaging Microsatellite]] (M3MSat).  This is a technology demonstration satellite that will be used to assess the utility of having in space an Automatic Identification System (&lt;abbr&gt;AIS&lt;/abbr&gt;) for reading signals from vessels to better manage transport in Canadian waters. &lt;abbr&gt;M3MSat&lt;/abbr&gt; was scheduled to be launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Ecological competence''' is the ability of an [[organism]], often a [[pathogen]], to survive and compete in new habitats. In the case of plant pathogens, it is also their ability to survive between growing seasons. For example, [[peanut clump virus]] can survive in the spores of its fungal [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]] until a new growing season begins and it can proceed to infect its primary host again. If a pathogen does not have ecological competence it is likely to become extinct.

The '''Franki piling system''' (also called [[pressure]]-injected [[foundation (architecture)|footing]]) is a method used to drive expanded [[Base (geometry)|base]] cast-[[in-situ]] [[concrete]] (Franki) [[deep foundation#Drilled piles|piles]].&lt;ref name="Perry1"&gt;[http://www.geoforum.com/info/pileinfo/view.asp?ID=15 Franki Pile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711085120/http://www.geoforum.com/info/pileinfo/view.asp?ID=15 |date=2011-07-11 }} GRV AB, Retrieved November 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Belgian]] [[Engineer]] Edgard Frankignoul in 1909 and has achieved considerable worldwide success since.&lt;ref name="Perry3"&gt;[http://www.franki-geotechnics.be/page.asp?q=history&amp;id=501&amp;title=History History] Franki Foundations Group Belgium, Retrieved December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This method can be applied to different site conditions and is still widely used&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; due to its high [[ultimate tensile strength|tensile load]] capacity, and relatively low [[noise]] and ground [[vibration]] levels.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

==History==
Edgard Frankignoul applied for the production [[patent]] for the Franki pile in July 1909. He then co-founded the [[geotechnical]] company Frankipile (Société des Pieux Armés Frankignoul) with [[Liège]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] Edmond Baar with the goal of commercializing the Franki piling system. By 1929, the technique had been implemented by 34 international [[subsidiaries]] and [[license]] holders.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;

The Franki pile process has undergone several reformations since it was conceived.  The dry concrete plug was not introduced to the design until 1926.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt; Before this innovation, the casing had to be top-driven and equipped with a lost bottom plate.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt; The Franki pile with vibrated shaft and [[hydraulic]] vibrating hammer were manufactured starting from 1960 and 1971 respectively.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;

==Applications==
Franki piles can be used as high-capacity [[deep foundation]] elements without the necessity of excavation or [[dewatering]].&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; They are useful in conditions where a sufficient [[Bearing capacity|bearing]] [[soil]] can only be reached deeper in the ground,&lt;ref name="Perry2"&gt;[http://www.franki.de/pdf_en/FRANKI_pile.pdf FRANKIPILE] FRANKI Grundbau, Retrieved December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt; and are best suited to granular soil where bearing is primarily achieved from the densification of the soil around the base.&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; They are not recommended for use in [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] soils where [[Dynamic compaction|compaction]] of the base is not possible.&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;
The Franki piling system is the quietest of the driven cast-in-place systems, and so is used in conditions where high noise levels could cause [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] problems.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

==Installation of a Franki pile==
# A charge of [[Concrete slump test|zero-slump]] concrete is poured into the bottom of a [[steel]] driving [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] that is placed vertically on the ground. A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-operated [[pile driver|drop hammer]] is then driven on the concrete, forming a [[watertight]] concrete plug.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"&gt;Shamsher Prakash, Hari D. Sharma (1990). ''Pile foundations in Engineering Practice'', p. 60. Wiley-Interscience {{ISBN|0-471-61653-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# The concrete plug is driven into the ground by the drop hammer. The pipe is also dragged into the ground due to [[friction]] developed between the steel and the concrete.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# When the desired depth is reached, the pipe is held in position by leads—structures which guide and align the pile and hammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piledrivers.org/files/uploads/272D1300-0887-4849-BDB0-4044B9FF8859.pdf ''piledrivers.org'' PDF, Land Based Rigs]&lt;/ref&gt; The hammer is then applied to the concrete, driving it outwards through the bottom of the pile and forming a [[mushroom]]-shaped base.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# At this point, a [[cylindrical]] [[rebar]] cage can be driven into the concrete if supplementary reinforcement is desired.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"&gt;Dr. B.C. Punmia, Ashok Kumar Jain, B.C. Punmia, Arun Kr. Jain (2005). ''Soil Mechanics and Foundations
 '', p. 763. Laxmi Publications (P) Ltd. {{ISBN|81-7008-081-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Additional charges of concrete are added and driven while the steel casing is simultaneously pulled up until the shaft of the pile is formed.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;

==Variations==
* Small charges of concrete can be added while the base is being formed&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt; to enlarge the base and improve the pile’s settlement performance.&lt;ref name="Perry5"&gt;[http://esvc000701.wic052u.server-web.com/PDF/Frank_Piles.pdf Franki Piles] Frankipile Australia, Retrieved December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Franki piles can be installed raked (or sloped) with a tilt of up to 4:1.&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt; Raked Franki piles are always reinforced and are particularly suitable for structures subject to dynamic [[forces]].&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;
* Driving methods such as open-ended coring, rock socketing, and composite shaft construction are occasionally used to overcome unique site problems.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

We, Matata: Bicultural living amongst apes, Spring, 83, 161-183.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was expanded to parrots, bears, and domestic animals and led to her founding the field of [[trans-species psychology]], the articulation of a vertebrate common model of brain, mind, and behavior that is supported by existing science.&lt;ref name="kerulos"/&gt;

==Discovery of PTSD in elephants and chimpanzees==
In 2005, while investigating what was referred to as an outbreak of “abnormal behaviors,” Bradshaw established that in fact African elephants were experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name="dissertation"/&gt;  Psychological symptoms included inter- and intra-species aggression, abnormal startle response, depression, mood disorders, and socio-emotional dysfunction, including infant neglect.  All were related to a series of human-caused trauma: mass killings, translocations, social disruption, and habitat loss and degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Slotow, R. et al. (2000). Nature, 408, 425–426.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slotow, R., Balfour, D. &amp; Howison, O. (2001) Killing of black and white rhinoceroses by African elephants in Hluhluhe-Umfolozi, South Africa. Pachyderm, 31, 14-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her findings were further supported by neuroscience research stating that the brain structures affected by trauma (cortical and subcortical areas of the right brain) are highly conserved across species.&lt;ref&gt;Schore, A. N. (2002). Dysregulation of the right brain: a fundamental mechanism of traumatic attachment and the psychopathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder.

(2005).  Elephant trauma and recovery: from human violence to [[trans-species psychology]]. dissertation: Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans-species psychology==
[[Trans-species psychology]] labels the entirety of standing science that describes a unitary model of brain, mind, and behavior for all animals.&lt;ref&gt;Northoff, G. and J. Panksepp, (2008).The trans-species concept of self and the subcortical-cortical midline system. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 12 (7), 259-264.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradshaw maintains that establishing trans-species psychology as a new field was only necessary to point out the selective use of science. A vast accumulation of theory and data accumulated since Charles Darwin shows that nonhuman animals are mentally and emotionally comparable to humans, and surpass human abilities in diverse ways.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, C. (2009). Post-traumatic stress disorder: evolutionary perspectives. Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 43(11), 1038-1048. doi:10.3109/00048670903270407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecotherapy"&gt;Bradshaw, G.A. (2009). Transformation through service: trans-species psychology and its implications for ecotherapy. Ecotherapy. (eds.) L. Buzzell and C. Chalquist. Sierra Club, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. (1998). Affective neuroscience: The foundations of human and animal emotions. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this understanding is neither explicitly acknowledged, nor do scientific practices reflect such.  By ignoring human and other animal psychological comparability, the science community encourages cultural and legal subjugation of animals.&lt;ref name="marino"/&gt;

Trans-species psychology rectifies this inconsistency by eliminating the artificial separation between species and openly bringing knowledge of human psychology to bear on other species.&lt;ref name="marino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;Bradshaw, G.A. &amp; M. Watkins. (2006). Trans-species psychology; theory and praxis. Spring. V. 75, p. 69-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The affix ''trans'' on psychology embeds the human species, without privilege, in the matrix of the animal kingdom. By recognizing human-animal comparability, trans-species psychology situates all species under a single conceptual umbrella - a unitary model of brain, mind, behavior and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalvisions.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/trans-species-living-an-interview-with-gay-bradshaw/ Bradshaw, G.A. 2015. ''Elephant trauma and recovery: from human violence to trans-species psychology).'' Doctoral dissertation Pacifica Graduate Institute, Santa Barbara, CA.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In so doing, trans-species psychology revolutionizes a new scientific and ethical paradigm that has profound implications for human-animal relationships, culture, ethics, scientific research, and psychological practice.&lt;ref name="dissertation"/&gt;

Trans-species psychology provides a scientific basis for the animal rights movement.  Scientific evidence supports compelling ethical arguments to provide nonhuman animals with rights comparable to humans.  Bradshaw refers to this cultural movement as trans-species living, "learning to live like animals again.” Trans-species living embraces an ethic of being in service to animals in ways that promote animal self-determination and restores animal well-being by supporting their habitats, cultures, individual value, and agency. It disavows the exploitation of animals for profit, entertainment, research, or other gain.&lt;ref name="kerulos"/&gt;

==The Kerulos Center==
In 2008, Bradshaw founded The Kerulos Center, in Jacksonville, Oregon, USA, a non-profit organization dedicated to ethical living with non-human nature.&lt;ref name="kerulos"/&gt;  The Kerulos Center consists of an international community of faculty members and professional advisors from diverse disciplines working to improve the lives of animals through scientific understanding and service. Its mission is to create community and practices that foster animal self-determination and wellbeing. A key principle at the Kerulos Center is that knowledge is only valuable when translated into action.&lt;ref name="kerulos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecotherapy"/&gt;

==Publications==
Bradshaw authored the book, ''Elephants on the Edge: What Animals Teach Us about Humanity,'' (Yale University Press, 2009), which discusses the emotional and social lives of elephants.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;  ''Elephants on the Edge'' has been distinguished as a 2009 Book of the Year (BOTYA) Gold Medal Award, Winner in Psychology, a Scientific American Favorite Science Books of 2009, a nomination for Pulitzer Prize 2009, an Honorable Mention Award 2009 PROSE, a Psychology (Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers), and an Honorable Mention, 2010 Green Book Festival.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

Archbishop Desmond M.Tutu, 1984 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate:
"African peoples and wildlife have been bound together in a delicate network of interdependence since ancient times. The arrival of colonialism tore apart these bonds:  human brother now fights against elephant brother, and mothers of both species mourn. Elephants on the Edge is an urgent call to end this strife and for humanity to embrace once more the traditions that kept the peace with our animal kin."&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

Bradshaw is also editor of ''Minding the Animal Psyche'', an anthology covering diverse species from the perspective of trans-species psychology.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;Bradshaw, G.A. (2010). Minding the Animal Psyche (Editor). Spring Journal, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gene redundancy''' is the existence of multiple genes in the genome of an organism that perform the same function. This is the case for many sets of [[paralogous]] genes. When an individual gene in such a set is disrupted by mutation or targeted [[gene knockout|knockout]], there can be little effect on [[phenotype]] as a result of gene redundancy, whereas the effect is large for the knockout of a gene with only one copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pérez-Pérez JM, Candela H, Micol JL |title=Understanding synergy in genetic interactions |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=368–76 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19665253 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gene Duplication.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Figure 1. Common mechanisms of gene duplication.]]

== Origin and Evolution of Redundant Genes ==
Gene redundancy most often results from [[Gene duplication]]. When a gene is duplicated within a genome, the two copies are initially functionally redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancy Caused By Gene Duplications And Its Evolution In Networks Of Transcriptional Regulators|last = Wagner|first = Andreas|date = 1996|journal = Biological Cybernetics|doi = 10.1007/s004220050267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the more common mechanisms of gene duplication are [[Retroposon|retroposition,]] unequal [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]], and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During unequal crossing over, [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This can lead to the transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurles|first=Matthew|title=Gene Duplication: The Genomic Trade in Spare Parts|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=2|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020206|pmc=449868|pmid=15252449|page=e206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Evolution of redundant genes.png|thumb|398x398px|Figure 2. After a duplication event, redundant genes undergo either subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or gene loss]]As the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to [[Genetic drift]]. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function. The three mechanisms of functional differentiation in genes are nonfunctionalization (or gene loss), neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Evolutionary Fate and Consequences of Duplicate Genes|last = Lynch|first = M.|date = 2000|journal = Science|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During nonfunctionalization, or degeneration/gene loss, one copy of the duplicated gene acquires mutations that render it inactive or [[Gene silencing|silent]]. At this time, the gene has no function and is called a [[pseudogene]]. Pseudogenes can be lost over time due to genetic mutations. Neofunctionalization occurs when one copy of the gene accumulates mutations that give the gene a new, beneficial function that is different than the original function. Subfunctionalization occurs when both copies of the redundant gene acquire mutations. Each copy becomes only partially active; two of these partial copies then act as one normal copy of the original gene. Figure 2 to the right provides a visual explanation.

== Gene Maintenance Hypotheses ==
The evolution and origin of redundant genes remain unknown, largely because evolution happens over such a long period of time. Theoretically, a gene can not be maintained without mutation unless it has a selective pressure acting on it. Gene redundancy, therefore, would allow both copies of the gene to accumulate mutations as long as the other was still able to perform its function. This means that all redundant genes should theoretically become a [[pseudogene]] and eventually be lost. Scientists have devised two hypothesis as to why redundant genes can remain in the genome: the backup hypothesis and the piggyback hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Genetic Redundancies and Their Evolutionary Maintenance|last = Zhang|first = Jianzhi|date = 2012|journal = Evolutionary Systems Biology Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The backup hypothesis proposes that redundant genes remain in the genome as a sort of "back-up plan". If the original gene loses its function, the redundant gene is there to take over and keep the cell alive. The piggyback hypothesis states that two [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml paralogs] in the genome have some kind of non-overlapping function as well as the redundant function. In this case, the redundant part of the gene remains in the genome due to the proximity to the area that codes for the unique function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Qian|first = Wenfeng|last2 = Liao|first2 = Ben-Yang|last3 = Chang|first3 = Andrew Y.-F.|last4 = Zhang|first4 = Jianzhi|date = 2010-10-01|title = Maintenance of duplicate genes and their functional redundancy by reduced expression|journal = Trends in Genetics|volume = 26|issue = 10|pages = 425–430|doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.002|issn = 0168-9525|pmc = 2942974|pmid = 20708291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason redundant genes remain in the genome is an ongoing question and gene redundancy is being studied by researchers everywhere. There are many hypotheses in addition to the backup and piggyback models. For example, at the University of Michigan, a study provides the theory that redundant genes are maintained in the genome by reduced expression.

== Research ==

=== Gene Families and Phylogeny ===
Researchers often use the history of redundant genes in the form of [[Gene family|gene families]] to learn about the phylogeny of a species. It takes time for redundant genes to undergo functional diversification;  the degree of diversification between [http://homepage.usask.ca/~ctl271/857/def_homolog.shtml orthologs] tells us how closely related the two genomes are. Gene duplication events can also be detected by looking at increases in gene duplicates.

A good example of using gene redundancy in evolutionary studies is the [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00438-015-1142-3 Evolution of the KCS gene family in plants]. This paper studies how one KCS gene evolved into an entire gene family via duplication events. The number of redundant genes in the species allows researchers to determine when duplication events took place and how closely related species are.

=== Locating and Characterizing Redundant Genes ===
Currently, there are three ways to detect paralogs in a known genomic sequence: simple homology (FASTA), gene family evolution ([http://treefam.genomics.org.cn/ TreeFam]) and [http://eggnogdb.embl.de/ orthology (eggNOG v3]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=Minou|date=2006-01-01|title=Identification and mapping of paralogous genes on a known genomic DNA sequence|journal=[[Methods in Molecular Biology]]|volume=338|pages=21–29|doi=10.1385/1-59745-097-9:21|issn=1064-3745|pmid=16888348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Human Genome Project]]'s completion, researchers are able to annotate the human genome much more easily. Using online databases like the [https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway Genome Browser] at UCSC, researchers can look for homology in the sequence of their gene of interest.

== Human Redundant Genes ==

=== Olfactory Receptors ===
The Human Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene family contains 339 intact genes and 297 pseudogenes. These genes are found in different locations throughout the genome, but only about 13% are on different chromosomes or on distantly spaced loci. 172 subfamilies of OR genes have been found in humans, each at its own loci. Because the genes in each of these subfamilies are structurally and functionally similar, and in close proximity to each other, it is hypothesized that each evolved from single genes undergoing duplication events. The high number of subfamilies in humans explains why we are able to recognize so many odors.

Human OR genes have homologues in other mammals, such as mice, that demonstrate the evolution of Olfactory Receptor genes. One particular family that is involved in the initial event of odor perception has been found to be highly conserved throughout all of vertebrate evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malnic|first=Bettina|last2=Godfrey|first2=Paul A.|last3=Buck|first3=Linda B.|date=2004-02-24|title=The human olfactory receptor gene family|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/8/2584|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=101|issue=8|pages=2584–2589|doi=10.1073/pnas.0307882100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=356993|pmid=14983052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease ===
Duplication events and redundant genes have often been thought to have a role in some human diseases. Large scale whole genome duplication events that occurred early in vertebrate evolution may be the reason that human monogenic disease genes often contain a high number of redundant genes. Chen et al. hypothesizes that the functionally redundant paralogs in human monogenic disease genes mask the effects of dominant deletorious mutations, thereby maintaining the disease gene in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Wei-Hua|last2=Zhao|first2=Xing-Ming|last3=van Noort|first3=Vera|last4=Bork|first4=Peer|date=2013-05-01|title=Human Monogenic Disease Genes Have Frequently Functionally Redundant Paralogs|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=9|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073|issn=1553-734X|pmc=3656685|pmid=23696728|page=e1003073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whole genome duplications may be a leading cause of retention of some tumor causing genes in the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malaguti|first=Giulia|last2=Singh|first2=Param Priya|last3=Isambert|first3=Hervé|date=2014-05-01|title=On the retention of gene duplicates prone to dominant deleterious mutations|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=93|pages=38–51|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2014.01.004|issn=1096-0325|pmid=24530892}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Strout et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strout|first=Matthew P.|last2=Marcucci|first2=Guido|last3=Bloomfield|first3=Clara D.|last4=Caligiuri|first4=Michael A.|date=1998-03-03|title=The partial tandem duplication of ALL1 (MLL) is consistently generated by Alu-mediated homologous recombination in  acute myeloid leukemia|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=95|issue=5|pages=2390–2395|issn=0027-8424|pmc=19353|pmid=9482895|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.5.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that tandem duplication events, likely via homologous recombination, are linked to [[acute myeloid leukemia]].

'''Genetic stock centers''' are collections of pure genetic stock available for use in research. They are often housed at research universities, and include everything from single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] life to plants, fish, and small mammals such as mice and rats. Genetic Stock Centers often charge for research stock on a two tier scale, with [[Nonprofit organization|non profit]] researchers getting stock at a lower cost than commercial researchers.  Dr [[Myron Gordon (biologist)|Myron Gordon]], for example, established the [[Xiphophorus]] genetic stock center in 1939 to raise pure strains when he realized that certain Xiphophorus hybrids would be useful in cancer research. He understood that his research could not be duplicated by other scientists without pure genetic stock to use as a base. The strains that Dr Gordon started remain pure and are used to this day.

The '''School of Interactive Computing''' is an [[academic department|academic unit]] located within the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech). It conducts both research and teaching activities related to [[interactive computing]] at the undergraduate and graduate levels. These activities focus on [[computing]]'s interaction with users and the environment, as well as how computers impact the quality of people's lives.&lt;ref name="TwoNewSchools"/&gt;

==History==
The School of Interactive Computing was formed in February 2007, when the former Interactive &amp; Intelligent Computing Division was renamed and promoted to "School" status. [[Aaron Bobick]] was appointed as the school's first chair. Along with its sibling academic unit, the [[Georgia Institute of Technology School of Computer Science|School of Computer Science]], the School of Interactive Computing represents the first time a college-level [[computing]] program has delineated the field into separate but related bodies of study.&lt;ref name="TwoNewSchools"/&gt; In July 2012, [[Annie Antón]], formerly at [[North Carolina State University]], replaced Bobick as school chair.&lt;ref name="AntonHired" /&gt;

==Degrees offered==
The School of Interactive Computing offers [[bachelor's degree]]s, [[master's degree]]s, and [[doctorate|doctoral degrees]] in several fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/inside/units/ic/degree-programs | accessdate=2008-01-27 | publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing]] | title=Degrees Offered | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131094738/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/inside/units/ic/degree-programs | archivedate=2008-01-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These degrees are technically granted by the School's parent organization, the Georgia Tech College of Computing, and often awarded in conjunction with other academic units within Georgia Tech.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism''' describes a variety of reactions involving [[glyoxylate]] or [[dicarboxylate]]s.  Glyoxylate is the [[conjugate base]] of [[glyoxylic acid]], and within a buffered environment of known [[pH]] such as the cell [[cytoplasm]] these terms can be used almost interchangeably, as the gain or loss of a [[hydrogen ion]] is all that distinguishes them, and this can occur in the [[aqueous]] environment at any time.  Likewise dicarboxylates are the conjugate bases of [[dicarboxylic acid]]s, a general class of organic compounds containing two [[carboxylic acid]] groups, such as [[oxalic acid]] or [[succinic acid]].

A compact graphical description of major biochemical reactions involved can be found at [[KEGG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00630.html|title=Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism}} at KEGG.&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides information on the relevant [[enzyme]]s and details the relationship with several other metabolic processes: [[glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism]] which provides [[hydroxypyruvate]] and [[glyoxylate]], [[purine metabolism]] which provides glyoxylate, [[pyruvate metabolism]] which provides (S)-[[malate]] and [[formate]], [[carbon fixation]] which consumes [[3-phospho-D-glycerate]] and provides D-[[ribulose]] 1,5-P2, [[ascorbate and aldarate metabolism]] which shares [[tartronate-semialdehyde]], [[nitrogen metabolism]] which shares [[formate]], [[pyruvate metabolism]] and the [[citrate cycle]] which share [[oxaloacetate]], and [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; metabolism]] which consumes [[glycolaldehyde]].

The [[glyoxylate cycle]] describes an important subset of these reactions involved in biosynthesis of carbohydrates from fatty acids or two-carbon precursors which enter the system as [[acetyl-coenzyme A]].  Its crucial enzymes are [[isocitrate lyase]] and [[malate synthase]].  However, alternate pathways have been proposed in organisms lacking isocitrate lyase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmpdr.org/FIG/wiki/rest.cgi/NmpdrPlugin/SeedViewer?page=Subsystems;subsystem=Glyoxylate_bypass |title=Subsystem: Glyoxylate bypass |publisher=National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005184505/http://www.nmpdr.org/FIG/wiki/rest.cgi/NmpdrPlugin/SeedViewer?page=Subsystems;subsystem=Glyoxylate_bypass |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Economics==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Kennet Tickell.jpeg|thumb|left|Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet with Sir Crispin Tickell and Oliver Tickell at Oxford University]] --&gt;
As defined by the Green Economics Institute, green economics is "Progressive Economics, reclaiming economics for all people everywhere - women, nature, other species, the planet and its systems".&lt;ref name="greeneconomics.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=6conf&gt;[http://www.gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf Green Economics Institute: 6th Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023853/http://gef.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Green_Economics_Conference_flyer_July_2011.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inderscience.com/www/conf/2012jul_ijge_growth_rio_uk_110.pdf Green Economics Institute Seventh Annual Green Economics Conference at Oxford University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Economics Institute Founder and CEO Miriam Kennet describes green economics as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Green Economics is the green movement's challenge to mainstream orthodoxy in economics and it is gaining ground globally and in the corridors of power as the best alternative to solving climate change, the credit crunch, poverty and biodiversity losses. It is about providing reclaiming the practices and policies of economics, for all people everywhere, nature, other species, the planet and its systems. It is about provisioning for the needs, impacts, effects and responsibilities, for everyone and everything on the planet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Founders==
[[File:GEIWorkshop.jpg|thumb|right|An interactive Green Economics workshop in Petersfield, July 2011]]

The Green Economics Institute was founded by Miriam Kennet and Volker Heinemann in 2004.

'''Miriam Kennet''', co-founder, director and CEO, received an MAIB in Economics and International Business from [[South Bank University]], and most recently an MSC in Environmental Science and Economics from the [[University of Oxford]]. She has researched into environmental economics at [[South Bank University]], Oxford University, and [[Keele University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micandidate.eu/candidate.aspx?idcandidate=2705 ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk/page34.html |title=Miriam Kennet |publisher=Green Economics |date= |accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volker Heinemann''', co-founder and director of the Institute, holds a master's degree in Economics. He is a former German Green Councillor and is currently an associate editor of the ''[[International Journal of Green Economics]]''&lt;ref&gt; www.inderscience.com/jge&lt;/ref&gt; He is author of ''Die Oekonomie der Zukunft'', a book that investigates future economic trends in the developed world. It is based on the idea that a new economic science, free from any neo-liberal or other normative bias is needed: green economics.&lt;ref name="greeneconomics5"/&gt;

'''Michelle Gale (USA)''' is our current Non Executive Director and has been in post for 10 years.
She heads up our COP UNFCC Climate Delegations Diplomacy and also is the co -author and editor of many  of our books. She is a specialist in International Relations, and Economics and Human Rights Law and gender issues.

'''Professor Maria Madi''' (Brazil) heads up our academic work at the www.geiacademy.org. &lt;ref&gt; www.geiacademy.org &lt;/ref&gt;. She is a specialist and Professor of international finance.

'''The Green Economics Institute Trust'''
The Green Economics Institute Trust, greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org, is a Registered Charity No 111768 (Ref: The Charities Commission) which was founded in 2009 by Judith Felton with founding trustees, Jacob Sanders, Miriam Kennet, Volker Heinemann and others.
Its board of trustees is very active and holds regular Exhibition Stands roughly one a month around Europe to advise people what they can do to implement our research and ideas. The Charity  spreads its ideas by educating the public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice, in particular it shared the  offices with '''Launchpad''' a charity for the homeless, and also with the '''Ethical Property Company'''.

'''Social Justice'''
It has supported the  publication of numerous books on aspects of social justice, for Example The Philosophy of Social Justice which was very popular at the Paris UNFCC COP21 Climate Conference showing the link between social justice, diversity and solving climate change issues. It also publishes regularly on climate change and supports the publication of books on the green economy.

'''Changing the Narrative of Migration''' 
The Trust has also been active in the migration debate- promoting the idea of '''Changing the Narrative of Migration''' with 4 conferences on the subject and academic papers and a book '''{{ISBN|9781907543210}}'''&lt;ref&gt; {{ISBN|9781907543210}} &lt;/ref&gt; discussing other ways of looking at migration and its true history, believing that xenophobia and intolerance are contrary to the introduction of a green economy. More information about the Green Economics Institute Trust can be found at its website www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org 
&lt;ref&gt;www.greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Its email is &lt;ref&gt; info@greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org&lt;/ref&gt; greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org.

'''Mental Health and Sustainability'''
The Trust is also very active in promoting mental health as a very important factor in understanding the human difficulty in changing track and stopping runnaway climate change, pollution and a range of difficult subjects. It works with a range of top pyschiatrists and many of them inform the profession and government on this issue. We have also published a book on Health, ''The Greening of Health and Healthcare, which has been very influential not least being used by  Chinese government official when planning the next phase of health developments in China.
''
'''Law: Whose Law is it anyway?''' 
The Trust is very active in philosophy and the law internationally, working with many partner lawyers. It is currently engaged in a round of lectures, talking about how many of the worlds worst ever atrocities have been committed under the cover of the ruling laws or governments so that victims have no recourse to law whilst this has taken place. We are advising people to consider, who is the law for and who does it protect, and who has access to it. It is necessary to sort this out if we are considering the role of the commons, and the rights of ordinary people to access ordinary resources, water for example, so ''Whose Law is it anyway?'' is a major project developing at the institute led by '''Maria Fernanda Madi''' (Brazil and the Netherlands).

'''Diversity'''
The Trust has always promoted diversity in all its activities, publications and events, as well as acting as a beacon for others. It is currently advising several other Institutions on how to achieve and maintain real diversity in organisations as a means of ensuring social and environmental justice.

''''''Chair of Trustees'''''' is Marlyn Lee - Hughes, more information can be found at:  greeneconomicsinstitutetrust.org. She is a specialist in both science, trained at Edinburgh and a lecturer in English. Mrs Hughes runs our Registered Charity The Green Economics Institute Trust and its work in 
'''Educating the Public in all aspects of Green Economics and Social and Environmental Justice.''

==Research and Conferences==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GEICollage.jpg|thumb|left|A collage depicting Green Economics conferences and awards ceremonies]] --&gt;
The Green Economics Institute's Green Economics Research is focused on three key aspects:&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The reform of mainstream [[economics]] by means of robust research into alternatives and existing theories, and how these can be made more relevant and practical.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# The creation and development of the new "Greening the Economy" discourse of [[Green economy|green economics]].&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;
# Research into policy formulation and implementation which would provide economics with the philosophy, methodology, ontology and instruments to bring social and environmental justice.&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;

''''''Research Activity and Website''''''
The Green Economics Institute now has its own Research Academy, the GEIAcademy. Its website 
can be found at www.GEIAcademy.org and the Academy is Headed up by Professor Maria Madi (Brazil) co- author of many of the institutes books.[http://www.geiacademy.org www.geiacademy.org].

Additionally the Green Economics Institute is an official ''''''Research Institute of the United Nations Climate Process'''. UNFCC COP (RINGO)''' and is very active in research into climate change methodology and science and takes a global lead in diplomacy in areas of '''Ambition Enhancement''' for climate change. Please visit&lt;ref&gt; www.geiclimate.org for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Institute's philosophy is summarized as follows:'''
:"The aim is that as a result more people enjoy a better quality of life. There is a focus on corporate activities and the globalisation process and their impacts on a range of stakeholders including indigenous peoples, minorities, women, people in less developed countries and non human species and the biosphere and also the conventional wisdoms of trickle down theories, growth and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greeneconomicsinstitute.wordpress.com/about/who-are-we/ |accessdate=November 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817122123/http://greeneconomicsinstitute.wordpress.com/about/who-are-we/ |archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Economics Institute Conferences'''
The Green Economics Institute runs several Annual  International Conferencesand also sending one of the largest delegation to the UNFCC United Nations Climate Conferences (COP) as well as themed events throughout the year .&lt;ref name=key101 /&gt;&lt;ref name="european-network-of-political-foundations1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The main conference which takes place every summer  is the '''Annual Green Economics Institute Conference''',&lt;ref&gt;www.geiconferences.org &lt;/ref&gt;, currently in its 14th year, held every summer at The University of Oxford. In June 2019 this conference will be held at St Hugh's College, The University of Oxford.The Green Economics Institute now has a dedicated conferences and bookings website www.geiconferences.org where bookings can be made and '''Calls for Papers''' can be found.&lt;ref&gt;www.geiconferences.org &lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6051">'''High-redundancy actuation''' (HRA) is a new approach to [[fault-tolerant control]] in the area of mechanical actuation.

==Overview==
The basic idea is to use a lot of small actuation elements, so that a fault of one element has only a minor effect on the overall system.  This way, a High Redundancy Actuator can remain functional even after several elements are at fault.  This property is also called [[graceful degradation]].

Fault-tolerant operation in the presence of actuator faults requires some form of redundancy. Actuators are essential, because they are used to keep the system stable and to bring it into the desired state. Both requires a certain amount of power or force to be
applied to the system. No control approach can work unless the actuators produce this necessary force.

So the common solution is to err on the side of safety by over-actuation: much more control action than strictly necessary is built into the system. For critical systems, the normal approach involves straightforward replication of the actuators. Often three or four actuators are used in parallel for aircraft flight control systems, even if one would be
sufficient from a control point of view. So if one actuator fails, the remaining actuator can always keep the system operation. While this approach certainly successful, it also makes the system expensive, heavy and ineffective.

===Inspiration of high-redundancy actuation===
The idea of the high-redundancy actuation (HRA) is inspired by the human musculature. A muscle is composed of many individual muscle cells, each of which provides only a minute contribution to the force and the travel of the muscle. These properties allow the muscle as a whole to be highly resilient to damage of individual cells.

==Technical realisation==
The aim of high redundancy actuation is not to produce man-made muscles, but to use the same principle of cooperation in technical actuator's to provide intrinsic fault tolerance. To achieve this, a high number of small actuator elements are assembled in parallel and in series to form one actuator (see [[Series and parallel circuits]]).

Faults within the actuator will affect the maximum capability, but through robust control, full performance can be maintained without either adaptation or reconfiguration. Some form of [[condition monitoring]] is necessary to provide warnings to the operator calling for
[[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]]. But this monitoring has no influence on the system itself, unlike in adaptive methods or [[control reconfiguration]], which simplifies the design of the system significantly.

:[[File:HRA-configurations.gif]]

The HRA is an important new approach within the overall area of fault-tolerant control,
using concepts of [[reliability engineering]] on a mechanical level. When applicable, it can provide actuators that have graceful degradation, and that continue to operate at close to nominal performance even in the presence of multiple faults in the actuator elements.

===Using actuation elements in series===
An important feature of the high-redundancy actuation is that the actuator elements are connected both in parallel and in series. While the parallel arrangement is commonly used, the configuration in series is rarely employed, because it is perceived to be less efficient.

However, there is one fault that is difficult to deal with in a parallel arrangement: the locking up of one actuator element. Because parallel actuator elements always have the same extension, one locked-up element can render the whole assembly useless. It is possible to mitigate this by guarding the elements against locking or by limiting the force exerted by a single element. But these measures reduce both the effectiveness of the system and introduce new points of failure.

The analysis of the serial configuration shows that it remains operational when one element is locked-up. This fact is important for the High Redundancy Actuator, as fault tolerance is required for different fault types. The goal of the HRA project is to use parallel and serial actuator elements to accommodate both the blocking and the inactivity (loss of force) of an element.

===Available technology===
The basic idea of high-redundancy actuation is technology agnostic: it should be applicable to a wide range of actuator technology, including different kinds of [[linear actuator]]s and rotational actuators.

However, initial experiments are performed with [[electric actuator]]s, especially with electromechanical and electromagnetic technology. Compared to [[pneumatic actuator]]s, the electrical drive allow a much finer control of position and force.

[[File:1802 Examples of Amine Peptide Protein and Steroid Hormone Structure.jpg|thumb|00px|Different types of hormones are secreted in the body, with different biological roles and functions.]]
A '''hormone''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] participle “{{lang|grc|ὁρμῶ}}”, "to set in motion, urge on") is any member of a class of [[cell signaling|signaling molecules]] produced by  [[gland]]s in [[multicellular organism]]s that are transported by the [[circulatory system]] to target distant organs to regulate [[physiology]] and [[behavior|behaviour]].  Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: [[eicosanoid]]s, [[steroid]]s, and [[amino acid]]/[[protein]] derivatives ([[amine]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the [[endocrine system|endocrine signaling system]]. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell ([[autocrine signaling|autocrine]] or [[intracrine|intracrine signalling]]) or nearby cells ([[paracrine signalling]]).

Hormones are used to communicate between [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and tissues for [[physiological]] regulation and [[behavioral]] activities, such as digestion, [[metabolism]], [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] function, [[sensory perception]], [[sleep]], [[excretion]], [[lactation]], [[Stress (physiology)|stress]], [[human development (biology)|growth and development]], [[Motor coordination|movement]], [[reproduction]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Neave N | title = Hormones and behaviour: a psychological approach | year =2008 | publisher = Cambridge Univ. Press | location = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0521692014 | laysummary = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pbm/summary/v053/53.1.gibson.html | laysource = Project Muse }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hormones | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hormones.html | work = MedlinePlus | publisher = U.S. National Library of Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins in the target cell resulting in a change in cell function. When a hormone binds to the receptor, it results in the activation of a [[signal transduction]] pathway that typically activates gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] resulting in increased [[gene expression|expression]] of target proteins; non-genomic effects are more rapid, and can be synergistic with genomic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhs|first=Stefanie|last2=Nolze|first2=Alexander|last3=Hübschmann|first3=Ralf|last4=Grossmann|first4=Claudia|date=July 2017|title=30 YEARS OF THE MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR: Nongenomic effects via the mineralocorticoid receptor|journal=The Journal of Endocrinology|volume=234|issue=1|pages=T107–T124|doi=10.1530/JOE-16-0659|issn=1479-6805|pmid=28348113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amino acid–based hormones ([[amines]] and [[peptide hormone|peptide or protein hormones]]) are water-soluble and act on the surface of target cells via [[second messenger system|second messengers]]; [[steroid hormone]]s, being lipid-soluble, move through the plasma membranes of target cells (both [[cell membrane|cytoplasmic]] and [[nuclear membrane|nuclear]]) to act within their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]].

Hormone [[secretion]] may occur in many tissues. Endocrine glands are the cardinal example, but specialized cells in various other organs also secrete hormones. Hormone secretion occurs in response to specific biochemical signals from a wide range of regulatory systems. For instance, [[serum calcium]] concentration affects [[parathyroid hormone]] synthesis; [[blood sugar]] (serum glucose concentration) affects [[insulin]] synthesis; and because the outputs of the [[stomach]] and exocrine [[pancreas]] (the amounts of [[gastric juice]] and [[pancreatic juice]]) become the input of the [[small intestine]], the small intestine secretes hormones to stimulate or inhibit the stomach and pancreas based on how busy it is. Regulation of hormone synthesis of [[sex steroid|gonadal hormones]], [[adrenocortical hormone]]s, and [[thyroid hormone]]s is often dependent on complex sets of direct influence and feedback interactions involving the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA), [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|-gonadal]] (HPG), and [[hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis|-thyroid]] (HPT) axes.

Upon secretion, certain hormones, including protein hormones and catecholamines, are water-soluble and are thus readily transported through the circulatory system. Other hormones, including steroid and thyroid hormones, are lipid-soluble; to allow for their widespread distribution, these hormones must bond to [[carrier plasma glycoprotein]]s (e.g., [[thyroxine-binding globulin]] (TBG)) to form [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-protein complexes. Some hormones are completely active{{define}} when released into the bloodstream (as is the case for insulin and growth hormones), while others are [[prohormone]]s that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated. The [[endocrine system]] [[secrete]]s hormones directly into the [[circulatory system|bloodstream]], typically via [[Capillary#Types|fenestrated capillaries]], whereas the [[exocrine system]] secretes its hormones indirectly using [[Duct (anatomy)|ducts]]. Hormones with [[paracrine]] function diffuse through the [[Interstitial fluid|interstitial space]]s to nearby target tissue.

== Introduction/Overview ==
{{further|Signal transduction}}

Hormonal signaling involves the following steps:&lt;ref name=Nussey_Whitehead_2001&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Nussey S, Whitehead S | title=Endocrinology: an integrated approach|year = 2001 | publisher = Bios Scientific Publ. | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-1-85996-252-7 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Biosynthesis]]''' of a particular hormone in a particular tissue
# '''Storage and [[Cellular secretion|secretion]]''' of the hormone
# '''Transport''' of the hormone to the target cell(s)
# '''Recognition''' of the hormone by an [[membrane protein|associated cell membrane]] or [[intracellular]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein
# '''Relay and amplification''' of the received hormonal signal via a [[signal transduction]] process: This then leads to a cellular response. The reaction of the target cells may then be recognized by the original hormone-producing cells, leading to a [[down-regulation]] in hormone production. This is an example of a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback loop]].
# '''Breakdown''' of the hormone.

Hormone producing cells are typically of a specialized cell type, residing within a particular [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]], such as the [[thyroid gland]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and [[testes]]. Hormones exit their cell of origin via [[exocytosis]] or another means of [[cell membrane|membrane transport]]. The hierarchical model is an oversimplification of the hormonal signaling process. Cellular recipients of a particular hormonal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues, as is the case for [[insulin]], which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects. Different tissue types may also respond differently to the same hormonal signal.

== Regulation ==

The rate of hormone biosynthesis and secretion is often regulated by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback]] control mechanism. Such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the [[metabolism]] and [[excretion]] of hormones. Thus, higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism. Negative feedback must be triggered by overproduction of an "effect" of the hormone.

Hormone secretion can be stimulated and inhibited by:
* Other hormones (''stimulating''- or ''releasing'' -hormones)
* Plasma concentrations of ions or nutrients, as well as binding [[globulin]]s
* [[Neuron]]s and mental activity
* Environmental changes, e.g., of light or temperature

One special group of hormones is the [[tropic hormone]]s that stimulate the hormone production of other [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]].  For example, [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) causes growth and increased activity of another endocrine gland, the [[thyroid]], which increases output of [[thyroid hormone]]s.

To release active hormones quickly into the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], hormone biosynthetic cells may produce and store biologically inactive hormones in the form of [[prehormone|pre-]] or [[prohormone]]s. These can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus.

[[Eicosanoid]]s are considered to act as local hormones. They are considered to be "local" because they possess specific effects on target cells close to their site of formation. They also have a rapid degradation cycle, making sure they do not reach distant sites within the body.&lt;ref&gt;"Eicosanoids". www.rpi.edu. Retrieved 2017-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Receptors ==
[[File:Steroid and Lipid Hormones.svg|thumb|400px|The left diagram shows a steroid (lipid) hormone (1) entering a cell and (2) binding to a receptor protein in the nucleus, causing (3) mRNA synthesis which is the first step of protein synthesis. The right side shows protein hormones (1) binding with receptors which (2) begins a transduction pathway. The transduction pathway ends (3) with transcription factors being activated in the nucleus, and protein synthesis beginning. In both diagrams, a is the hormone, b is the cell membrane, c is the cytoplasm, and d is the nucleus.]] Most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially binding to either [[membrane protein|cell membrane associated]] or [[intracellular]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. A cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different [[signal transduction]] pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.

Receptors for most [[peptide hormone|peptide]] as well as many [[eicosanoid]] hormones are embedded in the [[plasma membrane]] at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR) class of seven [[alpha helix]] [[transmembrane]] proteins.  The interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, described as [[signal transduction]], often involving [[phosphorylation]] or dephosphorylation of various other cytoplasmic proteins, changes in [[ion channel]] permeability, or increased concentrations of intracellular molecules that may act as [[second messenger|secondary messengers]] (e.g., [[cyclic AMP]]). Some [[protein hormone]]s also interact with [[intracellular]] receptors located in the [[cytoplasm]] or [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] by an [[intracrine]] mechanism.

For [[steroid hormone|steroid]] or [[thyroid hormone|thyroid]] hormones, their [[steroid hormone receptor|receptors]] are located [[intracellular|inside the cell]] within the [[cytoplasm]] of the target cell. These receptors belong to the  [[nuclear receptor]] family of ligand-activated [[transcription factor]]s. To bind their receptors, these hormones must first cross the cell membrane. They can do so because they are lipid-soluble. The combined hormone-receptor [[protein complex|complex]] then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific [[DNA sequences]], regulating the expression of certain [[genes]], and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes.&lt;ref name=beato&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beato M, Chavez S, Truss M | title = Transcriptional regulation by steroid hormones | journal = Steroids | year=1996 | volume=61 | issue=4 | pages=240–251 | pmid = 8733009 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128X(96)00030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located inside the cell. Some are associated with the [[plasma membrane]].&lt;ref name=hammes&gt;{{cite journal | author =Hammes SR | title = The further redefining of steroid-mediated signaling | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  | year=2003 | volume=100 | issue=5 | pages=21680–2170 | pmid = 12606724 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0530224100 | pmc =151311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

Hormones have the following effects on the body:

* stimulation or inhibition of growth
* wake-sleep cycle and other [[circadian rhythm]]s
* [[mood swing]]s
* induction or suppression of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death)
* activation or inhibition of the [[immune system]]
* regulation of [[metabolism]]
* preparation of the body for [[mating]], [[fighting]], [[fight-or-flight response|fleeing]], and other activity
* preparation of the body for a new phase of life, such as [[puberty]], [[parenting]],  and [[menopause]]
* control of the [[reproductive cycle]]
* hunger cravings

A hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones. Hormone signals control the internal environment of the body through [[homeostasis]].

== Chemical classes ==

As hormones are defined functionally, not structurally, they may have diverse chemical structures. Hormones occur in [[multicellular organism]]s ([[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[brown algae]] and [[red algae]]). These compounds occur also in [[unicellular organism]]s, and may act as [[signaling molecules]],&lt;ref name="pmid1585458"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lenard J | title = Mammalian hormones in microbial cells | journal = Trends Biochem. Sci. | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 147–50 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1585458 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(92)90323-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Janssens PM | title = Did vertebrate signal transduction mechanisms originate in eukaryotic microbes? | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 12 | pages = 456–459 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0004(87)90223-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no consensus if, in this case, they can be called hormones.

{{further|List of human hormones}}
[[Vertebrate]] hormones fall into three main [[chemical classification|chemical classes]]:

* [[Amino acid]] derived – Examples include [[melatonin]] and [[thyroxine]].
** [[Peptide]]s, [[polypeptide]]s and [[protein]]s. – Small peptide hormones include [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]] and [[vasopressin]]. Peptides composed of [[20 (number)#As an indefinite number|scores]] or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as [[protein]]s. Examples of protein hormones include [[insulin]] and [[growth hormone]]. More complex protein hormones bear [[carbohydrate]] side-chains and are called [[glycoprotein]] hormones. [[Luteinizing hormone]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] are examples of glycoprotein hormones.
* [[Eicosanoid]]s – hormones derived from lipids such as [[arachidonic acid]], [[lipoxin]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s. These hormones are produced by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases and there are many drugs that include the NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen which affect the activity of the cyclooxygenases and inhibit the formation of these eicosanoid hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/eicosanoids.php|title=Eicosanoid Synthesis and Metabolism: Prostaglandins, Thromboxanes, Leukotrienes, Lipoxins|website=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Plant hormone#Classes of plant hormones}}

Plant hormones include [[abscisic acid]], [[auxin]], [[cytokinin]], [[ethylene]], and [[gibberellin]].

== Therapeutic use ==
Many hormones and their [[structural analog|structural]] and [[functional analog (chemistry)|functional analogs]] are used as [[medication]]. The most commonly prescribed hormones are [[estrogen]]s and [[progestogen]]s (as methods of [[hormonal contraception]] and as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic-what-is-perimenopause-menopause-postmenopause/hic-hormone-therapy | title = Hormone Therapy | publisher = Cleveland Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thyroxine]] (as [[levothyroxine]], for [[hypothyroidism]]) and [[steroid]]s (for [[autoimmune disease]]s and several [[pulmonology|respiratory disorders]]). [[Insulin]] is used by many [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]]. Local preparations for use in [[otolaryngology]] often contain [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] equivalents of [[adrenaline]], while [[steroid]] and [[vitamin D]] creams are used extensively in [[dermatology|dermatological]] practice.

A "pharmacologic dose" or "supraphysiological dose" of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body. The effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful, though not without potentially adverse side effects. An example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of [[glucocorticoid]]s to suppress [[inflammation]].

== Hormone-behavior interactions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
At the neurological level, behavior can be inferred based on: hormone concentrations; hormone-release patterns; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription. Not only do hormones influence behavior, but also behavior and the environment influence hormones. Thus, a feedback loop is formed. For example, behavior can affect hormones, which in turn can affect behavior, which in turn can affect hormones, and so on.

Three broad stages of reasoning may be used when determining hormone-behavior interactions:
* The frequency of occurrence of a hormonally dependent behavior should correspond to that of its hormonal source
* A hormonally dependent behavior is not expected if the hormonal source (or its types of action) is non-existent
* The reintroduction of a missing behaviorally dependent hormonal source (or its types of action) is expected to bring back the absent behavior

== Comparison with neurotransmitters ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
There are various clear distinctions between hormones and [[neurotransmitter]]s:
* A hormone can perform functions over a larger spatial and temporal scale than can a neurotransmitter.
* Hormonal signals can travel virtually anywhere in the circulatory system, whereas neural signals are restricted to pre-existing nerve tracts
* Assuming the travel distance is equivalent, neural signals can be transmitted much more quickly (in the range of milliseconds) than can hormonal signals (in the range of seconds, minutes, or hours). Neural signals can be sent at speeds up to 100 meters per second.
* Neural signalling is an all-or-nothing (digital) action, whereas hormonal signalling is an action that can be continuously variable as dependent upon hormone concentration.

==Binding proteins==
Hormone transport and the involvement of binding proteins is an essential aspect when considering the function of hormones. There are several benefits with the formation of a complex with a binding protein: the effective half-life of the bound hormone is increased; a reservoir of bound hormones is created, which evens the variations in concentration of unbound hormones (bound hormones will replace the unbound hormones when these are eliminated).&lt;ref&gt;Boron WF, Boulpaep EL. Medical physiology : a cellular and molecular approach. Updated 2. Philadelphia, Pa: Saunders Elsevier; 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The discovery of hormones and endocrine signaling occurred during studies of how the digestive system regulates its activities, as explained at ''[[Secretin#Discovery|Secretin § Discovery]]''.

[[File:Allergy to Antibiotic Cefaclor.JPG|thumb|290x290px|The cardinal signs of inflammation include: pain, heat, redness, swelling, and loss of function. Some of these indicators can be seen here due to an allergic reaction.]]
'''Inflammation''' (from {{lang-la|[[wikt:en:inflammatio#Latin|inflammatio]]}}) is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as [[pathogen]]s, damaged cells, or irritants,&lt;ref name="pmid17223962"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferrero-Miliani L, Nielsen OH, Andersen PS, Girardin SE |title=Chronic inflammation: importance of NOD2 and NALP3 in interleukin-1beta generation |journal=Clin. Exp. Immunol. |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=061127015327006–– |date=February 2007 |pmid=17223962 |pmc=1810472 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03261.x |url=|last2=Nielsen |last3=Andersen |last4=Girardin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a protective response involving [[immune cells]], [[blood vessels]], and molecular mediators. The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury, clear out necrotic cells and tissues damaged from the original insult and the inflammatory process, and initiate tissue repair.

The five [[Cardinal sign (pathology)|classical signs of inflammation]] are heat, pain, redness, swelling, and [[Functio laesa|loss of function]] (Latin ''calor'', ''dolor'', ''rubor'', ''tumor'', and ''functio laesa'').{{ref}} Inflammation is a generic response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of [[innate immune system|innate immunity]], as compared to [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immunity]], which is specific for each pathogen.&lt;ref name="ABBAS"&gt;{{cite book | author = Abbas A.B. |author2=Lichtman A.H. | title = Basic Immunology. Functions and disorders of the immune system | edition = 3rd | year = 2009|  isbn =978-1-4160-4688-2 | pages = | chapter = Ch.2 Innate Immunity | editor = Saunders (Elsevier) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Too little inflammation could lead to progressive tissue destruction by the harmful stimulus (e.g. bacteria) and compromise the survival of the organism. In contrast, chronic inflammation may lead to a host of diseases, such as [[hay fever]], [[periodontitis]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and even cancer (e.g., [[gallbladder carcinoma]]). Inflammation is therefore normally closely regulated by the body.

Inflammation can be classified as either ''acute'' or ''chronic''. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] and [[leukocyte]]s (especially [[granulocyte]]s) from the blood into the injured tissues. A series of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local [[vascular system]], the [[immune system]], and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as ''chronic inflammation'', leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation, such as [[Mononuclear cell infiltration|mononuclear cells]], and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and [[healing]] of the tissue from the inflammatory process.

Inflammation is not a synonym for [[infection]]. Infection describes the interaction between the action of microbial invasion and the reaction of the body's inflammatory response — the two components are considered together when discussing an infection, and the word is used to imply a microbial invasive cause for the observed inflammatory reaction. Inflammation on the other hand describes purely the body's immunovascular response, whatever the cause may be. But because of how often the two are [[correlation|correlated]], words ending in the suffix ''[[wikt:-itis|-itis]]'' (which refers to inflammation) are sometimes informally described as referring to infection. For example, the word ''[[urethritis]]'' strictly means only "urethral inflammation", but clinical [[health care provider]]s usually discuss urethritis as a urethral infection because urethral microbial invasion is the most common cause of urethritis.

It is useful to differentiate inflammation and infection as there are many pathological situations where inflammation is not driven by microbial invasion – for example, [[atherosclerosis]], [[type III hypersensitivity]], [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], and [[ischemia]]. There are also pathological situations where microbial invasion does not result in classic inflammatory response—for example, [[parasitosis]], [[eosinophilia]].

Acute inflammation is a short-term process, usually appearing within a few minutes or hours and begins to cease upon the removal of the injurious stimulus.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; It involves a coordinated and systemic mobilization response locally of various immune, endocrine and neurological mediators of acute inflammation.

* [[Rubor]] (redness)
* Tumor ([[swelling (medical)|swelling]])
* [[Functio laesa]] (loss of function)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://thepoint.lww.com/Book/ShowWithResource/2931?resourceId=16419 |last=Werner |first=Ruth |publisher=Wolters Kluwer |year=2009 |title=A massage Therapist Guide to Pathology |edition=4th |isbn=978-0781769198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four (classical signs) were described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]] (ca. 30 BC–38 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Wolfgang H. |last=Vogel |first2=Andreas |last2=Berke |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_5pzrF1QocC&amp;pg=PA97 |title=Brief History of Vision and Ocular Medicine |publisher=Kugler Publications |page=97 |isbn=978-90-6299-220-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''loss of function'' was probably added later by [[Galen]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-7087-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Porth, Carol |title=Essentials of pahtophysiology: concepts of altered health states |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=270 |isbn=978-0-7817-7087-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the addition of this fifth sign has also been ascribed to [[Thomas Sydenham]]&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-11322-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dormandy, Thomas |title=The worst of evils: man's fight against pain |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |pages=22 |isbn=978-0-300-11322-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow|Virchow]].&lt;ref name="robspath"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease| last=Cotran|author2=Kumar, Collins| publisher=W.B Saunders Company| location=Philadelphia| isbn=978-0-7216-7335-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

Redness and heat are due to increased blood flow at body core temperature to the inflamed site; swelling is caused by accumulation of fluid; [[pain]] is due to the release of chemicals such as bradykinin and histamine that stimulate nerve endings. Loss of function has multiple causes.&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

Acute inflammation of the lung (usually caused in response to [[pneumonia]]) does not cause pain unless the inflammation involves the [[parietal pleura]], which does have [[nociceptor|pain-sensitive nerve endings]].&lt;ref name="ConcisePathology-Signs" /&gt;

=== Process of acute inflammation ===

[[File:Granulation tissue low power.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing granulation tissue. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
The process of acute inflammation is initiated by resident immune cells already present in the involved tissue, mainly resident [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]], [[histiocytes]], [[Kupffer cells]] and [[mast cell]]s. These cells possess surface receptors known as ''[[pattern recognition receptor]]s'' (PRRs), which recognize (i.e., bind) two subclasses of molecules: [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs) and [[damage-associated molecular pattern]]s (DAMPs). PAMPs are compounds that are associated with various [[pathogen]]s, but which are distinguishable from host molecules.  DAMPs are compounds that are associated with host-related injury and cell damage.

At the onset of an infection, burn, or other injuries, these cells undergo activation (one of the PRRs recognize a PAMP or DAMP) and release inflammatory mediators responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow causes the redness (''rubor'') and increased heat (''calor''). Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation (leakage) of [[blood plasma|plasma]] proteins and fluid into the tissue ([[edema]]), which manifests itself as swelling (''tumor''). Some of the released mediators such as [[bradykinin]] increase the sensitivity to pain ([[hyperalgesia]], ''dolor'').  The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes, mainly [[neutrophils]] and [[macrophages]], outside of the blood vessels (extravasation) into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a [[chemotactic]] gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; The loss of function (''functio laesa'') is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain.

In addition to cell-derived mediators, several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of preformed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the [[complement system]] activated by bacteria and the [[coagulation system|coagulation]] and [[fibrinolysis system]]s activated by [[necrosis]], e.g. a burn or a trauma.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

Acute inflammation may be regarded as the first line of defense against injury. Acute  inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators are short-lived and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence, acute inflammation begins to cease once the stimulus has been removed.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

== Vascular component ==

=== Vasodilation and increased permeability ===

As defined, acute inflammation is an immunovascular response to an inflammatory stimulus. This means acute inflammation can be broadly divided into a vascular phase that occurs first, followed by a cellular phase involving immune cells (more specifically myeloid [[granulocytes]] in the acute setting). The vascular component of acute inflammation involves the movement of [[Blood plasma|plasma fluid]], containing important [[protein]]s such as [[fibrin]] and [[immunoglobulin]]s ([[antibodies]]), into inflamed tissue.

Upon contact with PAMPs, tissue [[macrophages]] and [[mastocytes]] release vasoactive amines such as [[histamine]] and [[serotonin]], as well as [[eicosanoids]] such as [[prostaglandin E2]] and [[leukotriene B4]] to remodel the local vasculature. Macrophages and endothelial cells release [[nitric oxide]]. These mediators vasodilate and permeabilize the [[blood vessel]]s, which results in the net distribution of [[blood plasma]] from the vessel into the tissue space. The increased collection of fluid into the tissue causes it to swell ([[edema]]). This exuded tissue fluid contain various antimicrobial mediators from the plasma such as [[complement system|complement]], [[lysozyme]], [[antibodies]], which can immediately deal damage to microbes, and opsonise the microbes in preparation for the cellular phase. If the inflammatory stimulus is a lacerating wound, exuded [[platelet]]s, [[coagulation system|coagulant]]s, [[plasmin]] and [[kinin]]s can [[clot]] the wounded area and provide [[haemostasis]] in the first instance. These clotting mediators also provide a structural staging framework at the inflammatory tissue site in the form of a [[fibrin]] lattice – as would construction [[scaffolding]] at a construction site – for the purpose of aiding phagocytic debridement and [[wound healing|wound repair]] later on. Some of the exuded tissue fluid is also funnelled by [[lymphatics]] to the regional lymph nodes, flushing bacteria along to start the recognition and attack phase of the [[adaptive immune system]].

Acute inflammation is characterized by marked vascular changes, including [[vasodilation]], increased permeability and increased blood flow, which are induced by the actions of various inflammatory mediators. Vasodilation occurs first at the [[arteriole]] level, progressing to the [[capillary]] level, and brings about a net increase in the amount of blood present, causing the redness and heat of inflammation. Increased permeability of the vessels results in the movement of [[blood plasma|plasma]] into the tissues, with resultant ''[[stasis (medicine)|stasis]]'' due to the increase in the concentration of the cells within blood – a condition characterized by enlarged vessels packed with cells. Stasis allows [[leukocytes]] to marginate (move) along the [[endothelium]], a process critical to their recruitment into the tissues. Normal flowing blood prevents this, as the [[Shear stress|shearing force]] along the periphery of the vessels moves cells in the blood into the middle of the vessel.

=== Plasma cascade systems ===
* The [[complement system]], when activated, creates a cascade of chemical reactions that promotes [[Antibody opsonization|opsonization]], [[chemotaxis]], and [[agglutination (biology)|agglutination]], and produces the [[Membrane attack complex|MAC]].
* The [[kinin system]] generates proteins capable of sustaining vasodilation and other physical inflammatory effects.
* The [[coagulation system]] or ''clotting cascade'', which forms a protective protein mesh over sites of injury.
* The [[fibrinolysis system]], which acts in opposition to the ''coagulation system'', to counterbalance clotting and generate several other inflammatory mediators.

== Cellular component ==
The ''cellular component'' involves [[leukocyte]]s, which normally reside in blood and must move into the inflamed tissue via ''extravasation'' to aid in inflammation. Some act as [[phagocyte]]s, ingesting [[bacteria]], viruses, and cellular debris. Others release enzymatic [[granule (cell biology)|granules]] that damage pathogenic invaders. Leukocytes also release inflammatory mediators that develop and maintain the inflammatory response. In general, acute inflammation is mediated by [[granulocyte]]s, whereas chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as [[monocyte]]s and [[lymphocyte]]s.

=== Leukocyte extravasation ===
[[File:NeutrophilerAktion.svg|200px|thumb|right|Neutrophils migrate from blood vessels to the infected tissue via chemotaxis, where they remove pathogens through phagocytosis and degranulation]]
[[File:Immune response.svg|thumb|Inflammation is a process by which the body's white blood cells and substances they produce protect us from infection with foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses. The (phagocytes)White blood cells are a nonspecific immune response, meaning that they attack any foreign bodies. However, in some diseases, like arthritis, the body's defense system the immune system triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. In these diseases, called autoimmune diseases, the body's normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues. The body responds as if normal tissues are infected or somehow abnormal.]]
{{Main|Leukocyte extravasation}}
Various [[leukocyte]]s, particularly neutrophils, are critically involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These cells must be able to move to the site of injury from their usual location in the blood, therefore mechanisms exist to recruit and direct leukocytes to the appropriate place. The process of leukocyte movement from the blood to the tissues through the blood vessels is known as ''extravasation'', and can be broadly divided up into a number of steps:
# '''Leukocyte margination and endothelial adhesion:''' The white blood cells within the vessels which are generally centrally located move peripherally towards the walls of the vessels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muir's Textbook of Pathology|last=Herrington|first=Simon|publisher=CRC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1444184990 |edition=15th |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activated macrophages in the tissue release [[cytokines]] such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]] and [[TNFα]], which in turn leads to production of [[chemokine]]s that bind to [[proteoglycan]]s forming gradient in the inflamed tissue and along the [[endothelial]] wall. Inflammatory cytokines induce the immediate expression of [[P-selectin]] on endothelial cell surfaces and P-selectin binds weakly to carbohydrate ligands on the surface of leukocytes and causes them to "roll" along the endothelial surface as bonds are made and broken. Cytokines released from injured cells induce the expression of [[E-selectin]] on endothelial cells, which functions similarly to P-selectin. Cytokines also induce the expression of [[integrin]] ligands such as [[ICAM-1]] and [[VCAM-1]] on endothelial cells, which mediate the adhesion and further slow leukocytes down. These weakly bound leukocytes are free to detach if not activated by chemokines produced in injured tissue after [[signal transduction]] via respective [[G protein-coupled receptors]] that activates integrins on the leukocyte surface for firm adhesion. Such activation increases the affinity of bound integrin receptors for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelial cell surface, firmly binding the leukocytes to the endothelium.
# '''Migration across the endothelium, known as'' transmigration, ''via the process of [[diapedesis]]:''' Chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to move between adjacent endothelial cells. The endothelial cells retract and the leukocytes pass through the basement membrane into the surrounding tissue using adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Movement of leukocytes within the tissue via [[chemotaxis]]:''' Leukocytes reaching the tissue interstitium bind to [[extracellular matrix]] proteins via expressed integrins and [[CD44]] to prevent them from leaving the site. A variety of molecules behave as [[chemoattractant]]s, for example, C3a or C5, and cause the leukocytes to move along a chemotactic gradient towards the source of inflammation.

=== Phagocytosis ===
{{Main|Phagocyte}}
Extravasated neutrophils in the cellular phase come into contact with microbes at the inflamed tissue. [[Phagocyte]]s express cell-surface endocytic [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific [[microbe-associated molecular patterns]] (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate [[phagocytosis]] are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as [[mannans]] and β-[[glucans]], [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS), [[peptidoglycans]], and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with [[C-type lectin]] receptors binding to mannans and β-glucans, and [[scavenger receptor (immunology)|scavenger receptor]]s binding to LPS.

Upon endocytic PRR binding, [[actin]]-[[myosin]] [[cytoskeletal]] rearrangement adjacent to the plasma membrane occurs in a way that endocytoses the plasma membrane containing the PRR-PAMP complex, and the microbe. [[Phosphatidylinositol]] and [[Vps34]]-[[PIK3R4|Vps15]]-[[BECN1|Beclin1]] signalling pathways have been implicated to traffic the endocytosed phagosome to intracellular [[lysosomes]], where fusion of the phagosome and the lysosome produces a phagolysosome. The [[reactive oxygen species]], [[superoxides]] and [[hypochlorite]] bleach within the phagolysosomes then kill microbes inside the phagocyte.

Phagocytic efficacy can be enhanced by [[opsonization]]. Plasma derived complement [[C3b]]  and antibodies that exude into the inflamed tissue during the vascular phase bind to and coat the microbial antigens. As well as endocytic PRRs, phagocytes also express [[opsonin]] receptors [[Fc receptor]] and [[complement receptor 1]] (CR1), which bind to antibodies and C3b, respectively. The co-stimulation of endocytic PRR and opsonin receptor increases the efficacy of the phagocytic process, enhancing the [[lysosomal]] elimination of the infective agent.

== Morphologic patterns ==
Specific patterns of acute and chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an [[epithelial]] surface, or [[pyogenic]] bacteria are involved.
* '''Granulomatous inflammation:''' Characterised by the formation of [[granuloma]]s, they are the result of a limited but diverse number of diseases, which include among others [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[sarcoidosis]], and [[syphilis]].
* '''Fibrinous inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in a large increase in vascular permeability allows [[fibrin]] to pass through the blood vessels. If an appropriate ''procoagulative'' stimulus is present, such as cancer cells,&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; a fibrinous exudate is deposited. This is commonly seen in [[serous membrane|serous cavities]], where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function. The deposit sometimes forms a pseudomembrane sheet. During inflammation of the intestine ([[Pseudomembranous colitis]]), pseudomembranous tubes can be formed.
* '''Purulent inflammation:''' Inflammation resulting in large amount of [[pus]], which consists of neutrophils, dead cells, and fluid. Infection by pyogenic bacteria such as [[staphylococci]] is characteristic of this kind of inflammation. Large, localised collections of pus enclosed by surrounding tissues are called [[abscess]]es.
* '''Serous inflammation:''' Characterised by the copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid, commonly produced by [[mesothelial]] cells of [[serous membrane]]s, but may be derived from blood plasma. Skin [[blister]]s exemplify this pattern of inflammation.
* '''Ulcerative inflammation:''' Inflammation occurring near an epithelium can result in the [[necrotic]] loss of tissue from the surface, exposing lower layers. The subsequent excavation in the epithelium is known as an [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]].

== Inflammatory disorders ==

Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders that underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, demonstrated in both [[allergic reaction]]s and some [[myopathies]], with many [[immune system disorder]]s resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with causal origins in inflammatory processes include cancer, [[atherosclerosis]], and [[ischaemic heart disease|ischemic heart disease]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Atherosclerosis ===

{{main|Atherosclerosis}}
Atherosclerosis, formerly considered a bland lipid storage disease, actually involves an ongoing inflammatory response. Recent advances in basic science have established a fundamental role for inflammation in mediating all stages of this disease from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. These new findings provide important links between risk factors and the mechanisms of atherogenesis. Clinical studies have shown that this emerging biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis applies directly to human patients. Elevation in markers of inflammation predicts outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes, independently of myocardial damage. In addition, low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by levels of the inflammatory marker [[C-reactive protein]], prospectively defines risk of atherosclerotic complications, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors. Moreover, certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. In the case of lipid lowering with statins, this anti-inflammatory effect does not appear to correlate with reduction in low-density lipoprotein levels. These new insights into inflammation in atherosclerosis not only increase our understanding of this disease but also have practical clinical applications in risk stratification and targeting of therapy for this scourge of growing worldwide importance.&lt;ref name="pmid12490960"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libby|first=P|title=Inflammation in atherosclerosis.|journal=Nature|date=Dec 19–26, 2002|volume=420|issue=6917|pages=868–74|doi=10.1038/nature01323|pmid=12490960|bibcode=2002Natur.420..868L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergy ===
An allergic reaction, formally known as [[Type I hypersensitivity|type 1 hypersensitivity]], is the result of an inappropriate immune response triggering inflammation, vasodilation, and nerve irritation. A common example is [[hay fever]], which is caused by a hypersensitive response by [[mast cell]]s to [[allergen]]s. Pre-sensitised mast cells respond by [[degranulation|degranulating]], releasing [[vasoactive]] chemicals such as histamine. These chemicals propagate an excessive inflammatory response characterised by blood vessel dilation, production of pro-inflammatory molecules, cytokine release, and recruitment of leukocytes.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Severe inflammatory response may mature into a systemic response known as [[anaphylaxis]].

=== Myopathies ===
Inflammatory myopathies are caused by the immune system inappropriately attacking components of muscle, leading to signs of muscle inflammation. They may occur in conjunction with other immune disorders, such as [[systemic sclerosis]], and include [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], and [[inclusion body myositis]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Leukocyte defects ===
Due to the central role of leukocytes in the development and propagation of inflammation, defects in leukocyte functionality often result in a decreased capacity for inflammatory defense with subsequent vulnerability to infection.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Dysfunctional leukocytes may be unable to correctly bind to blood vessels due to surface receptor mutations, digest bacteria ([[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]]), or produce [[microbicide]]s ([[chronic granulomatous disease]]). In addition, diseases affecting the [[bone marrow]] may result in abnormal or few leukocytes.

=== Pharmacological ===
Certain drugs or exogenous chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. [[Vitamin A]] deficiency causes an increase in inflammatory responses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiedermann U |title=Vitamin A deficiency increases inflammatory responses |journal=Scand J Immunol. |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=578–584 |year=1996 |pmid=8972739 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-351.x |name-list-format=vanc |display-authors=1 |last2=Chen |first2=X.-J. |last3=Enerback |first3=L. |last4=Hanson |first4=L.

Such an approach may limit side effects that are unrelated to the tumor of interest, and may help preserve vital homeostatic functions and developmental processes in the organism.

According to a review of 2009, recent data suggests that cancer-related inflammation (CRI) may lead to accumulation of random genetic alterations in cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid19468060"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colotta F, Allavena P, Sica A, Garlanda C, Mantovani A |title=Cancer-related inflammation, the seventh hallmark of cancer: links to genetic instability |journal=Carcinogenesis |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=1073–81 |date=July 2009  |pmid=19468060 |doi=10.1093/carcin/bgp127 |type=review|last2=Allavena |last3=Sica |last4=Garlanda |last5=Mantovani }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A normal cell may undergo [[carcinogenesis]] to become a cancer cell if it is frequently subjected to DNA damage during long periods of chronic inflammation.  DNA damages may cause genetic [[mutation]]s due to [[DNA repair#Translecion synthesis|inaccurate repair]].  In addition, mistakes in the DNA repair process may cause [[Cancer epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shacter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ding /&gt;  Mutations and epigenetic alterations that are replicated and provide a selective advantage during somatic cell proliferation may be carcinogenic.

Genome-wide analyses of human cancer tissues reveal that a single typical cancer cell may possess roughly 100 mutations in [[coding region]]s, 10-20 of which are [[carcinogenesis|“driver mutations”]] that contribute to cancer development.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;  However, chronic inflammation also causes epigenetic changes such as [[DNA methylation in cancer|DNA methylation]]s, that are often more common than mutations.  Typically, several hundreds to thousands of genes are methylated in a cancer cell (see [[DNA methylation in cancer]]).  Sites of oxidative damage in [[chromatin]] can recruit complexes that contain [[DNA methyltransferase]]s (DNMTs), a histone deacetylase ([[sirtuin 1|SIRT1]]), and a [[EZH2|histone methyltransferase (EZH2)]], and thus induce DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=Chiba /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22094255"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Hagan HM, Wang W, Sen S, Destefano Shields C, Lee SS, Zhang YW, Clements EG, Cai Y, Van Neste L, Easwaran H, Casero RA, Sears CL, Baylin SB |title=Oxidative damage targets complexes containing DNA methyltransferases, SIRT1, and polycomb members to promoter CpG Islands |journal=Cancer Cell |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=606–19 |year=2011 |pmid=22094255 |pmc=3220885 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2011.09.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28522752"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maiuri AR, Peng M, Sriramkumar S, Kamplain CM, DeStefano Shields CE, Sears CL, O'Hagan HM |title=Mismatch Repair Proteins Initiate Epigenetic Alterations during Inflammation-Driven Tumorigenesis |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=77 |issue=13 |pages=3467–3478 |year=2017 |pmid=28522752 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0056 |pmc=5516887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA methylation of a [[CpG site|CpG island]] in a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter region]] may cause silencing of its downstream gene (see [[CpG site]] and [[regulation of transcription in cancer]]).

The feed-forward nature of this inflammatory response produces chronic inflammation and tissue injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doitsh|first=Gilad|last2=Greene|first2=Warner C.|date=2016-03-09|title=Dissecting How CD4 T Cells Are Lost During HIV Infection|journal=Cell Host &amp; Microbe|volume=19|issue=3|pages=280–291|doi=10.1016/j.chom.2016.02.012|pmc=4835240|pmid=26962940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying pyroptosis as the predominant mechanism that causes CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation, provides novel therapeutic opportunities, namely caspase-1 which controls the pyroptotic pathway. In this regard, pyroptosis of CD4 T cells and secretion of pro-inflmammatory cytokines such as [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1β]] and [[Interleukin 18|IL-18]] can be blocked in HIV-infected human lymphoid tissues by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765,&lt;ref name="Doitsh 509–514"/&gt; which has already proven to be safe and well tolerated in phase II human clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01048255|title=Study of VX-765 in Subjects With Treatment-resistant Partial Epilepsy - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings could propel development of an entirely new class of “anti-AIDS” therapies that act by targeting the host rather than the virus. Such agents would almost certainly be used in combination with ART. By promoting “tolerance” of the virus instead of suppressing its replication, VX-765 or related drugs may mimic the evolutionary solutions occurring in multiple monkey hosts (e.g. the sooty mangabey) infected with species-specific lentiviruses that have led to a lack of disease, no decline in CD4 T-cell counts, and no chronic inflammation.

=== Resolution of inflammation ===
The inflammatory response must be actively terminated when no longer needed to prevent unnecessary "bystander" damage to tissues.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;  Failure to do so results in chronic inflammation, and cellular destruction. Resolution of inflammation occurs by different mechanisms in different tissues.
Mechanisms that serve to terminate inflammation include:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eming |first=S. A. |first2=T. |last2=Krieg |first3=J.

{{Cquote|Acute inflammation normally resolves by mechanisms that have remained somewhat elusive. Emerging evidence now suggests that an active, coordinated program of resolution initiates in the first few hours after an inflammatory response begins. After entering tissues, [[granulocyte]]s promote the switch of [[arachidonic acid]]–derived [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s to lipoxins, which initiate the termination sequence. [[Neutrophil]] recruitment thus ceases and programmed death by [[apoptosis]] is engaged. These events coincide with the biosynthesis, from [[omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids]], of [[resolvins]] and [[Neuroprotectin|protectins]], which critically shorten the period of neutrophil infiltration by initiating apoptosis. As a consequence, apoptotic neutrophils undergo [[phagocytosis]] by [[macrophage]]s, leading to neutrophil clearance and release of anti-inflammatory and reparative [[cytokines]] such as transforming growth factor-β1.

There is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-200|pmid=24228900|pmc=3846682|year=2013|author1=Berk|first1=M|title=So depression is an inflammatory disease, but where does the inflammation come from?|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=11|pages=200|last2=Williams|first2=L.

In addition there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines, setting the brain into a "sickness mode".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/04/depression-allergic-reaction-inflammation-immune-system|title=Is depression a kind of allergic reaction?|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2015-01-04|last1=Williams|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical symptoms of being physically sick like lethargy show a large overlap in behaviors that characterize depression.

Inflammations that lead to serious depression could be caused by common infections such as those caused by a virus, bacteria or even parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/2045-5380-4-10|title=Reconceptualizing major depressive disorder as an infectious disease|journal=Biology of Mood &amp; Anxiety Disorders|volume=4|pages=10|year=2014|last1=Canli|first1=Turhan|pmc=4215336|pmid=25364500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systemic effects ==
An [[infectious organism]] can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the [[circulatory system]] or [[lymphatic system]], where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby [[lymph vessel]]s. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as [[lymphangitis]], and infection of a lymph node is known as [[lymphadenitis]]. When lymph nodes cannot destroy all pathogens, the infection spreads further. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system.

When inflammation overwhelms the host, [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] is diagnosed. When it is due to [[infection]], the term [[sepsis]] is applied, with the terms [[bacteremia]] being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and [[viremia]] specifically to viral sepsis. [[Vasodilation]] and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to [[septic shock]] and death.

=== Acute-phase proteins ===
Inflammation also induces high systemic levels of [[acute-phase protein]]s. In acute inflammation, these proteins prove beneficial; however, in chronic inflammation they can contribute to [[amyloidosis]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; These proteins include [[C-reactive protein]], [[serum amyloid A]], and [[serum amyloid P]], which cause a range of systemic effects including:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=25em}}
* [[Fever]]
* Increased [[blood pressure]]
* Decreased [[sweating]]
* [[Malaise]]
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
* [[Somnolence]]
{{div col end}}

=== Leukocyte numbers ===
Inflammation often affects the numbers of leukocytes present in the body:
* [[Leukocytosis]] is often seen during inflammation induced by infection, where it results in a large increase in the amount of leukocytes in the blood, especially immature cells. Leukocyte numbers usually increase to between 15 000 and 20 000 cells per microliter, but extreme cases can see it approach 100 000 cells per microliter.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt; Bacterial infection usually results in an increase of [[neutrophil]]s, creating [[neutrophilia]], whereas diseases such as [[asthma]], [[hay fever]], and parasite infestation result in an increase in [[eosinophil]]s, creating [[eosinophilia]].&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;
* [[Leukopenia]] can be induced by certain infections and diseases, including viral infection, ''[[Rickettsia]]'' infection, some [[protozoa]], [[tuberculosis]], and some [[cancer]]s.&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

=== Systemic inflammation and obesity ===
With the discovery of [[interleukin]]s (IL), the concept of [[systemic inflammation]] developed. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but involves the [[endothelium]] and other organ systems.

Chronic inflammation is widely observed in obesity.&lt;ref name=ParimisettyDorsemans2016&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Parimisetty A, Dorsemans AC, Awada R, Ravanan P, Diotel N, Lefebvre d'Hellencourt C|title=Secret talk between adipose tissue and central nervous system via secreted factors-an emerging frontier in the neurodegenerative research|journal=J Neuroinflammation|volume=13|issue=1|pages=67|date=Mar 24, 2016|pmid=27012931|pmc=4806498|doi=10.1186/s12974-016-0530-x|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kershaw |first=E.

Low-grade chronic inflammation is characterized by a two- to threefold increase in the systemic concentrations of cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=A.

The body attacks fat like it does bacteria and fungi. When expanded fat cells leak or break open, macrophages mobilize to clean up and embed into the adipose tissue. Then macrophages release inflammatory chemicals, including TNF-α and IL-6. TNF's primary role is to regulate the immune cells and induce inflammation. White blood cells then assist by releasing more [[cytokine]]s. This link between adiposity and inflammation has been shown to produce 10–35% of IL-6 in a resting individual, and this production increases with increasing adiposity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Subcutaneous adipose tissue releases interleukin-6, but not tumor necrosis factor-α, in vivo |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |year=1997 |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=4196–4200 |doi=10.1210/jc.82.12.4196 |pmid=9398739 |author1=Mohamed-Ali |first1=V |last2=Goodrick |first2=S |last3=Rawesh |first3=A |last4=Katz |first4=D.

Loss of [[white adipose tissue]] reduces levels of inflammation markers.&lt;ref name=ParimisettyDorsemans2016 /&gt; The association of systemic inflammation with [[insulin resistance]] and [[atherosclerosis]] is the subject of intense research.&lt;ref name=Stitzinger&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/9729/11/01.pdf |publisher= The digital repository of Leiden University |title= Lipids, inflammation and atherosclerosis |author=M Stitzinger |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |format= pdf|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the obese mouse models, inflammation and [[macrophage]]-specific genes are upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT). There were also signs of dramatic increase in circulating [[insulin]] level, adipocyte lipolysis and formation of [[multinucleate]] [[giant cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chronic Inflammation in Fat Plays a Crucial Role in the Development of Obesity-Related Insulin Resistance |journal=J Clin Invest |year=2003 |volume=112 |issue=12 |pages=1821–30 |doi=10.1172/JCI19451 |pmid=14679177 |pmc=296998 |author1=Xu |first1=H |last2=Barnes |first2=G.

Higher than normal Angptl2 level in fat tissues develop inflammation as well as insulin and leptin resistance. Stored fat secretes leptin to signal satiety. Leptin resistance plays a role in the process where appetite overrules the message of satiety. Angptl2 then starts an inflammatory cascade causing blood vessels to remodel and attract macrophages. Angptl2 is an adipocyte-derived inflammatory mediator linking obesity to systemic insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=KadomatsuTabata2011&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kadomatsu T, Tabata M, Oike Y|title=Angiopoietin-like proteins: emerging targets for treatment of obesity and related metabolic diseases|journal=FEBS J|volume=278|issue=4|pages=559–64|date=Feb 2011|pmid=21182596|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/73/12/73_CJ-09-0710/_pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07979.x|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that, as an inflammatory marker, [[Leptin#Clinical significance|leptin responds specifically]] to adipose-derived [[Proinflammatory cytokine|inflammatory cytokines]].

== Outcomes ==
[[File:Scar (xndr).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Scars present on the skin, evidence of fibrosis and healing of a wound]]
The outcome in a particular circumstance will be determined by the tissue in which the injury has occurred and the injurious agent that is causing it. Here are the possible outcomes to inflammation:&lt;ref name="robspath" /&gt;

# '''Resolution'''&lt;br /&gt;The complete restoration of the inflamed tissue back to a normal status. Inflammatory measures such as vasodilation, chemical production, and leukocyte infiltration cease, and damaged [[parenchyma]]l cells regenerate. In situations where limited or short-lived inflammation has occurred this is usually the outcome.
# '''[[Fibrosis]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Large amounts of tissue destruction, or damage in tissues unable to regenerate, cannot be regenerated completely by the body. Fibrous [[scarring]] occurs in these areas of damage, forming a scar composed primarily of [[collagen]]. The scar will not contain any specialized structures, such as [[parenchyma]]l cells, hence functional impairment may occur.
# '''Abscess formation'''&lt;br /&gt;A cavity is formed containing pus, an opaque liquid containing dead white blood cells and bacteria with general debris from destroyed cells.
# '''Chronic inflammation'''&lt;br /&gt;In acute inflammation, if the injurious agent persists then chronic inflammation will ensue. This process, marked by inflammation lasting many days, months or even years, may lead to the formation of a [[chronic wound]]. Chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue. These cells are powerful defensive agents of the body, but the [[toxin]]s they release (including [[reactive oxygen species]]) are injurious to the organism's own tissues as well as invading agents. As a consequence, chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction.

== Examples ==
Inflammation is usually indicated by adding the suffix "[[wikt:-itis|itis]]", as shown below. However, some conditions such as [[asthma]] and [[pneumonia]] do not follow this convention. More examples are available at [[list of types of inflammation]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Diet and inflammation ==
The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is a score (number) that describes the potential of diet to modulate systemic inflammation within the body.  As stated chronic inflammation is linked to most chronic diseases including arthritis, many types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, and diabetes.

== Exercise and inflammation ==

===Exercise-induced acute inflammation===

Acute inflammation of the [[muscle cells]], as understood in exercise physiology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilmore|first=Jack|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise|year=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=978-0-7360-5583-3|pages=26–36, 98–120, 186–250, 213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; can result after [[Muscle contraction|induced]] [[Eccentric contraction|eccentric]] and [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] muscle training.  Participation in eccentric training and conditioning, including resistance training and activities that emphasize eccentric lengthening of the [[muscle]] including downhill running on a moderate to high incline can result in considerable soreness within 24 to 48 hours, even though [[blood lactate]] levels, previously thought to cause muscle soreness, were much higher with level running.  This [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS) results from structural damage to the contractile filaments and [[Muscle cells|z-disks]], which has been noted especially in [[marathon runner]]s whose muscle fibers revealed [[Myopathy|remarkable damage]] to the muscle fibers after both training and marathon competition &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/recent-research-provides-insight-into-muscle-soreness|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise 5E: Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness|work=human-kinetics|access-date=2017-06-04|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.  The onset and timing of this gradient damage to the muscle parallels the degree of muscle soreness experienced by the runners.

Z-disks are the point of contact for the contractile proteins.  They provide structural support for transmission of force when muscle fibers are activated to shorten.  However, in marathon runners and those who subscribe to the overload principle to enhance their muscles, show moderate Z-disk streaming and major disruption of thick and thin filaments in parallel groups of sarcomeres as a result of the force of eccentric actions or stretching of tightened muscle fibers.

This disruption of muscle fibers triggers white blood cells to increase following induced muscle soreness, leading to the inflammatory response observation from induced muscle soreness. Elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure are concluded to be associated with inflammatory response. High tension in the contractile-elastic system of muscle results in structural damage to the muscle fiber and plasmalemma and its epimysium, perimysium, and/or endomysium.  The mysium damage disrupts calcium homeostasis in injured fibers and fiber bundles, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 48 hours after exercise.  The products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents (such as histamines, kinins, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) accumulate outside cells. These substances then stimulate free nerve endings in the muscle; a process that appears accentuated by eccentric exercise, in which large forces are distributed over a relatively small cross-sectional area of the muscle&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s, including but not limited to those cited in the above description, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases. The new view that muscle is an endocrine organ is transforming our understanding of exercise physiology and with it, of the role of inflammation in adaptation to stress.&lt;ref name="inflammation-metabolism.dk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedersen|first=BK|date=Jul 2013|title=Muscle as a secretory organ|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1337–62|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|isbn=9780470650714|pmid=23897689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the above, IL-6 had previously been classified as a proinflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise-induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage.&lt;ref name="pmid9130176"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bruunsgaard H, Galbo H, Halkjaer-Kristensen J, Johansen TL, MacLean DA, Pedersen BK | title = Exercise-induced increase in serum interleukin-6 in humans is related to muscle damage | journal = Journal of Physiology | volume = 499 | issue = Pt 3| pages = 833–41 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9130176 | pmc = 1159298 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp021972| last2 = Galbo | last3 = Halkjaer-Kristensen | last4 = Johansen | last5 = MacLean | last6 = Pedersen }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric “nondamaging” muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid23897689"&gt;{{cite book | author = Pedersen BK | title = Muscle as a secretory organ | journal = Compr Physiol | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 1337–62 |date=July 2013 | pmid = 23897689 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c120033 | isbn = 9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work has shown that both upstream and downstream signalling pathways for IL-6 differ markedly between myocytes and macrophages. It appears that unlike IL-6 signalling in macrophages, which is dependent upon activation of the NFκB signalling pathway, intramuscular IL-6 expression is regulated by a network of signalling cascades, including the Ca2+/NFAT and glycogen/p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, when IL-6 is signalling in monocytes or macrophages, it creates a pro-inflammatory response, whereas IL-6 activation and signalling in muscle is totally independent of a preceding TNF-response or NFκB activation, and is anti-inflammatory.&lt;ref name="TheRole"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brandt C |author2=Pedersen BK|title=The role of exercise-induced myokines in muscle homeostasis and the defense against chronic diseases |journal=Journal of Biomedicine &amp; Biotechnology|year=2010|volume=2010|pages=1–6|pmid=20224659|doi=10.1155/2010/520258|pmc=2836182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies show that markers of inflammation are reduced following longer-term behavioural changes involving both reduced energy intake and a regular program of increased physical activity, and that, in particular, IL-6 was miscast as an inflammatory marker. For example, the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 have been demonstrated by IL-6 stimulating the production of the classical anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10.&lt;ref name="TheRole" /&gt; As such, individuals pursuing exercise as a means to treat the causal factors underlying chronic inflammation are pursuing a course of action strongly supported by current research, as an inactive lifestyle is strongly associated with the development and progression of multiple inflammatory diseases. Note that cautions regarding over-exertion may apply in certain cases, as discussed above, though this concern rarely applies to the general population.

===Signal-to-noise theory===

Given that localized acute inflammation is a necessary component for muscle growth, and that chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with a disruption of anabolic signals initiating muscle growth, it has been theorized that a [[signal-to-noise]] model may best describe the relationship between inflammation and muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;Pilon, Brad. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160509091232/http://www.inflammationtheory.com/ Inflammation Affects Your Ability to Build Muscle]" ''Inflammation Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; By keeping the "noise" of chronic inflammation to a minimum, the localized acute inflammatory response signals a stronger anabolic response than could be achieved with higher levels of chronic inflammation.

'''John Kenneth Major''' [[Royal Institute of British Architects|ARIBA]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]], popularly known as '''Ken Major''' (21 October 1928 – 25 July 2009) was an [[architect]], [[author]] and world authority on [[industrial archaeology]], particularly [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s and [[animal engine|animal powered machines]].&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windmillworld.com/news/current.htm |title=Ken Major 1928–2009 |publisher=Windmill World |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Intl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagelink.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/heritage-link-update-no-31.pdf |title=HERITAGE LINK UPDATE No 31 — 15 September 2003 |publisher=Heritage Link |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727093031/http://www.heritagelink.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/heritage-link-update-no-31.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobhamheritage.org.uk/History_SkiltonsYard.html |title=Skilton's Yard |author=David Taylor |publisher=Cobham Conservation &amp; Heritage Trust |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402125401/http://www.cobhamheritage.org.uk/History_SkiltonsYard.html |archivedate= 2 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an author, he was known as '''J Kenneth Major'''.

==Early life==

Ken Major was born in [[Reading, Berkshire]] on 21 October 1928.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6787679.ece |title=Kenneth Major: heritage architect and author |publisher=The Times |accessdate=8 August 2009 | location=London | date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Katharine May Major (née Ridge) and John William Major. He was christened John Kenneth Major but owing to a number of John Majors in the family he was generally referred to as Ken.&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millsarchivetrust.org/images/uploads/documents/8485.doc |title=JOHN KENNETH MAJOR |author=John Kenneth Major |publisher=Mills Archive |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major attended the Boy's Grammar School at [[Leigh, Lancashire|Leigh]], [[Lancashire]], where his father was the [[Head teacher|headmaster]], from 1939 to 1945. He then attended a school in Kendal until 1946. Major was interested in ancient buildings from an early age. He recalled cycling to [[Winwick, Cheshire|Winwick]] [[St Oswald's Church, Winwick|church]] aged 8 to see the carved pig (symbolic of a legend about the church being relocated to a pre-Christian site) there.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Higher education==

Owing to the high number of demobbed ex-servicemen, Major was unable to gain a place at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] where his results would have enabled him to study [[mathematics]]. He was able to obtain a place at King's College, [[Durham University]] in Newcastle upon Tyne where he studied [[architecture]] under the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts regime]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

During his time at King's College, Major switched from design to repair. He visited [[Florence]], [[Italy]] where he studied the repair of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance buildings]] damaged in the [[Second World War|war]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; In 1952, he applied for and obtained the Lethaby Scholarship from the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] (SPAB).&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

==Career==
===Professional===
On completing his Scholarship in April 1953, Major was appointed as an architect at the Planning Department of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]], [[London]]. In April 1954, he married Helen Lawrence after a four-year courtship. They both had an interest in ancient building and in 1958 the purchase of a [[Lambretta]] [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] enabled them to travel further afield.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; In 1956, Major joined [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]] where his work involved the design of bus garages.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In May 1961, Major visited the [[Hudson River]] to research the construction of a [[watermill]] at [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]]. As the original settlers of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and Sleepy Hollow had come from [[East Anglia]], measured drawings of [[Woodbridge Tide Mill]] were prepared to assist the restoration.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

On his return from the [[United States]], Major joined architect and [[goldsmith]] [[Louis Osman]] as his assistant. His main work while with Osman was the restoration of [[List of Grade I listed buildings in Dorset|Ranston House]], [[Iwerne Courtney]], [[Dorset]]. In July 1963, Major joined Morgan and Branch, architects. He was involved in the redevelopment of [[Doncaster]] town centre including a new [[Movie theater|cinema]] for [[Associated British Cinemas|ABC]] and a new [[library]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

After this, Major then joined [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith Borough Council]] where he was in charge of the building of the [[White City, London|White City]] scheme. The scheme was cancelled and Major joined [[Westminster City Council]] where he was in charge of a scheme at Lisson Green, which was in limbo after the [[Ronan Point]] disaster. Following this, Major was in charge of the redevelopment of parts of [[Westbourne Grove]] where 101 properties formerly owned by [[Peter Rachman]] were repaired and converted to make them suitable for use by council tenants. Major later took charge of Westminster City Council's maintenance team. In 1975, Major was appointed Assistant City Architect to Westminster City Council. In 1984 his department was closed by the Council and Major commenced practice on his own account.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Initial work in private practice involved finishing off various schemes from Westminster City Council.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Major was involved in the restoration of the [[waterwheel]] ({{convert|36|ft|m|2}} diameter and {{convert|2|ft|9|in|m|2}} wide) at [[Painshill Park]], [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]], [[Surrey]]. Other work included the repair of [[Stainsby Mill]], [[Doe Lea]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Gelli Groes]] mill, [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] and [[Thornhaugh|Sacrewell Mill]], [[Wansford, Cambridgeshire|Wansford]], [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; As well as mills, Major was involved in conservation and restoration of a number of [[church (building)|churches]]. Other buildings Major was involved with include Churchgate House, [[Cookham]], Berkshire and a 13th-century cottage at [[Mowsley]], [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

===Molinological===

In 1963, [[Rex Wailes]] invited Major to assist him in carrying out a survey of mills in [[Berkshire]]. Following this, the [[Isle of Wight]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Wiltshire]] were covered. Major also conducted a survey of the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]], listing all artefacts surviving and producing a map at a scale of 2 inches to the mile (1:31,680). The resulting map was {{convert|18|ft|m|2}} long.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

In 1964, Major met João Miguel dos Santos Simões who was at that time trying to get the various individual mill societies together. This led to the formation of [[The International Molinological Society]] in 1973,&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; of which Major was a founder member.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; Major became chairman in 1977 and remained in that position until 1993. In 1970, Major's first book, ''Mills of the Isle of Wight'' was published. The publishing in 1978 of ''Animal-Powered Engines'' marked the first in-depth study of that subject.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

Apart from his work for the SPAB, Major was also an advisor for other national heritage organisations, such as [[English Heritage]],&lt;ref name=Ullesthorpe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ullesthorpewindmill.org.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=2 |title=Ullesthorpe Windmill| publisher=Ullesthorpe Windmill Project |accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and other bodies concerned with mill preservation. He was also a founding trustee of the [[Mills Archive|Mills Archive Trust]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

==Death==

Major died on 25 July 2009 after a short illness. His funeral took place on 6 August 2009 at Reading Crematorium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">[[Image:Wiki-lcp.png|thumb|right|An Illustration of a couple demonstrating the lateral coital position.]]
The '''lateral coital position''' is a [[list of sex positions|sex position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]] in their ''Human Sexual Response''. The position was preferred by 75% of their [[heterosexual]] respondents once they had tried it.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

==Technique==
Moving into this position requires that the partners begin with [[Woman on top (sex position)|woman on top sexual position]] with penis penetrating the woman and then:

# The man lifts the woman's right leg up slightly with his left hand.
# The man begins to bend his left knee without lifting his knee from the bed.  Instead, he slides his left knee outwards as it bends, opening his left inner thigh towards the ceiling. He slides his left leg upward and outward until it has passed underneath her lifted right knee.
# Meanwhile, the woman leans to ''her'' left, and places her weight on her left knee. This allows her to straighten out her lifted right leg behind her, placing it inside her partner's bent left leg.  Care must be taken at this point that the penis does not slip out.
# Once the legs are switched, the woman leans forward to the man's chest.  He holds her body firmly against his body with both arms.
# Together, they roll to her right (his left), where her upper body remains.  She may prop herself up on her right elbow or lie flat against a pillow.  The man rolls back flat upon his back, while they keep their pelvises pressed together. At this point the man is lying flat on his back on the bed and the plane of the woman's torso is almost perpendicular to that of the man's. Her shoulders are almost vertical, with her left shoulder above her right shoulder. Her torso is twisted so that her pelvis is horizontal, resting on his pelvis. The woman's weight is entirely on the right side of her body and her right elbow.
# They resume intercourse.

==Advantages==
This position leaves the partners both fully supported by the bed (the man on his back, the woman on her right shoulder and torso) except for the woman's left leg which is resting on the man's right hip. The man is flat on his back, while the woman is rolled slightly to her right. Their bodies form an angle of roughly 30°, leaving the partners face to face with the woman's weight on her right shoulder. Pillows are used under both partners' heads. Should her size require it, more pillows may be needed to support the woman's upper body.

According to Masters and Johnson, "when facility in lateral coital positioning has been obtained, there is no pinning of either the male or female partner. There is mutual freedom of pelvic movement in any direction, and there will be no cramping of muscles or necessity for tiring support of body weight. The lateral coital position provides both sexes flexibility for free sexual expression. This position particularly is effective for the woman, as she can move with full freedom to enjoy either slow or rapid pelvic thrusting, depending upon current levels of sexual tensions."

The position was recommended by them for all couples, and also particularly in cases of [[premature ejaculation]] due to reduced pressure on the man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Manna''''' is a 2003 [[science fiction]] essay by [[Marshall Brain]] that explores several issues in modern information technology and user interfaces, including some around [[transhumanism]].

==Plot summary==

The fictional story is set in 2050 and takes place in [[Cary, North Carolina]] before the narrator flies to [[Australia]].  The narrator starts at a minimum wage job at Burger-G before being laid-off, primarily due to the Manna, a computer management system, replacing people in the service industry.  He then takes a bus to a small government provided welfare dormitory where he meets a friend.  Soon after, he is visited by two girls who tell him that he's invited to live in Australia because his father bought stock in the Australia Project years prior.  The narrator then goes on to discover the many aspects of the Australia Project.

In the US, which has a libertarian economic system, most Americans are unemployable and live in cramped housing projects, where they are fed and kept safe like farm animals. Birth control medicine in the water prevents them from having children. In contrast, in Australia, everyone has access to the goods provided by automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Mark|title='I wasn't interested in just following the rules': Data scientist Jeremy Howard and the 'next internet'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/innovation/i-wasnt-interested-in-just-following-the-rules-data-scientist-jeremy-howard-and-the-next-internet-20160419-go9rps.html|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
''Manna'' is meant to be a thought-provoking read or conceptual prototype rather than an entertaining novel (''see [[exploratory engineering]] for more on such writing'').  The novel shows two possible outcomes of the 'robotic revolution' in the near future: one outcome is a [[dystopia]] based around US capitalism and the other is a [[utopia]] based upon a communal and technological society in Australia.  Essentially, the two differ in that lower-class humans in the dystopic society have been left unmodified and are controlled by AI "managers" to the point of slavery, while humans in the utopian society more directly and efficiently participate in the management of the society as a whole and most or all willingly accept implanted AI aids.

Some technological and social themes explored :
* [[brain-computer interface]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[class structure]]
* effect of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robot]]s on society
* proper and improper uses of technology
* the failings of capitalism to cope with technological development
* [[welfare economics]] and a [[basic income]]

Positions and assumptions presented in the novel include:
*Insertion of an AI management system between workers and decision makers results in a loss of upward mobility in a society due to the impossibility of workers ever becoming actual managers.
*The acceptance of nervous system modification and integration of human and machine consciousness into what is considered "human" is accordingly presented as a path to liberation and practical [[egalitarianism]].
*Capitalism is inherently hierarchical and cannot be easily reconciled with abundance, it will by definition move more resources into the hands of the property owners and destitute all others - the novel shares this assumption with classic [[Marxism]].
*Privacy is largely incompatible with human safety in a utopian environment.

The book can be read online for free (see link below).

'''Massive online open research (MOOR)''' is an online research and development (R&amp;D) open access platform or higher education study program aiming at unlimited participation via the internet.

It may be used to create, on a very large participative scale, a new discovery, development or creation which will be allegedly accompanied by a peer-review publication.

==As a higher education online research program==

In September 2013, The University of California in San Diego bioinformatics department, proposed a [[massive online open course]] which would feature "an opportunity (for students) to work on specific research projects under the leadership of prominent bioinformatics scientists".&lt;ref name=UCSDnews01&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=Doug|title=Is Massive Open Online Research the Next Frontier for Education?|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/is_massive_open_online_research_the_next_wi_for_education|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an online internet platform==

Several internet platforms have shown their interest in bridging prominent science, technology, engineering and mathematics (i.e., [[STEM fields]]) researchers with students, as means to accelerate STEM discoveries and education.  The internet social network Research Gate has unveiled that multiple discoveries and advancements in science have been made collaboratively in an open access scheme since its creation,&lt;ref name=Techcr1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Leena|title=The Collaborative Power of Berlin-Based ResearchGate|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/30/the-collaborative-power-of-berlin-based-researchgate|accessdate=14 Nov 2013|newspaper=[[Techcrunch]]|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially serving as a MOOR platform.

The University of Amsterdam has been developing an online tool for massive online open research since February 2014. This tool will primarily focus on collaborative (qualitative) data analysis.

Research in [[artificial intelligence (AI)]] is known to have impacted [[medical diagnosis]], [[Algorithmic trading|stock trading]], [[robot control]], and several other fields. Perhaps less popular is the contribution of AI in the field of [[music]]. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence and music (AIM) has, for a long time, been a common subject in several conferences and workshops, including the [[International Computer Music Conference]], the Computing Society Conference &lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html INFORMS Computing Society Conference: Annapolis: Music, Computation and AI] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630221600/http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~echew/INFORMS/ics2005.html |date=2012-06-30 }}. Rcf.usc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence]]. In fact, the first International Computer Music Conference was the ICMC 1974, Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computermusic.org/page/23/ International Computer Music Association - ICMC]. Computermusic.org (2010-11-15). Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Current research includes the application of AI in [[Musical composition|music composition]], [[performance]], theory and digital [[Audio signal processing|sound processing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a714908257?words=artificial*|intelligence*|music* Research in Music and Artificial Intelligence - Ergonomics Abstracts]. Informaworld.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Several music [[software]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been developed that use AI to produce music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A Functional Taxonomy of Music Generation Systems

A prominent feature is the capability of the A.I. algorithm to learn based on information obtained such as the computer accompaniment technology, which is capable of listening to and following a human performer so it can perform in synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f275/4c359d7ef052ab5997d71dc3e9443404565a.pdf|title=Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Music Understanding|last=Dannenberg|first=Roger|date=|website=Semantic Scholar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial intelligence also drives the so-called interactive composition technology, wherein a computer composes music in response to the performance of a live musician. There are several other A.I. applications to music that covers not only music composition, production, and performance but also the way it is marketed and consumed. Companies like [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Spotify]] rely on user data to augment their engagement metrics to power their ability to get consumers to listen more to music or push the right songs to users according to their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinwestcottgrant/2017/12/10/how-to-think-about-artificial-intelligence-in-the-music-industry/#55a5c0eb7d4a|title=How To Think About Artificial Intelligence In The Music Industry|last=Grant|first=Kristin Westcott|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1960, Russian researcher R.Kh.Zaripov published worldwide first paper on algorithmic music composing using the "[[Ural (computer)|Ural-1]]" computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaripov|first=R.Kh.|title=Об алгоритмическом описании процесса сочинения музыки (On algorithmic description of process of music composition)|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|year=1960|volume=132|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, inventor Ray Kurzweil premiered a piano piece created by a computer that was capable of pattern recognition in various compositions. The computer was then able to analyze and use these patterns to create novel melodies. The computer was debuted on Steve Allen's I've Got a Secret program, and stumped the hosts until film star Henry Morgan guessed Ray's secret.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kurzweiltech.com/raybio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software applications==

===Interactive scores===
Multimedia Scenarios in interactive scores are represented by
temporal objects,
temporal relations and
interactive objects. Examples of temporal objects are sounds, videos and light controls.
Temporal objects can be triggered by interactive objects (usually launched by the user) and
several temporal objects can be executed simultaneously.  A temporal object may contain
other temporal objects:  this hierarchy allows us to control the start or end of a temporal
object by controlling the start or end of its parent.  Hierarchy is ever-present in all kinds
of music:  Music pieces are often hierarchized by movements, parts, motives, measures,
among other segmentations. &lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Toro, Myriam Desainte-Catherine, Camilo Rueda. Formal semantics for interactive music scores: a framework to design, specify properties and execute interactive scenarios.

===EMI===
A program developed by David Cope which composes classical music. See [[Experiments in Musical Intelligence]]. [[Emily Howell]] is an interactive augmentation of EMI. (As a popular example, the background music of the [[viral video]] [[Humans Need Not Apply]] was created by "her", as revealed in the video to illustrate the likely fate of creative jobs.)

===OrchExtra===

This program was designed to provide small-budget productions with instrumentation for all instruments usually present in the full-fledged orchestra. If there is a small orchestra playing, the program can play the part for missing instruments. High school and community theaters wanting to produce a musical can now benefit from the virtual orchestra and realize a full Broadway score. This software is able to follow the fluctuations in tempo and musical expression. Musicians enjoy the thrill of playing with a full orchestra, while the audience enjoys the rich sound that comes from the combination of the virtual orchestra with the musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA Realtime Music Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060910191858/http://www.rms.biz/index.cfm?page=OrchEXTRA |date=2006-09-10 }}.

===REAPER's TabEditor===
MIDI to string instrument (guitar, violin, dombra, etc.) tablature conversion is a nontrivial task, as the same note can reside on different strings of the instrument. And the creation of good fingering is sometimes a challenge even for real musicians, especially when translating a two handed piano composition on a string instrument.
So in TabEditor&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.cockos.com/wiki/index.php/TabEditor TabEditor]&lt;/ref&gt; (the tiny plugin for [[REAPER]] DAW), an AI was used that solves this puzzle the same way as a musician would: trying to keep all the notes close to each other (to be possible to play) while trying to fit all the piano notes into a range that can be played simultaneously on the instrument. When direct translation is impossible (piano part has more notes than are possible on the guitar) the AI tries to find an acceptable solution, removing as few notes as possible from the original composition.
The Prolog programming language was used to create this AI.

===Ludwig===
Ludwig&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.write-music.com The automatic composition software Ludwig]. www.write-music.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is an automated composition software based on tree search algorithms. Ludwig generates melodies according to principles of classical music theory. The software arranges its melodies with pop-automation patterns or in four-part choral writing. Ludwig can react in real-time on an eight-bar theme played on a keyboard. The theme will be analysed for key, harmonic content and rhythm while it is being performed  by a human. The program then without delay repeats the theme arranged e.g. for orchestra. It subsequently varies the melody to create a little piece as interactive answer to the human input.

===OMax===
OMax&lt;ref&gt;[http://omax.ircam.fr/ The OMax Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a software environment which  learns in real-time typical features of a musician's style and  plays along with him interactively, giving the flavor of a machine co-improvisation. OMax uses OpenMusic and Max. It is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by Gerard Assayag and Shlomo Dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by G. Assayag, M. Chemillier and G. Bloch (Aka the OMax Brothers) in the [[Ircam]] Music Representations group.

===Melomics===
Melomics is a proprietary computational system for the automatic (without human intervention) composition of music, based on bioinspired methods and produced by Melomics Media.  Composing a wide variety of genres, all music composed by Melomics algorithms are available in MP3, MIDI, MusicXML, and PDF (of sheet music), after purchase. Music composed by this algorithm was organized into an album named [[Iamus (album)]], which was hailed by New Scientist as "The first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite   journal | title= Computer composer honours Turing's centenary| journal= New Scientist| date =5 July 2012| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system uses an optimization approach based on a variable neighborhood search algorithm to morph existing template pieces into novel pieces with a set level of tonal tension that changes dynamically throughout the piece. This optimization approach allows for the integration of a pattern detection technique in order to enforce long term structure and recurring themes in the generated music. Pieces composed by MorpheuS have been performed at concerts in both Stanford and London.

===MXX===
Founded in 2015, MXX (Mashtraxx Ltd) is a creative AI technology company, which has developed the world’s first AI engine that atomises and edits music to video instantly.
 
The MXX technology is the only artificially intelligent music editor that can work on the stereo file alone, without the need for stems, and can adapt the narrative to fit a brief just like a music editor would.
 
With the MXX products, music can be adapted to perfectly wrap around certain experiences such as UGC of different lengths and forms; users workouts and runs; computer game dynamic narratives; and object-based media viewing of dynamic lengths. This presents a new future for music in itself, as music is one of the few remaining static artefacts in a world where all media needs to be more dynamic and flexible.
 
The first MXX product, Audition Pro, enables anyone to edit music against video with intensity rises, fades, dropouts and climax points, load any track, and immediately listen to the edited track, and makes responding to the demands of today’s media fast and simple.

'''Ottonian art''' is a [[style (visual arts)|style]] in [[Pre-Romanesque art|pre-romanesque]] [[German art]], covering also some works from the [[Low Countries]], northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian [[Hubert Janitschek]] after the [[Ottonian dynasty]] which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], [[Otto I]], [[Otto II]], [[Otto III]] and [[Emperor Henry II|Henry II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arthistorians.info/janitschekh |title=Dictionary of Art Historians: Janitschek, Hubert |access-date=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ottonian architecture]], it is a key component of the [[Ottonian Renaissance]] (circa 951–1024).  However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty.  It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early [[Salian dynasty]], which lacks an artistic "style label" of its own.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524"&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524&lt;/ref&gt;  In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows [[Carolingian art]] and precedes [[Romanesque art]], though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden.  Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important [[monastery|monasteries]], as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading [[vassal]]s.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was re-established under the [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.  Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church.  However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 81–86; Lasko, 82; Dodwell, 123–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from [[Byzantine art]] and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as "a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277"&gt;Honour and Fleming, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 004.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|"Roma", "Gallia", "Germania" and "Sclavinia" pay homage to Otto III, from the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], one of the "Liuthar group"]]

Following late Carolingian styles, "[[presentation miniature|presentation portraits]]" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art,&lt;ref&gt;in contrast, there are no surviving contemporary portraits of [[Charlemagne]] in manuscripts&lt;/ref&gt; and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of [[Late Antiquity]], such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic]], and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]]. This goal was accomplished in various ways.  For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 123; Imperial portraiture is a major subject in Garrison&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of [[spolia]] from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity.  This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], and other building materials from the [[Palace of Theoderic]] in [[Ravenna]] and reused them in his new cathedral at [[Magdeburg]].  The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features.

In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain [[presentation miniature]]s depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St [[Pirmin]], founder of [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the "command structure" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solothurn]] Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89–90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140-141; Dodwell, 134; the [[Egbert Psalter]] also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byzantine art]] also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess [[Theophanu]] to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers.  However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times.  The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills,&lt;ref&gt;Or so it is usually assumed, but see Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt; some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen,&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 47–49&lt;/ref&gt; though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and some [[lay brother]]s and lay assistants employed by monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;An area where evidence is generally thin across Europe, see Cherry, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;  While secular [[medieval jewelry|jewellery]] supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, [[ivory carving]] at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.

==Manuscripts==
[[File:CodexEgberti-Fol052v-ResurrectionOfLazarus.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Egberti]], ''Resurrection of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]'', "Ruodprecht group"]]
Ottonian monasteries produced most if not all of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.  The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;

In contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] devoted to "strips" in three tiers with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' and his [[Parables of Jesus|parables]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, throughout; Dodwell, 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich [[treasure binding]]s and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the "[[Eburnant group]]" were made, perhaps at [[Lorsch]], as several miniatures in the [[Gero Codex]] (now [[Darmstadt]]), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian [[Lorsch Gospels]].  This is the first stylistic group of the traditional "'''Reichenau school'''".  The two other major manuscripts of the group are the [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]] named for [[Hornbach, Germany|Hornbach]] and [[Petershausen Sacramentary|Petershausen]].  In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above "we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134, quoted; Beckwith, 92–93; compare the St John portraits in [[:File:Gero Codex Evangelist Johannes.jpg|the Gero Codex]] and [[:File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|the Lorsch Gospels]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister der Reichenauer Schule 005.jpg|thumb|left|the ''[[Annunciation to the shepherds]]'' from the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], "Liuthar group" of the "Reichenau school"]]
A number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the [[Reichenau Island|island monastery of Reichenau]] in [[Lake Constance]], despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there.  C.R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at [[Lorsch]] and Trier instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130, with his full views in: C.R. Dodwell et [[D. H. Turner]] (eds.), ''Reichenau reconsidered. A Re-assessment of the Place of Reichenau in Ottonian Art'', 1965, Warburg Surveys, 2, of which Backhouse is a review.  See Backhouse, 98 for German scholars dubious about the traditional Reichenau school.  Garrison, 15, supports the traditional view.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wherever it was located, the "Reichenau school" specialized in [[gospel book]]s and other [[liturgical book]]s, many of them, such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]] (c. 1000) and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001–1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World]] International Register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-4/illuminated-manuscripts-from-the-ottonian-period-produced-in-the-monastery-of-reichenau-lake-constance/ |title=Illuminated manuscripts from the Ottonian period produced in the monastery of Reichenau (Lake Constance) |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important "Reichenau school" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books.&lt;ref&gt;Or at any rate, monks depicted and named in them. Whether these would actually have been the main scribes of the text is discussed by Mayr-Harting, 229&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Eburnant group" covered above was followed by the "Ruodprecht group" named after the scribe of the [[Egbert Psalter]]; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The [[Liuthar Gospels|Aachen Gospels of Otto III]], also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third "'''Liuthar group'''" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–144; Backhouse, throughout, is rather sceptical about Trier as a major centre; Beckwith, 96–104 stresses the mobility of illuminators.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outstanding miniaturist of the "Ruodprecht group" was the so-called Master of the ''[[Registrum Gregorii]]'', or [[Gregory Master]], whose work looked back in some respects to [[Late Antique]] manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for "their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 141–142, 141 quoted; Lasko, 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; He worked chiefly in [[Trier]] in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential ''[[Codex Egberti]]'', a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop [[Egbert of Trier]], probably in the 980s.  However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 134–142&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the "Liuthar group" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it "carried transcendentalism to an extreme", with "marked schematization of the forms and colours", "flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 104, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them  "emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance", with narrative scenes "presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 108–110, both quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  This gestural "dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe".&lt;ref name="Honour and Fleming, 277" /&gt;

The group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]], the [[Bamberg Apocalypse]] and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the [[Pericopes of Henry II]], the best known and most extreme of the group, where "the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 112&lt;/ref&gt; The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.

[[File:CodexAureusEpternacensisf76fDetail.jpg|thumb|Labourers in the vineyard, from the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]]]]

Two dedication miniatures added to the [[Egmond Gospels]] around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style.  In [[Regensburg]] [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]] held the major Carolingian [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which probably influenced a style with "an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page", giving in the [[Uta Codex]] of c. 1020 complex schemes where "bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism.  This style was to be very influential on [[Romanesque art]] in several media.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 151–153; Garrison, 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echternach Abbey]] became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] were produced there, followed by the [[Golden Gospels of Henry III]] in 1045–46, which Henry presented to [[Speyer Cathedral]] (now [[Escorial]]), the major work of the school.  Henry also commissioned the [[Uppsala Gospels]] for the cathedral there (now in the university library).&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 144–146&lt;/ref&gt;  Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at [[Salzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 153–15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hildesheim]], [[Corvey]], [[Fulda]], and [[Cologne]], where the [[Hitda Codex]] was made.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130–156 covers the whole period, as does Beckwith, 92–124; Legner's three volumes have catalogue entries on considerable numbers of manuscripts made in Cologne, or now located there.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalwork and enamels==
[[File:Nürnberg — GNM 2013-09-07 Mattes (101).JPG|thumb|A corner of the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], [[Trier]], 980s]]

Objects for decorating churches such as crosses, [[reliquaries]], altar frontals and [[treasure binding]]s for books were all made of or covered by gold, embellished with gems, enamels, crystals, and cameos.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, Part Two (pp. 77–142), gives a very comprehensive account.  Beckwith, 138–145&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by "beehive" projections in gold wire, and figurative [[relief]]s in [[repoussé]] gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration.  Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94–95; Henderson, 15, 202–214; see Head for an analysis of the political significance of reliquaries commissioned by Egbert of Trier.&lt;/ref&gt; In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the [[Celestial city]], and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various "scientific", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular [[lapidary (text)|lapidary books]].&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] after he outgrew it.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 94-95; also this [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/465119 brooch] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Obverse.png|left|thumb|[[Curmsun Disc]] - Obverse, Jomsborg, 980s]]
Examples of ''[[crux gemmata]]'' or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the [[Essen Cathedral Treasury]]; several abbesses of [[Essen Abbey]] were Ottonian princesses. The [[Cross of Otto and Mathilde]], [[Cross of Mathilde]] and the [[Essen cross with large enamels]] were probably all given by [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen]] (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the [[Theophanu Cross]] came some fifty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 99–109; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cross of Lothair]] ([[Aachen]]) and [[Imperial Cross]] ([[Vienna]]) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]. The book cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] ([[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]]) is in a very comparable style.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, 59–60; Lasko, 98; Beckwith, 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in [[Trier]],&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 15; Lasko, 96–98; Head.&lt;/ref&gt; and gold altar frontals for the [[Palace Chapel, Aachen]] and [[Basel Cathedral]] (now in Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 129–131; Beckwith, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or [[Ambon of Henry II]]. The late Carolingian upper cover of the  [[Lindau Gospels]] ([[Morgan Library]], New York) and the [[Arnulf Ciborium]] in [[Munich]] were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64–66; Beckwith, 50, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christussäule 6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wedding at Cana]] on the [[Bernward Column]]]]

Large objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving [[wheel chandelier]]s from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Hildesheim|Hildesheim Cathedral]] from the period of Bishop [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]] (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach "the peaks of perfection".  The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the [[Bernward Doors]], with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 111–123, 119 quoted; Beckwith, 145–149&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a bronze columnm the [[Bernward Column]], over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the [[ministry of Jesus]] in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of [[Trajan's Column]] and other Roman examples.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 120-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing [[cloisonné]] enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to [[Essen]].  During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the ''[[senkschmelz]]'' or "sunk enamel" technique in addition to the ''[[vollschmelz]]'' one already used.  Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use ''vollschmelz'', with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in ''senkschmelz'', surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed.  The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 95–106; Beckwith, 138–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Christ Magdeburg Cathedral Met 41.100.157.jpg|thumb|The "dedication" [[Magdeburg]] plaque]]

Much very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites.  There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 126–138; Lasko, 78–79, 94, 106–108, 112, 131, as well as the passages cited below&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of four Ottonian ivory [[situla (vessel)|situlae]] appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period.  Situlae were [[liturgy|liturgical]] vessels used to hold [[holy water]], and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An [[aspergillum]] was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects.  However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of [[elephant]] tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops.  All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the [[Basilewsky]] Situla of 920 in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], decorated with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' on two levels,&lt;ref&gt;Basilewsky Situla [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93850/situla-the-basilewsky-situla/ V&amp;A Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Situla of Gotofredo" of c. 980 in [[Milan Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/56/m_483a78b657804fbaa6842929d8126c39.jpg image of Milan situla]&lt;/ref&gt; one in the [[Aachen Cathedral]] Treasury,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |title=Image of Aachen situla |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722075610/http://files.wikiweise.de/pdftmp/img-320_situla%20aachen.jpg.jpg |archive-date=2011-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/06/euwf/ho_17.190.45.htm Metropolitan Museum example]&lt;/ref&gt;  All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop [[Gotofredo I (archbishop of Milan)|Gotfredus]] presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 92-3&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, 26, though Lasko, 92 disagrees with this.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops.  This was probably made in [[Trier]] about 1000.&lt;ref&gt;All except the New York situla are illustrated and discussed in Beckwith, pp. 129–130, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Among various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]] and two [[diptych]] wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with "an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 133-136, 135-136 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

A very important group of [[plaquette|plaques]], now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for [[Magdeburg Cathedral]] and are called the "Magdeburg plaques", the "plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium" or similar names.  They were probably made in [[Milan]] in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an [[antependium]] or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed.  Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York has a "dedication" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral.  Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set.  The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold.  Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 87–91; Williamson, 12; Beckwith, 126–129. On the function of the original object, Williamson favours a door, Lasko leans towards a pulpit, and Beckwith an antependium, but none seem emphatic in their preference.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style of the figures is described by [[Peter Lasko]] as "very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions".&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall painting==
[[File:Reichenau Oberzell Fresko1.jpeg|thumb|Jesus and the [[Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac|Gadarene swine]], nave fresco in St George, [[Oberzell]]]]

Although it is clear from documentary records that many churches were decorated with extensive cycles of wall-painting, survivals are extremely rare, and more often than not fragmentary and in poor condition. Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around [[Fulda]] in [[Hesse]]; though there are also important examples from north Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 127–128; Beckwith, 88–92&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a record of bishop [[Gebhard of Constance]] hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of [[Petershausen Abbey]], and laymen may have dominated the art of wall-painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators.  The artists seem to have been rather mobile: "at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 130; the Italian was "Johannes Italicus", who one scholar has identified with the Gregory Master, see Beckwith, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The church of St George at Oberzell on [[Reichenau Island]] has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration.  The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich [[Gospels of Otto III]]; they are therefore usually dated around 980–1000.  Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 128–130; Beckwith, 88–92; Backhouse, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Larger sculpture==
[[File:Gerokreuz full 20050903.jpg|thumb|[[Gero Cross]], c. 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]]]

Very little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the [[Gero Cross]] (around 965–970, [[Cologne Cathedral]]) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 142; Lauer, Rolf, in Legner, III, 142 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Golden Madonna of Essen]] (about 1000, [[Essen Cathedral]], which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the [[Virgin and Child]], which is in wood which was covered with [[gesso]] and then thin gold sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 150–152 Lasko, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Monumental sculpture]] remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the [[stucco]] reliefs on the [[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] of [[Sant' Ambrogio, Milan]], and also on that in [[San Pietro al Monte]], [[Civate]], which relate to ivory carving of the same period,&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 132&lt;/ref&gt; and some stone sculpture.

==Survival and historiography==
Surviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements.  As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Legner, Vol 2 pp. 238-240, no. E32, where a largely rubbed-down 6th-century Byzantine bookcover plaque has on the original back a Cologne relief of c. 1000 ([[Schnütgen Museum]], Inv. B 98).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like.&lt;ref name="Suckale-Redlefsen, 524" /&gt;  A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods.  Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above.  Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries.

The term "Ottonian art" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524–525&lt;/ref&gt; apart from [[Adolph Goldschmidt]]'s studies of ivories and sculpture in general.  A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations.  The 1950 Munich exhibition ''Ars Sacra'' ("sacred art" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by [[Peter Lasko]] in his book for the ''[[Penguin Books#Pelican History of Art|Pelican History of Art]]'', the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the "minor arts", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms.&lt;ref&gt;Suckale-Redlefsen, 524; Lasko, xxii lists a number of the exhibitions up to 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field "that is still significantly under-represented in English-language art-historical research".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Paleolimnology''' ({{lang-el|paleon}}=old, ''limne''=lake, ''logos''=study) is a scientific subdiscipline closely related to both [[limnology]] and [[paleoecology]].  Palaeolimnological studies are concerned with reconstructing the [[paleoenvironment]]s of inland waters ([[lake]]s and [[streams]]; [[freshwater]], [[brackish]], or [[saline water|saline]]) – and especially changes associated with such events as [[climatic change]], human impacts (e.g., [[eutrophication]], or [[acid rain|acidification]]), and internal ontogenic processes.

Paleolimnological studies are commonly based on meticulous analyses of [[sediment]] cores, including the [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] properties of sediments, and diverse [[biology|biological]] records (e.g., fossil [[diatoms]], [[cladocera]], [[ostracodes]], [[molluscs]], [[pollen]], [[pigments]], or [[chironomid]]s). One of the primary sources for recent paleolimnological research is the Journal of Paleolimnology.

==History==

===Lake ontogeny===
Most early paleolimnological studies focused especially on the biological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in directing lake development.  Although [[Einar Naumann]] had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, [[August Thienemann]] suggested that the reverse process likely occurred.  Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, I. R. 1987.  Chironomidae (Diptera) in paleoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 6: 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson]] &amp; Wollack suggested that following an initial oligotrophic stage lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium.  They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities, and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonising organisms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

In a classic paper, [[Raymond Lindeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R. L. 1942. The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23, 399–418.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], [[mesotrophic lake|mesotrophic]], and [[eutrophic]] stages, before senescing to a [[dystrophic lake|dystrophic]] stage and filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin.  These ideas were further elaborated by [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]],&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., Jr. 1955. The obliteration of the hypolimmon. Mem. Ist. Ital. Idrobiol., Suppl 8, 9–38.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric [[eutrophication]].  As the [[hypolimnion]] of lakes gradually filled with sediments, [[oxygen]] depletion would promote the release of iron-bound [[phosphorus]] to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. 2006. Chironomid overview. pp.360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, Vo1. 1, Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely, if uncritically, accepted.  Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were effectively refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student [[Daniel A. Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, D.A. 1957. On the sigmoid growth phase in the history of Linsley Pond. American Journal of Science 255: 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Whiteside&lt;ref&gt;Whiteside. M. C. 1983. The mythical concept of eutrophication. Hydrobiologia 103, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's proposal, and palaeolimnologists now consider that a host of external  factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity.  Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the [[Younger Dryas]]) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, illustrating that 1) lake development is not a unidirectional process, and 2) climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

==Limnic Environment==
[[Limnology]] is study of inland water bodies including: lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, wetlands and more.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-07-023673-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change====
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used [[chironomid]] fossils to assess the impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic [[eutrophication]]) on lake communities. Their studies reveal pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes, a consequence of severe oxygen depletion in the eutrophied lakes.

From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to understanding the role of human impacts ([[acid rain]]) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of [[pH]] change in northern lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Battarbee, R. W. 1984. Diatom analysis and the acidification of lakes. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 305: 451–477.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pH]]-sensitivity of [[diatom]] communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when [[Friedrich Hustedt]] developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. [[Gunnar Nygaard (phycologist)|Gunnar Nygaard]] subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, [[Jouko Meriläinen]] introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function.  Using diatom and [[chrysophyte]] fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions.  Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.

In recent years palaeolimnologists have recognised that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct [[paleoclimate]]s.  Sensitive records of climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from [[chironomid]] fossils, and palaeosalinity records inferred from [[diatoms]].

==== Freshwater [http://extension.usu.edu/waterquality/whats-in-your-water/aquatic_macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates] ====
Freshwater macroinvertebrates ([[invertebrate]]s that can be see by naked eye; &gt; 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) are a very diverse group of small animals present in [[river]]s, streams, lakes and wetlands. These animals include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, annelids and arachnids. They comprise a functionally and taxonomically diverse group that plays an important role in linking the food web in the [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They serve as a main source of food for the fishes and they depend on different types of algae and bacteria for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J. Iwan|last2=Sayer|first2=Carl D.|title=DOES THE FISH–INVERTEBRATE–PERIPHYTON CASCADE PRECIPITATE PLANT LOSS IN SHALLOW LAKES?|journal=Ecology|date=August 2003|volume=84|issue=8|pages=2155–2167|doi=10.1890/02-0422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most aquatic macro-invertebrates are small while some are quite large such as freshwater crayfish. They are very sensitive to different physical and chemical conditions and respond to it accordingly due to their limited mobility. For example, their community will change when a pollutant enters into the water or due to the change of [[water quality]]. Therefore, the water body which is rich with a macro-invertebrate community can be used to provide an estimate of water body health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Marc|title=Water: Facts without Myths|journal=Water|date=7 August 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.3390/w1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Macro invertebrates termed "benthos" inhabit surfaces of vegetation, rocks and other aquatic sediments. They are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and present at a range of trophic levels. Most  macroinvertebrates taxa are dependent on a range of [[abiotic factor]]s and [[biotic factor]]s and therefore community structure can be used to represent the local ecosystem. These factors may be the availability and quality of food, [[pH]], [[temperature]], salinity, land use pattern and [[water flow]] etc. These factors are interconnected and influence each other. For example, any change in the land use affects the riparian vegetation that may be increased or decreased which changes the inputs into the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|last2=Gresens|first2=Susan|last3=Kenney|first3=Melissa|last4=Sutton-Grier|first4=Ariana|title=Benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality: The intersection of science and policy|journal=Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–128|doi=10.1163/187498209X12525675906077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all of these reasons, macroinvertabrates are considered as one of the best indicators of water quality.

===== Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates =====
Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates vary in their tolerance to changes in the aquatic environment.

===== Macroinvertebrates as an indicator of [[water quality]] =====
Macroinvertebrateas are commonly and widely distributed in many types of water bodies and respond with a range of sensitivities to many kinds of stressors. They are commonly used for toxicity testing and ecological assessments in water bodies and many of them complete their life cycles in a single water body so they are exposed directly to physical, chemical, and biological stressors and they also integrate the long and short term changes. When a freshwater source is degraded, the most sensitive invertebrate species are lost initially, followed by species more tolerant to pollution.These species either sustain their existence or their number decreases in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.T|first1=Barbour|title=USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, 1–35|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Macro-invertebrates are an essential part of the food chain. Their strategies for feeding can be clustered into several "functional feeding" groups. For example, shedders feed on leaves and woody materials, some depends on the vegetation growing in the water body. Examples of shredders are amphipods, isopods, freshwater crayfish, and caddisfly larvae.

==Paleoclimate proxies==
Paleoclimatology (or the study of past climates) uses proxy data in order to relate elements collected in modern-day samples to suggest the climatic conditions of the past.

===Sediment cores===
Sediment cores are one of the primary tools for studying paleolimnology because of the role in which lake and river sediments play in preserving biological information.&lt;ref name="sediment book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birks|first1=H. John. B.|last2=Lotter|first2=Andre F.|last3=Juggins|first3=Steve|last4=Smol|first4=John P.|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolimnologists collect [[Core sample|sediment cores]] and observe various proxy indicators in order to reconstruct past limnology of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Some of these indicators include geochemical markers and isotopic data which are found within the various sections of the sediment core.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; In order to calibrate data, a group of around 40 or more calibration lakes are used to reconstruct what the conditions of a new core are likely to reflect.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; The use of these calibration lakes is necessary to identify dramatic differences in a newly collected core compared to normal variations which would be depicted in the calibration lakes. Through the use of sediment cores as a technique, paleolimnologists are able to use other proxies (such as pollen, charcoal, diatoms, chironomids, and other organic matter) in order to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Lake sediment cores in particular offer a more comprehensive analysis of an area because of the continual accumulation of sediment as well as other organic matter like pollen and charcoal.

===Pollen records===
Pollen and spores can be analyzed within a lab setting to determine the family, genus, or species which the pollen grains belong. The overall taxonomic assemblage of pollen types reflects the surrounding vegetation of the lake.  [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] is a major field in [[paleoecology]]. A range of statistical and qualitative treatment of pollen records can be used to reconstruct past vegetation and climate.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt;

=== Diatoms ===
The taxonomic assemblages of [[diatom]]s reflect many aspects of the lake temperature, chemical, and nutrient environment.

=== Organic matter characteristics ===
Organic matter may be characterized in terms of 1) amount (accumulation rate, reflecting productivity), 2) origin (aquatic or terrestrial determined from the C:N ratio), 3) carbon isotopic composition (reflecting plant photosynthetic pathways of C3 vs C4 plants, and reflecting drought and/or aquatic productivity), 4) nitrogen isotopic composition (reflecting sources of nitrogen and nitrogen cycling). There are a range of biomarkers widely used, as well as compound-specific isotopic analyses.  [[Diagenesis]] is an important factor to consider in interpreting organic matter records.

===Chironomids===

==== [[Chironomids]] as a proxy of climate change: Paleolimnology and chironomids ====
One of the major factor that affects the flora and fauna of the earth is the change of climate at the local, regional and global scale. These changes are preserved over the period of time as a fossil record and through paleolimnological methods, these changes can be traced out and also helpful for the prediction of the future climate change. Chironomids are one of the best indicators of climate change. These are two winged flies and belongs to family Chironomidae with 500 to 15,000 species. Ecologically they are considered as [[Bottom feeder|bottom dwellers]] and are very responsive to any fluctuation in the surrounding environment. They are considered as a good indicator of [[salinity]], water depth, [[stream flow]], aquatic productivity, oxygen level, lake acidification, [[pollution]], [[Temperature|temperatur]]e, and overall [[ecosystem health]]. As the assemblage of chironomids is dependent on several [[environmental factor]]s, they can be easily related to those changing factors using a transfer function to connect a particular group of organisms to a specific [[environmental variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilyashuk|first1=Elena A.|last2=Ilyashuk|first2=Boris P.|last3=Tylmann|first3=Wojciech|last4=Koinig|first4=Karin A.|last5=Psenner|first5=Roland|title=Biodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high-altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|date=1 November 2015|volume=8|issue=6|pages=547–561|doi=10.1111/icad.12137|language=en|issn=1752-4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake deposits have a rich diversity of fossilized insects that trace back to middle Paleozoic era and more abundance can be found in the Quaternary period.Among aquatic invertebrates, different families of aquatic fly larvae can be traced out in the lake sediments of Quaternary era. Among them, Chironomids are of greatest ecological importance due to their diverse habitat in the aquatic ecosystem, feeding habitat, important component in the food web and above all their usage as a plaeolimnological studies because their head capsule and feeding structures are fossilized in the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew S.|title=Paleolimnology : the history and evolution of lake systems|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195133530|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chironomids complete their larval stage in the water and its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] continues up to several years while adult life span is very short. They have an important role in the degradation of material in the aquatic ecosystem and serve as an important part of the food web during their whole life cycle.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smol|first1=edited by Reinhard Pienitz and Marianne S.V. Douglas and John P.|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-2126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate change ====
According to [[IPCC]] (2007) reports one of the vital aspect of environment is the continuous climate change due several factors over the period of time which is influential in shaping the biodiversity.
Macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids have been considered as an important [[Indicator organism|indicator]] of the [[climate change]] especially temperature due to their presence in the abundance in the [[lake sediment]] as a fossil. There is a strong correlation between the chironomids assemblage and the water temperature, lake depth, salinity and, nutrients of the lake.Lake water levels over the past time period can be inferred from the chironomids assemblage due to their correlation.It is due to the fact that climate change resulted in the water level change of the lake that is related to change in the pattern of chironomids distribution and abundance.Their strong correlation helps to build the information about the evaporation and precipitation in the past. Past climate change is reconstructed based on the paleolimnology with the help of different [[fossilized]] records especially the lake sediments that helps to find out the regional and local climate change. It is important to differentiate between the impacts that a lake store due to the regional and local level [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; 

Recent studies in [[Arctic]] shows that [[biodiversity]] affect more due to the arctic warming than other associated factors like human alteration and [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RAHEL|first1=FRANK J.|last2=OLDEN|first2=JULIAN D.|title=Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=June 2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Himalayan region water bodies are not only affected by the anthropogenic disturbances but also impacted by the different types of pollutants that are transferred to this area over a longer distance.It is vital to understand all the associated factors acting on the aquatic biodiversity while analyzing the impact of climate change over the past years with the help of lake sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=C.M|last2=Sharma|first2=S|last3=Gurung|first3=S|last4=Bajracharya|first4=R.M|last5=Jüttner|first5=I|last6=Pradhan|first6=N.S|title=Global Climatic Change and High Altitude Lakes: Impacts on Aquatic Biodiversity and Pollution Status|journal=Natural Resources Management: Reviews and Research in the Himalayan Watersheds|date=2009|issue=44(977)|pages=103–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to consider that the impact and intensity of different changes due to climate change may have totally different affect on different [[ecosystems]] depending upon its sensitivity to that change &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beniston|first1=Martin|title=Climatic Change in Mountain Regions: A Review of Possible Impacts | journal=Climatic Change|date=2003|volume=59|issue=1/2|pages=5–31|doi=10.1023/A:1024458411589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors influencing chironomids distribution and abundance ====
There are several factors that has been affecting the abundance and distribution pattern of [[Chironomids]] over the past years.Therefore, it is important to be careful while making interpretations from their fossil records.There are several debates for the last many years on the impact of temperature on their abundance and diversity along with other associated factors. For the correct interpretation of the [[Fossil|fossil records]], it is important to understand all the associated factors of an ecosystem.In order to understand the different forces that have been affecting the [[fossil]] data of lake, it important to reconstruct [[Physical property|physical]], chemical and the [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient]] content of the lakes that actually shapes the communities.
Their distribution and abundance is highly influenced by the combination of human disturbance and change in the climate. Both of them influence the catchment area that resulted into the changing of [[Aquatic vegetation|vegetation]], [[hydrology]], and nutrients cycle. Any change at the regional level especially the temperature affects the water quality at the local scale and then at the end it affect the [[habitat]] that is species-specific.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

==== Chironomids and reconstruction of quantitative change in [[Holocene Epoch|Holocene climate]] ====
There is ongoing debate about the main factor that controls the distribution and abundance of chironomids.Several factors are considered as the controlling factor especially temperature that in turn control other supporting factors including Ph, [[salinity]], nutrient flow and productivity especially in the late [[Pleistocene]]/Holocene timer period. For many years research has been carried out on the relationship between temperature and chironomids distribution pattern due to its influence on its emergence. Chironomids are directly and indirectly affected by [[temperature]] during the whole life cycle including their larval emergence, growth, feeding and [[Insect reproduction|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; According to Eggermont and Heiri (2012) there is indirect impact of temperature on different physic chemical aspects of water resulted into determination of their distribution and abundance. There is also a strong relationship between the chironomids abundance, [[emergence]] and distribution with the mean temperature of the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=Hilde|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|title=The chironomid-temperature relationship: expression in nature and palaeoenvironmental implications|journal=Biological Reviews|date=May 2012|volume=87|issue=2|pages=430–456|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00206.x|pmid=22032243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research conducted by Gunten et al., 2007 at [[Lakes in Switzerland|high altitude lake]] Lej da la Tscheppain Switzerland, seasonal temperature reconstruction can be done with the help of independent chironomids and diatoms.Any change in the assemblage of chironomids reflects change in the temperature and duration of ice cover of that specific water body due to climate change. According to their findings, chironomids respond mostly to the change in the [[Temperature|summer temperature]], so seasonal variation in temperature can be inferred from different cores of the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Gunten|first1=Lucien|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|last3=Bigler|first3=Christian|last4=van Leeuwen|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Casty|first5=Carlo|last6=Lotter|first6=Andr?

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school was moved to the {{convert|60|acre|m2|sing=on}} plot at the confluence of the [[Potomac River]] and [[St. George's Creek]]&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt; at the Piney Point location in 1991,&lt;ref name="amo"/&gt; and at the same time renamed after former SIU president [[Paul Hall (labor leader)|Paul Hall]].

According to SIU, "Tens of thousands of rated and licensed seamen have completed upgrading classes at the training center. Additionally, more than 21,000 men and women from every state in the U.S., Puerto Rico and several U.S. territories have graduated from the trainee program for those just beginning their maritime careers."&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

The center features a number of buildings, including:&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;
* The Joseph Sacco Fire Fighting and Safety School
* The Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship
* The Thomas B. Crowley Sr. Education Center
* The Paul Hall Library and Maritime Museum
* The Romeo Lupinacci Culinary lab

Prior to the opening of the Paul Hall Center, SIU maintained training facilities at five different ports.  In 1966, the union bought the Piney Point site.  The program grew to include other offerings, such as a reading skills program, a  high-school equivalency program, an adult basic skills program, and English as a Second Language program.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

In 1978, SIU entered into an arrangement with [[Charles County Community College]] of Maryland which allows participants to earn an Associates of Arts degree.  In 1993, the Maryland Higher Education Commission authorized the college program to change its degree award to an Associate of Applied Science degree and to a certificate program in Maritime Technology.&lt;ref name="siu"/&gt;

== Training programs ==
Professional training begins with basic or entry-level vocational education programs. 
* Unlicensed Apprentice Program
* Deck Upgrading Courses
* Engine Department Upgrading Courses
* Steward Department Upgrading Courses
* Other Miscellaneous Courses
* Passenger Vessel Training
The upgrading programs provide experienced seafarers the opportunity to advance their professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/maryland/paul-hall-center-for-maritime-training-and-education Paul Hall Center Maritime Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

== NCL America ==
In 2004, [[Norwegian Cruise Lines|Norwegian Cruise Lines' ''NCL America'']] division began operating the [[Pride of Aloha]] in [[Hawaii]].  The cruise line was plagued by customer complaints which prompted them to seek out a training program for new employees.&lt;ref name="ncl bootcamp"&gt;{{cite web

Bleeding from hemorrhoids and vulvar lesions can be mistaken for postcoital bleeding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post coital bleeding can occur with discharge, itching, or irritation. This may be due to ''[[Trichomonas]]'' or ''[[Candidiasis|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name = mscape/&gt; A lack of estrogen can make vaginal tissue thinner and more susceptible to bleeding. Some have proposed that [[birth control pills]] may cause postcoital bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113478|title=Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of young women aged 20-24 with abnormal vaginal bleeding|last=Health|first=Department of|date=2010-03-03|access-date=2018-02-04|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101110212848/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113478|archivedate=2010-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk factors for developing postcoital bleeding are: low estrogen levels, rape and 'rough sex'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
Tests and detailed examination are used to determine the cause of the bleeding:
* a [[pregnancy test]]
* a [[pelvic examination]]&lt;ref name="nhs" /&gt; 
* obtaining tissue samples
* pap smear
* [[Colposcopy|colposcopic]] examination of the vagina and cervix
* [[ultrasound]]
* histogram
* cultures for bacteria&lt;ref name="mscape" /&gt;
* biopsy of tissues&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A [[Referral (medicine)|referral]] may be made to a specialist.&lt;ref name="nhs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/postcoital-bleeding-query-bank/|title=Postcoital bleeding|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal College of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynaecologists|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging may not be necessary. Cryotherapy has been used but is not recommended.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Postcoital bleeding rarely is associated with gynecological cancer in young women and its incidence is projected to drop due to the widespread [[Immunization|immunizations]] against [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]]. Postcoital bleeding has been most studied in women in the US.  In a large Taiwanese study, the overall incidence of postcoital bleeding was found to be 39-59  per 100,000 women. Those with postcoital bleeding had a higher risk of [[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia|cervical dysplasia]] and [[Cervical cancer|cervical cancer.]] [[Benignity|Benign]] causes of postcoital bleeding were associated with [[Cervical ectropion|cervical erosion]], ectropion, [[vaginitis]] and vulvovaginitis. Other associations were noted such as the presence of [[leukoplakia]] of the cervix, an [[Intrauterine device|intrauterine contraceptive device]], [[Cervical polyp|cervical polyps]], [[cervicitis]], [[menopause]], [[dyspareunia]], and [[vulvodynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Hsin-Li|last2=Chen|first2=Chuan-Mei|last3=Pai|first3=Lee-Wen|last4=Hwu|first4=Yueh-Juen|last5=Lee|first5=Horng-Mo|last6=Chung|first6=Yueh-Chin|date=2017-04-01|title=Comorbidity profiles among women with postcoital bleeding: a nationwide health insurance database|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-017-4327-7|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|language=en|volume=295|issue=4|pages=935–941|doi=10.1007/s00404-017-4327-7|issn=0932-0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Scotland approximately 1 in 600 women aged 20-24 experience unexplained bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study of African women found an that trauma from consensual sexual intercourse was a cause of postcoital bleeding in young women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== In society and culture ==
In Islamic culture, postcoital bleeding may be desired to "satisfy cultural and/or religious 'needs'".  It is controversial: 
{{Quote box|width=60em|align=left| quote = "From a Western-ethics perspective, the life-saving potential of the procedure is weighed against the role of the surgeon in directly assisting in a deception and in indirectly promoting cultural practices of sexual inequality. From an Islamic bioethical vantage point, jurists offer two opinions. The first is that the surgery is always impermissible. The second is that although the surgery is generally impermissible, it can become licit when the risks of not having postcoital bleeding harm are sufficiently great."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bawany|first=Mohammad H.|last2=Padela|first2=Aasim I.|title=Hymenoplasty and Muslim Patients: Islamic Ethico-Legal Perspectives|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1743609517312924|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=14|issue=8|pages=1003–1010|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2017.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{wiktionary|pounce}}
[[Image:PounceSprinkler.JPG|thumb|220px|A ''Pounce pot'' (or sprinkler) at the [[London Science Museum]]]]
'''Pounce''' is a fine powder, most often made from powdered [[cuttlefish bone]], that was used both to dry ink and to sprinkle on a rough writing surface to make it smooth enough for writing. This last was certainly needed if the paper came "[[Sizing|unsized]]", that is, lacking the thin gelatinous material used to fill the surface of the paper and make it smooth enough for writing with a [[quill]] or a [[nib (pen)|steel nib]]. It was also used to prepare the surface when [[Technical drawing|drafting]] with [[Technical pen|Rapidiograph pens]] on mylar, a common drafting medium in the late twentieth century. 

Although some people claim that pounce was never added afterwards to dry ink, this probably represents confusion between the two processes of preparing paper and drying the ink after writing. Experiment shows that using pounce does indeed smooth "unsized" paper but then does little or nothing to dry the ink after you have written on that prepared paper, and it is clearly the case that pouncing or sanding continued long after properly "sized" writing paper came into general use during the nineteenth century. 

The pounce or sand is gently sprinkled all over the writing on the paper. When using a quill or a steel nib, and with inks that are made up to match those typically in use during the 18th or 19th centuries, and provided the pen has been used with the fine strokes typical of handwriting of that period, the handwriting will be sufficiently dry within 10 seconds to allow the paper to be folded without blotting. Gently vibrating the paper whilst the pounce or sand is on it ensures that little or no pounce or sand sticks to the handwriting and excess sand or pounce is shaken off before folding the paper. 

In the 19th century the pounce pots or sanders often had a shallow dish round the top so that pounce or sand could be returned to the pot and reused. The process is very effective for quickly drying ink, and although [[blotting paper]] has been available since Tudor times, pounce or sand continued to be used throughout the nineteenth century because it was often cheaper.

[[File:PressureExchanger 2DSchematics.svg|thumb|300px|Schematics of a rotary pressure exchanger. {{nowrap|''A'': High pressure side,}} {{nowrap|''B'': Low pressure side,}} {{nowrap|''C'': Rotor rotation,}} {{nowrap|''D'': Sealed area,}} ''1'':High pressure reject water inflow, ''2'':Pressurized sea water, ''3'': Low pressure sea water inflow, ''4'': Low pressure reject water drain, {{nowrap|{{legend2|#ff0000}}: Reject water / concentrate,}} {{nowrap|{{legend2|#808080}}: Piston / barrier,}} {{nowrap|{{legend2|#00ffff}}: Sea water}}]]

A '''pressure exchanger''' transfers pressure [[energy]] from a high pressure fluid stream to a low pressure fluid stream. Many industrial processes operate at elevated pressures and have high pressure waste streams. One way of providing a high pressure fluid to such a process is to transfer the waste pressure to a low pressure stream using a pressure exchanger.

One particularly efficient type of pressure exchanger is a rotary pressure exchanger. This device uses a [[cylindrical]] rotor with longitudinal ducts parallel to its rotational axis. The rotor spins inside a sleeve between two end covers. Pressure energy is transferred directly from the [[high pressure]] stream to the low pressure stream in the ducts of the rotor. Some fluid that remains in the ducts serves as a barrier that inhibits mixing between the streams. This rotational action is similar to that of an old fashioned machine gun firing high pressure bullets and it is continuously refilled with new [[fluid]] cartridges. The ducts of the rotor charge and discharge as the pressure transfer process repeats itself.

The performance of a pressure exchanger is measured by the efficiency of the energy transfer process and by the degree of mixing between the streams. The energy of the streams is the product of their flow rates and pressures. Efficiency is a function of the pressure differentials and the volumetric losses (leakage) through the device computed with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\Sigma\text{ energy out} }{\Sigma\text{ energy in} }=\frac{(Q_G-L)\times(P_G-HDP)+(Q_B+L)\times(P_B-LDP)}{Q_G\times P_G+Q_B\times P_B}\qquad\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;
    
where Q is flow, P is pressure, L is leakage flow, HDP is high pressure differential, LDP is low pressure differential, the subscript B refers to the low pressure feed to the device and the subscript G refers to the high pressure feed to the device. 
Mixing is a function of the concentrations of the species in the inlet streams and the ratio of flow rates to the device.

==Reverse Osmosis with Pressure Exchangers==
[[File:ReverseOsmosis with PressureExchanger.svg|thumb|300px|Schematics of a [[reverse osmosis]] system (desalination) using a pressure exchanger. ''1'':Sea water inflow, ''2'': Fresh water flow (40%), ''3'':Concentrate Flow (60%), ''4'':Sea water flow (60%), ''5'': Concentrate (drain), ''A'': High pressure pump flow (40%), ''B'': Circulation pump, ''C'':Osmosis unit with membrane, ''D'': Pressure exchanger]]
One application in which pressure exchangers are widely used is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, pressure exchangers are used as [[energy recovery]] devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes [C] is directed [3] to the ERD [D]. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream [1] becomes stream [4]), which it then merges (with the aid of a circulation pump [B]) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump [A]. This combined stream feeds the membranes [C]. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure [5], expelled by the incoming feedwater flow [1].
 
Pressure exchangers save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the high pressure [[pump]]. In a seawater [[Reverse osmosis|RO]] system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane feed flow. Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the high pressure pump. Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane feed flow is pressurized with almost no energy input.

==Energy Recovery and Pressure Exchange Systems==
Seawater [[water desalination|desalination]] plants have produced potable water for many years. However, until recently desalination had been used only in special circumstances because of the high energy consumption of the process.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  
 
Early designs for desalination plants made use of various evaporation technologies. The most advanced are the [[multi-stage flash distillation]] seawater evaporation desalinators, which make use of multiple stages and have an energy consumption of over 9 kWh per cubic meter of potable water produced. For this reason large seawater desalinators were initially constructed in locations with low energy costs, such as the Middle East, or next to process plants with available waste heat. 
 
In the 1970s the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process was developed which made potable water from seawater by forcing it under high [[pressure]] through a tight membrane thus filtering out salts and impurities. These salts and impurities are discharged from the SWRO device as a concentrated brine solution in a continuous stream, which contains a large amount of high-pressure energy. Most of this energy can be recovered with a suitable device. Many early SWRO plants built in the 1970s and early 1980s had an energy consumption of over 6.0 kWh per cubic meter of potable water produced, due to low membrane performance, pressure drop limitations and the absence of energy recovery devices.

An example where a pressure exchange engine finds application is in the production of potable water using the reverse osmosis membrane process. In this process, a feed saline solution is pumped into a membrane array at high pressure. The input saline solution is then divided by the membrane array into super saline solution (brine) at high pressure and potable water at low pressure. While the high pressure brine is no longer useful in this process as a fluid, the pressure energy that it contains has high value. A pressure exchange engine is employed to recover the pressure energy in the brine and transfer it to feed saline solution. After transfer of the pressure energy in the brine flow, the brine is expelled at low pressure to drain.

Nearly all [[reverse osmosis plant]]s operated for the desalination of sea water in order to produce drinking water in
industrial scale are equipped with an energy recovery system based on turbines. These are activated by the concentrate (brine) leaving the plant and transfer the energy contained in the high pressure of this concentrate usually mechanically to the high-pressure pump. In the pressure exchanger the energy contained in the brine is transferred hydraulically&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

Therefrom results an economic energy recovery, amortization times for such systems varying between 2 and 4 years depending on the place of operation.

Reduced energy and capital costs mean that for the first time ever it is possible to produce potable water from seawater at a cost below $1 per cubic meter in many locations worldwide. Although the cost may be a bit higher on islands with high power costs, the PE has the potential to rapidly expand the market for seawater desalination.

By means of the application of a pressure exchange system, which is already used in other domains, a considerably higher efficiency of energy recovery of [[reverse osmosis]] systems may be achieved than with the use of reverse running pumps or turbines.
The pressure exchange system is suited, above all, for bigger plants i.e. approx. ≥ 2000 m3/d permeate production.

A '''pugmill''' or '''pug mill''' is a machine in which clay or other materials are mixed into a plastic state or a similar machine for the [[trituration]] of ore.&lt;ref&gt;"Pug-mill" def. 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Industrial applications are found in [[pottery]], [[brick]]s, [[cement]] and some parts of the [[concrete]] and [[asphalt]] mixing processes. A pugmill may be a fast continuous mixer. A continuous pugmill can achieve a thoroughly mixed, homogeneous mixture in a few seconds, and the right machines can be matched to the right application by taking into account the factors of agitation, drive assembly, inlet, discharge, cost and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics/processing/mixing-blending/pugmill-mixer-selection-guide {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003101542/http://www.bulk-solids-handling.com/?q=topics%2Fprocessing%2Fmixing-blending%2Fpugmill-mixer-selection-guide |date=2015-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing materials at optimum moisture content requires the forced mixing action of the pugmill paddles, while soupy materials might be mixed in a drum mixer. A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly. Some of the factors affecting mixing and residence time are the number and the size of the paddles, paddle swing arc, overlap of left and right swing arc, size of mixing chamber, length of pugmill floor, and material being mixed.

==Common construction and industrial uses==

Road Base - Dense well-graded aggregate, uniformly mixed, wetted, and densely compacted for building the foundation under a pavement.

Lime Addition to asphalt – Lime may be added to the cold feed of an [[asphalt plant]] to strengthen the binding properties of the asphalt.

Flyash Conditioning – Wetting [[fly ash]] in a pugmill to stabilize the ash so that it won’t create dust. Some flyashes have cementitious properties when wetted and can be used to stabilize other materials.

Waste stabilization – various waste streams are remediated with pugmills forcing the mixing of the wastes with remediation agents.

[[Roller-compacted concrete]] – (RCC) or rolled concrete is a special blend of concrete that has the same ingredients as conventional concrete but in different ratios. It has cement, water, and aggregates, but RCC is much drier and essentially has no slump. RCC is placed in a manner similar to paving, often by dump trucks or conveyors, spread by bulldozers or special modified asphalt pavers. After placement it is compacted by vibratory rollers.  
The “stiff” nature of RCC may require a paddle type pugmill to force the materials to mix completely and discharge easily.

[[Ceramic]]s pug mills, or commonly just "pugs", are not used to grind or mix, rather they extrude clay bodies prior to shaping processes. Some can be fitted with a vacuum system that ensures the extruded clay bodies have no entrapped air. According to the 1913 edition of [[Webster's Dictionary]], a clay pug mill typically consists of an upright shaft armed with projecting knives, which is caused to revolve in a hollow cylinder, tub, or vat, in which the clay body is placed.

Pugmills that run intermittently are used in the [[kaolin]] mining industry to mix certain grades of [[kaolin]] clay with water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17579">{{Italic title}}{{canon law}}'''''{{lang|la|Regulæ Juris}}''''', also spelled as '''''{{lang|la|Regulae}} -''''' and '''''- {{lang|la|Iuris}}''''' ({{Language with name/for||2=Latin|3=Rules of Law|links=no}}) is a generic term for general rules or principles serving chiefly for the interpretation of canon laws.

==Canonical use==
{{see also|Interpretation (canon law)}}
In a specific sense, however, ''{{lang|la|regulæ juris}}'' are certain fundamental laws in the form of [[axiom]]s found in the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'', eleven inserted by [[Pope Gregory IX]] at the end of the fifth Book of [[Decretals]], eighty-eight by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in the last title of ''Liber Sextus Decretalium''.

These rules are an exposition of several laws on the same subject, conclusions or deductions, rather than principles of law drawn from constitutions or decisions, and consequently reserved to the last title of the two books mentioned, in imitation of [[Justinian]] in the "Digest" (L, l, tit. 17).

While these rules are of great importance, it must be stated that few general statements are without exception. Some of the axioms are applicable in all matters, others are confined to judicial trials, benefices, etc. As examples the following are taken from the Liber Sextus: No one can be held to the impossible (6); Time does not heal what was invalid from the beginning (18); What is not allowed to the defendant, is denied to the plaintiff (32); What one is not permitted to do in his own name, he may not do through another (47).

== The Eighty-Eight by Boniface VIII ==
These 88 legal dicta or maxims known as ''{{lang|la|De Regulis Juris}}'' were promulgated in 1298 by [[Boniface VIII]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13215">The term “School Brand”, similar to "brand" as it applies to traditional business applications, is any type of term, mark or insignia, which identifies one organization or product from another. These marks were intended to indicate an affiliation with a particular school, group, organization, trade, manufacturer, or maker.

== History ==

While “branding” has history as far back as 1100&amp;nbsp;BCE, in a period referred to as the [[Vedic Period]], “School Branding” however is a relatively new concept. Many universities and colleges, now operate in a businesslike market where students are “customers” and other schools are competition. To successfully compete, a school must develop and market its own brand that differentiates it from the thousands of other schools vying for students and funding. Although most have marketing budgets, schools are still climbing the learning curve when relating to effective branding.

According to Branding Strategy Insider, school branding surfaced in the early 1800s when a few sororities and fraternities literally branded their pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2006/08/history_of_bran.html/ |title=History of Branding - Brand Strategy Insider |publisher=Brandingstrategyinsider.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, tobacco and patent medicine companies began branding their products as a way to identify them and build buyer loyalty. Brand identity also helped protect the customer by holding companies more accountable for product quality. By the mid-1800s, branding became central to business strategy as consumer companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] began using it in their marketing.

Higher education waited over a century to follow the corporate world. According to University Business, schools adopted branding in the early 2000s, when they realized that higher learning had evolved into a marketplace of customers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitybusiness.com/article/have-college-brands-delivered-their-promise|title=Have College Brands Delivered on Their Promise?|author=Robert A. Sevier|publisher=UB University Business|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of for-profit and online universities created more choices for students, and those newer schools were aggressively marketing in corporate style. Students were becoming more diverse, and schools could no longer take demographics for granted. At the same time, schools ranging from elementary to colleges and universities, had to compete harder for government funding and private endowments. To meet the challenges, universities invested in market research, logos and other marketing efforts that often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

== Present situation ==

Today’s school branding goes a step further and identifies a school’s unique competitive advantage. As stated in the Gallup Business Journal, a brand promises what the student experience will be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/28081/building-brand-higher-education.aspx/ |title=Building Brand Higher Education - Gallup Business Journal |publisher=Businessjournal.gallup.com |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many school departments produce their own distinctive communications, which can muddy the message. Colleges are grappling with the fact that the message is only effective if the entire faculty and leadership commit as one voice to the brand promise.

Schools also need to communicate their brand in a way that resonates emotionally with students. When people feel a message, they are more likely to remember it and respond. Brandgarten advocates using archetypes in branding to focus the emotional message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandgarten.com/2012/05/07/branding-higher-education|title=Branding Higher Education|publisher=brandgarden|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a school that places a high value on community service might use the archetype of the caregiver to tell its story. Prospective students would hear the call to service in all of the college's communications and could decide whether it was a potential match. Prior to branding, the same college would have been lost among superficially similar schools.

One recent rebranding occurred when [[Beaver College]], in Pennsylvania, surveyed prospective students and discovered that 30 percent of people considering the university did not apply because of the name. As a result, Beaver College was rebranded as [[Arcadia University]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunzel|first1=David|title=Universities Sell Their Brands|journal=The Journal of Product and Brand Management|date=2007|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=152-153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of need ==

[[Harvard University]], viewed as the college gold standard, relies on branding to help recruit students and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randall |first=Kevin |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1361340/does-branding-pay-colleges-harvard-thinks-so/ |title=Does Branding Pay Off for Colleges? Harvard Thinks So |publisher=Fast Company |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university took a lesson from its own business school and has applied for trademarks to protect several taglines. According to Fast Company, Harvard has already won approval for the taglines "Ask what you can do" and "Lessons learned". Harvard has also taken the entrepreneurial step of licensing its name to an upscale clothing line, which helps with branding as well as its funding mission.

Although colleges may be fairly new to branding, Neuromarketing points out that they represent the longest-lived brands in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fri, Jul 17, 2009 Neuromarketing, Branding |url=http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/college-branding.htm/ |title=College Branding |publisher= Neuromarketing |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools exist for decades and even centuries and today have thousands of rivals. As baby boomers age out of the education market, the declining number of prospective students is increasing competition among schools. Schools have responded with glossy marketing campaigns but still lag in branding. Neuromarketing notes that much college marketing material portrays similar images of a pleasant campus filled with smiling professors and a diverse student body. Websites, brochures and even tours often leave students and their families no wiser as to what makes a particular school special.

The missing ingredient is brand development, as [[Columbia University]] discovered in recent years. According to Neuromarketing, Columbia branded itself as the only Ivy League school in New York City and began showcasing the Manhattan experience in its marketing materials. Student applications have since increased over the competition, and many applicants cited location as the reason they chose Columbia University. Administrators of Columbia University realized that name recognition alone was not enough to attract more of the right students, and its branding strategy paid off.

Even as schools compete for students, those students are learning to brand themselves in an effort to impress colleges. High school is the right time to start building a personal brand, advises Visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vizibility.net/blog/its-never-too-early-personal-branding-for-high-school-college-students/ |title=It’s Never Too Early - Personal Branding for High School &amp; College Students - Visibility |author=Adrian Maynard| publisher=Vizibility.net |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young students can take several steps to enhance their uniqueness, beginning with defining a niche that will serve as the core of their brand. To build the school brand, they can start a quality blog and network both online and offline about its subject. Additional help in for schools in building a brand can be found by extended resources to companies like VIP Branding, who specializes in school branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvillageconcerns.com/ |title=Specializing in School Branding - VIP Branding |publisher=Globalvillageconcerns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allocation of resources to expert branding companies, allows school administrators to focus their attention to the needs of the school. By the time these students are ready to apply for college, they will have an edge over those who left personal branding up to the admissions essay.

Today’s students shop with brand awareness, and schools need to have a compelling message in place to attract them. Online school stores, like the ones offered through the Varsity Shop Program, provide a new avenue for schools to market themselves and their brand, through specialty designed and branded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsityshop.com/ |title=Varsity Shop Program |publisher=varsityshop.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although schools tends to be leery of corporate tactics, branding is an opportunity for them to define for themselves what makes them special. By doing so, schools enrich what they offer creating school spirit and student pride, helping students to carry that commitment and care onto higher education.

== Repercussions of improper use ==

While many school administrators, recognize the power of school branding, the lack of resources and funding have led to alternative solutions to professional branding. Logo infringement has increased through the years as a result of this acknowledged need for branding. Numerous schools across the United States are infringing upon trademarked logos without realizing they are in violation. The [[Sanford Herald]] notated a recent case with [[Lake Mary High School]] out of [[Florida]], was in such a case, when the school was given a cease and desist order to terminate the use of their ram logo because as their ram logo was too similar the [[Dodge Ram]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysanfordherald.com/view/full_story_obits/7668253/article-Lake-Mary-rallies-around-new-ram|title=Lake Mary rallies around a new ram|author=Rachel Delinski|publisher=The Sanford Herold|date=2010-05-26 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, logo infringement is accidental, but the resulting repercussions of using trademarked logos can lead to litigation, exorbitant fines, and can be disparaging on school morale.

In addition to logo infringement, the loss of brand identity is another resulting drawback to improper school branding. Unprofessionally designed logos or mascots, can lead to an undesired identity or a variety of versions, which can lead to brand confusion as notated in by Brand Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandempowerment.com/schools/school-challenges/brand-control/ |title=Brand Control |publisher=Brand Empowerment |date= |accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The limited success of Newly Industrialized Countries==
The reason that there have been so few scientists, who have made their mark globally, from most NIC's ([[Newly Industrialized Countries]]) is partly historical and partly social &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==The common thread==
A common thread can indeed be discerned in the state of science in many NICs. Thus although, most of the science establishments in the major NICs can be said to be doing fairly well, none of them have been as successful as the developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/may102004/1195.pdf|title=1195.pdf - may102004 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], a small technical elite arose in developing countries such as India, [[Pakistan]], [[Brazil]], and [[Iraq]] who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for [[Manhattan project]]-type enterprises in [[nuclear power]], [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], or [[space exploration]] they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost hundreds of millions of dollars but had limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/third_world_nukes.html|title=Nuclear Power in the Third World: An Analysis|website=Ccnr.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying [[nuclear weapons]] and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, [[Chandrayaan I]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'' चंद्रयान-1), which literally means "Moon Craft," is an unmanned lunar mission by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; [[Chang'e I]], China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their terminal education from some institution or university in US or Europe. In addition there have been hardly any [[Nobel laureate]]s in science who have conducted the path-breaking research in a native science establishment.

==Science in Brazil==
{{main|Science and technology in Brazil}}
Brazilian science effectively began in the 19th century, until then, Brazil was a poor colony, without universities, printing presses, libraries, museums, etc. This was perhaps a deliberate policy of the Portuguese colonial power, because they feared that the appearance of educated Brazilian classes would boost nationalism and aspirations toward political independence.

The first attempts of having a Brazilian science establishment were made around 1783, with the expedition of Portuguese naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues, who was sent by Portugal's prime minister, the Marquis of Pombal, to explore and identify Brazilian fauna, flora and geology. His collections, however, were lost to the French, when [[Napoleon]] invaded, and were transported to Paris by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]]. In 1772, the first learned society, the Sociedade Scientifica, was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], but lasted only until 1794. Also, in 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Bahia]]. In the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the main universities in Brazil were organised from a set of existing medical, engineering and law schools. The University of Brazil dates from 1927, the [[University of São Paulo]] - today the largest in the Country - dates from 1934.

Today, Brazil has a well-developed organization of science and technology. Basic research in science is largely carried out in public universities and research centers and institutes, and some in private institutions, particularly in non-profit non-governmental organizations. More than 90% of funding for basic research comes from governmental sources.

Applied research, technology and engineering is also largely carried out in the university and research centers system, contrary-wise to more developed countries such as the United States, [[South Korea]], [[Germany]], Japan, etc. A significant trend is emerging lately. Companies such as [[Motorola]], [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]] and IBM have established large R&amp;D&amp;I centers in Brazil. One of the incentive factors for this, besides the relatively lower cost and high sophistication and skills of Brazilian technical manpower, has been the so-called Informatics Law, which exempts from certain taxes up to 5% of the gross revenue of high technology manufacturing companies in the fields of telecommunications, computers, digital electronics, etc. The Law has attracted annually more than 1,5 billion dollars of investment in Brazilian R&amp;D&amp;I. Multinational companies have also discovered that some products and technologies designed and developed by Brazilians are significantly competitive and are appreciated by other countries, such as automobiles, aircraft, software, fiber optics, electric appliances, and so on.

The challenges Brazilian science faces today are: to expand the system with quality, supporting the installed competence; transfer knowledge from the research sector to industry; embark on government action in strategic areas; enhance the assessment of existing programmes and commence innovative projects in areas of relevance for the Country. Furthermore, scientific dissemination plays a fundamental role in transforming the perception of the public at large of the importance of science in modern life. The government has undertaken to meet these challenges using institutional base and the operation of existing qualified scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |title=Science in Brazil |author=José Galizia Tundisi |publisher=Government of Brazil |accessdate=2007-12-21 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AScience+in+Brazil&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215061136/http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/ingles/economia/ctec/panhist/apresent.htm |archivedate=December 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science in China==
{{Main|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China| Science in China}}

A question that has been intriguing many historians studying China is the fact that China did not develop a scientific revolution and Chinese technology fell behind that of Europe. Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|author=Nathan Sivin
|url=http://hps.arts.unsw.edu.au/hps_content/new/sivin_new_sts.htm
|title=Think Ahead
|publisher=university of New South wales \accessdate=2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century and that we are still far from understanding the scientific revolutions of the West and China in all their political, economic and social ramifications. Some like [[John K. Fairbank]] are of the opinion that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress.

[[Needham Research Institute|Needham]] argued, and most scholars agreed, that cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called "science". It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature. More recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have focused more on economic causes. Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought, as well as Kenneth Pomeranz' argument that resources from the New World made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.

Thus, it was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The Taoists, indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naive for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.  Similar grounds have been found for questioning much of the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived mainly from [[Taoist]] philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the scientific method, it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Even though there are physically verifiable anatomical or histological bases for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians, for instance skin conductance measurements show increases at the predicted points.

Today, science and technology establishment in the People's Republic of China is growing rapidly. Even as many Chinese scientists debate what institutional arrangements will be best for Chinese science, reforms of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] continue. The average age of researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has dropped by nearly ten years between 1991 and 2003. However, many of them are educated in the United States and other foreign countries.

Chinese university undergraduate and graduate enrollments more than doubled from 1995 to 2005. The universities now have more cited PRC papers than CAS in the Science Citation Index. Some Chinese scientists say CAS is still ahead on overall quality of scientific work but that lead will only last five to ten years.

Several Chinese immigrants to the United States have also been awarded the Nobel Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other overseas ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] that have achieved success in sciences include [[Fields Medal]] recipient [[Shing-Tung Yau]] and [[Terence Tao]], and [[Turing Award]] recipient Andrew Yao. [[Tsien Hsue-shen]] was a prominent scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, while [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] contributed to the Manhattan Project (some argue she never received the Nobel Prize unlike her colleagues [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]] due to sexism by the selection committee). Others include [[Charles K. Kao]], a pioneer in fiber optics technology, and [[Dr. David Ho]], one of the first scientists to propose that AIDS was caused by a virus, thus subsequently developing combination antiretroviral therapy to combat it. Dr. Ho was named [[TIME]] magazine's 1996 Man of the Year. In 2015, [[Tu Youyou]], a pharmaceutical chemist, became the first native Chinese scientist, born and educated and carried out research exclusively in the People's Republic of China, to receive the Nobel Prize in natural sciences.

==Science in India==

{{Main|Science and technology in India}}

The [[Science and technology in ancient India|earliest applications of science in India]] took place in the context of medicine, metallurgy, construction technology (such as ship building, manufacture of cement and paints) and in textile production and dyeing. But in the process of understanding chemical processes, led to some theories about physical processes and the forces of nature that are today studied as specific topics within the fields of chemistry and physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/physics.htm History of Indian Science and Technology: History of Physics and Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many mathematical concepts today were contributed by Indian mathematicians like [[Aryabhata]].

There was really no place for scientists in the Indian caste system. Thus while there were/are castes for the learned [[brahmins]], the warriors [[kshatriyas]], the traders [[vaishyas]] and the menial workers [[shudras]], maybe even the bureaucrats (the kayasths) there was/is hardly any formal place in the social hierarchy for a people who discover new knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul25/articles30.htm|title=articles30.htm - jul25 - currsci - Indian Academy of Sciences|website=Ias.ac.in|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or invent new devices based on the recently discovered knowledge, even though scientific temper has always been in India, in the form of logic, reasoning and method of acquiring knowledge. Its therefore no wonder that some Indians quickly learned to value science, especially those belonging to the privileged Brahmin caste during the British colonial rule that lasted over two centuries. Some Indians did succeed to achieve notable success and fame, examples include [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] and [[C. V. Raman]] even though they belonged to different castes. The science communication had begun with publication of a scientific journal, Asiatick Researches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1784as.html|title=1784 - Calcutta - Asiatic Society of Bengal - History of Scholarly Societies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1788. Thereafter, the science communication in India has evolved in many facets. Following this, there has been a continuing development in the formation of scientific institutions and publication of scientific literature. Subsequently, scientific publications also started appearing in Indian languages by the end of eighteenth century. The publication of ancient scientific literature and textbooks at mass scale started in the beginning of nineteenth century. The scientific and technical terms, however, had been a great difficulty for a long time for popular science writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''Smithsonian Environmental Research Center''' ('''SERC''') is a [[United States]] {{convert|2800|acre|km2|sing=on}} environmental research and educational facility operated by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  It is located on the [[Rhode River|Rhode]] and [[West River (Maryland)|West River]]s near [[Mayo, Maryland|Edgewater]] in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]], near the western shore of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The center's focus  of study is the [[ecosystem]]s of coastal zones, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay [[estuary]] and nearby [[wetlands]].

==History==
In 1964, Robert Lee Forrest of Baltimore left a 365-acre dairy farm on the Rhode River to the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb&gt;{{cite web|title=About SERC:History|url=http://serc.si.edu/about/history.aspx|work=SERC|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Chesapeake Center for Field Biology was established on the site of this former dairy farm.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;   A $375,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] was awarded and another $550,000 in other grants followed by the end of 1969.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;  These funds were used to  purchase another 568 additional acres adjoining the original parcel.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

In 1970, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Field Biology was renamed to the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies (CBCES) and land acquisition continued.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

In 1974, Jim Lynch was hired as the first on-site staff scientist.  Lynch had recently finished his Ph.D. from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Zoology]].&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

==Site==
The 2,600 acre site occupied by SERC contains coastal plain forests, land used for agriculture, wetlands and marshes, and brackish environments.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Colin and Derek Thomas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-SrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=%22Smithsonian+Environmental+Research+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATg8ahUKEwi4v7Hb747JAhUI2SYKHYrDCOU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Smithsonian%20Environmental%20Research%20Center%22&amp;f=false Birds of a Feather: Seasonal Changes on Both Sides of the Atlantic]. Matador. 2014. p.318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
SERC conducts research on topics that include [[Terrestrial ecoregion#Terrestrial ecoregions|terrestrial]], [[atmospheric]], and [[estuarine]] environmental research within the disciplines of [[botany]], [[ecology]], [[environmental education]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[microbiology]], [[physics]], and [[zoology]]. The center trains interns and graduate students, including pre-doctoral and doctoral students. Annually, the center receives over 10,000 students, teachers, and families who come to visit. It gives advice, consultation, and testimony to local, state, federal, and international governmental agencies, natural resource managers, policy makers, and conservation organizations.

It serves as a center of research and education on human impacts in land-sea interactions of the coastal zone. The center receives $20,000,000 in extramural grants and contracts funded from governmental agencies, foundations, and industry.

SERC developed and maintains an extensive database of [[invasive species]] in marine and estuarine ecosystems. The database tracks details on over 500 invasive species throughout coastal North America. SERC coordinates with the [[United States Geological Survey]], which has developed a similar database for freshwater invasions, and has worked with marine centers in other nations to study marine invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Gollasch, Stephan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQzwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=%22Smithsonian+Environmental+Research+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgyahUKEwjsx9_i9YHJAhVLWT4KHc_sAtY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Smithsonian%20Environmental%20Research%20Center%22&amp;f=false "Databases on Aquatic Alien Species: North and Mediterranean Seas and Non-European Initiatives"], from Invasive Aquatic Species of Europe, Erkki Leppäkoski, Stephan Gollasch, Sergej Olenin eds. Springer Science. 2002. p.522.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical innovation==
The center has been an innovator of biotelemetry to track behavior, habitat use, and movement of [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs ''(Callinectes sapidus)'']], a marine predator and a valuable crustacean fishery in North America. They are the  patent holder for the [[Radiometer|Spectral Radiometer]], the national standard for monitoring [[solar radiation]]. The center has  developed a model for testing estuarine water quality and watershed nutrient discharges.

Social cognition refers to the psychological processes that mediate thinking about others and the self at four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. Social cognitive neuroscience uses the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[social neuroscience]]. Social cognitive neuroscience employs human [[neuroimaging]], typically using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], [[electroencephalography]], and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Brain stimulation techniques such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] and [[transcranial direct-current stimulation]] are also used.

Social cognition is primarily subserved by two dissociable [[Large_scale_brain_networks|macro-scale brain networks]]: the [[mirror neuron|mirror neuron system]] (MNS) and [[default mode network]] (DMN). MNS is thought to represent and identify observable actions (e.g. reaching for a cup) that are used by DMN to infer unobservable mental states, traits, and intentions (e.g. thirsty).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-11-01|title=Understanding intentions from actions: Direct perception, inference, and the roles of mirror and mentalizing systems|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|language=en|volume=36|pages=426–433|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.03.012|pmid=25864592|issn=1053-8100|last1=Catmur|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar-Szakacs|first=Istvan|last2=Uddin|first2=Lucina Q.|date=2013|title=Self-Processing and the Default Mode Network: Interactions with the Mirror Neuron System|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|language=English|volume=7|pages=571|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00571|pmid=24062671|pmc=3769892|issn=1662-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concordantly, the activation onset of MNS precedes DMN during social cognition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, the extent of [[feedforward]], [[feedback]], and [[Recurrence|recurrent]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} processing within and between MNS and DMN is not yet well-characterized, thus it is difficult to fully dissociate the exact functions of the two networks and their nodes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

=== Mirror Neuron System (MNS) ===

[[Mirror neuron]]s, first discovered in [[macaque]] frontoparietal cortex, fire when actions are either performed or observed.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=G |last2=Craighero |first2=L |title=The mirror-neuron system. |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |date=2004 |volume=27 |pages=169–92 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 |pmid=15217330}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, similar sensorimotor "mirroring" responses have been found in the brain regions listed below, which are collectively referred to as MNS.&lt;ref name=Rizzolatti2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; The MNS is has been found to identify and represent intentional actions such as [[Facial expression|facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[Grasp|grasping]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rizzolatti|first1=G|last2=Fabbri-Destro|first2=M|date=April 2008|title=The mirror system and its role in social cognition.|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=179–84|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.001|pmid=18706501}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MNS may encode the ''concept'' of an action, not just the sensory and motor information associated with an action.

Mechanistic theories of MNS functioning fall broadly into two camps: motor and cognitive theories. Classical motor theories claim that abstract action representations arise from simulating actions within the motor system, while newer cognitive theories propose that abstract action representations arise from the integration of multiple domains of information: [[Perception|perceptual]], [[Motor system|motor]], [[Semantics|semantic]], and [[conceptual]].&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lingnau|first1=A|last2=Downing|first2=PE|date=May 2015|title=The lateral occipitotemporal cortex in action.|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=19|issue=5|pages=268–77|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.03.006|pmid=25843544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Aside from these competing theories, there are more fundamental controversies surrounding the human MNS – even the very existence of mirror neurons in this network is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caramazza|first=Alfonso|last2=Anzellotti|first2=Stefano|last3=Strnad|first3=Lukas|last4=Lingnau|first4=Angelika|date=2014-07-08|title=Embodied Cognition and Mirror Neurons: A Critical Assessment|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-013950|pmid=25032490|issn=0147-006X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickok2009" /&gt; As such, the term "MNS" is sometimes eschewed for more functionally-defined names such as "action observation network", "action identification network", and "action representation network".&lt;ref name="Hickok2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickok|first=Gregory|date=July 2009|title=Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=EN|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1229–1243|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21189|pmc=2773693|pmid=19199415}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Premotor Cortex ====

The [[macaque]] [[premotor cortex]] was the location of the first discoveries of mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; The premotor cortex is associated with a diverse array of functions, encompassing low-level motor control, motor planning, sensory guidance of movement, along with higher level cognitive functions such as [[Language processing in the brain|language processing]] and action comprehension.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=MS|last2=Aflalo|first2=TN|date=25 October 2007|title=Mapping behavioral repertoire onto the cortex.|journal=Neuron|volume=56|issue=2|pages=239–51|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.09.013|pmid=17964243}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premotor cortex has been found to contain subregions with unique [[Cytoarchitecture|cytoarchitectural]] properties, the significance of which is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael S.A.|date=2016-02-01|title=Ethological Action Maps: A Paradigm Shift for the Motor Cortex|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=121–132|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2015.10.008|issn=1364-6613|pmid=26628112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are also found throughout premotor cortex and adjacent sections of [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and [[supplementary motor area]]&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

Visuospatial information is more prevalent in ventral premotor cortex than dorsal premotor cortex.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses extend beyond ventral premotor cortex into adjacent regions of inferior frontal gyrus, including [[Broca's area]], an area that is critical to language processing and speech production.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishitani|first1=N|last2=Schürmann|first2=M|last3=Amunts|first3=K|last4=Hari|first4=R|date=February 2005|title=Broca's region: from action to language.|journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)|volume=20|pages=60–9|doi=10.1152/physiol.00043.2004|pmid=15653841}} {{open access}} {{update-inline|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action representations in inferior frontal gyrus can be evoked by language, such as action verbs, in addition to observed and performed action stimuli typically used in biological motion studies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. The overlap between language and action understanding processes in inferior frontal gyrus has spurred some researchers to suggest overlapping neurocomputational mechanisms between the two.&lt;ref name="Nishitani2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dorsal premotor cortex is strongly associated with motor preparation and guidance, such as representing multiple motor choices and deciding the final selection of action.&lt;ref name="Graziano2007" /&gt;

==== Intraparietal Sulcus ====
Classical studies of action observation have found mirror neurons in macaque [[intraparietal sulcus]].&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2004" /&gt; In humans, sensorimotor mirroring responses are centered around the anterior intraperietal sulcus, with responses also seen in adjacent regions such as [[inferior parietal lobule]] and [[superior parietal lobule]]. Intraparietal sulcus appears to be most sensitive to the motor features (relative to perceptual and semantic features) of biological motion.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt; Intraparietal sulcus is considered a part of the [[two streams hypothesis|dorsal visual stream]], but is also thought to receive inputs from upstream non-dorsal stream areas such as LOTC and posterior superior temporal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;

==== Lateral Occipitotemporal Cortex (LOTC) ====
LOTC encompasses lateral regions of the [[visual cortex]] such as area [[Visual cortex#Middle temporal visual area (V5)|V5]]. Though LOTC is typically associated with visual processing, sensorimotor mirroring responses and abstract action representations are reliably found in this region.&lt;ref name="Lingnau2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downing|first1=PE|last2=Peelen|first2=MV|date=2011|title=The role of occipitotemporal body-selective regions in person perception.|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=3–4|pages=186–203|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.582945|pmid=24168534}}&lt;/ref&gt; LOTC includes cortical areas that are sensitive to motion, objects, body parts, kinematics, body postures, observed movements, and semantic content in verbs.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Downing2011" /&gt; LOTC is thought to encode the fine sensorimotor details of an observed action (e.g. local kinematic and perceptual features).&lt;ref name=Downing2011/&gt; LOTC is also thought to bind together the different means by which a specific action can be carried out.&lt;ref name=Lingnau2015/&gt;

=== Default Mode Network (DMN) ===
{{See also|Theory_of_mind#Brain_mechanisms|}} The [[default mode network]] (DMN) is thought to process and represent abstract social information, such as mental states, traits, and intentions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amft|first=Maren|last2=Bzdok|first2=Danilo|last3=Laird|first3=Angela R.|last4=Fox|first4=Peter T.|last5=Schilbach|first5=Leonhard|last6=Eickhoff|first6=Simon B.|date=2014-01-08|title=Definition and characterization of an extended social-affective default network|journal=Brain Structure and Function|language=en|volume=220|issue=2|pages=1031–1049|doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0698-0|issn=1863-2653|pmc=4087104|pmid=24399179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-11-15|title=Understanding others' actions and goals by mirror and mentalizing systems: A meta-analysis|journal=NeuroImage|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=564–584|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.009|pmid=19524046|issn=1053-8119|last1=Van Overwalle|first1=Frank|last2=Baetens|first2=Kris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social cognitive functions such as [[theory of mind]], [[Mentalization|mentalizing]], [[emotion]] recognition, [[empathy]], [[Morality|moral]] cognition, and social [[working memory]] consistently recruit DMN regions in human neuroimaging studies.

==== Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) ====
{{See also|Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex|Ventromedial prefrontal cortex|Orbitofrontal cortex|}}
[[Medial prefrontal cortex]] (mPFC) is strongly associated with abstract social cognition such as mentalizing and theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Bryan T.|last2=Kober|first2=Hedy|last3=Wager|first3=Tor D.|last4=Ochsner|first4=Kevin N.|date=August 2012|title=A Meta-analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Studies of Self- and Other Judgments Reveals a Spatial Gradient for Mentalizing in Medial Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|language=en|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1742–1752|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00233|issn=0898-929X|pmc=3806720|pmid=22452556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Theoryofmind2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mentalizing about others activates much of the mPFC, but dorsal mPFC appears to be more selective for information about other people, while the middle mPFC may be more selective for information about the self.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The [[temporoparietal junction]] (TPJ) is thought to be critical to distinguishing between multiple agents, such as the self and other.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The right TPJ is robustly activated by false belief tasks, in which subjects have to distinguish between others' beliefs and their own beliefs in a given situation.&lt;ref name="Theoryofmind2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The TPJ is also recruited by the wide variety of abstract social cognitive tasks associated with the DMN.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Outside of the social domain, TPJ is associated with a diverse array of functions such as attentional reorienting, target detection, contextual updating, language processing, and episodic memory retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krall|first=S.

==== Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) ====

Social tasks recruit areas of lateral temporal cortex centered around [[superior temporal sulcus]] (STS), but also extending to superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and the temporal poles.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; During social cognition, the anterior STS and temporal poles are strongly associated with abstract social cognition and person information, while the posterior STS is most associated with [[social vision]] and biological motion processing.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The posterior STS is also thought to provide perceptual inputs to the mirror neuron system.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission''' ('''SOPAC''') was an inter-governmental regional organisation dedicated to providing services to promote sustainable development in the countries it serves. In 2010, its functions had been transferred to the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]] (SPC) and the [[Pacific Regional Environment Programme]] (SPREP), thus ending SOPAC as a separate entity. Today, SOPAC is a division of the SPC with its main office in Suva, Fiji.

==History==
SOPAC was created by the conclusion of a 1990 [[multilateral treaty]] known as the '''Agreement establishing the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission'''. The treaty was concluded and signed on 10 October 1990 in [[Tarawa]], [[Kiribati]]. It was signed by representatives of the governments of [[Australia]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Guam]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Western Samoa]].

Since SOPAC's foundation, [[American Samoa]], [[France]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Nauru]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Niue]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Palau]], [[Pitcairn Islands]], [[Tokelau]], [[United States]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]] have accepted the Agreement and thereby joined SOPAC.

==Activity==
SOPAC focuses on assisting SPC members in three key program areas, Ocean and Islands, Community Lifelines and Community Risk.
*Ocean and Islands is focused on research, development and management of non-living resources in ocean and island systems addressing issues relating to seabed resources, energy, maritime [[boundary delimitation]], and monitoring of ocean processes.
*Community Lifelines is a diversified program that strengthens national capacities in energy, water and sanitation, information and communications.
*Community Risk is a comprehensive program aimed at reduction of community vulnerability through improved hazard assessment and risk management.

Benefits accrue to SPC members directly through provision of basic geological knowledge and indirectly, through improvements in land and ocean use, leading to improved health through water and sanitation provision, wealth generation through the development of mineral resources, hazard and disaster management and sustainable development by taking into account the geo-environmental impacts of development.

Any island member can request assistance from SOPAC which is funded by member-country contributions and supported by the following donors: Australia, Fiji, [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], New Zealand, the Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance, [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the [[European Union]], and certain [[United Nations|UN]] agencies.

== Major projects ==
; Environmental Vulnerability Index : SOPAC has contributed to the development of EVI to provide a new global indicator related to environmental issues.

; Reducing Vulnerabilities in Pacific ACP states : This project, based on three components, [[Water]], [[Risk]]s, and [[Aggregate (composite)|Aggregate]], is also providing assistance in [[Bathymetry]] mapping, [[Remote sensing]], [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] and the installation of [[Open-source software|open source]] web based map servers ([[Geospatial Content Management System]]) for fourteen Pacific Islands Countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71060">The '''spiral of silence theory''' is a [[political science]] and [[mass communication]] theory proposed by the [[Germany|German]] [[political scientist]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], which stipulates that individuals have a fear of [[solitude|isolation]], which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Background==
According to Shelly Neill, "Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure."{{Sfn|Neill|2009|p=42}} The spiral of silence theory suggests that "people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Applicatinon|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|location=New York|pages=411|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. "As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} "In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the [[spiral]] refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} The following steps summarize how the process works:
#We can distinguish between fields where the opinions and attitudes involved are static, and fields where those opinions and attitudes are subject to changes... Where opinions are relatively definite and static – for example, "customs" – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.
#Individuals who, when observing their environments, notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and is taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#It follows from this that, as the representatives of the first opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent, there is a definite influence on the environment: an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

This is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

Further, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a [[Positive feedback|dynamic process]], in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]] becomes the [[status quo]], and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=278}}

==Epistemology==
===Public===
Scholars have long argued over the concept of ''public'' within "public opinion". The use of "[[public]]" and "the public" betrays multiple competing meanings.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Opinion===
"Common [[Opinion]]" is what the Scottish social philosopher [[David Hume]] called it in his 1739 published work ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French "opinion."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} In researching the term opinion, ''meinung'' in German, researchers were led back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In Plato's ''Republic'', a quote from [[Socrates]] conclude that opinion takes the middle position. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered opinion to be an "insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively."{{Sfn|Kant|1781|p=498}} How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Public opinion===
The term [[public opinion]] first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase ''[[public opinion]].'' [[Hermann Oncken]], a German historian, stated &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a [[Proteus]], a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was said to be a "fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. "The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

The American sociologist [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward Ross]] described [[public opinion]] in 1898 using the word "cheap". "The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Many possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than "on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is this Thing we Call Public Opinion? Reflections on the Spiral of Silence|url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/368|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 September 2012|issn=0954-2892|pages=368–386|volume=24|issue=3|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds014|language=en|first=Kurt|last=Lang|first2=Gladys Engel|last2=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book "Public Opinion," published in 1923.&lt;ref name="Lippmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippmann|first1=W|title=Public opinion|date=1946|publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states "the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noelle-Neumann|first1=Elisabeth|title=The spiral of silence: Public opinion, our social skin|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda-setting theory]] is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media.&lt;ref name="AgendaSetting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaw|first2=D. L|date=1972|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990|last1=McCombs|first1=M. E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; The media battles with these news alternatives by creating "pseudo-crises" and "pseudo-novelties."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Media's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a "one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the [[conversation]]."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic Needle model]],&lt;ref name="CommChar" /&gt; the spiral model assumes an active audience "who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals."&lt;ref name="CommChar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball-Rokeach|first1=S|last2=Cantor|first2=M. G|title=Media, audience, and social structure|date=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge "gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The spiral of silence: examining how cultural predispositions, news attention, and opinion congruency relate to opinion expression|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=2013-04-01|issn=0129-2986|pages=113–134|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|first=Shirley S.|last=Ho|first2=Vivian Hsueh-Hua|last2=Chen|first3=Clarice C.|last3=Sim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho et al. point out that "among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Noelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=C. J|last2=McLeod|first2=J.M|title=Implications of the spiral of silence theory for communication and public opinion research|journal=Political communication yearbook|date=1984|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennamer|first1=J.D|title=Self-serving biases in perceiving the opinions of others: Implications for the spiral of silence|journal=Communication Research|date=1990|doi=10.1177/009365090017003006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=393–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the "micro-climate" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media.&lt;ref name="Kennamer" /&gt; Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=P. J|last2=Wackman|first2=D. B|title=Mass media and community public opinion|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=1973|volume=16|issue=4|doi=10.1177/000276427301600408|pages=593–606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
===Fear of isolation===
The fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence.{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] in the [[Asch conformity experiments]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2012}} People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

===Assessing the climate===
This assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiman|first1=Gabriel|title=Communicating Unreality|date=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quasi-statistical sense====
Individuals use what is described as "an innate ability" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2005|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}
{{Quote|The [[Mass media]] play a large part in determining what the dominant opinion is, since our direct observation is limited to a small percentage of the population. The mass media have an enormous impact on how public opinion is portrayed, and can dramatically impact an individual's perception about where public opinion lies, whether or not that portrayal is factual.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} }}

====Pluralistic ignorance====
[[Pluralistic ignorance]] may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=J. Nicole|title=Intergroup Contact and Pluralistic Ignorance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=91–107|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.91|pmid=15631577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of public opinion matters===
Our evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a ''vocal minority'' (the complement of the ''[[silent majority]]'') by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=279}} It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are "people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the [[avant-garde]] are "the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}}

==Application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena,&lt;ref name=PopCulture&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedel|first1=T|title=The spiral of silence in popular culture: applying a public opinion theory to radio station popularity|journal=California State University|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to smoking.{{Sfn|Shanahan|Scheufele|Yang|Hizi|2004}} Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component,&lt;ref name=NoelleBook /&gt; many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAbortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=C.T|last2=Neuwirth|first2=k|title=Perceptions of opinion "climates" and willingness to discuss the issue of abortion|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1990|volume=67|issue=3|pages=567–577|doi=10.1177/107769909006700312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[affirmative action]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAffirmative&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=P|last2=Domke|first2=D|last3=Stamm|first3=K|title=The spiral of silence and public opinion on affirmative action|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2001|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.1177/107769900107800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=SpiralOnCapital&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=A.F|title=Exploring the Forms of Self-Censorship: On the Spiral of Silence and the Use of Opinion Expression Avoidance Strategies|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=4|pages=785–802|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social [[conformity]] and [[culture]], motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of [[psychology]] in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion.&lt;ref name=Milgram&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milgram|first1=S|title=Nationality and conformity|journal=Scientific American|date=1961|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45|volume=205|issue=6|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a [[meta-analysis]] regarding [[Asch conformity experiments]], for example, suggest that [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.&lt;ref name=MetaAsch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Rod|last2=Smith|first2=Peter B.|title=Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=1|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States and Taiwan====
''A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence'' by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is [[individualistic culture|an "individualistic" society]], while Taiwan is a "[[collectivist]]" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the "I" identity over the "we" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including [[self-efficacy]] and [[self-assurance]].

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in [[Somalia]], and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose "favor," "neutral" or "oppose" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the [[individualism]] and collectivism constructs, and the "motives of not expressing opinion" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it "unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion." Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.{{Sfn|Huang|2005}}

====Basque nationalism====
''Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence'' is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as "How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a "fear of isolation" in regards to fellow [[Basques]]. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.{{Sfn|Spencer|Stephen|2008}}

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study, by Henson and Denker "investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, [[political affiliation]], and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university [[classroom climate]]s and [[communication behavior]]s."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The goal of the article was to "determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], [[cultural communication|cultural]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[political communication]]. Henson and Denker said, "Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and [[political ideology|ideological]] differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on [[face-to-face interaction]] before 2000, the theory was later applied to a [[computer-mediated communication]] environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDevitt|first1=M.|title=Spiral of Moderation: Opinion Expression in Computer-Mediated Discussion|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=454–470|doi=10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name=OnlineKorea&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung Choi|first1=Yun|last2=Lee|first2=Cheolhan|last3=Hyuk Lee|first3=Jong|title=Influence of poll results on the advocates' political discourse: An application of functional analysis debates to online messages in the 2002 Korean presidential election|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1080/0129298042000195189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silence in the crowd: The spiral of silence contributing to the positive bias of opinions in an online review system|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/17/11/1811|journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]]|date=1 December 2015|issn=1461-4448|pages=1811–1829|volume=17|issue=11|doi=10.1177/1461444814535190|language=en|first=David A.|last=Askay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended "into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms" and "the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression" is also addressed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===In social media contexts===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the [[social media]] context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users "who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Was It Something I Said?" "No, It Was Something You Posted!" A Study of the Spiral of Silence Theory in Social Media Contexts|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|date=2015-04-16|pages=208–213|volume=18|issue=4|doi=10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|language=en|first=Sherice|last=Gearhart|first2=Weiwu|last2=Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another research confirms the positive relationship between speaking out and issue importance on the social media context as well: individuals who view [[Gay bashing|gay bullying]] as a significant social issue are more likely to comment on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gearhart|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=W.|title=Gay Bullying and Online Opinion Expression: Testing Spiral of Silence in the Social Media Environment|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=23 September 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–36|doi=10.1177/0894439313504261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to [[social capital]] context. Recent studies see social capital as "a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Social Capital and the Spiral of Silence|last=Dalisay|first=Francis|date=2012|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds023|pmid=|accessdate=|last2=Hmielowski|first2=Jay D.|last3=Kushin|first3=Matthew James|last4=Yamamoto|first4=Masahiro|volume=24|issue=3|pages=325–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--[[civic engagement]], trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the study shows that "only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Internet==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as [[social withdrawal]], defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction.{{Sfn|O'Connor|1969}}{{Sfn|O'Connor|1972}} Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of [[peer rejection]].{{Sfn|Gottman|Gonso|Rasmussen|1975}} Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings{{Sfn|Kraut|Patterson|Lundmark|Kiesler|1998}}{{Sfn|Moody|2001}}{{Sfn|Sleek|1998}} or how the Internet decreases [[social isolation]] of people by allowing them to expand their [[social network]]s and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family.{{Sfn|Morris|Ogan|2002}}{{Sfn|Bradley|Poppen|2003}} Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the [[World Wide Web]], a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[newsgroup]]s, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial [[virtual communities]].{{Sfn|Sassenberg|2002}} The theories and hypotheses about how [[Internet]]-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, [[online game]]s, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.{{Sfn|Rheingold|1993}}{{Sfn|Cummings|Sproull|Kiesler|2002}}{{Sfn|McKenna|Bargh|1998}}

Traditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the [[peer group]] and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers.{{Sfn|Bowker|Bukowski|Zargarpour|Hoza|1998}} From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever.{{Sfn|Witschge|2002}} Witschge further explained, "Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully."{{Sfn|Witschge|2002|p=8}}

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that "Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own."{{Sfn|van Alstyne|Brynjolfsson|1996|p=24}} The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it "makes manageable large-scale, [[many-to-many]] discussion and deliberation."{{Sfn|Coleman|Gøtze|2001|p=17}} Unlike [[traditional media]] that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.{{Sfn|O'Hara|2002}}

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many [[reference group|reference]] and [[social group]]s are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009|p=36}} Liu and Fahmy stated that "it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group."{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in [[online forum]]s (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nekmat|author2=Gonzenbach|journal=JMCQ|year=2013|volume=90|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"/&gt;

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, "The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other."{{Sfn|Page|1996|p=124}} The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as [[chat room]]s and newsgroups.{{Sfn|Wanta|Dimitrova|2000}}{{Sfn|O'Sullivan|1995}}{{Sfn|Sproull|Kiesler|1992}}{{Sfn|Hiltz|Johnson|Turoff|1986}}

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|pp=124–25}}

The groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}} Stromer-Galley considered that "an absence of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.{{Sfn|Stromer-Galley|2002|p=35}}

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[computer-mediated communication]], physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Second, a great deal of [[normative influence]] is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as [[eye contact]] and [[gestures]],{{Sfn|Burgoon|Buller|Woodall|1989}} but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal [[social context]] cues convey formality and status inequality in [[face-to-face communication]].{{Sfn|Keisler|Siegel|McQuire|1984}} When these cues are removed, the importance of [[social status]] as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment.{{Sfn|Williams|1977}} The form and consequences of [[conformity]] influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the [[social presence]] of participants.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Social presence is defined as the degree of [[salience (language)|salience]] of the other person in the interaction{{Sfn|Short|Williams|Christie|1976}} or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.{{Sfn|Rice|Williams|1984}}

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and [[equal opportunities]] to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a [[deliberation]]. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by [[pecking order|dominant others]], or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the [[social hierarchies]] and power relations that exist offline: "The 'blindness' of [[cyberspace]] to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the [[social position]] of the poster".{{Sfn|Dahlberg|2001|p=14}}

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: "if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation".{{Sfn|Gastil|2000|p=359}} While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens [[stereotyping]] and [[prejudice]].{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}}

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. [[Racism]], [[ageism]], and other kinds of [[discrimination]] against out groups "seems to be diminishing because the cues to [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] status are not as obvious".{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|p=99}} Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, [[Information sharing|share]] and [[information organization|organize]] [[information]],{{Sfn|Warren|2001}} realizing more equality of [[information access|access to information]].{{Sfn|Gimmler|2001}}

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through [[Opinion poll|survey]]s&lt;ref name=Method&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuwirth|first1=K|title=The Spiral of Silence and Fear of Isolation|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=450–468|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this [[methodology]] as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Talk: Manipulating the Dependent Variable in Spiral of Silence Research|journal=Communication Research|date=1 June 2001|volume=28|issue=3|pages=304–324|doi=10.1177/009365001028003003|last1=Scheufele|first1=D. A.|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|last3=Lee|first3=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among different approaches to survey methodology, [[cross-sectional study]] design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory.&lt;ref name=Method /&gt; Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Method" /&gt;

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed [[panel data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Cheryl|title=Popularity in a Freefall: Measuring a Spiral of Silence at the End of the Bush Presidency|last2=Baldassare|first2=Mark|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1994|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1093/ijpor/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is "observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it "leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.{{Sfn|Moy|Domke|Stamm|2001}}

Scholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person "has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures.{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's "perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=J.|title=Observing the "Spiral" in the Spiral of Silence|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–176|date=2014|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edu032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Legacy of Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann: The Spiral of Silence and Other Controversies|last=Splichal|first=Slavko|date=2015|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323115589265|pmid=|access-date =|volume=30|issue=3|pages=353–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that "it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion "is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
Research indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of "recognizing cognitive bias" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked  or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Scott Percival (2012). "The Myth of the Closed Mind: Explaining why and how People are Rational".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Fusari (2014).

[[File:Streetlight 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[High pressure sodium lamp| A High pressure sodium street light]] fixture]]
'''Street light interference''' ('''SLI''') is a term coined by [[paranormal]] author [[Hilary Evans]] to denote the claimed ability of individuals to turn [[street light]]s or outside building [[security lighting|security lights]] on or off when passing near them. Believers in SLI allege that they experience it on a regular basis with specific lamps and more frequently than chance would explain; however, SLI has never been demonstrated to occur in a scientific experiment, and those who claim the ability have been found to be unable to reproduce the effect on demand.&lt;ref name=WaPost&gt;Linton Weeks. "Bad Karma, Or Just Bad Lightbulbs?; The Mystery Of Blinking Street Lights." [[The Washington Post]]. Washingtonpost Newsweek Interactive. 2002. [http://www.highbeam.com HighBeam Research]. 19 Sep. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Independent Investigations Group |title=Light Bulb Luminosity Demonstration |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/light_bulb_luminosity_demonstration |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center For Inquiry |accessdate=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proponents ==
According to Evans, SLI is a phenomenon "based on claims by many people that they involuntarily, and usually spontaneously, cause street lamps to go out." Evans' 1993 book ''The SLI Effect'' proposes that the phenomenon is "not consistent with our current knowledge of how people interact with the physical world." Evans coined the term "SLIder" to refer to someone who allegedly causes this effect, and cites SLIders' claims of being able to "extinguish a row of [[sodium vapor lamp]]s in sequence, each one going out as the witnesses nears it."&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer" /&gt;

Some proponents believe static electricity or "some kind of “energy” emitted by the human body" is responsible for SLI. Others claim the alleged phenomenon is caused by individuals having [[psychic]] or [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] ability.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt;

== Reception ==
Author [[Massimo Polidoro]] writing in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' has considered claims of SLI to be examples of [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation not implying causation]], or of [[confirmation bias]]: people are much more likely to notice when a nearby street light turns on or off than they are to notice a light turning on or off at a distance, or a street light in a steady state at any distance. This is compounded by a failure mode of street lights, known as "cycling", in which street lights of the high pressure sodium type turn off and on more frequently at the end of their life cycle.&lt;ref name="straightdope"&gt;Cecil" Adams. [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_047.html "Can some people extinguish streetlamps by means of their bodily emanations?"] In "The Straight Dope", October 28, 1994. Retrieved April 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A high pressure sodium engineer at [[General Electric]], quoted by [[Cecil Adams]], summarizes SLI as "a combination of coincidence and wishful thinking".&lt;ref name="straightdope" /&gt; Polidoro notes that "Paranormal phenomenon is the least likely possibility."&lt;ref name="skepticalinquirer"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2267">'''Thoriated glass''' is a [[glass]] material used in the manufacture of optical systems, specifically [[Camera lens|photographic lenses]]. It is useful to this process due to its high [[refractive index]]. Thoriated glass is [[radioactive]] due to the inclusion of [[thorium dioxide]], oxide of radioactive element [[thorium]]. It has therefore been succeeded as a material of choice by glass including [[lanthanum oxide]]. Thoriated glass can contain up to 30% by weight of thorium.&lt;ref name="McMillan"&gt;http://www.irpa.net/irpa3/cdrom/VOL.3B/W3B_13.PDF Robert C. McMillan &amp; Steven A. Horne: ''Eye Exposure from Thoriated Optical Glass'' (U.S. Army memo)&lt;/ref&gt; The thoriated glass elements in lenses over time develop a brown tint reducing transmission and interfering with neutral color reproduction.

Many Kodak and Takumar lenses that were produced prior to the 1960s are radioactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dsider.co.uk/bills-blogs/radioactive-camera-lenses/|title=Radioactive Camera Lenses from the recent past|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation browning==
Over extended time periods, thoriated glass may develop significant discoloration. This is due to induced [[F-center|F-centers]] forming in the glass as the [[radioactive decay]] of the thorium progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0RX1mbhzAEC&amp;dq=radiation+browning&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Properties of Optical Glass|last=Bach|first=Hans|last2=Neuroth|first2=Norbert|date=1998-08-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540583578|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of F-centers is due to the [[ionizing]] effect of the high energy thorium decay products. This process can potentially be reversed by [[Annealing (glass)|annealing]] the glass or exposing it to [[light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sealandair.fr/pdf/birns-nucleaire/camera-lights/radiation-induced-discoloration.pdf|title=Radiation-induced Discoloration|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sealandair.fr|publisher=BIRNS, Inc .|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26571">A [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|system of plant taxonomy]], the '''Thorne system''' of plant classification was devised by the American botanist [[Robert Folger Thorne|Robert F. Thorne]] (1920–2015) in 1968,{{sfn|Thorne|1968}} and he continued to issue revisions over many years (1968–2007).{{sfn|Thorne|1968}}{{sfn|Thorne|1976}}{{sfn|Thorne|1977}}{{sfn|Thorne|1983}}{{sfn|Thorne|1992a}}{{sfn|Thorne|1992b}}{{sfn|Reveal|1999a}}{{sfn|Thorne|Reveal|2007}}

Some versions of the system are available online. The Bioinformatics Working Group Center for the Study of Digital Libraries at Texas A&amp;M University lists the March 1999 version&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/newgate/thor1ang.htm Robert F. Thorne. 1992. Classification and Geography of Flowering Plants. Botanical Review 58: 225-348 as updated December, 1992 and March, 1999.] Source for March 1999 in {{harvtxt|Reveal|1999a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and other classification systems).&lt;ref&gt;[http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/newgate/cronang.htm Texas A&amp;M Flowering Plant Gateway]&lt;/ref&gt; James Reveal's course lecture notes (1999) also gives an account of the Thorne system at that time, with an extensive listing of synonyms, both nomenclatural and taxonomic, for each name in the system{{sfn|Reveal|1999b}} together with several other classification systems.{{sfn|Reveal|1999c}}

For a discussion of the various [[suffixes]] used for [[superorders]] (''-florae'' ''vs.'' ''-anae''), see Brummitt 1992,{{sfn|Brummitt|1992|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;770–776}} and Thorne 1992.{{sfn|Thorne|1992a}} In this latter paper, Thorne sets out his reasons for abandoning ''-florae'' for ''-anae'', following contemporary practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">The '''Wayqecha Biological Station''' is a [[tropical ecology|tropical ecological]] [[research station]] near [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]]. This research station is located (13°10'38.06"S, 71°36'16.36"W) in the upper reaches of the river Cosñipata, an affluent of the [[Madre de Dios River]], in the [[Paucartambo Province]], [[Cusco Region]].  The station ranges from 2200 to 3700 m in elevation and includes several Andean [[ecosystem]]s, such as montane forests, elfin forests, montane scrub and high-Andean grassland ([[Puna grassland|puna]]). These ecosystems are connected by a series of trails and by the road Paucartambo-Shintuya. The station was established in 2005 and is managed by two non-governmental organizations: the Peruvian NGO Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica (ACCA) and the US-based [[Amazon Conservation Association]] (ACA), which also manage the [[Los Amigos Biological Station]] in the lowland rainforest of southeastern Peru.  

Current research at Wayqecha includes a multidisciplinary project studying [[Carbon cycle|carbon cycling]] in soils and montane forests and their response to [[climate change]], and  studies of plant and animal diversity patterns along the Andean elevational gradient. Wayqecha hosted a field course of the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] in 2007.

==Access==
Wayqecha is located along the Paucartambo-Shintuya road, approximately 1 hour east of Paucartambo and 4–5 hours east of [[Cusco]], the nearest city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">[[Image:Winogradsky Week1.jpg|thumb|300px|right| This picture depicts the initial appearance of three different Winogradsky columns.  They are soil and water samples from a river, the later two columns have been modified with phosphate, nitrate, sulfur and oxygen additives. These additions promote the growth of various bacteria specific to the anaerobic and aerobic regions of the column.]]
[[Image:week7.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Shown above as a result of a 7-week period where the columns have been allowed to grow [[algae]], cyanobacteria and other bacterial colonies.  Of specific interest are the red regions of the middle column, indicative of purple non-sulfur bacteria (e.g. ''[[Rhodospirillaceae]]''). Also, in column three, the red growth along the side of the column: a purple sulfur bacterium, ''[[Chromatium]]''.]]

The '''Winogradsky column''' is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of [[microorganism]]s. Invented in the 1880s by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper (containing [[cellulose]]), blackened marshmallows or egg-shells (containing [[calcium carbonate]]), and a [[sulfur]] source such as gypsum ([[calcium sulfate]]) or egg yolk.  Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]]/[[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] gradient as well as a sulfide gradient.  These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as ''[[Clostridium]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'', ''[[Chlorobium]]'', ''[[Chromatium]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', and ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.

The column provides numerous gradients, depending on additive nutrients, from which the variety of aforementioned organisms can grow.  The aerobic water phase and anaerobic mud or soil phase are one such distinction. Because of oxygen's low solubility in water, the water quickly becomes [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] towards the interface of the mud and water.  Anaerobic phototrophs are still present to a large extent in the mud phase, and there is still capacity for biofilm creation and colony expansion, as shown in the images at right.  Algae and other aerobic phototrophs are present along the surface and water of the upper half of the columns.  Green growth is often attributed to these organisms.

==Construction==

The column is a rough mixture of ingredients – exact measurements are not critical. A tall glass (30&amp;nbsp;cm long, &gt;5&amp;nbsp;cm wide) is filled one third full of pond mud, omitting any sticks, debris, and air bubbles. Supplementation of ~0.25% w/w calcium carbonate and ~0.50% w/w calcium sulfate or sodium sulfate is required (ground eggshell and egg yolk respectively are rich in these minerals), mixed in with some shredded newspaper, filter paper or hay (for cellulose). An additional anaerobic layer, this time of unsupplemented mud, brings the container to two thirds full.  Alternatively, some procedures call for sand to be used for the layer above the enriched sediment as to allow for easier observation and sampling of resulting populations. This is followed by water from the pond to saturate the mud (or sand) and occupy half the remaining volume. The column is sealed tightly to prevent evaporation of water and incubated for several months in strong natural light.

After the column is sealed tightly the anaerobic bacteria will develop first, including ''Clostridium'' spp. These anaerobic bacteria will consume the cellulose as an energy source. Once this commences they create CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is used by other bacteria and thus the cycle begins. Eventually colour layers of different bacteria will appear in the column. At the bottom of the column will be black anaerobic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S dominated zone with sulfur reducing bacteria, the layer above will be green sulfur photosynthetic anaerobic bacteria, then the layer will be purple which is sulphur anaerobic bacteria, followed by another column of purple anaerobic non-sulfur bacteria and at the top will be a layer of Cyanobacteria which is sulphur oxidising bacteria. This top layer of aerobic bacteria, produces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which feeds back into the column creating further reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Corner, T. (1992). Ecology in a Jar. The Science Teacher. (59)3, 32&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Winogradsky column is an excellent tool to see whole communities of bacteria, it does not allow one to see the densities or individual bacterial colonies. It also takes a long time to complete its cycle. However its importance in environmental microbiology should not be overlooked and it is still an excellent tool to determine the major bacterial communities in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarin, G.A. (2006). Winogradsky and Modern Microbiology. Microbiology. (75)3, 501-511&lt;/ref&gt;
