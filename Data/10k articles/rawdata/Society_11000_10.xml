      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11409">'''Aizkolaritza''' {{IPA-eu|ais̻koˈlaɾits̻a|}} is the [[Basque language|Basque]] name for a type of [[Wood chopping|wood-chopping]] competition. They are a popular form of ''herri kirol'' ([[Basque rural sports|rural sport]]) in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. Competitions are commonly held at most festivals, especially town festivals and usually involve at least two individuals or teams competing against each other.

==The name==
The sport is called ''aizkolaritza'' in [[Basque language|Basque]], from ''aizkolari'' "wood-chopper" plus the noun-forming [[suffix]] ''-tza''. The word ''aizkora'' "axe" itself is derived from [[Latin]] ''asciola''.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, L. ''The History of Basque'', Routledge 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''aizkol jokoa'' the "axe game". [[Spanish language|Spanish]] uses a loanword from Basque, ''aizcolari'' and in [[French language|French]] the sport is called ''coupeurs de bûches''.

==Rules==
[[Image:LuxioApustua.jpg|thumb|350px|Luxio chopping a trunk with a 2.10m diameter in 1949]]
The sections of trunk are usually [[beech]] without visible [[Wood#Knots|knots]] from the forests of [[Navarre]]. For competitions, the trunk sections closest to the roots or branches are used as they are of less value to the wood industry. The trunks are categorised according to their [[circumference]] using Basque [[inch]]es (''ontza''), equivalent to 0.0254m. They commonly are used in the following sizes: 
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Ontza'''
|'''Basque name'''
|'''translation'''
|-
|36
|oinbetekoa
|one of a full foot
|-
|45
|
|
|-
|54
|kanaerdikoa
|one of half a kana
|-
|60
|
|
|-

|oinbikoa
|one of two feet
|-
|80
|
|
|-
|108
|kanakoa
|one of one kana
|-
|110
|
|
|-
|}
The ''oinbetekoa'', 80 ''ontza'', ''kanakoa'' and bigger ones are often used in wagers; the ''kanaerdikoa'', 60 ''ontza'' and ''oinbikoa'' most commonly in bigger competitions and arranged in a row, each nailed to planks for stability.

The axes are between 2.4 and 2.8&amp;nbsp;kg heavy with a rounded blade and each ''aizkolari'' uses a number of them in a competition. The logs are between 0.5-0.8m long for competitions where one ''aizkolari'' stands on the log and between 0.8-1.2m long for competitions where two stand on it.

==Competitions==
The competitions are usually a race for the finish by however many individual competitors there are but occasionally they are done ''txandetan'', in relays, where two ''aizkolaris'' form a team and relieve the other once a trunk has been chopped through. The focus is more on stamina than speed compared to other wood-chopping events outside the Basque Country and most competitions last half an hour at the very least but normally more than an hour.

They can be held with each ''aizkolari'' having two helpers. The ''botilero'' (''botillero'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) holds the towel and brings new axes. The ''prestatzaile'' (''enseñador'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) checks the two halves are fully separated (they sometimes appear to have but are still connected), dictates the rhythm and indicates where best to hit next.

In a famous competition held in 1983 in [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], two ''aizkolaris'' called Jose Mari Mendizabal and Mikel Mindegi had a wager to chop six 110 ''ontza'' trunks and 52 ''kanaerdikoa'' (a total of 100 ''kanaerdi'') each in less than 5 hours. Mendizabal won the competition and 2 million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] taking just 4:12hrs, Mindegi 4:29hrs. But the most famous ''aizkolari'' was probably a man nicknamed ''Santa Ageda'' who competed in an epic event in the bullring of [[Azpeitia]] in 1903.

Many ''aizkolariak'' compete into high age. In 1900, Augustin Unanue who was aged 75 at the time, famously chopped a log of 1m diameter in 4 hours. Famous competitions often lead to the composition of ''[[bertso]]s'' in honour of the event.

The most important modern day competition is probably the ''Urrezko Aizkora'', the "golden axe" competition where the best ''aizkolaris'' from all over the Basque Country compete against each other individually or in pairs. There are several categories, including two junior competitions for people under the age of 23 and 18. The competitions are held in different places in the Basque Country over a period of two months to establish a winner. Held since 1997, it has been held annually since. Other important competitions are the ''Donostiako Urrezko Kopako'' ("gold cup of San Sebastián"), the ''Euskal Herriko Lehen Maila'' ("premier league of the Basque Country") and the provincial competitions.

==Variations==
Normally the ''aizkolaris'' stand on the trunk sections but there are variations where they are required to chop a vertical tree from the top called ''zutiko enborra'' or "upright trunk". This is achieved by chopping notches into the trunk into which the ''aizkolari'' inserts a plank. He then stands on the plank to reach higher up, working his way around the trunk in a spiral until he can chop the top section. The trunks are up to 6m tall and usually no safety equipment is used up to that height.

There is another variation combining the chopping competition with a race.

==Women and ''aizkolaritza''==
Traditionally a male dominated sport, women have begun to take part in ''aizkolari'' competitions in recent years as they have in other traditional Basque sports, for example Itziar Goenaga, Kristina Saralegi and Lucia Unceta

==History==
Wood-chopping as a profession has a long tradition in the Basque Country and has been recorded since medieval times when the profession was important to the local shipbuilding and charcoal burning industry which later also fed the metal-working industry. This work was carried out by small, itinerant groups of men living in the woods, the youngest and strongest usually felling the trees and the older preparing the felled trees and building the ''txondorra'', the mound for burning charcoal. In these communities, competitions were common to establish who the strongest and fastest ''aizkolariak'' were.

The use of large quantities of charcoal as fuel for the many foundries in the Basque Country in the 18th century together with the use of wood for [[shipbuilding]] led to large areas of woodland being cut down. In time, those country towns and valleys that were famed for their top wood-cutters turned out to be those that have safeguarded the wealth of their forests.

As popular competitions they were not recorded until the 19th century. The names of the competitors were not recorded but referred to by their place of origin or group, for example "one of [[Beizama]]", "the son of the house of Gorrizu", "the group from [[Nuarbe]]" or "the one from Beunza farm". To outsiders, the early competitions were known as ''fiestas Euskaras'' "Basque fiestas".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5820">'''Alan Berkman''' (September 4, 1945 &amp;ndash; June 5, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and activist in the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] and [[Weather Underground]] who went to prison for his involvement in a number of robberies staged by the organizations and their offshoots. Released after eight years in prison for armed robbery and explosives possession, Berkman provided medical care to the homeless and founded '''Health GAP''' to help provide AIDS pharmaceuticals to some of the world's poorest nations.

==Biography==
Berkman was born in [[Brooklyn]] and moved with his family to [[Middletown, Orange County, New York]]. He was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] who graduated as the [[salutatorian]] of his high school class. He earned his undergraduate degree at [[Cornell University]], graduating as an honor student in 1967. Berkman received his medical training at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], which he completed in 1971.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/nyregion/15berkman.html "Alan Berkman, 63, Activist Doctor, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 14, 2009. Accessed June 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

His politics and practice of medicine often overlapped, including his treatment of prisoners after the September 1971 [[Attica riots]]. He and his wife evaded the cordon established by the [[United States Marshals Service]] during the [[Wounded Knee incident]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=NYT1994&gt;Hoffman, Jan. [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/10/nyregion/healing-on-parole-doctor-and-ex-prisoner-he-treats-others-on-probation.html "Healing on Parole; Doctor and Ex-Prisoner, He Treats Others on Probation"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 1994. Accessed June 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brinks robbery and life on the run===
The [[Black Liberation Army]] and [[May 19th Communist Movement]] had organized the October 20, 1981, [[Brinks robbery (1981)|Brinks robbery]] in [[Nanuet, New York]], in which $1.6 million was taken from a [[The Brink's Company|Brink's]] armored car. In a shootout shortly after the heist, two police officers were killed. A witness told a [[grand jury]] that Berkman had treated one of the holdup group's members for a gunshot wound. Berkman refused to talk and spent almost a year in jail for [[civil contempt]].&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt; Indicted as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory after the fact]], Berkman jumped bail and went underground.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Berkman's lawyers claimed that he was the only U.S. doctor to be charged for treating a fugitive since Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]] was charged and later convicted for his medical treatment of [[John Wilkes Booth]] in 1865 after the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]].&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt;

On the run, Berkman was involved in the gunpoint robbery of a [[Connecticut]] supermarket that netted more than $20,000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Berkman and [[Elizabeth Ann Duke]] were arrested on May 23, 1985, near [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. Their car was found to have a pistol and shotgun, as well as the key to a storage site that held 100 pounds of dynamite.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} During his years on the run in the 1980s, court papers alleged, he was involved with groups that had staged seven bombings of military and other government facilities, though charges related to the bombings were later dismissed.&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt; He was charged as part of the [[Resistance Conspiracy]] and convicted for his participation in the supermarket robbery, the proceeds of which, prosecutors alleged, had been used to buy the dynamite. Berkman served eight years of a 10-year sentence.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

===Post-prison===
As a parolee after his release from prison, Berkman worked as a doctor at a [[South Bronx]] drug addiction clinic for other parolees.&lt;ref name=NYT1994/&gt; In 1995, he returned to [[Columbia University]] as a postdoctoral research fellow and worked at a clinic assisting homeless victims of AIDS with mental illness.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Upon his return to New York, after performing research in [[South Africa]] in the late 1990s, Berkman became one of the founders of Health GAP, an organization dedicated to expanding affordable access to AIDS medications such as [[antiretroviral drugs]] in the poorest parts of the world. Through such efforts as lobbying to allow foreign governments to impose [[compulsory license]]s to allow local manufacture of medications without the imposition of U.S. trade tariffs, costs for a regimen of AIDS medications that had cost $15,000 annually in the late 1990s had been cut to $150 per year by the time of his death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

===Personal life and death===
A resident of [[Manhattan]], Berkman died there, aged 63, from [[lymphoma]] on June 5, 2009. He was survived by his wife, Dr. Barbara Zeller, as well as two daughters and a grandson.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

'''Arabs in France''' are those parts of the [[Arab diaspora]] who have [[Immigration to France|immigrated to France]], as well as their descendants. Subgroups include [[Algerians in France]], [[Moroccans in France]], [[Lebanese people in France]] and [[Tunisians in France]]. This French subgroup of [[Arabs in Europe]] are concentrated in the [[North African communities of Paris]]. 

==Demographics==
French people of Arab origin (predominantly from [[Maghreb]] but also some from [[Mashreq]] areas of the [[Arab world]]) in France forms the second largest ethnic group after [[French people]] of French origin.

There are no official figures concerning the demographics of French people of Arab descent because ethnic statistics are forbidden in France.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/13377324 France's ethnic minorities: To count or not to count]. The Economist (2009-03-26). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most immigration was in the 1960s and the early 1970s, a period of economic growth, but many of them managed to bring their families after 1973. They have settled mainly in the industrial regions in France, especially the [[Île-de-France (region)|Paris region]], but also in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], [[Alsace]], [[Rhône-Alpes]] and [[Corsica]].

{{Armenians}}
Many [[Armenians|Armenian]] merchants from [[Amsterdam]] went to [[Southeast Asia]] in the 19th century to trade, and to set up factories and plantations. Armenian merchants settled in parts of [[Java]], then part of the [[Dutch East Indies]], as did Armenians moving east from the [[Persian Empire]], establishing a community of '''Armenians in Java'''.

In 1808, with a growing community, [[George Manook]] (Gevork Manuch Merchell) along with others, securing 25,000 Guilders from the Dutch Government, established schools and a church. In 1852 Haileian Miabanse Thioen in [[Jakarta|Batavia]], helped to open orphanages and schools for Armenian children. The community also built a small chapel in Batavia and founded a school in 1855.

In 1865, names like Galistan, Lazar, Joseph Amir, Manook, Arakiel Navaran, and Stefan Arathoon appeared in commercial almanacs. In the sugar industry, Manook Jordan owned the Mlongo factory, and P. Andreas owned the Trangkil factory. 

On 6 January 1880, the Armenian community was formally recognised as an incorporated society by the Dutch government. Within a short time Armenians extended also to [[Singapore]] where they were involved in the [[opium trade]], which was under British control, while some Armenian [[missionaries]] went on to [[the Philippines]].

==Notable Armenians==
[[George Manook]], was among the richest figures in Dutch East India, and often lent the Dutch government funds. He left behind a large fortune of five million guilders when he died.

The [[Sarkies Brothers]] were known for founding a chain of luxury [[hotels]] throughout Southeast Asia.

The '''Balti''' are an ethnic group of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] descent with [[Dard people|Dardic]] admixture who live in the [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] region of [[Pakistan]] and the [[Kargil district|Kargil]] region of [[India]]. Smaller populations are found in the [[Leh district|Leh]] region; others are scattered in Pakistan's major urban centres of [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]]/[[Rawalpindi]].

==Language==
The [[Balti language]] belongs to the [[Tibetic language]] family. Read (1934) considers it a dialect of [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]],&lt;ref&gt;''Balti Grammar'', by A. F. C. Read. London: The Royal Asiatic society, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; while Tournadre (2005) considers it a sister language of Ladakhi.&lt;ref&gt;*N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
The Baltis historically practiced [[Bön]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Islam arrived in Baltistan via [[Sufi]] missionaries such as Ameer Kabeer Syed Ali Hamadani in the 15th century, and soon became dominant. The Baltis still retain many traits of pre-Islamic [[Bön]] and [[Lamaist]] rituals, making them unique in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.baltistan.eus/news/articles/the-nurbakhshi-religion-in-baltistan | title=The Nurbakhshi religion in Baltistan | publisher=Baltistan Foundation | accessdate=7 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[swastika]] (Yung drung) sign is considered auspicious and is carved on wooden planks that can be seen in historical mosques and [[Khanqah]]s. Showing respect to Lha and Lhu (Bön gods) is customary during many village rituals.

Baltis regard congregation in the mosques and Khanqahs as an important religious ritual. The Khanqahs are training schools which were introduced by early saints who arrived in the region. The students gain spiritual purity ([[tazkiah]]) through these trainings (meditations and contemplations) under well-practiced spiritual guides, who have already attained certain degree of spirituality. 

Mosques in Baltistan are mainly built in the Tibetan style, though several mosques constructed have wood-finish and decorations of Mughal origin which can also be seen in Ladakh, [[Kargil district|Kargil]]. On every Friday, the men generally attend the Friday prayers sometime after noon. All Muslims will fast by day during the month of the Ramadan, and a celebration will be held at the end of the celebration.

Today, the Baltis are 60% [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]], 30% [[Noorbakshia Islam|Sufia Imamia Nurbakhshia]], and 10% [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1LEY1yWmagC|title=Kashmir: History and People|last=Bakshi|first=S. R.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=9788185431963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small pockets of Bön and Tibetan Buddhist believers in [[Kharmang District|Kharmang Valley]] and West Kargil amount to about 3000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladakhtimes.com/balticontemporary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031106/http://www.ladakhtimes.com/balticontemporary.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bara Balutedar system was a hereditary village servant system of twelve trades that was found in regions of what is now the Indian state of   [[Maharashtra]]. It was formally abolished by statute in 1958.
The Bara Balutedar included [[Sunar]] (goldsmith), [[Gurav]] (temple servants), Nhawi (barbers), Parit (washers), [[Kumbhar]] (potters), Sutar (carpenters), [[Lohar]] (blacksmiths), Chambhar (cobblers), [[Dhor]] (makers of ornaments for cattle), [[Koli people|Koli]] (water carriers), Chougula, and [[Mang (caste)|Mang]] and [[Mahar]] (Village watchman,messengers,sweepers and land arbitrators)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffrelot|first1=Christopher|title=Dr. Ambedkar and untouchability : fighting the Indian caste system|date=2005|publisher=Columbia Univ.

Under the baluta system, the balutedars had certain rights and privileges at ceremonies, etc.Their services were remunerated by the cultivators in the shape of an annual payment in sheaves of corn and a few seers of other grain grown in the field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffrelot|first1=Christopher|title=Dr. Ambedkar and untouchability : fighting the Indian caste system|date=2005|publisher=Columbia Univ.

, such as wheat, hulga, gram, Tur, groundnut, etc. For special services rendered on ceremonial occasions payments were made in cash, corn or clothes. Sometimes food was given. 

The barber, as a balutedar, does many duties not connected with his profession. At the time of a marriage ceremony, when the bridegroom goes to the temple to pray, he holds his horse and receives a turban as present. At village festivals or marriage ceremonies he sometimes acts as a cook. He also serves food and water to the guests on such ceremonies. It is his privilege to act as a messenger at marriage ceremonies and call the invitees for the function. He does massage to persons of distinction at the village. He plays on the pipe and tambour at weddings and on other festive occasions.

The water-carrier not only supplies water to the villages but also keeps watch during floods in the case of villages situated on river banks. He is also useful to the villagers to take them across the river with the help of a sangad (floats joined together).

The castes whose work was considered less important by the farmers were known as ''alutedar''.

{{Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The '''culture of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''' encompasses the country's ancient heritage, architecture, literature, visual arts, music, cinema, sports and cuisine.

==Ancient cultural heritage==
[[Image:Plocakulinabana.GIF|thumb|left|[[Kulin Ban]]'s plate found in Biskupići, near [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]].]]
The rock-carving by an artist found in [[Badanj Cave]] near the city of [[Stolac]] dates back to [[Paleolithic]] times (c. 1400 BC). It represents the death of a horse under a rain of arrows. It is the oldest Paleolithic finding in southeast Europe. There is also a rich legacy of [[Neolithic]] culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Particularly beautiful items have been found in [[Butmir]] near Sarajevo (5000 BC). During the [[Bronze Age]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina was occupied by [[Illyrian tribes]] such as the Japods in [[Bihać]] and the Daors in [[Daorson]], near Stolac. They were directly influenced by the [[Greeks]], as seen in Daorson especially. The Illyrians were conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who left roads, bridges, and beautiful villas with mosaics all over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The best preserved examples are at [[Mogorjelo]] near [[Čapljina]] and the [[mosaics]] at Stolac (dating from the 3rd century). The Christian [[basilica]] are found throughout the country ([[Zenica]], [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Mostar]], [[Široki Brijeg]] ... ), and their carved stone stonework influenced the first original medieval Bosnian art, found on tombstones – [[stećak]].

The [[Charter of Ban Kulin]] is the symbolic birth certificate of Bosnia's statehood, as it is the first written document that refers to Bosnia's borders (between the rivers of Drina, Sava and Una) and the elements of the Bosnian state - the ruler, throne and political organization. It is written in [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] and it also referred to the people of Bosnia - Bosnianins. The Charter was a trade agreement between [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and the Republic of [[Dubrovnik]].

The most important item in the [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina|National Museum in Sarajevo]] is the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]], a [[Jewish]] illuminated [[codex]] originally from 12th century Spain. Other important items include Hrvojev’s mass ([[Hrvojev misal]]) and Hval’s codex ([[Hvalov zbornik]]), both Bosnian books of liturgy produced in [[Croatia]] at the start of the 15th century, a 16th-century [[Quran|Kur’an]] and Leontiev’s New Testament ([[Leontijevo četverojevanđelje]]).

==Literature==
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literary heritage. [[Matija Divković]], Bosnian Franciscan and writer is considered to be the founder of the modern literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Notable poets include [[Antun Branko Šimić]], [[Aleksa Šantić]], [[Jovan Dučić]] and [[Mak Dizdar]].  Prominent prose writers include the Nobel Literature Prize laureate [[Ivo Andrić]], [[Meša Selimović]], [[Zaim Topčić]], [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinović]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], [[Branko Ćopić]], [[Miljenko Jergović]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Kočić]] and [[Nedžad Ibrišimović]]. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was famous playwright [[Branislav Nušić]].
Magazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'', ''[[Most (Most District)|Most]]'' and ''Sarajevske sveske'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

==Visual arts==
{{Main|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The visual arts in Bosnia and Herzegovina were always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones ([[stećak]]) to paintings in Kotromanić court. However, it was the [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in 1878 that led to the renaissance of Bosnian painting. The first artists trained in European academies emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. These included [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], Petar Tiješić, Karlo Mijić, Špiro Bocarić, [[Petar Šain]], Đoko Mazalić, Roman Petrović and Lazar Drljača. Their generation was succeeded by artists such as Ismet Mujezinović, Vojo Dimitrijević, Ivo Šeremet and Mica Todorović. Prominent artists in the post-World War II period include Virgilije Nevjestić, Bekir Misirlić, Ljubo Lah, Meho Sefić, Franjo Likar, [[Mersad Berber]], Ibrahim Ljubović, Dževad Hozo, Affan Ramić, Safet Zec, Ismar Mujezinović, and Mehmed Zaimović. The [[Ars Aevi]] museum of contemporary art in Sarajevo includes works by artists renowned worldwide.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Evstafiev-vedran-smailovic-sarajevo1992w.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Vedran Smailović]], the cellist of Sarajevo.]]
The most popular traditional Bosnian and Herzogovinian [[song]] forms of relatively recent origin (early 20th century) are the Bosnian root music (played with ''"[[šargija]]"''), ''[[Ganga (music)|ganga]]'', the ''rera'' and the ''ojkavica'' (''oja-noja'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muspe.unibo.it/period/ma/index/number6/caleta/jos_5.htm mp3 files with examples from Dalmatia (Croatia) in "Trends and Processes in the Music Culture of the Dalmatian Hinterland" by Josko Caleta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231011218/http://www.muspe.unibo.it/period/ma/index/number6/caleta/jos_5.htm |date=2008-12-31 }}, accessed 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular surviving forms from the Ottoman era is the ''[[sevdalinka]]''.

[[Pop music]] and [[rock music]] are traditionally popular too, represented by famous [[music]]ians including [[Goran Bregović]], Davorin Popović, Kemal Monteno, [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Johnny Štulić]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Dino Merlin]] and [[Tomo Miličević]]. Talented composers include Đorđe Novković, Esad Arnautalić, Kornelije Kovač, and the many pop and rock bands, e.g. [[Bijelo Dugme]], [[Indexi]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], include some of the leading groups from the era of the former [[Yugoslavia]].

Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], creator of the current [[national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], and the pianist [[Sasha Toperich]].

==Cinema==
{{Main|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}

==Sports==
===Olympics===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Olympics}}
The most important international sporting event in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the hosting of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]], held in [[Sarajevo]] from the 7th to 19 February 1984.

Some notable Bosnian [[Olympic Games|Olympians]] were:
* Rome, 1960: [[Tomislav Knez]] and [[Velimir Sombolac]] (football),
* Munich, 1972: [[Abaz Arslanagić]], [[Milorad Karalić]], [[Nebojša Popović]], Đorđe Lavrinić, and Dobrivoje Seleć (handball)

'''Sitting volleyball'''

[[Bosnia and Herzegovina national sitting volleyball team]] is the most decorated team representing Bosnia and Herzegovina. The team won 2 [[Paralympics]] Gold medals ([[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics|2004]] and [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Paralympics|2012]]) and [[Sitting volleyball#Championships|multiple]] World and European [[sitting volleyball]] titles. Many of the players lost limbs in the 1992-1995 [[Bosnian War]].

===Popular sports===
'''Athletics'''

Bosnia and Herzegovina has produced many prominent athletes, including members of the Yugoslav national team before Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The nation's most notable track and field athlete since independence is runner [[Amel Tuka]], who took the bronze medal in the [[2015 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 800 metres|800 metres at the 2015 World Athletics Championships]].

'''Football (soccer)'''
{{Main|Football in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in B&amp;H. It dates from 1903 but its popularity grew significantly after [[World War II]]. In the pre-independence era [[Sarajevo]] (1967 and 1984) and [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|Željezničar]] (1972) both won the Yugoslavian Championship title. The former [[Yugoslav national football team]] included a number of Bosnian players, such as [[Josip Katalinski]], [[Dušan Bajević]], [[Miroslav Blažević]], [[Ivica Osim]], [[Safet Sušić]], and [[Mirsad Fazlagić]].

Since independence the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team]] has failed to qualify for any European or World Championship tournament, up until [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], after winning eight games to secure their place after many years of failed attempts of making their FIFA debut. Bosnian national teams have struggled to field the best eligible team as many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries for reasons of ethnic identification and because of the higher salaries offered by other teams (for example: [[Mario Stanić]] and [[Mile Mitić]] were both born in Bosnia but play for Croatia and Serbia respectively; other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina who have made similar choices include [[Zoran Savić]], [[Vladimir Radmanović]], [[Zoran Planinić]], [[Aleksandar Nikolić]] and [[Savo Milošević]]).

'''Basketball'''

Bosnian [[basketball]] club, [[KK Bosna]] from Sarajevo were European Champions in 1979. The [[Yugoslav national basketball team]], medal-winners in every world championship from 1963 through 1990, included Bosnian players such as [[Dražen Dalipagić]] and [[Mirza Delibašić]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the [[Eurobasket]] championship. The Jedinstvo [[Women's basketball]] club, based in Tuzla, won the 1979 European Championships in Florence.

'''Boxing'''

The middle-weight [[boxing|boxer]] [[Marjan Beneš]] has won several B&amp;H Championships, Yugoslavian Championships and the European Championship. In 1978, he won the World Title against Elish Obeda from Bahamas. Another middle-weight, [[Ante Josipović]], won the Olympic gold medal in Los Angeles in 1984. He also won the Yugoslavian Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983 and the Beograd Trophy in 1985. [[Felix Sturm]] aka Adnan Catic is a German former middleweightchampion boxer with Bosnian origin.  He has a Bosnian flag in his weardrobe and often holdes tales in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] after a boxing match.

'''Chess'''

The Bosnian [[chess]] team has been Champion of Yugoslavia seven times, in addition to winning four European championships: 1994 in Lyon, 1999 in Bugojno, 2000 in Neum, and 2001 in Kalitea. The [[Borki Predojević]] chess club (from Teslić) has also won two European Club Championships, at Litohoreu (Greece) in 1999, and Kalitei (Greece) in 2001.

'''Handball'''

The [[RK Borac Banja Luka|Borac]] [[team handball|handball]] club, seven times Yugoslav National Championship winners, won the European Championship Cup in 1976 and the International Handball Federation Cup in 1991.

'''Karate'''

The Tuzla-Sinalco [[karate]] club from Tuzla was the most prolific Yugoslav championship-winning team, also winning four European Championships and one World Championship.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}
[[File:Cevapcici_in_somun.jpg|thumb|Bosnian [[ćevapi]] with onions in a ''[[somun]]''.]]

Bosnian cuisine reflects a balance of [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. Due to almost 500 years of Ottoman rule, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, years of [[Austria]]n rule can be detected in the many influences from [[Central Europe]]. Bosnian cuisine uses many [[spices]], but usually in very small quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are completely natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[Zucchini|courgettes]], dried beans, fresh beans, [[plum]]s, [[milk]], and cream called ''[[pavlaka]]''. Typical meat dishes include primarily [[chicken]], [[beef]] and [[mutton]]. Some local specialties are [[ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilaf]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and an extensive range of Eastern sweets. The best local [[wine]] comes from the southern region of the country, [[Herzegovina]], where the climate is particularly suitable for growing [[grapes]]. Plum or apple [[rakia]] is distilled in the northern region of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]].

A '''Dadchelor Party''', otherwise referred to as a '''Man Shower''' or a '''baby stag''', is a party that is similar to a [[baby shower]], but instead of being thrown for the mother-to-be, it is thrown for the father-to-be.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bindley|first1=Katherine|title='Dadchelor Parties' Celebrate First Time Father|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/dadelor-parties-celebrate-first-time-fathers_n_875968.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a celebratory event held for a man shortly before he enters [[fatherhood]] to celebrate his "last days before fatherhood" or merely to spend time with his male friends. The baby stag is usually planned by a friend or a group of friends of the future father and is modeled after that of a [[bachelor party]]. Typically the event is held before or early in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is considered to be one of the new emerging trends for fathers in the 21st century.

==History==
&lt;!-- from baby stag 
As per North American tradition, women will hold a [[baby shower]] for female friends of the mother which entails a gathering to celebrate the future birth of their child. The baby stag was created for the father as soon-to-be fathers have historically been excluded from holding specific events to celebrate their future parenthood.
--&gt;
The idea of a Dadchelor Party has been around for years, but the recent trend emerged more prominently in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/dadelor-parties-celebrate-first-time-fathers_n_875968.html|title=Bachelor Party? Nope, Dadchelor Party|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years before this trend emerged, [[Baby shower|Baby Showers]] were often centered around the [[Mother|mothers-to-be]], leaving the father left out and forgotten altogether. It is common for the party to be revolved around the mother because their bodies are the ones that have another human being growing inside of them. They go through extensive [[mood swing]]s and grow out of their clothes, which can be quite frustrating, so a simple celebration makes them feel as though the journey was worth it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babble.com/pregnancy/10-dadchelor-party-ideas-for-baby-daddy/|title=10 "Dadchelor Party" Ideas for Baby Daddy|last=Mass|first=Aela|date=|website=Babble|publisher=Babble|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baby showers often follow around the idea of an extravagant party. Typically the event is held before or early in the third trimester of pregnancy. The [[Infant|baby's sex]] is often revealed or there are games, such as diapers filled with different melted candies. It highlights the transition into parenthood, especially for mothers. It allows them to feel as though this process of birth and parenting will be manageable. They also receive many gifts that they can "ooh and ahh" over for a majority of the party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description==
The Dadchelor Party is a way to celebrate a first time father and to give them some recognition as they enter parenthood. There are many things that they will lose as fatherhood moves up to their first priority. Instead of nights out with their friends, their days will consist of late nights and early mornings.These parties allow the father-to-be to let loose one last time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men do this in order to celebrate one last time before their lives are filled with diapers and other baby-related activities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebump.com/a/man-showers|title=Man Showers|last=|first=|date=|website=The Bump|publisher=The Bump|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These parties consist of masculine activities to celebrate a gift that isn't always considered to be quite masculine, his new promotion into fatherhood.  These parties can also be viewed as the "one last pre-fatherhood bash."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeofdad.com/dadchelorparty.php|title=Dad-chelor Party!|last=|first=|date=|website=Life of Dad - The Social Network for Dads|publisher=Life of Dad|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dadchelor Parties can be an extensive celebration or a simple party. Sometimes fathers-to-be choose to take a trip to a location in which there will be multiple activities for them to partake in while others make a simple fishing trip or go to celebrate at the local golf course.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Misconceptions==
Often, people assume these parties are to celebrate a man's life "before it is over" but this is far from the truth. Dadchelor Parties are a celebration of new babies and the father-to-be. They create memories for the father-to-be that he will remember forever and allows him to have a get together with his friends in honor of this monumental life moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manshower.net/how-we-were-born.html|title=How We Were Born|last=|first=|date=|website=Man Shower|publisher=Man Shower|access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifts==
The exchange of gifts at a Dadchelor Party is optional, but is encouraged. It adds an awkward moment into the party, in which the Dadchelor's friend make the dad-to-be open his gifts while "oohing" and "aahing" like one would do at a normal baby shower-style party. Gifts can range from gift cards to fast food places to Sports stores.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other men bring gifts that will contribute to their night of male bonding or even pay for the dad-to-be and his travel expenses. Gifts also are exchanged for alcoholic beverages, for example, "Chuggies for Huggies," where the guests bring [[diaper]]s in exchange for beers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Adouma''' (or '''Duma''') are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Gabon]], in western Africa. They primarily live on the south bank of the upper [[Ogooué River]], in the vicinity of [[Lastoursville]] (originally an Adouma village), and are known as expert [[canoe]]ists or the boatmen.

Their traditions hold that they arrived from the east or southeast, coming down the [[Sebe River]] to the Ogowe, and thence to the [[Doumé rapids]]. They made canoes of [[Okoumé]], and sold [[slavery|slave]]s to the [[Okandé]], receiving European products such as guns and cloth in exchange. The [[Société du Haut-Ogooué]] (SHO) established a post at Lastoursville and engaged the Adouma in trade for [[rubber]], [[ivory trade|ivory]], and [[ebony]].

During the 1970s and 1980s, many Adouma moved down the Ogowe, towards [[Port-Gentil]].

'''El with middle hook''' (Ԡ&amp;nbsp;ԡ; italics: &lt;span style="font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif"&gt;''Ԡ&amp;nbsp;ԡ''&lt;/span&gt;) is a letter of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Its form is derived from the [[El (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter El]] (Л&amp;nbsp;л) by adding a hook to the middle of the right leg.

El with middle hook was only used in the [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]]{{citation needed |date=May 2011}} and [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] languages.

The '''Fur''' ([[Fur language|Fur]]: ''fòòrà'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: فور ''Fūr'') are an ethnic group inhabiting western [[Sudan]]. They are concentrated in the [[Darfur]] region, where they are the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref name=jg9307&gt;Gettleman, Jeffrey, "Chaos in Darfur on rise as Arabs fight with Arabs", news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 3, 2007, pp 1, A7&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Fur language]], which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan family]].

==Overview==
[[File:Fur map.png|The Fur's traditional territory|thumb]]
[[File:Bandera Darfur.svg|right|thumb|Flag of the Fur national movement]]
The Fur are the largest ethnic group in the Darfur region of western [[Sudan]]. They are also sometimes referred to by the names Fora, Fordunga, Furawi, Konjara, or Kungara. They are an active [[Agrarian society|agricultural people]] and may also herd cattle. Some Fur families who have accumulated a substantial cattle herd developed a more [[Nomad|nomadic lifestyle]] like that of their herding neighbors, the [[Baggara|Baqqara (Baggara) Arabs]]. Culturally, those cattle-herding Fur are now considered to be Baqqara. The Fur are nominally [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] following the [[Maliki|Maliki school of Islamic law]].

They are a Western Sudanese people who practice [[sedentism|sedentary]] herding and agriculture, mainly the cultivation of [[millet]]. Their society is a traditional one governed by village elders. They speak [[Fur language|Fur]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]], and are [[Muslim]]s, having adopted the religion following the region's conquest by the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. Some of them have come to speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in recent years.

The name of Darfur comes from the name of this ethnic group and means "the home of the Fur". Most of the well known governors of Darfur such as [[Deriage]] and [[Tegani Seisei]] are members of the Fur. The Fur established the historical [[Sultanate of Darfur]] which governed Darfur until 1916 (see [[History of Darfur]]).
 
[[Abdul Wahid al Nur]], a leader among the Fur,&lt;ref name="WhoAre"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7039360.stm |author=BBC staff |date=February 24, 2009 |title=Who are Sudan's Darfur rebels? |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]] and Army. Another leader of the Fur, {{As of| 2007|lc=on}}, is Ahmed Abdelshafi (Toba).&lt;ref name=jg9307/&gt;

The traditional heartland of the Fur is the mountainous region around [[Jebel Sî]] and [[Jebel Marra]] Wadi Salih and Zaligi; today, however, most of them live in the lower country west and southwest of that area, between 11–14 N and 23–26 E. Some Fur live across the border in [[Chad]], many of them [[refugees]].

The Furs' lifestyle has led to conflict with the nomadic [[Baggara]], cattle-herders of the region, concerning access to water and grazing land, particularly in Darfur's central [[Jebel Marra]] mountains where the best agricultural land is to be found. This has been the source of ethnic tensions for many years, culminating in the [[Darfur conflict]] which began in 2003.

Many Fur villagers were massacred in the [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic fighting]] as [[Mahria]] and [[Terjem]] tribes divided up land they conquered from the Fur, according to a September 3, 2007 ''[[New York Times]]'' account citing United Nations officials and Fur survivors.&lt;ref name=jg9307/&gt;

The Fur are well known for their [[Muslim|Muslim piety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sudan/story/0,14658,1268773,00.html |last=de Waal |first=Alex |title=Darfur's deep grievances defy all hopes for an easy solution (opinion article) |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=July 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{see also|Fur language}}
The Fur speak the [[Fur language]], which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family. They also speak Arabic as a lingua franca.

There is no written or symbolic script for the Fur language. They recently have been using Arabic or Latin characters to put the language in written form. Most Fur people speak Fur fluently as their mother tongue.

Common greetings include:

*''Avilakoa'': Good Morning
*''Avilakonu'': Good Evening

Heavy drums are often used while making speeches and other public addresses.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed, Omer Ali. Personal interview. September 28, 2009.{{full|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=A personal interview doesn't qualify as a verifiable reference unless it has been published.|date=April 2013}}

==Art==

===Dance===
Fur dance style is unique to the region. Some of the main Fur dances are Nogara, Firalubia and Dukkei, and Hajoee (mainly in north Darfur) which are performed on special occasions such as weddings, the birth of a child and other important events.

===Handmade art===
The Fur people make their own handmade art and utensils. These include ''talak'', which is used for cleaning pots (''talak'' looks like a sponge); ''birish'', which is a carpet for sitting; and ''gada'', which is a wood plate or bowl used for important occasions.

===Music, stories and entertainment===
Among the Fur people, stories are told to keep children safe from the outside world. These stories are designed to keep children close to home. In some stories children are told that if they go out in the morning they will die from the heat of the sun, and in the night they are told if they go out an animal called ''nyama'' will eat them.

Fur music is very popular in their culture. The main instruments are drums. The music is played with a heavy drumbeat that accompanies their celebrations. Some popular Fur musicians are; Abdalla Kioka and Marium Amo.

===Architecture===
There is one common type of architecture in homes and buildings, which is called guttiya. Guttiya is a mud house; this is no longer practical because it could catch fire very easily. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Attire and body art===
Clothes among the Fur people are similar to what is worn in Sudan. They wear casual Sudanese clothes like a [[Thawb|jalabiya]]. The jalabiya is a white garment that covers the wearer from head to toe. A long time ago, when the Fur tribe was [[Arabised]], Fur women used to poke their lower lip many times until the lip starts to swell. These dents were considered a sign of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed, Omer Ali. Personal interview. October 4, 2009.{{full|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure==

In the [[social structure]] of the Fur people, they do not have so much regard for their wealth. A poor leader and a rich leader can become a chief. The experience of a man is based primarily on his knowledge of the [[Quran]]. A man cannot even get married if he does not know a couple pages of this text.

The Quran is studied with the help of a hand-held board shaped object known as the lohh and a wooden stylus called a kalam. The Fur tribesman’s knowledge of the Quran determines their position on the tribe’s hierarchy ladder. For example, a tribesman must know almost the whole book to attain position as chieftain.

The Fur people also have their own crafts for entertainment. These include dance-games like “ALLE”(all-eh) and toys like Burajei. Burajei is a small doll-like toy made from a [[Camel|camel’s back]]. It is bound by rope and sewn by thorns.

==Social behavior==

When greeting each other, a woman and a man have different forms of respect. The woman must kneel down before the man and the man must slow his pace. Different sexes can also dance together but are forbidden to touch or live with each other unless they are family.

Men and women usually get married in their late teens to their early twenties. The groom and wife will meet each other and get to know about them, their accomplishments and other important attributes. If everything goes well they will proceed to wed.

===Roles of men and women===

The men bear the family name. They work to bring money to the family and are responsible for all important decisions related to the family, such as finances and marriages. The women get water, prepare the food and ensure the cleanliness of the home.

Daughters normally help their mothers, milk the cows and stay at home. Sons rear and herd cattle along with the domesticated cows. If either of these two misbehave they are similarly punished by their elders. Also, it is disrespectful look an adult in the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Hamed, Omer Ali. Personal interview. October 8, 2009.{{full|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eating===

Sudan is well known for its Guhwah [[coffee]] served from a ''jebena'', a special Sudanese pot. The coffee beans are roasted in this pot over charcoal, then ground with [[cloves]] and other spices. The grounds are [[steeping|steeped]] in hot water and the coffee is served in tiny cups after straining it through a [[grass]] [[sieve]].

[[Tea]] or ''chai'' is also very popular and served in small glasses without milk. Some beverages enjoyed in the non-Islamic areas are Aragi, a clear strong spirit made from dates, merissa, a type of beer and tedj, or wines, made from dates or honey. 
Sudanese cuisine is as varied as its cultures, especially in the south, but it has certain unique characteristics. Millet porridge and fool medamas, a savory dish of mashed fava beans, are popular breakfast foods in the north. Lamb and chicken are often eaten, but pork is prohibited to Muslims. 

Wheat and dura sorghum are the staple starches. Breads include the Arabian khubz, and kisra, an omelette-like pancake which is part of the Sudanese dinner. Maschi, a beef and tomato dish, is also typical. Fruits are peeled for dessert and a favourite treat is creme caramel.

In the south, dinner is served on a low, bare table. There may be five or six dishes to dip into with large pieces of flatbread. These dishes are accompanied by a salad and shata, a red-hot spice mixture served in small dishes. After the meal, dessert is served, then tea. On special occasions incense may be lit. The ritual of hospitality is important in Sudan.

==Economic base==

Families among the Fur people have many types of families. Porundia, or nuclear families, are a very common type. They normally have 2 or more children. In a typical Fur family the parents of the groom and wife will be taken care of until they die.

In a Fur marriage, the groom's father goes to the bride's father and asks for his son's permission to marry. The bride's father does not give an answer immediately, but then asks the village for its opinion. If everyone approves, the bride's father accepts. The whole village gathers for the announcement of the marriage, and preparations are made. Then the marriage starts in the groom's house. The [[imam]] recites words from the [[Quran]]. The groom and bride hold hands during this time. After the wedding, the family and guests have lunch, then they start a lively dance called firalubia. Then the bride and groom are taken to the bride's house and given food during which everyone says congratulations (''mabrouk'' in Arabic).

==Institutions==

Islam is the major religion among the Fur people, although some still practice their own religion. The schools called (Kalwa) in this region teach the [[Quran]]. Classes begin at 6–7 years and they continue learning the Quran (though not entirely in school) for the rest of their lives. Normal schooling is also practiced in these schools.

The main occupation here is farming. The Fur people are excellent farmers. They grow and harvest wheat, herbs, spices, etc. Wealth is not really important for the Fur people. Only his knowledge of the Quran determines his altitude.

==History==

The Fur people came from southern Africa to the northwest of Sudan, where they settled in Darfur. They had 36 sultanates. The Fur were also one of the first people from other ethnic groups in the country who were picked to build the wall covering and mosque surrounding the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamed, Omer Ali. Personal interview. October 15, 2009.{{full|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political situation===

Until 1916, the Fur were ruled by an independent sultanate and were oriented politically to peoples in Chad. Though the ruling dynasty before that time, as well as the common people, had long been Muslims they have not been [[Arabization|arabized]]. They are now incorporated into the Sudan political system. 
The Fur had been basically independent from the 17th century. After British reconquest in 1899, the British approved the re-establishment of the Fur Sultanate, assumed by Ali Dinar when the Mahdist movement crumbled.

[[Mahdi]]st revolts continued to break out in Sudan until 1916. The fall of Darfur was decided when Ali Dinar declared loyalty to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]]. The British abolished the [[Fur Sultanate]] in 1916 after Dinar died in battle. 

In World War I Darfur made a bid for independence by allying with [[Turkey]] against the British. The British conquered Darfur in 1916, and since then it has been part of Sudan. Since the 1970s, the Darfur area has suffered some of the effects of the northern Arab war prosecuted in the south against Southern ethnic groups who wanted to secede from the Sudan.

War has been the primary factor in the last few decades of the Darfur area. A civil war lasted about 20 years until the end of the 20th Century. A new conflict arose in 2003, involving local Arab [[militia]] called [[Janjaweed]] attacking the African peoples village by village in a campaign of terror, reportedly supported by the Sudanese military.

==Genetics==
Analysis of classic genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms by Tay and Saha (1988) found that the Fur are most closely related to the Hawazma of Sudan. Both populations have gene frequencies intermediate between those of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking [[Beja people|Beja]], [[Ja'alin tribe|Gaalin]] and [[Arabian peninsula|Gulf Arab]] populations and those of the local [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] and [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John S. H. Tay|author2=N. Saha|title=Genetic Heterogeneity Among the Negroid and Arab Tribes of the Sudan|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=1988|volume=76|pages=211–215|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.1330760209/abstract|accessdate=25 September 2016|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330760209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hassan et al. (2008), around 59.4% of Fur are carriers of the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] paternal haplogroup. Of these, 68.4% bear the V32 subclade. Approximately 6.3% also belong to the haplogroup [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|J1]]. This points to significant patrilineal gene flow from neighbouring [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking populations. The remaining Fur individuals are primarily carriers of the [[Haplogroup A-L1085|A3b2]] lineage (31.3%), which is instead common among [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hassan, Hisham Y.|display-authors=etal|title=Y‐chromosome variation among Sudanese: Restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=November 2008|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316-323|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876|url=http://ychrom.invint.net/upload/iblock/94d/Hassan%202008%20Y-Chromosome%20Variation%20Among%20Sudanese.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2016|pmid=18618658|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923031520/http://ychrom.invint.net/upload/iblock/94d/Hassan%202008%20Y-Chromosome%20Variation%20Among%20Sudanese.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternally, the Fur entirely belong to African-based derivatives of the [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macrohaplogroup L]] according to Hassan (2010). Of these mtDNA clades, the [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0a1]] (15.3%) and [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1c]] (11.5%) lineages are most frequent. This altogether suggests that the genetic introgression into the Fur's ancestral population was asymmetrical, occurring primarily through Afro-Asiatic-speaking males rather than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohamed|first1=Hisham Yousif Hassan|title=Genetic Patterns of Y-chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Variation, with Implications to the Peopling of the Sudan|url=http://khartoumspace.uofk.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/6376/Genetic%20Patterns%20of%20Y-chromosome%20and%20Mitochondrial.pdf?sequence=1|publisher=University of Khartoum|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabonese people in France''' consist of migrants from [[Gabon]] and their descendants living and working in France.

==History==
The first [[Gabon]]ese immigrants in [[France]] came in the 1970s, like the other immigrants from Central Africa, some years after the first immigrant wave from [[Black Africa]] (Senegal Valley) in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/067041.pdf |format=PDF |title=L‘immigration africaine en France : regards des autres et repli sur soi |website=Politique-africaine.com |accessdate=2016-02-08}} &lt;/ref&gt; There are more immigrants in France from countries which neighbor Gabon ([[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Cameroon]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">The Ghoryakhel ({{lang-ps|غورياخېل}}) is  [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] supertribe son of Kand son of [[Kharshbun]] son of [[Sarbans|Sarban]], son of [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], who lived in Ghwara Marghay [[Arghistan]] [[Qandahar]] but mostly settled  in [[Ghazni]] on the basin of Tarnak River and [[Nangarhar]], [[Logar Province|Logar]], [[Kabul]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Kunduz]] of Afghanistan and also in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] and [[Peshawar]] [[Pakistan]] between the 15th and 16th century. The largest tribe belonging to the Ghoryakhel confederacy is [[Mohmand]] while other tribes belonging to the confederacy include [[Daudzai]], [[Mulagori]], [[Khalil (Pashtun tribe)|Khalil]], [[Shilmani]], Zeerani, Daulatyar tribe, [[Chamkani tribe]], Halimzai, Zakhil or Zakhilwal, Tarakzai, Khawezai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/tribes/web/ppl/d/f/be310391e7a64ad3232b9aff7fd.shtml Ibrahim Sheikh Ghauri شېخ ابراهيم غوري.] Khyber.ORG.&lt;/ref&gt;
The legendary [[Pashto language|Pashto]] Poet [[Rahman Baba]] also belonged to Mohmand subtribe of the Ghoryakhel.

According to Pata Khazana Pashtun History Book written by Abdulhai Habibi that [[Kharshbun]] and Sharkhbun are brothers. [[Kharshbun]] had three sons
Kand, Zamand, Kasi and Sharkhbun had six sons Urmar, Babar, Baraich, Miana, Tareen, Sheerani. Kand had two sons Ghoryakhel and Khakhykhel,  Zamand  had five sons Muhammadzai and Kheshgi are more popular and Kasi had eleven sons Shinwari and Zhamaryani are more popular. 

Ghoryakhel had four sons Daulatyar tribe, Zeerani, Khalil, Chamkani. Many historian mention in different Pashto and Dari books that Zeerani Pashtun tribe settled in [[Nangarhar Province]], [[Laghman Province]], [[Badakhshan Province]]  Afghanistan and majority people speak [[Dari language]] and [[Pashto]] because of close relation and cross marriages with [[Tajiks]]. Daulatyar had two sons [[Mohmand]], [[Daudzai]], and [[Mulagori]], [[Shilmani]], [[Halimzai]], Zakhil or [[Zakhilwal]], Tarakzai, Khawezai. tribes are sub-section of Mohmand. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''''Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death''''' is a [[comedy]] album by [[The Firesign Theatre]] that was released in 1998 on [[Rhino Records]]. Its main theme satirizes 1990s [[radio format]]s and public hysteria over the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K programming bug]]. ''Give Me Immortality...'' is the first of the Firesign Theatre's Millenium CD trilogy ''We're Doomed'', which includes ''[[Boom Dot Bust]]'' and ''[[Bride of Firesign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death|url=http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=gmiogmd-rv|website=Firesign Media|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The album takes the form of a fictional [[radio]] broadcast on the night of December 31, 1999.&lt;ref name= "review"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sirois |first=A. L. |url= https://www.sfsite.com/12b/give47.htm |title=Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death |work=[[SF Site]] |date=September 12, 1998 |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Now is a radio station in FunFunTown (apparently modeled after [[Los Angeles, California]]) whose [[radio format|format]] changes approximately every hour at the slightest whims of overzealous market researchers and [[focus groups]]. The album chronicles Radio Now's attempt to operate normally on the final day before the year 2000, a day riddled with [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] omens, rampant computer errors, and dangerous doomsayers. The station is populated by DJ Bebop Lobo ([[Phil Austin]]), his producer Dwayne ([[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]]), news anchors Harold Hiphugger ([[David Ossman]]) and Ray Hamberger ([[Philip Proctor]]), sports commentator Chump Threads (Bergman), and [[self-help]] guru O'Nann Winquedinque (Austin).&lt;ref name= "austinobit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Sam |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/arts/phil-austin-who-played-nick-danger-on-firesign-theater-dies-at-74.html |title=Phil Austin (a.k.a. Nick Danger) of Firesign Theater Dies at 74 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 25, 2015 |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also reporting from outside the station are [[celebrity]] [[Stalking|stalker]] Danny Vanilla (Ossman) and helicopter-bound traffic reporter Col. Happy Panditt (Proctor).

==Themes==
The album, made in 1998, lampoons the various world-threatening results which were being predicted from the [[Y2K bug]]. It also [[satire|satirizes]] the media exploitation of the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], the [[Joe Camel]] controversy, and the [[Art Bell]] radio show. 

A running gag involves eyeballs, which at one moment represent [[Binary numeral system|binary]] digits (the digit 1 resembles the letter I, a [[homophone]] of "eye", while the digit 0 is in the shape of a ''ball'') and at other times seem to be an allusion to [[The Residents]] ("Guyz in Eyeball Hats"). Another is "U.S. Plus", an apparent multi-national conglomerate with intentionally vague commercials that hint at their all-encompassing presence ("We're U.S. Plus. We own the ''idea''...of America!"). The urbane, sophisticated Goddess Airways commercials promise "no bloody babies" on their flights.

The '''Great Andamanese languages''' are a near-extinct [[language family]] once spoken by the [[Great Andamanese people]]s of the [[Andaman Islands]] (India), in the [[Indian Ocean]].  The last fluent speaker, of what may have been a creole based on Aka-Jeru, died in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|gac|Mixed Great Andamanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still speakers of a koine-form of Great Andamanese known as "Aka-Jero".

== History ==
By the late 18th century, when the British first settled on the Andaman islands, there were an estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living on [[Great Andaman]] and surrounding islands, comprising 10 distinct tribes with distinct but closely related languages. From the 1860s onwards, the setting up of a permanent [[British Empire|British]] [[penal colony]] and the subsequent arrival of immigrant settlers and indentured labourers, mainly from the [[Indian subcontinent]] greatly reduced their numbers, to a low of 19 individuals in 1961.&lt;ref name="asi1990"&gt;{{Citation | title=The Jarawa | author=Jayanta Sarkar | publisher=Anthropological Survey of India | date=1990 | isbn=81-7046-080-8 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=HxBuAAAAMAAJ | quote=''... The Great Andamanese population was large till 1858 when it started declining ... In 1901, their number was reduced to only 600 and in 1961 to a mere 19 ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then their numbers have rebounded somewhat, reaching 52 by 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph2/&gt;  However, by 1994 seven of the ten tribes were already extinct,&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Sharma (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WEztW7c0CqQC&amp;pg=PA75 Tribal Development in the Andaman Islands]'', page 75. Sarup &amp; Sons, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; and divisions among the surviving tribes ([[Jeru people|Jeru]], [[Bo people (Andaman)|Bo]] and [[Cari people|Cari]]) had effectively ceased to exist&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown, A. R. (1922). ''The Andaman Islanders: A study in social anthropology.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; due to intermarriage and resettlement to a much smaller territory on [[Strait Island]]. Some of them also intermarried with [[Karen people|Karen (Burmese)]] and [[Demographics of India|Indian]] settlers.  [[Hindi language|Hindi]] increasingly serves as their primary language, and is the only language for around half of them.&lt;ref name="lansuv"&gt;[http://infochangeindia.org/Media/Languages-of-India/The-case-for-a-linguistic-survey.html Anosh Malekar, "The case for a linguisitic survey," ''Infochange Media,'' August 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbi, Anvita, Bidisha Som and Alok Das. 2007. "Where Have All The Speakers Gone? A Sociolinguistic Study of the Great Andamanese." Indian Linguistics, 68.3-4: 325-343.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boa Sr.|last known speaker]] of the [[Aka-Bo language|Bo language]] died in 2010 at age 85.&lt;ref name=telegraph2&gt;(2011) ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7207731/Lives-Remembered.html Lives Remembered.  [[The Daily Telegraph]], London, 10 February 2010. Accessed on 2010-02-22. Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20100213125406/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/7207731/Lives-Remembered.html on web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the population now speak what may be considered a new language (a kind of mixed or koine language) of the Great Andamanese family, based mainly on [[Jeru language|Aka-Jeru]].&lt;ref name=abbi&gt;Abbi, Anvita (2008). "Is Great Andamanese genealogically and typologically distinct from Onge and Jarawa?" ''Language Sciences'', {{doi|10.1016/j.langsci.2008.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modified version has been called "Present Great Andamanese" by some scholars,&lt;ref name=Abbi06&gt;Abbi, Anvita (2006). ''Endangered Languages of the Andaman Islands.'' Germany: Lincom GmbH.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burenh&gt;[http://cts.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/LWPL/article/view/2475/2050 Burenhult, Niclas (1996). "Deep linguistic prehistory with particular reference to Andamanese." ''Working Papers'' 45, 5-24. Lund University: Department of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; but also may be referred to simply as "Jero" or "[[Great Andamanese creole|Great Andamanese]]".

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name="Abbi06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association).&lt;ref name="Burenh"/&gt; Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".&lt;ref name="Burenh"/&gt;

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''.

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

It is noted that a few sounds would have changed among more recent speakers, perhaps due to the influence of Hindi. Older speakers tended to have different pronunciations than among the more younger speakers. The consonant sounds of /pʰ, kʰ, l/ were common among older speakers to pronounce them as /ɸ~f~β, x, lʷ/. Sounds such as a labio-velar approximant /w/, only occur within words or can be a word-final, and cannot occur as a word-initial consonant. The sounds /ɽ, β/ can occur as allophones of /r, b/.

==Classification==
The languages spoken in the Andaman islands fall into two clear families, Great Andamanese and [[Ongan languages|Ongan]], plus one unattested language, [[Sentinelese language|Sentinelese]]. These are generally seen as related. However, the similarities between Great Andamanese and Ongan are so far mainly of a typological [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] nature, with little demonstrated common vocabulary. As a result, even long-range researchers such as [[Joseph Greenberg]] have expressed doubts as to the validity of Andamanese as a family,&lt;ref name = Greenb&gt;Greenberg, Joseph (1971). "The Indo-Pacific hypothesis." ''Current trends in linguistics vol. 8'', ed. by Thomas A. Sebeok, 807.71. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Abbi (2008)&lt;ref name=abbi /&gt; considers the surviving Great Andamanese language to be an [[language isolate|isolate]].  The Great Andaman languages are:&lt;ref name=Manoh1&gt;Manoharan, S. (1983). "Subgrouping Andamanese group of languages." ''[[International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics]]'' XII(1): 82-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Greenberg proposed that Great Andamanese is related to western [[Papuan languages]] as members of a larger phylum he called [[Indo-Pacific languages|Indo-Pacific]],&lt;ref name="Greenb"/&gt; but this is not generally accepted by other linguists. [[Stephen Wurm]] states that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the [[West Papuan languages|West Papuan]] and certain languages of [[Timor]] "are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances", but considers this to be due to a linguistic [[substratum]] rather than a direct relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/pl/C38/_toc.html Wurm, S.A.

==Samples==

The following [[poem]] in Aka-Bea was written by a [[Tribal chief|chief]], ''Jambu'', after he was freed from a six-month [[Prison|jail]] term for [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;Man, E.H. (1923). ''Dictionary of the South Andaman Language''. British India Press: Bombay&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''ngô:do kûk l'àrtâ:lagî:ka,''
: ''mō:ro el:ma kâ igbâ:dàla''
: ''mō:ro el:mo lê aden:yarà''
:: ''pō:-tōt läh.''
: Chorus: ''aden:yarà pō:-tōt läh.''

Literally:

: thou heart-sad art,
: sky-surface to there looking while,
: sky-surface of ripple to looking while,
:: bamboo spear on lean-dost.

Translation:

: Thou art sad at heart,
: gazing there at the sky's surface,
: gazing at the ripple on the sky's surface,
:: leaning on the bamboo spear.

Note, however, that, as seems to be typical of Andamanese [[poetry]], the words and sentence structure have been somewhat abbreviated or inverted in order to obtain the desired [[rhythm]]ical effect.

As another example, we give part of a [[creation myth]] in Oko-Juwoi, reminiscent of [[Prometheus]]:

: ''Kuro-t'on-mik-a Mom Mirit-la, Bilik l'ôkô-ema-t, peakar at-lo top-chike at laiche Lech-lin a, kotik a ôko-kodak-chine at-lo Karat-tatak-emi-in.''

Literally:

:"Kuro-t'on-mik-in Mr. Pigeon, God ?-slep-t, wood fire-with stealing-was fire the.late Lech-to he, then he ?-fire-make-did fire-with Karat-tatak-emi-at."

Translated (by Portman):

: Mr. [[Pigeon]] stole a firebrand at Kuro-t'on-mika, while [[God]] was sleeping.  He gave the brand to the late Lech, who then made fires at Karat-tatak-emi.

'''Henriette Caillaux''' (5 December 1874 – 29 January 1943) was a [[Paris, France|Parisian]] [[socialite]] and second wife of the former [[Prime Minister of France]], [[Joseph Caillaux]]. On March 16, 1914, she shot and killed [[Gaston Calmette]], editor of the newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]''.

==Early life and marriages==
Henriette Caillaux was born '''Henriette Raynouard''', at [[Rueil-Malmaison]] on 5 December 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Acte de naissance nº 213, année 1874, état civil de Rueil&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 19, she married Léo Claretie, a writer twelve years her senior.&lt;ref name="bereson13"&gt;Berenson (1992), p.13&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children. In 1907 she began having an affair with [[Joseph Caillaux]] while both he and she were still married. In 1908, she divorced Claretie; Caillaux had more difficulties in divorcing his wife, but he eventually did so and they married in October 1911.&lt;ref name="bereson13" /&gt; Their joint assets were worth around 1.5 million francs, placing them among France's wealthiest couples.&lt;ref name="bereson13" /&gt;

==Shooting of Gaston Calmette==
===Background===
While serving as [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Finance]] in the government of France, Caillaux came under bitter attack from his political foes. The editor of the ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper, [[Gaston Calmette]], had been a severe critic. Calmette received a letter belonging to Caillaux that journalistic etiquette at the time dictated should not be published. The letter seemed to suggest that improprieties had been committed by Caillaux. In this letter he appeared to admit having orchestrated the rejection of a tax bill while publicly pretending to support its passage. Calmette published the letter at a time when Caillaux, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, was trying to get a [[progressive taxation]] law passed by the [[French Senate]]. The publication of his letter severely tarnished Caillaux's reputation and caused a great political upheaval.

[[File:Henriette Caillaux 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Cover illustration from ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' (29 March 1914) depicting the assassination of Calmette by Madame Caillaux.]]

===The shooting===
Henriette Caillaux believed that Calmette would publish other private letters that would demonstrate that Caillaux and she had had an [[intimate relationship]] while he was still married to his first wife. She felt the only way for her husband to defend his reputation would be to challenge Calmette to a [[duel]], which, one way or another, would destroy her and her husband's life. Madame Caillaux made the decision to protect her beloved husband by sacrificing herself.

At 5pm on 16 March 1914, she entered offices of ''Le Figaro'', wearing a fur coat and with her hands in a fur [[Muff (handwarmer)|muff]],&lt;ref name="breenson2" /&gt; and asked to see Gaston Calmette. When told he was away but would return within an hour, she sat to wait.&lt;ref name="martin151"&gt;Martin (1984), p.151&lt;/ref&gt; Calmette returned at 6pm with his friend, the novelist [[Paul Bourget]] and agreed to briefly see Madame Caillaux, to Bourget's surprise.&lt;ref name="martin151" /&gt;

After being shown into Calmette's office, Henriette Caillaux exchanged a few words with him, then pulled out a [[.32 ACP|.32]] Browning automatic pistol she had been concealing within the muff and fired six shots, Calmette was hit four times and was critically wounded.&lt;ref name="martin152"&gt;Martin (1984), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Henriette Caillaux made no attempt to escape and newspaper workers in adjoining offices quickly summoned a doctor and the police. She refused to be transported to the police headquarters in a police van, insisting on being driven there by her chauffeur in her own car, which was still parked outside. The police agreed to this and she was formally charged upon reaching the headquarters.&lt;ref name="breenson2"&gt;Berenson (1992), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Gaston Calmette died six hours after being shot.&lt;ref name="martin152" /&gt;

===Trial===
Henriette Caillaux's trial dominated French public life. It featured a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] from the president of the Republic, an unheard-of occurrence at a criminal proceeding almost anywhere, along with the fact that many of the participants were among the most powerful members of French society. She was defended by the prominent attorney [[Fernand Labori]] who convinced the jury that her crime, which she did not deny, was not a premeditated act but that her uncontrollable female emotions resulted in a [[crime of passion]]. The belief that women were not as strong emotionally as men resulted in her acquittal on 28 July 1914.

==Later life==
In the early 1930s she was awarded a diploma of the [[École du Louvre]] for her thesis on the sculptor [[Jules Dalou]]. She published a reference book in 1935 in which she established an inventory of the work of this artist.&lt;ref&gt;Henriette Caillaux, ''Aimé-Jules Dalou, L'homme - L'œuvre'', Paris, Delagrave, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1943.

==Legacy==
[[File:The Caillaux Case.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for ''The Caillaux Case'' in ''Motion Picture World (1918)]]
In 1918, an American silent film, ''The Caillaux Case'', was released by [[Fox Film]]. Directed by [[Richard Stanton]], it featured [[Madlaine Traverse]] as Henriette Caillaux and Eugene Ormonde as Gaston Calmette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008944/ | title=The Caillaux Case (1918) | publisher=IMDb | accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film portrays both Henriette Caillaux and her husband as pro-German conspirators and traitors to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Espionage Filmography: United States Releases, 1898 through 1999 | publisher=McFarland | author=Mavis, Paul | year=2011 | isbn=1476604274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before and during World War I, Joseph Caillaux had indeed been an advocate of peaceful compromise with Germany, and at the end of 1917 while the war was still going on, he was charged and convicted of treason. The film was not a financial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fox Film Corporation, 1915-1935: A History and Filmography | publisher=McFarland | author=Solomon, Aubrey | year=2011 | pages=34 | isbn=0786486104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 a German television film ''Madame Caillaux'' was made.

A 1985 made for [[French television]] film called ''L'Affaire Caillaux'' and a 1992 book titled ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6QRLcTQRI_4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Trial+of+Madame+Caillaux&amp;sig=ACfU3U3kS_uew2sOZqJqLy4kjlWY0iqocw|The Trial of Madame Caillaux]'' by American history professor Edward Berenson recount the event.  In addition, [[Robert Delaunay]] used an illustration of the assassination as the basis for his 1914 painting ''Political Drama''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/2985/2985_meyerhoff.pdf I think I see...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528164902/http://www.nga.gov/press/exh/2985/2985_meyerhoff.pdf |date=2010-05-28 }} at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hostile architecture''' is an [[urban design]] trend in which [[Public space|public spaces]] are constructed or altered to discourage people from using them in a way not intended by the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/hostile-architecture.html|title = hostile architecture|date = |accessdate = 23 February 2015|work = Macmillan Dictionary|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hostile architecture is a subset of attempts to [[Crime prevention through environmental design|'design out crime']] and 'anti social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/designersGuide_digital_0_0.pdf|title=Design out crime|last=Design Council|first=|date=|website=https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/designersGuide_digital_0_0.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;' Also known as '''defensive architecture''', '''hostile design''', '''unpleasant design''', '''exclusionary design,''' or '''defensive urban design''' it is most typically associated with "anti-homeless spikes" — studs embedded in flat surfaces to make [[sleeping rough]], uncomfortable, and impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/12/anti-homeless-spikes-latest-defensive-urban-architecture|title = Anti-homeless spikes are just the latest in 'defensive urban architecture'|last = Omidi|first = Maryam|date = 12 June 2014|work = [[The Guardian]]|access-date = 23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/defensive-architecture-keeps-poverty-undeen-and-makes-us-more-hostile|title = Anti-homeless spikes: 'Sleeping rough opened my eyes to the city's barbed cruelty'|last = Andreou|first = Alex|date = 18 February 2015|work = [[The Guardian]]|access-date = 23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other measures include sloped [[window sill]]s to stop people sitting, benches with armrests positioned to stop people lying on them, and water sprinklers that "intermittently come on but aren't really watering anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/13/anti-homeless-spikes-hostile-architecture|title = Anti-homeless spikes are part of a wider phenomenon of 'hostile architecture'|last = Quinn|first = Ben|date = 13 June 2014|work = [[The Guardian]]|access-date = 23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gizmodo.com/how-defensive-architecture-is-ruining-our-cities-1687215926|title = How 'Defensive Architecture' Is Ruining Our Cities|date = 21 February 2015|accessdate = 23 February 2015 |work=[[Gizmodo.com]] |publisher = |last = Mills|first = Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hostile architecture also seeks to deter [[skateboarding]], [[littering]], [[loitering]], and public [[urination]]. Critics argue that such measures reinforce social divisions and create problems for all members of the public, especially seniors, people with disabilities, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensiveto.com/|title=#defensiveTO|last=Chellew|first=Cara|date=January 21, 2018|website=#defensiveTO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostile architecture is often used in conjunction with [[Sit-lie ordinance|sit-lie ordinances]] which critics argue criminalize homelessness.

==Background==
Although the term "hostile architecture" is recent, the use of [[civil engineering]] to achieve [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] is not: antecedents include 19th century "urine deflectors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131202-dirty-tricks-of-city-design|title = Secret city design tricks manipulate your behaviour|last = Swain|first = Frank|date = 2 December 2013|work = BBC|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://catsmeatshop.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/urine-deflectors-in-fleet-street.html|title = Urine Deflectors in Fleet Street|date = 23 July 2013|accessdate = 23 February 2014|website = The Cat's Meat Shop|publisher = |last = Lee|first = Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its modern form is derived from design philosophy, [[Crime Prevention through Environmental Design]] which aims to prevent crime or protect property through three strategies: natural surveillance, natural access control, and territorial enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chellew|first=Cara|date=2016|title=Design Paranoia|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cara_Chellew/publication/314762975_Design_Paranoia/links/58c5d3d745851538eb8b009e/Design-Paranoia.pdf|journal=Ontario Planning Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seattle Department of Transportation installed bicycle racks to prevent the homeless from camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/12/19/25638433/seattle-uses-bike-racks-to-discourage-homeless-camping|title = Seattle Uses Bike Racks to Discourage Homeless Camping|last = Groover|first = Heidi|date = 19 December 2017|work = [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|access-date = 17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A gas station in [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|New Kensington]], Pennsylvania installed blue lighting in their bathrooms that make it hard for drug users to find their veins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/health/bathroom-blue-lights-trnd/index.html|title=Gas station installs blue lights to combat drug use|publisher=CNN|first=Amanda|last=Watts|date=December 7, 2017|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of hostile architecture argue that it makes [[Contrarian|contrarianism]] impossible, that it replaces public spaces with commercial or "pseudo-public" spaces and uses architecture "to enforce social divisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://medium.com/futures-exchange/designing-the-perfect-anti-object-49a184a6667a|title = Designing the Perfect Anti-Object|date = 5 December 2013|accessdate = 23 February 2015|website = Medium|publisher = |last = Swain|first = Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.discoversociety.org/2014/08/05/on-the-frontline-the-architectural-policing-of-social-boundaries/|title = On the frontline: The architectural policing of social boundaries|date = 5 August 2014|accessdate = 23 February 2015|website = Discover Society|publisher = |last = Shea|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative Responses to Hostile Design ==
In 2003 Stéphane Argillet and Gilles Paté filmed ''Rest of the Fakir'' showing themselves attempting rest at examples of hostile design throughout Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=pategilles|title=the fakir's rest|date=2009-12-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv3M7FxJqtM|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 American artist Sarah Ross documented examples of hostile design throughout Los Angeles in her series ''Tempting Resistance.''  Her 2006 followup ''Archisuits'' created clothing designed to fit in the negative space of hostile design to allow for sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insecurespaces.net/testingresistance.html|title=/\SARAH ROSS/\|website=www.insecurespaces.net|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 British artist [[Stuart Semple]] created a social media public awareness campaign encouraging the public to place identifying stickers on instances of hostile design in their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/article/design-crimes-artist-launches-campaign-highlight-hostile-architecture/|title=Hostile Architecture: 'Design Crimes' Campaign Gets Bars Removed from Benches - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/stuart-semple-launches-campaign-to-eradicate-hostile-design-around-the-world|title=Stuart Semple launches campaign to eradicate ‘hostile design’ around the world|website=www.theartnewspaper.com|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/424567/stuart-semple-launches-campaign-to-call-out-hostile-urban-design/|title=Artist Launches Campaign to Call Out Hostile Urban Design|date=2018-02-01|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-02-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of [[human evolution]]. Human science is the [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], informed critique of human existence and how it relates to [[reality]].

==Meaning of 'science'==
Ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms '[[science]]', '[[empirical science]]', and '[[scientific method]]' have complicated the usage of the term 'human science' with respect to human activities. The term 'science' is derived from the Latin ''scientia'' meaning 'knowledge'. 'Science' may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws.

However, according to [[Positivism|Positivists]], the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method, the application of knowledge or mathematics. As a result of the positivist influence, the term ''science'' is frequently employed as a synonym for ''empirical science''. Empirical science is knowledge based on the [[scientific method]], a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation. However, even with regard to the [[natural sciences]], significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific method&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl, ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2012}}—for example, [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], studying events that cannot be repeated, can use a method of historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm Mayr, Ernst. ''Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184042/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm |date=2006-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena. Thus, natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science, whereas the study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the [[humanities]]. Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term ''science'' is aggravated by the widespread use of the term [[formal science]] with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses, such as logic, mathematics, and the theoretical branches of computer science, information theory, and statistics.

==History==
The phrase 'human science' in English was used during the 17th-century scientific revolution, for example by [[Theophilus Gale]]&lt;ref name="Gale1677"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theophilus Gale|title=The Court of the Gentiles, Or, A Discourse Touching the Original of Human Literature: Both Philologie and Philosophie, from the Scriptures &amp; Jewish Church : in Order of a Demonstration Of, I. The Perfection of Gods Word, and Church-light. II. The Imperfection of Natures Light ... III. The Right Use of Human Learning ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjCI52YG1zIC&amp;pg=RA3-PA327|year=1677|publisher=H. Hall|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge (divine science) and study by humans (human science). [[John Locke]] also uses 'human science' to mean knowledge produced by people, but without the distinction&lt;ref name="Locke1753"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA170|year=1753|publisher=S. Birt|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 20th century, this latter meaning was used at the same time&lt;ref name="Jennings1930"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Spencer Jennings|title=The Biological Basis of Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu0nAAAAYAAJ|year=1930|publisher=W.W. Norton, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 'sciences that make human beings the topic of research'.&lt;ref name="Education1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Congress. House. Committee on Education|title=Proposed department of education: Hearing&amp;#91;s&amp;#93; before the Committee on education, House of Representatives, Seventieth Congress, first session on H. R. 7, a bill to create a department of education and for other purposes. April 25, 26, 27,28 and May 2, 1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkvAAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=U.S. Govt. print. off.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human science''' (also, '''humanistic social science''', '''moral science''' and '''human sciences''') refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities. Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as, [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[economics]], and advances in such things as [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the [[social sciences]] for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world. Its use of an [[empirical]] methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely [[positivism|positivistic]] approach typical of the [[natural sciences]] which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations. Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure, function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human.  The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences, but also its methodology.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'', {{ISBN|0-8014-0644-7}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development===
The term '''moral science''' was used by [[David Hume|David Hume (1711-1776)]] in his ''Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals'' to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships. Hume wished to establish a "science of human nature" based upon [[empirical]] phenomena, and excluding all that does not arise from [[observation]]. Rejecting [[teleological]], [[theological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanations, Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology; phenomena were to be precisely characterized. He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary, relating these to their empirical roots and real-world significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Hume's direction. [[Adam Smith]], for example, conceived of economics as a moral science in the [[David Hume|Hume]]an sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/publicat/m_and_m/2001_spring/crespo.html Book Review] of Jeffrey T. Young's ''Economics As a Moral Science: The Political Economy of Adam Smith''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development===
Partly in reaction to the establishment of [[positivism|positivist philosophy]] and the latter's [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology, non-postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study, for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront (e.g. for the biographer), from that appropriate to the [[natural science]]s, for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost. In this sense, [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] contrasted the humanistic science's need to ''comprehend'' the phenomena under consideration with natural science's need to ''explain'' phenomena, while [[Windelband]] coined the terms [[idiographic]] for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena, and [[nomothetic]] for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] brought nineteenth-century attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Hume's term "moral science", which he translated as ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' - a term with no exact English equivalent. Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way.&lt;ref name="Dilthey"&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''An Introduction to the Human Sciences'', Princeton Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. I}} Meanwhile, his conception of “Geisteswissenschaften” encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts. He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon:&lt;ref name="Dilthey"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter XI}}
* The conviction that perception gives access to reality
* The self-evident nature of logical reasoning
* The [[principle of sufficient reason]]
But the specific nature of the ''Geisteswissenschaften'' is based on the "inner" experience (''Erleben''), the "comprehension" (''[[Verstehen]]'') of the meaning of expressions and "understanding" in terms of the relations of the part and the whole – in contrast to the ''Naturwissenschaften'', the "[[explanation]]" of phenomena by [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] laws in the "[[natural science]]s".&lt;ref name=Dilthey7&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 86}}

[[Edmund Husserl]], a student of [[Franz Brentano]], articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Dilthey's attempt. Dilthey appreciated Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen''&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', 1973 [1913], Findlay, J. N., trans. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; (1900/1901, the first draft of Husserl's ''Phenomenology'') as an “epoch making“ epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften.&lt;ref name=Dilthey7/&gt;{{rp|p. 14}}

In recent years, 'human science' has been used to refer to "a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective, personal, historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saybrook.edu/phs/academicprograms/hs Saybrook Graduate School]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective vs. subjective experiences==

Since [[Auguste Comte]], the positivistic [[social science]]s have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human [[perception]] and attitude. Critics argue that [[subjectivity|subjective]] human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining. Rejecting the positivist influence, they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective, as well as objective, experience. The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner [[psychological]] experience rather than outer [[sensory perception|sensory]] experience. It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs.

==Human sciences in universities==
The Human Sciences degree is relatively young. It has been a degree subject at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] since 1969, and at [[University College London|UCL]] was proposed in 1973 by Professor [[John Zachary Young|J. Z. Young]] and implemented two years later. His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate, numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines, replacing the traditional Classics training for higher-level government and management careers. Central topics include the evolution of [[human]]s, their behaviour, [[molecular]] and population [[genetics]], population growth and ageing, ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including conservation, disease and [[nutrition]]. The study of both [[biological]] and social disciplines, integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems. In the [[United Kingdom]], Human Sciences is offered at degree level at several institutions. These include:

* [https://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/humansciences/ Human Sciences at University of Exeter]
* [[Durham University]] (as Health and Human Sciences)
* [[Cardiff University]] (as Human and Social Sciences)

==Human Science Lab==
The Human Science Lab (HSL) is a global centre for world-leading research on [[evolutionary]], [[biological]] and [[behavioural]] aspect of human species. It is located in [[Oxfordshire]] and [[London]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Introduction |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current research focus are Human [[Cognition]], [[Motivation]], [[Intelligence]], [[Leadership]], [[Critical Thinking]], [[Learning]], [[Ergonomics]] and Human [[Well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/research/| title=Research at Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach for most of its research incorporating [[neuroscience]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk/about| title=About Human Science Lab |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North American jaguar|jaguar]] motif was used due to the belief the jaguar represented [[Tezcatlipoca]]. Aztecs also wore this dress at war because they believed the animal's strengths would be given to them during battles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Jaguar warriors were used at the battlefront in military campaigns. They were also used to capture prisoners for sacrifice to the Aztec gods.&lt;ref name="colonial-mexico.com"/&gt; Many [[statue]]s and images (in [[pre-Columbian]] and [[post-Columbian]] [[codex|codices]]) of these warriors have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odysseyphoto.com/portfolio/PreHispanic/Precolumbian.html Pre-Columbian Stock Photography, Pre-Hispanic Stock Photos, Mesoamerican Travel Photos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417121702/http://www.odysseyphoto.com/portfolio/PreHispanic/Precolumbian.html |date=2007-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They fought with a wooden sword studded with [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] volcanic glass blades, called a [[macuahuitl]]. They also used spears and [[atlatl]]s.

To become a jaguar warrior, a member of the Aztec army had to capture four enemies during battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Patricia|date=|title=Costume and Control: Aztec Sumptuary Laws|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41726816|journal=Archeology|volume=vol. 33 no. 1|pages=40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to honor their gods in a way far greater than killing enemy soldiers in the battlefield. For a warrior to kill an enemy was considered clumsy.

== Education ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The formal education of the Aztecs was to train and teach young boys how to function in their society as warriors. The Aztecs had no standing army, so every boy not of noble birth was trained to become a warrior.  All boys who were between the ages of ten and twenty years old would attend one of the two schools. These two schools were the Telpochcalli (the neighborhood school for commoners) and the Calmecac, the exclusive school for nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Patricia|date=|title=Costume and Control: Aztec Sumptuary Laws|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41726816|journal=Archeology|volume=vol. 33 no. 1|pages=34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Telpochcalli students would learn the art of warfare, and would become warriors. At the Calmecac students would be trained to become military leaders, priests, government officials, etc.  Trades such as farming and artisan skills were not taught at these schools.

At the age of 15, sons of commoners would be sent to a Telpochcalli within their neighborhood.  Here, boys would be trained in the art of warfare and accustomed to military life. The instructors at these schools were veteran warriors who had experience in warfare and leadership. The schools focused on bravery and included a great deal of physical effort and intense pain to increase the strength and stamina of the students. Manual labor included transporting goods such as branches for firewood. The longer the student had attended the school, the more branches he would be expected to carry. This test of carrying firewood would be used to determine if the boy would do well in warfare.

Other manual labor tasks carried out from the Tepochcalli would be community projects. These projects would mainly consist of cleaning areas, building walls, digging canals, and farming. From these projects students would work hard to complete tasks, and gain physical experience needed to engage in warfare. The students of this school would also be used to transport shields, food, military supplies, weapons, armor, and wood to warriors on the battlefield. The reason for forcing the students to be near the battlefield was to make them fearless of warfare. Students were under heavy surveillance at all times. If a student was caught leaving training their punishment would be severe. Often, they would be beaten and their hair removed.  By removing their hair they would remove any sign of them being a warrior. Drinking [[pulque]] was prohibited; if caught, the student could be beaten to death. Relationships outside of the school were also prohibited; if a student was caught sleeping with a woman, they would be beaten to death.

== Life as a jaguar warrior ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Following the warrior's path was one of the few ways to change one's social status in Aztec culture.  Eagle and Jaguar warriors were full-time warriors who worked for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself.  They were expected to be leaders and commanders both on and off the battlefield, and acted as sort of a police force for the city. Men who reached this rank were considered as nobles and elites of society, and were granted many of the same privileges as a noble.  They were allowed to drink ''[[pulque]]'', have [[concubine]]s, and dine at the royal palace.  Jaguar warriors also participated in gladiatorial sacrifices.

== Gladiatorial sacrifice ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The gladiatorial sacrifice was a giant spectacle the entire city would attend. The captives would be paraded in the streets followed by eagle and jaguar warriors to the sacrifice stone. The eagle and jaguar warriors would dance around the captives and display their shields and weapons to the crowds. Once they brought the captives to the sacrifice stone, they would be tied down to it to be ceremonially killed. The captives would be forced to drink ''pulque'' to intoxicate them. They would be painted and given a sword and a shield along with four cudgels to throw. The warriors would then attack the victim who was tied down to the sacrifice stone with an obsidian laced club. The club would be used for ceremonial use and would be decorated with feathers. He would be attacked by several warriors one at a time and then, if still alive, would be attacked by all four together. The warriors which fought during the gladiatorial sacrifice would be eagle and jaguar warriors. If the captive fought off all of them, he would then have to defend himself against a left handed warrior. If captives were not killed this way, then they would be killed the following day by the offering priests. The gladiatorial sacrifice was done as a ceremony, for the return of warriors with their captives. The gladiatorial sacrifices were held during the month of the Feast of the Flaying of Men.

==History==

===Classical period===
==== Settlements ====
Contact with the Philippine islands began when Japanese traders/merchants first settled in the archipelago during the 12th century AD. Notable settlements of the period include [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Agoo]] along [[Lingayen Gulf]].&lt;ref name="seapots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seapots.com/home/index.php/production-centers-pottery-groups/philippines |title=Home Renovations |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019011022/http://www.seapots.com/home/index.php/production-centers-pottery-groups/philippines |archivedate=2014-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Pangasinan, 1572-1800|last=Cortes|first=Rosario Mendoza|publisher=New Day|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese were trading with Philippine kingdoms well before the Spanish period, mainly in [[pottery]] and [[gold]].&lt;ref name="asiapacificuniverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacificuniverse.com/pkm/tech.htm|title=Philippines History, Culture, Civilization and Technology, Filipino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records show that Japanese traders, especially those from [[Nagasaki]], frequently visited the Philippine shores and bartered Japanese goods for such Filipino products as gold and [[pearl]]s. In the course of time, shipwrecked Japanese sailors, pirate traders, and immigrants settled in the Philippines and intermarried with the early Filipinos. When the Spaniards reached the island of Luzon in 1571, they found [[Japanese people|Japanese]] colonies and settlements in Manila and in some parts of the Cagayan Valley, the Cordillera region, [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Bataan]], and Catanduanes Island. The relatively light complexion of the natives of [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]] and [[Banaue]] is probably a result of the early contacts between the Japanese and other islanders from south of [[Japan]] and the natives of the Cordillera.{{cn|date=January 2018}} 

==== Pottery trade ====
{{See also|Rusun jar}}
The ancient Philippines had a very rich tradition of pottery as verified by the finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato and other parts of the islands. Japanese texts mentioned trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) for the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (in Chinese), which means simply "made in Luzon." These Rusun jars, which had rokuru (wheel mark), were said to be more precious than gold because of its ability to act as tea canisters and enhance the fermentation.  In the 15th century AD, tea-jars were brought by the ''[[shōgun]]s'' to [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] in Kyoto from the [[Philippines]] which was used in the [[Japanese tea ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sambali.blogspot.com/2006/09/luzon-jars-glossary.html|title=Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan: Luzon Jars (Glossary)|first=Paul Kekai|last=Manansala|date=5 September 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the important pottery traditions that spread into the [[Oceania]] region had their counterparts in the Philippines including the well-known Lapita culture. This quote from American anthropologist [[Wilhelm Solheim]] illustrates the matter:
{{quotation|I hypothesize that the Sa-huynh Kalanay and Lapita pottery traditions had a common origin somewhere in the Palawan-Sarawak-Sulu Sea-Sulawesi area and that it was at this point in time and space that a second and main stage in the spread of the Austronesian languages began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hadrianmendozapottery.com/philippines/|title=Cerramic Artist|publisher=hadrianmendozapottery}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Japanese filipino.jpg|thumb|407x407px|Japanese Filipina woman (left) wearing [[Maria Clara gown]]]]
The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato confirmed the great pottery tradition of the Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question is whether or not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in Southeast Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified "Imbe" jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered [[Igorot]]s, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to [[Vigan]], where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the [[Philippines]], not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day.&lt;ref name="seapots" /&gt;

==== Fishing technologies ====
The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large [[fishing net]] which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture:

{{quotation|To the early Spaniards, the pisciculture of the Filipinos was regarded almost as a new art, so much more advanced it was than fish breeding methods in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jurado|first1=Antonio María Regidor y|last2=Mason|first2=Joseph Warren Teets|title=Commercial Progress in the Philippine Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tktBAQAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=Dunn &amp; Chidgey|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=tktBAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Commercial+Progress+in+the+Philippine+Islands%22+regidor+mason&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22To+the+early+Spaniards%2C+the+pisciculture+of+the+Filipinos+was+regarded+almost+as+a+new+art%2C%22 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many have looked to Japan for an explanation for these advanced methods. The [[roe]] was transplanted to safe pens for incubation and to guard the small fry from predators. Only when sufficiently mature to fend for themselves were they released back into the wild. These days this method is practiced by fisheries throughout the world. Before the Spanish came, the Filipinos also only used large mesh nets when fishing in rivers, lakes or in the sea. This ecologically sound practice protected the young ensuring future good catches. However, the competition brought by the Spaniards resulted in the use of such small mesh nets that the Spanish themselves eventually had to regulate the nets to prevent the destruction of the fisheries. Other Pre-Spanish Filipino industries included the manufacture of liquors and [[vinegar]]s like tuba, basi, etc., the production of hides for export to Japan, export of edible bird's nests from Northern [[Palawan]] to [[China]], the raising and trade of [[civet]] cats, the manufacture of gunpowder, the making of [[wax]] for export to [[China]], and the making of cotton stockings for export.&lt;ref name="asiapacificuniverse" /&gt;

===Spanish era===
The Japanese population in the Philippines has since included descendants of [[Catholicism in Japan|Japanese Catholics]] and other Japanese Christians who fled from the religious persecution imposed by the Tokugawa shogunate during the [[Edo period]] and settled during the colonial period from the 17th century until the 19th century. A statue of daimyō [[Ukon Takayama]], who was exiled to the Philippines in '''1614''' because he refused to disvow his Christian beliefs, stands a patch of land across the road from the Post Office building in the [[Paco, Manila]]. In the 17th century, the Spaniards referred to the Paco Area as the 'Yellow Plaza' because of the more than 3,000 Japanese who resided there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Google map of Paco district of Manila, Philippines |location=Philippines |title=Japanese Christian |url=http://ph.pagenation.com/mnl/Paco_120.9997_14.5808.map |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507124349/http://ph.pagenation.com/mnl/Paco_120.9997_14.5808.map |archivedate=2010-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese people traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I6owJcCOdwC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Racial%20intimacy%20in%20Japan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KQVvUv6bK_Td4APn14DoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Racial%20intimacy%20in%20Japan&amp;f=false|title=Interracial Intimacy in Japan: Western Men and Japanese Women, 1543-1900|first=Gary P.|last=Leupp|date=26 December 2016|publisher=A&amp;C Black|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;52–3

Many of the Japanese men intermarried with [[Filipino people|Filipino]] women (including those of mixed or unmixed  [[Filipinos of Chinese descent|Chinese]] and [[Filipinos of Spanish descent|Spanish]] descent), thus forming the new Japanese [[mestizo]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.pagenation.com/mnl/Paco_120.9997_14.5808.map ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507124349/http://ph.pagenation.com/mnl/Paco_120.9997_14.5808.map |date=7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sizeable population settled in Manila, [[Davao City|Davao]], the [[Visayas]] and in the 1600s in [[Dilao]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], and [[Ilocos Norte]] Province. This hybrid group tend to be re-assimilated either into the Filipino or the Japanese communities, and thus no accurate denominations could be established, though their estimates range from 100,000 to 200,000. Many were killed or expelled after [[World War II]] because of their alleged collaboration with the Japanese Imperial Army (mostly as translator). Many Japanese mestizos tended to deny their Japanese heritage and changed their family names in order to avoid discrimination.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===American period and the Post-WWII era===
During the American colonial era, the number of Japanese laborers working in plantations rose so high that in the 20th century, Davao soon became dubbed as a ''Ko Nippon Koku'' ("''Little Japan''" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) with a Japanese school, a [[Shinto shrine]] and a diplomatic mission from Japan. Prominent scholars and historian like Lydia Yu-Jose and Macario Tiu wrote extensively on the lively presence of Japanese migrants in pre-war Davao due to its noticeably thriving local economy predicated by a huge concentration of rubber, copra, and hemp plantations. Unsurprisingly so, when World War II broke out, it was reported that there were more than 21,000 Japanese residents in the Philippines with about 18,000 or more in Davao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davaotoday.com/main/todays-views/davao-from-the-past-part-one/|title=Davao of the Past: A Reexamination from the South (Part I)|date=12 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is even a popular restaurant called "The Japanese Tunnel", which includes an actual tunnel built by the Japanese during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Pacific Citizen |location=Philippines |title=A Little Tokyo Rooted in the Philippines |date=April 2007 |url=http://www.pacificcitizen.org/content/2007/national/apr20-lin-davaokuo.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222185058/http://www.pacificcitizen.org/content/2007/national/apr20-lin-davaokuo.htm |archivedate=2008-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Davao Region|Davao]] in Mindanao had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a [[fifth column]], welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II. These Japanese were hated by the [[Moros during World War II|Moros]] and disliked by the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sDRlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R4kNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2656,1332631&amp;hl=en Curtis 1942], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sDRlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R4kNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2656,1332631&amp;hl=en CURTIS 1942], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Moros were judged as "fully capable of dealing with Japanese fifth columnists and invaders alike."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oJRRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LWoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2732,2587117&amp;hl=en "80 Japanese Troop Ships Are Sighted Off Luzon" 1941], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Moros were to fight the Japanese invaders when they landed at Davao on Mindanao.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i1xFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ELwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4603,5384970&amp;hl=en AP 1941], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ruEcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3633,7246655&amp;hl=en "SITUATION AT DAVAO OBSCURE AS JAPS LAND" 1941], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2P0oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C9UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3421,2464690&amp;hl=en "THE JAPS SWARM AT DAVAO BUT THE SITUATION OBSCURE" 1941], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GnNHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=af4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5937,4816594&amp;hl=en "Six Japanese Bombers In New Raid On Manila" 1941], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/12/22/archives/outrages-cause-anger-flotilla-is-sighted-off-luzons-coast.html THE NEW YORK TIMES 1941], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=luBRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zoQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6067,2425479&amp;hl=en "Large Force Is Attacking" 1941], p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese went back to their ships at night to sleep since the Moros struck so much fear into them, even though the Moros were outnumbered by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VXgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3JgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2500,438255&amp;hl=en LEE 1942], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3O4qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GokFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1693,3646589&amp;hl=en LEE 1942], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rNZeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BFMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1233,4394025&amp;hl=en LEE 1942], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JZQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-MYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3881,736181&amp;hl=en LEE 1942], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9N5eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jlMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6736,635472&amp;hl=en Lee 1942], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4e8uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wdsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3415,515356&amp;hl=en Lee 1942], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6MoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5177,2963057&amp;hl=en Lee 1942], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

For fear of discrimination, some fled to the mountains after World War II while many others changed their names in the attempts to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]]. Many were also killed (''c.'' 10,000 Japanese Mestizos and Japanese) while others were deported as an act of retaliation. Their Japanese identity may take on extremes, some have completely lost their Japanese identity while others have "returned" to Japan, the homeland of their forebears. There is also a number of contemporary Japanese-mestizos, not associated with the history of the earlier established ones, born either in the Philippines or Japan. These latter are the resultant of unions between Filipinos and recent Japanese immigrants to the Philippines or Japanese and immigrant Filipino workers in Japan. Most Japanese mestizos speak Tagalog and/or other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]]. They may also be known as ''Japinos'', although this term is considered derogatory by many. There are believed to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Japanese-mestizos in the country, but no accurate figure is currently available. Thousands of war-displaced ethnic Japanese still live in the country and are denied recognition as Japanese nationals in order to return to Japan.

===Modern times===
The recent Japanese Filipinos are descendants of 1980s and 1990s Japanese settlers usually businesspeople, most of whom are men, and (mostly female) locals. Many are children of thousands of [[overseas Filipino workers]], who went to Japan mostly as entertainers. They are in the Philippines also to learn English. As the Filipina mothers return to the Philippines, most take their children along with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Japan Times |location=Japan |title=Japanese-Filipino kids await fate, Top court to rule on nationality law tied to paternal recognition |date=June 4, 2008 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080604f1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number in the U.S. today are the product of Filipino- and Japanese American intermarriages, mostly in [[California]], [[Hawaii]], or other U.S. states, or other U.S. territories in the Pacific, while others are Filipinos of Japanese ancestry who have migrated to the United States.

Several foundations today such as the ''Federation of Nikkeijin Kai Philippines'' &amp; ''Manila Nikkeijin Kai'' exist throughout the country through the efforts of prosperous Japanese descendants and expatriates to assist Filipinos of Japanese ancestry to travel in Japan to trace their roots and visit relatives, and also charity purposes such as offering Long Term Resident visa and educational scholarships to out of school Japanese Filipino children. Similar organizations exist in the Philippines to commemorate and signify the historical settlement of Japanese Filipinos in the region. The Philippines also has the highest number of Japanese in the country than any other Southeast Asian country.

=== Japanese citizenship ===
The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] on June 4, 2008, ruled against a law that denied citizenship to children born out of wedlock to Japanese fathers and foreign mothers. It upheld the 2003 and 2005 separate suits (of 10 Japanese-Filipino children for Japanese citizenship), filed by Filipino mothers who proved the fathers of their children were Japanese. It affirmed the [[Tokyo District Court]] judgment that "the marital status of the parents had no bearing on nationality, and that denying the children citizenship violated constitutional guarantees of equality for all."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120801014501/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/99158/Japan-high-court-rules-in-favor-of-Japanese-Filipino children GMA NEWS.TV, Japan high court rules in favor of 'Japanese-Filipino' children]&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Nuqui, executive director of the Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), stated that "the 30-year migration of Filipino entertainers to Japan produced 100,000 Japanese-Filipino children{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, but very few children were legally acknowledged by their Japanese fathers. DAWN assists Filipino entertainers and Japanese-Filipinos, by helping Japanese-Filipinos locate their fathers in Japan. In 2007, it called for registration of Japanese-Filipinos, and 1,313 Japanese-Filipinos in the Philippines registered (August to October in 2007). However, only 60 of the 1,313 children had been registered in Japan, and of 2,800 children (born out of wedlock from foreign mothers who reside in Japan), 2,000 had Japanese fathers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=120625 abs-cbnnews.com, Thousands of 'Japanese-Filipinos' seen to benefit from Japan high court ruling]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">The '''Ker''' are a [[Muslim Rajput]] community found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]] and a province of [[Sindh]] in [[Pakistan]]. They are one of a number of communities of pastoral nomads found in the Banni region of [[Kutch]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 631-636&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The Ker claim descent from the [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]] [[Rajput]]s of [[Sindh]]. According to their traditions, the word in ker in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] means a dreadful sin. Their ancestor Mania came to [[Kutch]] in the thirteenth century. He was involved in a murder of royal prince of [[Kutch]], and as such he and his descendants became known as the Ker, i.e., the committer of a dreadful sin.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Two edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 631-636&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The community is concentrated in the [[taluka]]s of [[Bhuj Taluka|Bhuj]], [[Abdasa Taluka|Abdasa]] and [[Lakpat Taluka|Lakhpat]] in [[Kutch District]] of [[Gujarat]], and the neighbouring districts of [[Badin District|Badin]] and [[Tharparkar District|Tharparkar]] in [[Sindh]].  They have three sub-divisions, the Mamda, Manai and Mode, all of which have equal status. The Ker are endogamous, but do on occasion marry into other [[Samma (tribe)|Samma]] communities such as the Aboda, Darad, Mandra, Mokhaji and Padiar. Historically, there were cases of intermarriage with the [[Hindu]] [[Jadeja]] community, but this custom has ended.

The Ker are pastoral [[Maldhari]] nomads, raising buffaloes, cows and sheep, and graze these in the Banni region. They also sell milk to [[Bhuj]]. They often migrate to [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] to graze their cattle. Like many other Kutchis, the Ker have migrated to others parts of India in search of work. The traditional headmen of the tribe, the Jaam have converted to [[Hinduism]], and this has led to a rupture of the relationship of the tribe with their headman.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Gujarat'' Volume XXI  Part  Two, edited by R.B. Lal, P.B.S.V. Padmanabham, G. Krishnan &amp; M. Azeez Mohideen, pages 631-636&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sierra Leonean Creole''' or '''Krio''' is an [[English-based creole language]] that is [[lingua franca]] and [[de facto]] [[national language]] spoken throughout the West African nation of [[Sierra Leone]]. Krio is spoken by 97% of Sierra Leone's population and unites the different ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction with each other. Krio is the primary language of communication among Sierra Leoneans at home and abroad. The language is native to the [[Sierra Leone Creole people]] or Krios, (a community of about 300,000 descendants of freed slaves from the [[West Indies]], [[United States]] and the [[British Empire]]), and is spoken as a second language by millions of other Sierra Leoneans belonging to the country's indigenous tribes.  English is Sierra Leone's [[official language]], while Krio, despite its common use throughout the country, has no official status.

==Overview==
The Krio language is an offshoot of the languages and variations of English brought by the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]] from [[North America]], [[Jamaican Maroon|Maroons]] from Jamaica, and the numerous liberated African slaves who settled in Sierra Leone.

All freed slaves&amp;mdash;the [[Jamaican Maroons]], [[African-Americans]], and [[Sierra Leone Liberated Africans|Liberated Africans]]&amp;mdash;influenced Krio, but the Jamaican Maroons, Igbo and Yoruba Liberated Africans were the most influential. It seems probable that the basic grammatical structure and vowel system of Krio is an offshoot of [[Jamaican Maroon spirit-possession language|Jamaican Maroon Creole]]&lt;ref&gt;The Structure of Creole Words: Segmental, Syllabic and Morphological Aspects
 by Parth Bhatt and Ingo Plag&lt;/ref&gt; spoken by the Maroons, as there are well-documented and important direct historical connections between Jamaica 
and Sierra Leone. The language was also influenced by [[African American Vernacular English]] while the majority of the African words in Krio come from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo language|Igbo]] languages.

Krio is distinct from a [[pidgin]] as it is a language in its own right, with fixed grammatical structures and rules. Krio also draws from other [[European languages]], like [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]],  e.g. the Krio word ''gentri/gentree,'' which means wealth or to acquire wealth, is derived from the [[Old French]] word "[[gentry]]," and the Krio word ''pikin,'' which means child, indirectly comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word "pequeno" (meaning "small" and often used to mean children in Portuguese).

In [[Sierra Leone]] the Krio Language is spoken by people with degrees in the fluency, as well as regional changes to the Krio. Many of the speakers of Sierra Leone Krio live in or close to the capital city, [[Freetown]]. As of 2007 there were close to 350,000 individuals who spoke Krio as a primary language. With even more individuals who were using it as a main language for communication purposes in the country as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages
An Introduction|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=|location=Philadelphia, U.S.A|pages=249, 276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language origins==
One theory suggests the early roots of Krio go back to the [[Atlantic slave trade]] era in the 17th and 18th centuries when an English-based "[[pidgin]]" language ([[West African Pidgin English]], also called Guinea Coast Creole English) arose to facilitate the coastal trade between Europeans and Africans.  This early pidgin later became the lingua franca of regional trade among West Africans themselves and likely spread up the river systems to the African interior.  After the founding of Freetown, this preexisting pidgin was incorporated into the speech of the various groups of freed slaves landed in Sierra Leone between 1787 and about 1855.  The pidgin gradually evolved to become a stable language, the native language of descendants of the freed slaves (which are now a distinct ethnic and cultural group, the Creoles), and the lingua franca of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;Fourah Bay College, Freetown: Guide to Krio, (held at [[SOAS]] Univ. of London Library, 195?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language usage==

===Krio usage in Sierra Leone===
Most ethnic and cultural Creoles live in and around [[Freetown]], the capital of Sierra Leone, and their community accounts for about 3% to 6% of Sierra Leone's total population  (Freetown is the province where the returned slaves from London and [[Nova Scotia]] settled).&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]]: [[Rough Crossings]], London,  2007&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of their cultural influence in Sierra Leone — especially during the period of colonial rule — their language is used as the lingua franca among all the ethnic groups in Sierra Leone.  Many [[Mende people|Mende]]s, [[Temne people|Temne]]s, and [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]]s grow up in the interior of the country speaking both their native languages and Krio. Some children born in [[Freetown]] to parents who are not ethnic Creoles grow up speaking Krio and only Krio as their mother tongue.

===Krio speakers abroad===
The Creole people acted as traders and missionaries in other parts of West Africa during the 19th century, and as a result there are also Krio-speaking communities in [[The Gambia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Wyse: Krios of Sierra Leone, London (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Sierra Leone Creole migratory patterns, in the Gambia the Creole or ''Aku'' community speak a dialect that is very similar to Krio in Sierra Leone. A small number of liberated Africans returned to the land of their origins, such as the Saros of [[Nigeria]] who not only took their Western names with them but also imported Krio words like ''sabi'' into [[Nigerian Pidgin English]].

===Language revival===
During the period of colonial rule, Sierra Leoneans (particularly among the upper class) were discouraged from speaking Krio; but after independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, writers and educators began promoting its use. In the 1960s, [[Thomas Leighton Decker|Thomas Decker]] translated some of Shakespeare's plays into Krio, and composed original poetry in the language. In the 1980s the New Testament was translated into Krio. Beginning with the involvement of Lutheran Bible Translators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.lbt.org/project/krio-completed-bible-2013/ Link to dedication report]&lt;/ref&gt; Krio-language translations of the New Testament and Bible were published in 1986 and 2013.

While English is Sierra Leone's official language, the Ministry of Education began using Krio as the medium of instruction in some primary schools in Freetown in the 1990s. Radio stations now broadcast a wide variety of programs in Krio. Sierra Leonean politicians also routinely give public speeches in the language.

==Classification==
Krio is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole]] from which descend [[Nigerian Pidgin English]] and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] and [[Pichinglis]].  It is also similar to English-based creole languages spoken in the Americas, especially the [[Gullah language]], [[Jamaican Patois]] (Jamaican Creole), and [[Bajan Creole]] but it has its own distinctive character. It also shares some linguistic similarities with non-English creoles, such as the French-based creole languages in the Caribbean.

==Grammar==
The suffix "-dèm" is used to mark the plural, as well as the genitive plural e.g. "uman" ("woman").
{|class="wikitable"
| || singular || plural
|-
| Oblique || uman || umandèm
|}

===Verbs===

Verbs do not conjugate according to person or number, but reflect their tense. Tense, aspect and mood are marked by one or more tense or aspect markers. The tense markers are 'bin' for the past tense and 'go' for the future, the absence of either shows the present tense. Aspect is shown by 'dòn' for perfective and 'de' for imperfective. Infinitive is marked by 'fòr' and conditional by a combination of 'bin' and 'go'. Tendency is marked by 'kin' and 'nòbar'. The verbal paradigm is as follows.
{|class="wikitable"
|-
| infinitive || fòr go
|-
| present simple (unmarked) || go
|-
| present progressive || de go
|-
| perfect || dòn go
|-
| perfect progressive || dòn de go
|-
| future simple || go go
|-
| future progressive || go de go
|-
| future perfect || go dòn go
|-
|  future perfect progressive|| go dòn de go
|-
| past simple || bin go
|-
| past progressive || bin de go
|-
| past perfect || bin dòn go
|-
| past perfect progressive || bin dòn de go
|-
| conditional || bin for go
|-
| conditional progressive || bin for de go
|-
| conditional perfect || bin for dòn go
|- go
| conditional perfect progressive || bin for dòn de go
|-
| tendency || kin go
|-
| negative tendency || nò kin/nòbar go
|}

The hortative is marked by 'lè' e.g. 'lè wi go, lè wi tòk' and the optative by 'mè' e.g. 'mè yu Kingmara kam, mè yu Will bi duo'

===Interrogatives===
The following interrogatives can be used:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
| ''udat'' || who
|-
| ''wetin'' || what
|-
| ''ustɛm'' || when
|-
| ''ussay'' || where
|-
| ''wetin mek'' || why
|-
| ''us'' || which
|-
| ''ɔmɔs" || how much/many
|}

In addition, like many other Creoles, a question can be asked simply by intonation.
E.g. ''Yu de go?'': 'Are you going' vs ''yu de go'': 'you are going.' Additionally the question particles 'ènti' and 'nòoso' can be used at the start or end of the phrase respectively.

===Pronouns===

There is no distinction between masculine and feminine in any person and, unlike Standard English, there is a 2nd person plural form. However, there are the hints of [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Genitive case|genitive]] cases.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
| ''a, mi, mi'' || I, me, my
|-
| ''yu'' || you, you, your
|-
| ''i, am, im'' || he/she/it, him/her/it, his/her/its
|-
| ''wi'' || we, us, our
|-
| ''unu'' or ''una'' or ''ina'' || you, you, your ''(plural)''
|-
| ''dèm'' || they, them, theirs
|}

==Orthography==

Krio uses the [[Latin script]] but without [[Q]]q and [[X]]x and with three additional letters from the [[African reference alphabet]], [[Latin epsilon|Ɛɛ]] (open E), [[Eng (letter)|Ŋŋ]] (eng), and [[Open O|Ɔɔ]] (open O). Three [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] can be distinguished in Krio and are sometimes marked with [[grave accent|grave]] (à), [[acute accent|acute]] (á), and [[circumflex]] (â) accents over the vowels for low, high, and falling tones respectively but these accents are not employed in normal usage. An alternative orthography with Latin letters only has been devised by Thomas Decker.

The complete alphabet with [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s follows with Decker's orthography in parentheses:

== Films ==
Krio is used (incorrectly) early in the 2006 film ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'' between Danny Archer (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) and a character named Commander Zero.

It can also be heard in the music video for "[[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]]", a song by American rapper Kanye West.

In 2007, work was completed on an unsanctioned, dubbed Krio version of [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s 1977 film ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]''. The dubs were recorded by a team of over 14 native Krio speakers, over a period of 9 months in the Lungi region of Sierra Leone. The film aired on ABC-TV and a limited run of 300 copies were produced, which were mostly sold in Lungi and Freetown.&lt;ref&gt;
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpgOsrKZN4c video clip] of Krio-dubbed version of Zefirelli's ''Jesus of Nazareth''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first feature-length documentary entirely spoken in Krio is Boris Gerrets' film ''Shado’man'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shadoman-film.com/|title=Shado'man - A Boris Gerrets Film|website=www.shadoman-film.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shot in Freetown at night with a group of homeless disabled people. The film premiered at the IDFA documentary festival&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?ID=0df397fc-6dcf-4c7b-be41-e7271541b526&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam and was seen in festivals around the world including FESPACO, the biannual Pan-African film festival in Ouagadougou.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fespaco.bf/images/pdf/documents_fespaco/SELECTION%20OFFICIELLE%20FESPACO%202015%20HORS%20COMPETITION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://documentaries.about.com/od/documentaryfestivals/tp/IDFA-2013-Documentaries-to-Watch-List.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-shadoman-1200909192/|title=Film Review: ‘Shado’man’|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=2013-12-09|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinemagazine.nl/shadoman-2013-recensie/|title=Shado'man (2013) recensie, Boris Gerrets - Cinemagazine|website=cinemagazine.nl|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-archief/pijnlijke-prachtige-schaduwwereld~a3600288/|title=Pijnlijke prachtige schaduwwereld|work=de Volkskrant|access-date=2018-09-17|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/next/van/2014/februari/20/leven-in-de-schaduw-in-sierra-leone-1351090|title=Leven in de schaduw in Sierra Leone|work=NRC|access-date=2018-09-17|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==

Peter Grant, the protagonist of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series, is the London-born son of an immigrant from Sierra Leone. While speaking English with other characters, he speaks Krio with his mother. Aaronovitch includes some such conversations in his text, leaving the reader to puzzle out what was said.

The members of this community are short, have black skin, and have protruding foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tamil.thehindu.com/tamilnadu/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B4%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8A%E0%AE%B4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A9-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%88%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%9A%E0%AF%81-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95-%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%82%E0%AE%95-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%88/article9127274.ece?homepage=true&amp;relartwiz=true  பழங்குடியினர் மொழிக்கான அகராதி தயாரித்த ஆசிரியைகள்: அரசு அங்கீகரிக்க சமூக ஆர்வலர்கள் கோரிக்கை]- The hindu Tamil News - 20 september 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurumbar believe in [[Hinduism]] and have a language, which is a mixture of all [[Dravidian languages]]. The main deity of the tribe is [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] under the name of [[Bhairava]]. They also worship animals, birds, trees, rock hillocks, and snakes, along with the other Hindu deities.

Kurumbar are one of the six ancient tribal groups in Tamil Nadu. They live very much in tune with Nature. Hunting and collecting forest produce are the two main means of living for the Kurumbar tribe. However, the restrictions to protect native forest and wildlife have forced them to find work outside the forests.

The '''LGBT community''' or '''GLBT community''', also referred to as the '''gay community''', is a loosely defined grouping of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], LGBT organizations, and [[subculture]]s, united by a common [[LGBT culture|culture]] and [[LGBT social movements|social movements]]. These communities generally celebrate [[Gay pride|pride]], [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], [[individuality]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. LGBT activists and sociologists see LGBT community-building as a counterbalance to [[heterosexism]], [[homophobia]], [[biphobia]], [[transphobia]], [[sexualism]], and [[Conformity|conformist]] pressures that exist in the larger society. The term ''pride'' or sometimes ''gay pride'' is used to express the LGBT community's identity and collective strength; [[pride parade]]s provide both a prime example of the use and a demonstration of the general meaning of the term. The LGBT community is diverse in [[political affiliation]]. Not all people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender consider themselves part of the LGBT community.

Groups that may be considered part of the LGBT community include [[gay village]]s, [[List of LGBT rights organizations|LGBT rights organizations]], LGBT employee groups at companies, [[Gay-straight alliance|LGBT student groups in schools and universities]], and [[LGBT-affirming religious groups]].

LGBT communities may organize themselves into, or support, [[movements for civil rights]] promoting [[LGBT rights]] in various places around the world.

==Symbols==
{{Main|LGBT symbols}}
The gay community is frequently associated with certain symbols; especially the [[rainbow]] or rainbow flags. The Greek [[lambda]] symbol ("L" for liberation), triangles, ribbons, and gender symbols are also used as "gay acceptance" symbol. There are many types of flags to represent subdivisions in the gay community, but the most commonly recognized one is the [[rainbow flag]]. According to [[Gilbert Baker (artist)|Gilbert Baker]], creator of the commonly known rainbow flag, each color represents a value in the community:
* pink = sexuality
* red = life
* orange = healing
* yellow = the sun
* green = nature
* blue = art
* indigo = harmony
* violet = spirit
[[File:Congresswoman Pelosi at the Friends of the Pink Triangle Ceremony (8281364821) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Congresswoman Pelosi at the Friends of the Pink Triangle Ceremony]]
Later, pink and indigo were removed from the flag, resulting in the present-day flag which was first presented at the 1979 Pride Parade. Other flags include the Victory over [[AIDS]] flag, Leather Pride flag, and Bear Pride flag.&lt;ref name="lambda.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm | title=Symbols of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Movements. | publisher=Lambda.org | accessdate=26 December 2004 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204072030/http://www.lambda.org/symbols.htm | archive-date=4 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lambda symbol was originally adopted by Gay Activists Alliance of New York in 1970 after they broke away from the larger Gay Liberation Front. Lambda was chosen because people might confuse it for a college symbol and not recognize it as a gay community symbol unless one was actually involved in the community. "Back in December of 1974, the lambda was officially declared the international symbol for gay and lesbian rights by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland."&lt;ref name="lambda.org"/&gt;

The triangle became a symbol for the gay community after the [[Holocaust]]. Not only did it represent Jews, but homosexuals who were killed because of German law. During the Holocaust, homosexuals were labeled with pink triangles to distinguish between them, Jews, regular prisoners, and political prisoners. The black triangle is similarly a symbol for females only to represent lesbian sisterhood.
[[File:Pink triangle jew.svg|thumb|Pink and yellow triangles were utilized to label Jewish homosexuals during the Holocaust.]]
The pink and yellow triangle was used to label Jewish homosexuals.
Gender symbols have a much longer list of variations of homosexual or bisexual relationships which are clearly recognizable but may not be as popularly seen as the other symbols. Other symbols that relate to the gay community or gay pride include the gay-teen suicide awareness ribbon, AIDS awareness ribbon, labrys, and purple rhinoceros.

In the fall of 1995, the Human Rights Campaign adopted a logo (yellow equal sign on deep blue square) that has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The logo can be spotted the world over and has become synonymous with the fight for equal rights for LGBT people.

One of the most notable recent changes was made in Philadelphia, PA on June 8, 2017. They added two new stripes to the traditional LGBT+ flag, one black and one brown. These were intended to highlight members of color within the LGBTQIA community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.phillymag.com/g-philly/2017/06/08/philly-pride-flag-black-brown/|title=Philly's Pride Flag to Get Two New Stripes: Black and Brown|date=2017-06-08|work=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LGBT community represented by a social component of the global community that is believed by many, including heterosexual allies, to be underrepresented in the area of [[civil rights]]. The current struggle of the gay community has been largely brought about by globalization. In the United States, [[World War II]] brought together many closeted rural men from around the nation and exposed them to more progressive attitudes in parts of Europe. Upon returning home after the war, many of these men decided to band together in cities rather than return to their small towns. Fledgling communities would soon become political in the beginning of the [[gay rights]] movement, including monumental incidents at places like [[Stonewall Inn|Stonewall]]. Today, many large cities have gay and lesbian community centers. Many universities and colleges across the world have support centers for LGBT students. The [[Human Rights Campaign]],&lt;ref name="HRC | What We Do"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/about_us/what_we_do.asp |title=What We Do |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731083704/http://www.hrc.org/about_us/what_we_do.asp |archivedate=2012-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lambda Legal]], the [[Empowering Spirits Foundation]],&lt;ref name="WiserEarth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiserearth.org/organization/view/c169c5a5c09f75d33327e1e86832df97 |title=Wiser Earth Organizations: Empowering Spirits Foundation |publisher=Wiserearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GLAAD]]&lt;ref&gt;GLAAD: [http://www.glaad.org/about/index.php "About GLAAD"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426130947/http://www.glaad.org/about/index.php |date=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; advocate for LGBT people on a wide range of issues in the United States. There is also an [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]]. In 1947, when the United Kingdom adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), LGBT activists clung to its concept of equal, inalienable rights for all people, regardless of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. The declaration does not specifically mention gay rights, but discusses equality and freedom from discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International USA. Human Rights and the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People.  2009.  {{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/lgbt-human-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights/page.do?id=1106573 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712090630/http://www.amnestyusa.org/lgbt-human-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights/page.do?id=1106573 |archivedate=2010-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Clark Polak joined The [[Janus Society]] in Philadelphia, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America.|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3403600387/polak-clark.html|website=Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a year after, he became president.  In 1968, he announced that the Society would be changing their name to Homosexual Law Reform Society; “Homosexuals are now willing to fly under their own colors” (Stewart, 1968).

===Same-sex marriage===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage}}
In parts of the world, partnership rights or [[marriage]] have been extended to same-sex couples. Advocates of same-sex marriage cite a range of benefits that are denied to people who cannot marry, including immigration, health care, inheritance and property rights, and other family obligations and protections, as reasons why marriage should be extended to same-sex couples. Opponents of same-sex marriage within the gay community argue that fighting to achieve these benefits by means of extending marriage rights to same-sex couples privatizes benefits (e.g., health care) that should be made available to people regardless of their relationship status. They further argue that the same-sex marriage movement within the gay community discriminates against families that are composed of three or more intimate partners. Opposition to the same-sex marriage movement from within the gay community should not be confused with opposition from outside that community.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Media==
{{main|Media portrayal of LGBT people}}
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
{{Editorial|date=January 2011}}
The contemporary lesbian and gay community has a growing and complex place in the American &amp; Western European media. Lesbians and [[gay men]] are often portrayed inaccurately in television, films, and other media. The gay community is often portrayed as many [[stereotypes]], such as gay men being portrayed as flamboyant and bold. Like other minority groups, these caricatures are intended to ridicule this marginalized group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raley|first1=Amber B.|last2=Lucas|first2=Jennifer L.|title=Stereotype or Success? Prime-time television's portrayals of gay male, lesbian, and bisexual characters|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=October 2006|volume=51|issue=2|pages=19–38|doi=10.1300/J082v51n02_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently a widespread ban of references in child-related entertainment, and when references do occur, they almost invariably generate controversy. In 1997, when American comedian [[Ellen DeGeneres]] [[Coming out|came out]] of the [[closeted|closet]] on her popular sitcom, many sponsors, such as the [[Wendy's]] fast food chain, pulled their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gomestic.  2009.  Stanza Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a portion of the media has attempted to make the gay community included and publicly accepted with television shows such as ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' or ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]''. This increased publicity reflects the [[Coming out]] movement of the LGBT community. As more celebrities came out, more shows developed, such as the 2004 show ''[[The L Word]]''. These depictions of the LGBT community have been controversial, but beneficial for the community. The increase in visibility of LGBT people allowed for the LGBT community to unite to organize and demand change, and it has also inspired many LGBT people to come out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gross|first1=Larry P.|title=Up from Invisibility: Lesbians, Gay Men, and the Media in America|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231119535|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Kc46h0Nu6IC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;q=medias%20protrayal%20of%20gays%20and%20lesbians|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, gay people are frequently used as a symbol of social [[decadence]] by celebrity evangelists and by organizations such as [[Focus on the Family]]. Many LGBT organizations exist to represent and defend the gay community. For example, the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] in the United States and [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]] in the UK work with the media to help portray fair and accurate images of the gay community.

As companies are advertising more and more to the gay community, LGBT activists are using ad slogans to promote gay community views. [[Subaru]] marketed its Forester and Outback with the slogan "It's Not a Choice. It's the Way We're Built", which was later used in eight U.S. cities on streets or in gay rights events.&lt;ref&gt;Fetto, John.  In Broad Daylight – Marketing to the gay community – Brief Article.  BNet.  Feb. 2001.  {{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4021/is_ISSN_0163-4089/ai_75171025/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016142008/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4021/is_ISSN_0163-4089/ai_75171025/ |archivedate=2015-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buying power==
{{main|Pink money}}

According to [[Witeck-Combs Communications, Inc.]] and Marketresearch.com, the 2006 buying power of U.S. gays and lesbians was approximately $660 billion and was then expected to exceed $835 billion by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;PRNewswire. "Buying Power of US Gays and Lesbians to Exceed $835 Billion by 2011". January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Headlines later stated "Gay Buying Power to hit $2 trillion by 2012".&lt;ref name="rawstory.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Gay_buying_power_to_hit_1_0626.html |title=The Raw Story. Yahoo. June 26, 2006 |publisher=Rawstory.com |date=2006-06-26 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay consumers can be very loyal to specific brands, wishing to support companies that support the gay community and also provide [[Social equality|equal rights]] for [[LGBT]] workers. In the UK, this buying power is sometimes abbreviated to "the [[pink pound]]". More and more [[Fortune 500]] companies are embracing LGBT/gay community consumers to include "domestic partner benefits, non-discrimination policies, and financial support for organizations working to promote equality."&lt;ref name="rawstory.com"/&gt;

According to an article by James Hipps, LGBT Americans are more likely to seek out companies that advertise to them and are willing to pay higher prices for premium products and services. This can be attributed to the median household income compared from same-sex couples to opposite-sex couples. "...studies show that GLBT Americans are twice as likely to have graduated from college, twice as likely to have an individual income over $60,000 and twice as likely to have a household income of $250,000 or more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hipps|first1=James|title=The Power of Gay: Buying Power That Is|url=http://www.gayagenda.com/2008/08/the-power-of-gay-buying-power-that-is|website=gayagenda.com|accessdate=5 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417135132/http://www.gayagenda.com/2008/08/the-power-of-gay-buying-power-that-is|archivedate=17 April 2010|date=24 August 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumerism===
Although many claim that the LGBT community is more affluent when compared to heterosexual consumers, research has proved that false.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Richard K. and Kelli Washington. 2014. "[http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e4814ec7-cc02-496e-b358-adbd000cb213%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4114 PART IX: SEGMENTATION: Chapter 60: GAY &amp; LESBIAN CONSUMERS]." Consumer Behavior. 326-333.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the LGBT community is still an important segment of consumer demographics because of the spending power and loyalty to brands that they have.&lt;ref name=Um&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Um |first1=Nam-Hyun |title=Seeking the holy grail through gay and lesbian consumers: An exploratory content analysis of ads with gay/lesbian-specific content |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |date=2012 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=133–149 |doi=10.1080/13527266.2010.489696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witeck-Combs Communications calculated the adult LGBT buying power at $830 billion for 2013.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Same-sex partnered households spend slightly more than the average household on any given shopping trip.&lt;ref name=Soat&gt;Soat, Molly. 2013. "[http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c9163a92-4133-40a8-97c1-0204940392ad%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=107 Demographics in the Modern Day]." Marketing News, 47 (9). 1p.&lt;/ref&gt; But, they also make more shopping trips compared to non-LGBT households.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; On average, the difference in spending with same-sex partnered households is 25% higher than the average U.S. household.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; According to the University of Maryland gay male partners earn $10,000 less on average compared to heterosexual men.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; However, partnered lesbians receive about $7,000 more a year than heterosexual married women.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Hence, same-sex partners and heterosexual partners are about equal with respect to consumer affluence.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

The LGBT community has been recognized for being one of the largest consumers in travel. Travel includes annual trips, and sometimes even multiple annual trips. Annually, the LGBT community spends around $65 billion on travel, totaling to 10% of the U.S. travel market.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Many common travel factors play into LGBT travel decisions, but if there is a destination that is especially tailored to the LGBT community, then they are more likely to travel to those places.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

===Demographics===
In a survey conducted in 2012, younger Americans are more likely to identify as LGBT.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; Statistics continue to decrease with age, as adults between ages 18–29 are three times more likely to identify as LGBT than seniors older than 65.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; These statistics for the LGBT community are taken into account just as they are with other demographics, in order to find trend patterns for specific products.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Consumers who identify as LGBT are more likely to regularly engage in various activities as opposed to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; According to Community Marketing, Inc., 90% of lesbians and 88% of gay men will dine out with friends regularly. And similarly, 31% of lesbians and 50% of gay men will visit a club or a bar.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

And at home, the likelihood of LGBT women having children at home as non-LGBT women is equal.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; However, LGBT men are half as likely when compared with non-LGBT men to have children at home.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; Household incomes for sixteen percent of LGBT Americans ranges above $90,000 per year, in comparison with 21% of the overall adult population.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; However, a key difference is that those who identify as LGBT have collectively fewer children in comparison to heterosexual partners.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Another factor at hand, is that LGBT populations of color continue to face income barriers along with the rest of the race issues, so they will expectedly earn less and not be as affluent as predicted.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

An analysis of a Gallup survey shows detailed estimates that - during the years 2012 through 2014 - the metropolitan area with the highest percentage of LGBT community is San Francisco, CA. The next highest are Portland, OR, and Austin, TX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/182051/san-francisco-metro-area-ranks-highest-lgbt-percentage.aspx|title=San Francisco Metro Area Ranks Highest in LGBT Percentage|author=Gallup, Inc.|date=|work=Gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
Marketing towards the LGBT community was not always a strategy among advertisers. Over the course of the last three to four decades, Corporate America has created a market niche for the LGBT community. Three distinct phases define the marketing turnover: 1) shunning in the 1980s, 2) curiosity and fear in the 1990s, and 3) pursuit in the 2000s.&lt;ref name=Oakenfull&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oakenfull |first1=Gillian |title=Gay Consumers and Brand Usage: The Gender-Flexing Role of Gay Identity |journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing |date=2012 |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=968–979 |doi=10.1002/mar.20578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just recently, marketers have picked up the LGBT demographic. With a spike in same-sex marriage in 2014, marketers are figuring out new ways to tie in a person's sexual orientation to a product being sold.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; In efforts to attract members of the LGBT community to their products, market researchers are developing marketing methods that reach these new families.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; Advertising history has shown that when marketing to the family, it was always the wife, the husband, and the children.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; But today, that is not necessarily the case. There could be families of two fathers or two mothers with one child or six children. Breaking away from the traditional family setting, marketing researchers notice the need to recognize these different family configurations.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt;

One area that marketers are subject to fall under is stereotyping the LGBT community. When marketing towards the community, they may corner their target audience into an "alternative" lifestyle category that ultimately "others" the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; Sensitivity is of importance when marketing towards the community. When marketing towards the LGBT community, advertisers respect the same boundaries.

Marketers also refer to LGBT as a single characteristic that makes an individual.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; There are other areas that can be targeted along with the LGBT segment such as race, age, culture, and income levels.&lt;ref name=Soat/&gt; Having knowledge of the consumer gives these marketers power.

Along with attempts to engage with the LGBT community, researchers have found gender disagreements among products with respective consumers.&lt;ref name=Oakenfull/&gt; For instance, a gay male may want a more feminine product, whereas a lesbian female may be interested in a more masculine product. This does not hold true for the entire LGBT community, but the possibilities of these differences are far greater.&lt;ref name=Oakenfull/&gt; In the past, gender was seen as fixed, and a congruent representation of an individual's sex. It is understood now that there is fluidity among sex and gender separately. Researchers also noted that when evaluating products, a person's biological sex is as equal of a determinant as his or her own self-concept.&lt;ref name=Oakenfull/&gt; As a customer response, when the advertisement is directed towards them, gay men and women are more likely to have interest in the product.&lt;ref name=Um/&gt; This is an important factor and goal for marketers because it indicates future loyalty to the product or brand.&lt;ref name=Um/&gt;

===Discrimination and mental health===
{{see also|Discrimination against homosexuals}}
In a 2001 study that examined possible root causes of [[Mental illness|mental disorders]] in [[lesbian]], [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] people, Cochran and psychologist Vickie M. Mays, of the [[University of California]], explored whether ongoing discrimination fuels [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other stress-related mental health problems among LGB people.&lt;ref name="LGB study"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mays |first1=Vickie M. |last2=Cochran |first2=Susan D. |title=Mental Health Correlates of Perceived Discrimination Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in the United States |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=2001 |volume=91 |issue=11 |pages=1869–1876 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.91.11.1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found strong evidence of a relationship between the two.&lt;ref name="LGB study"/&gt; The team compared how 74 LGB and 2,844 heterosexual respondents rated lifetime and daily experiences with discrimination such as not being hired for a job or being denied a bank loan, as well as feelings of perceived discrimination.&lt;ref name="LGB study"/&gt; LGB respondents reported higher rates of perceived discrimination than heterosexuals in every category related to discrimination, the team found.&lt;ref name="LGB study"/&gt; However, while gay youth are considered to be at higher risk for suicide, a literature review published in the journal ''Adolescence'' states, "Being gay in-and-of-itself is not the cause of the increase in suicide." Rather the review notes that the findings of previous studies suggested the,"...suicide attempts were significantly associated with psychosocial stressors, including gender nonconformity, early awareness of being gay, victimization, lack of support, school dropout, family problems, acquaintances' suicide attempts, homelessness, substance abuse, and other psychiatric disorders. Some of these stressors are also experienced by heterosexual adolescents, but they have been shown to be more prevalent among gay adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitts|first1= R.| title= Gay adolescents and suicide: understanding the association|journal= Adolescence|volume= 40|issue=159|pages= 621–628|date= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT multiculturalism==

===General===
LGBT multiculturalism is the diversity within the [[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]]) community as a representation of different [[sexual orientation]]s, [[Gender identity|gender identities]]—as well as different ethnic, language, religious groups within the LGBT community. At the same time as LGBT and multiculturalism relation, we may consider the inclusion of LGBT community into a larger multicultural model, as for example in universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dso.ufl.edu/multicultural/lgbt/ LGBT Affairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513052428/https://www.dso.ufl.edu/multicultural/lgbt/ |date=2014-05-13 }}, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; such multicultural model includes the LGBT community together and equal representation with other large minority groups such as [[African American]]s in the [[United States]].

The two movements have much in common politically. Both are concerned with tolerance for real differences, diversity, minority status, and the invalidity of value judgments applied to different ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;John Corvino, [http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3038586 "The Race Analogy"], ''The [[Huffington Post]]'', accessed Saturday 11 April 2015, 10:39 (GMT)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Craig J. |last1=Konnoth|url= http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/created-in-its-image-the-race-analogy-gay-identity-and-gay-litigation-in-the-1950s-1970s |title=Created in Its Image: The Race Analogy, Gay Identity, and Gay Litigation in the 1950s-1970s|journal=The Yale Law Journal|accessdate= 11 April 2015|volume=119|issue=2|pages=316–372|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have identified the emergence of gay and lesbian communities during several progressive time periods across the world including: the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and modern Westernization.&lt;ref name=Aldrich&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aldrich |first1=Robert |title=Homosexuality and the City: An Historical Overview |journal=Urban Studies |date=2004 |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1719–1737 |doi=10.1080/0042098042000243129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on geographic location, some of these communities experienced more opposition to their existence than others; nonetheless, they began to permeate society both socially and politically.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt;

===European cities past and present===
City spaces in Early Modern Europe were host to a wealth of gay activity; however, these scenes remained semi-secretive for a long period of time.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Dating back to the 1500s, city conditions such as apprenticeship labor relations and living arrangements, abundant student and artist activity, and hegemonic norms surrounding female societal status were typical in Venice and Florence, Italy.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Under these circumstances, many open minded young people were attracted to these city settings.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Consequently, an abundance of same-sex interactions began to take place.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Many of the connections formed then often led to the occurrence of casual romantic and sexual relationships, the prevalence of which increased quite rapidly over time until a point at which they became a subculture and community of their own.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt;

Since the 1700s, Paris has been known as a gay capital.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Literature and ballroom culture gradually made their way onto the scene and became integrated despite transgressive societal views.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Perhaps the most well-known of these are the balls of [[Magic-City]]. Amsterdam and London have also been recognized as leading locations for LGBT community establishment.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; By the 1950s, these urban spaces were booming with gay venues such as bars and public saunas where community members could come together.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; Paris and London were particularly attracting to the lesbian population as platforms for not only socialization, but education as well.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt; A few other urban occasions that are important to the LGBT community include Carnival in Rio de Jeneiro, Brazil, [[Sydney Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] in Sydney, Australia, as well as the various other [[pride parade]]s hosted in bigger cities around the world.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt;

===Urban spaces in America===
In the same way in which LGBT people used the city backdrop to join together socially, they were able to join forces politically as well. This new sense of collectivity provided somewhat of a safety net for individuals when voicing their demands for equal rights.&lt;ref name=Doderer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doderer |first1=Yvonne P. |title=LGBTQs in the City, Queering Urban Space |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=431–436 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2010.01030.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States specifically, several key political events have taken place in urban contexts. Some of these include, but are not limited to:

'''Independence Hall, Philadelphia''' - gay and lesbian protest movement in 1965
*Activists led by [[Barbara Gittings]] started some of the first picket lines here. These protests continued on and off until 1969.&lt;ref name=Polly&gt;Polly, J. (2009). Top 10 Historic Gay Places in the U.S. Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide, 16(4), 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Gittings went on to run the Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association for 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goulart|first1=Karen M.|title=Library opens Gittings Collection|accessdate=|issue=A1, A23, A24|publisher=Philadelphia Gay News|date=8 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Inn]], New York City''' - birthplace of the modern gay rights movement in 1969
*For the first time, a group of gay men and drag queens fought back against police during a raid on this small bar in Greenwich Village. The place is now a national historic landmark.&lt;ref name=Polly /&gt;

'''[[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro Street]], San Francisco''' - mecca for LGBTQ folks since the 1970s
*Almost of equal importance as Christopher Street (site of Stonewall Riot) when it comes to historic landmarks, this urban spot was an oasis of hopefulness. Home to the first openly gay elected official [[Harvey Milk]] and the legendary [[Castro Theater]], this cityscape remains iconic to the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=Polly /&gt;

'''Cambridge City Hall, Massachusetts''' - site of the first same-sex marriage in U.S. history in 2004
*In the years following this event, attempts by religious groups in the area to ban it have been stifled and many more states have joined the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=Polly /&gt;

'''AIDs Activities Coordinating Office, Philadelphia''' - an office to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDs
*An office that's goal is to provide proper administrative components, direct assistance, and education on HIV/AIDs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor's Commission on Sexual Minorities Fiscal Year 1988 Recommendations Pertaining to AIDS|accessdate=|agency=Special Collections Research Center, Temple University Libraries|publisher=City of Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and following these events, LGBT community subculture began to grow and stabilize into a nationwide phenomenon.&lt;ref name=DEmilio&gt;D'Emilio, J. (1998). CHAPTER 13: Capitalism and Gay Identity. In , Culture, Society &amp; Sexuality (pp. 239-247). Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay bars became more and more popular in large cities.&lt;ref name=DEmilio /&gt; For gays particularly, increasing numbers of cruising areas, public bath houses, and YMCAs in these urban spaces continued to welcome them to experience a more liberated way of living.&lt;ref name=DEmilio /&gt; For lesbians, this led to the formation of literary societies, private social clubs, and same-sex housing.&lt;ref name=DEmilio /&gt; The core of this community-building took place in New York City and San Francisco, but cities like St. Louis, Lafayette Park in WA, and Chicago quickly followed suit.&lt;ref name=DEmilio /&gt;

===City===
Cities afford a host of prime conditions that allow for better individual development as well as collective movement that are not otherwise available in rural spaces.&lt;ref name=Doderer /&gt; First and foremost, urban landscapes offer LGBTs better prospects to meet other LGBTs and form networks and relationships.&lt;ref name=Doderer /&gt; One ideal platform within this framework was the free labor market of many capitalistic societies which enticed people to break away from their often damaging traditional nuclear families in order to pursue employment in bigger cities.&lt;ref name=DEmilio /&gt; Making the move to these spaces afforded them new liberty in the realms of sexuality, identity, and also kinship.&lt;ref name=Doderer /&gt; Some researchers describe this as a phase of resistance against the confining expectations of normativity.&lt;ref name=Doderer /&gt; Urban LGBTs demonstrated this push back through various outlets including their style of dress, the way they talked and carried themselves, and how they chose to build community.&lt;ref name=Doderer /&gt; From a social science perspective, the relationship between the city and LGBT community is not a one-way street. LGBTs give back as much, if not more, in terms of economic contributions (i.e. "[[pink money]]"), activism and politics too.&lt;ref name=Aldrich /&gt;

{{Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
{{LGBT rights}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' people in [[Saudi Arabia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents, and Saudi Arabia is considered to have one of the worst LGBT rights records in the world. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal. LGBT rights are not recognized by the government of [[Saudi Arabia]].  The Saudi social mores and laws are heavily influenced by Arab tribal customs and ultra-conservative [[Wahhabi Islam]]. Homosexuality and being transgender are widely seen as immoral and indecent activities, and the law punishes acts of  [[homosexuality]] or [[cross-dressing]] with punishments ranging from fines, floggings, to life in prison, death, and torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/27/gay-relationships-still-criminalised-countries-report|title=Gay relationships are still criminalised in 72 countries.|last=|first=|date=27 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==

===Criminal laws===
Saudi Arabia has no criminal code. Traditionally, the [[legal system of Saudi Arabia]] has consisted of royal decrees and the legal rulings of Islamic judges and clerics, and is not based on legal codes and written law. Much subsequent written law has focused on business and foreign relations. Reformers have often called for codified laws to be instituted, and there appears to be a trend in the country to codify, publish and even translate some Saudi criminal and civil laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudilaws.net/ |title=Saudi Laws Encyclopedia |publisher=Saudilaws.net |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726034735/http://www.saudilaws.net/ |archivedate=26 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the Saudi judicial board advised Islamic judges to look for guidance in two books by the Hanbalite jurist Marʿī ibn Yūsuf al-Karmī al-Maqdisī (d.1033/1624). ''Liwat'' ([[sodomy]]) is to be 

&lt;blockquote&gt;treated like [[fornication]], and must be punished in the same manner. If ''muḥṣan'' [commonly translated as "adulterer" but technically meaning someone who has had legal intercourse, but who may or may not currently be married] and free [not a slave], one must be stoned to death, while a free bachelor must be punished with 100 lashes and banished for a year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sodomy is proven either by the perpetrator confessing four times or by the testimony of four trustworthy Muslim men, who were eyewitnesses to the act. If there are fewer than four witnesses, or if one is not upstanding, then they are all to be chastised with 80 lashes for slander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2005/December/Homosexuality/index.html |title=Keyan Keihani, A Brief History of Male Homosexuality in the Qur'an, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Arab-Islamic Culture |publisher=iranian.com |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Saudi King Khaled issued numerous royal decrees designed to secure support among religious fundamentalists in the aftermath of an uprising of religious extremists in 1979, known as the [[Grand Mosque seizure]].

The "Rules of Apprehension, Temporary Custody &amp; Precautionary Detention Regulation" codified the criminal code on homosexuality by listing it among the crimes that warranted arrest and detention. In addition to law enforcement, a second royal decree formally established the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]] (CPVPV) and gave this committee the power to arrest and detain people who violate the traditional teaches of Islam, including acts of homosexuality and cross-dressing.

Combating homosexuality remains one of the major goals of the CPVPV, along with its campaign against the consumption of alcohol and the practice of magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2010040668546&amp;archiveissuedate=06/04/2010 |title=Segregation of sexes: Hai'a chief stands by his comment |publisher=Saudi Gazette |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302081224/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2010040668546&amp;archiveissuedate=06%2F04%2F2010 |archivedate= 2 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal procedure==

===Cases===

In 2000 the Saudi government reported that it had sentenced nine Saudi men to extensive prison terms with lashing for engaging in [[cross-dressing]] and homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/saudi_arabia/saudinews02.htm |title=Sodomylaws.Org |publisher=SodomyLaws.Org |date= |access-date=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the government executed three Yemeni male workers for homosexuality and child molestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/saudi_arabia/saudinews06.htm |title=Sodomylaws.Org |publisher=SodomyLaws.Org |date= |access-date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Saudi government established formal criminal procedure rules, although many courts have been slow to adopt the rules.

In 2001, Saudi teacher and playwright [[Muhammad Al-Suhaimi]] was charged with promoting homosexuality and after a trial was sentenced to prison. In 2006, he was given a pardon and allowed to resume teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=75762&amp;d=4&amp;m=1&amp;y=2006 |title=Justice Served in Al-Suhaimi Case |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=4 January 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the government arrested 92 men for homosexuality, who were given sentences ranging from fines to prison sentences of several months and lashings. Likewise, on 7 November 2005 [[Riyadh]] police raided what the Saudi press called a "beauty contest for gay men" at [[al-Qatif]]. What became of the five men arrested for organizing the event is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/saudi/story/0,11599,1455792,00.html |title=Saudis' tough line on gays &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 9 April 2005|accessdate=10 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, [[United Kingdom|British]] human rights activists protested recent reports that the Saudi government was sending British mosques material urging the killing of gays and subjugation of women.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Persons caught living in the kingdom illegally are often accused of other crimes, involving illegal drugs, pornography, prostitution and homosexuality. Several such police crackdowns were reported in 2004–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=61828&amp;d=9&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005 |title=Busloads of Illegals Rounded Up in Riyadh Crime Swoop |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=9 April 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar raid in 2008 netted [[Filipino people|Filipino]] workers arrested on charges of alcohol and gay prostitution.&lt;ref name="arabnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=112657&amp;d=11&amp;m=8&amp;y=2008 |title=15 held on bootlegging, gay prostitution charges |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab News article on the arrests stated, "Gay rights are not recognized in the Middle East countries and the publication of any material promoting them is banned".&lt;ref name="arabnews1"/&gt;

International protests from human rights organizations prompted some Saudi officials within the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington D.C. to unofficially and incorrectly imply that their kingdom will only use the death penalty when someone has been convicted of child molestation, rape, sexual assault, murder or engaging in anything deemed to be a form of political advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/world/saudi_arabia/saudinews17.htm |title=Sodomylaws.Org |publisher=Sodomylaws.Org |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Prince [[Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasser Al Saud|Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir al Saud]] was charged with the murder of his male companion while on holiday in London. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to a long prison term. According to the prosecutor, the Prince sexually and physically abused his servant as well as paid other men for sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11571822 |title=Saudi prince found guilty of murdering servant in hotel |date=19 October 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saudi prince was subsequently transferred back to Saudi Arabia as part of a British-Saudi prisoner exchange deal

In 2011–2012 the Saudi newspaper ''Okaz'' announced that the government had arrested over 260 people for the crime of homosexuality over a one-year period. According to the official report, the men were caught cross-dressing, wearing ladies makeup and trying to pick up other men.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Stewart | first=Colin | title=Saudi Arabia: 260 arrests for homosexuality in 1 year | website=76 CRIMES | date=6 June 2012 | url=http://76crimes.com/2012/06/06/saudi-arabia-260-arrests-for-homosexuality-in-1-year/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this government crackdown on homosexuality, the CPVPV was permitted to make certain high-profile arrests.

In 2010, a 27-year-old Saudi man was sentenced to five years in prison, 500 lashes of the whip, and a SR50,000 fine after appearing in an amateur gay video online allegedly taken inside a Jeddah prison. According to an unnamed government source, "The District Court sentenced the accused in a homosexuality case that was referred to it by the CPVPV (the Hai'a) in Jeddah before he was tried for impersonating a security man and behaving shamefully and with conduct violating the Islamic teachings." The case started when the Hai'a's staff arrested the man under charges of practicing homosexuality. He was referred to the Bureau for Investigation and Prosecution, which referred him to the District Court.

Even government officials are not immune from criminal sanctions. A gay Saudi diplomat named Ali Ahmad Asseri applied for asylum in the United States after the Saudi government discovered his sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/15/local/la-me-saudi-gay-20100915 |title=Gay Saudi diplomat seeking asylum says 'they will kill me openly' |date=15 September 2010 |first=Alexandra |last=Zavis |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reports of people being executed for homosexuality often add other charges to the offense, typically theft, rape or murder. For example, a gay Yemeni was executed for homosexuality and murder in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/man-executed-and-crucified-male-rape-murder-and-theft-saudi-arabia150413|title=Man executed and crucified for male rape, murder and theft in Saudi Arabia|work=Gay Star News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian man was sentenced to three years detention and 450 lashes after a [[Medina]] court found him guilty of "promoting the vice and practice of homosexuality", after he was caught using Twitter to arrange dates with other men.&lt;ref name=twitter&gt;{{cite news|last1=SIMPSON|first1=JACK|title=Gay Saudi Arabian man sentenced to three years and 450 lashes for meeting men via Twitter|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gay-saudi-arabian-man-sentenced-to-three-years-and-450-lashes-for-meeting-men-via-twitter-9628204.html|access-date=3 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination and harassment===
Saudi Arabia has no laws against discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] or gender identity. Harassment or violence against LGBT people is not addressed in any bias motivated or hate crime law. Advocacy for LGBT rights is illegal within the kingdom.
The required exit and entry visa paperwork does not ask people about their sexual orientation, as it does their [[nationality]], [[sex]], religion and [[marital status]]. No [[same-sex marriage]], [[domestic partnership]] or [[civil union]] has any legal standing in the nation and may be used as evidence to initiate criminal proceedings.
In 2011, [[Mirel Radoi]], a Romanian football player who plays for the Saudi Alhilal Club, was fined 20,000 Saudi Riyals and suspended for two matches after calling a Saudi Arabian football player, [[Hussein Abdul Ghani]], who plays for Nasr Club, gay. The public comment, intended as an insult, was highly controversial and generated quite a bit of coverage in the Saudi press, including the refusal of Hussein Abdul Ghani to shake hands with Mirel Radoi after a later game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaymiddleeast.com/news/news%20293.htm |title=Shake hands, kiss and makeup? Not in Saudi Arabian football! |first=Dan |last=Littauer |date=27 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016032237/http://gaymiddleeast.com/news/news%20293.htm |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Gulf Cooperative Countries]], which Saudi Arabia is a member, announced plans to ban LGBT foreigners from entering Gulf countries. The ban would reportedly be enforced through some type of test.&lt;ref name="Lee 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lee | first=Steve | title=Gulf Cooperation Countries to test, detect then ban gays from entering their countries | website=LGBT Weekly | date=8 October 2013 | url=http://lgbtweekly.com/2013/10/08/gulf-cooperation-countries-to-test-detect-then-ban-gays-from-entering-their-countries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

Public education in Saudi Arabia is required to teach basic Islamic values based on interpretation of the Quran, which includes strong condemnation of homosexuality. In addition, Islam condemns cross-dressing. The Ministry Of Education approved textbooks that reflect the county's Islamic view against homosexual acts by stating that "[h]omosexuality is one of the most disgusting sins and greatest crimes", and that the proper punishment for the intentional act of homosexual intercourse in public is the capital punishment[Saudi Ministry of Education Textbooks for Islamic Studies: 2007-2008 Academic Year. Center for Religious Freedom of Hudson Institute]

In 2012, the Saudi government asked the CPVPV to assist in the expulsion of students who were judged, by their mannerisms and taste in fashion, to be gay or lesbian.&lt;ref name="HuffPost 2012"&gt;{{cite web | author=HuffPost | title=Saudi Arabia Bans Gays And Tom Boys From Schools | website=The Huffington Post | date=16 April 2012 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/saudi-arabia-bans-gays-tom-boys-schools_n_1428907.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private schools exist in Saudi Arabia, mainly to serve the needs of expatriates with children, and they are generally allowed more discretion in setting up their own school curriculum and policies. Unless a majority of the expatriate families are Muslim, the private school is likely to only teach the basic beliefs of Islam, through lessons about the culture, language and history of Saudi Arabia. Textbook content or policies regarding homosexuality or cross-dressing tends to be influenced by the prevailing attitudes of the expatriates and their country of origin.

=== Censorship===
{{main|Censorship in Saudi Arabia}}
The Saudi government censors the media with fines, imprisonment and, for foreigners, deportation for any person possessing, importing, distributing or producing media without governmental approval. Media content, including advertising, cannot be seen as insulting the royal family or conflicting with Islamic teachings and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/saudi.html |title=Human Rights Watch World Report 2001: Saudi Arabia: Human Rights Developments |publisher=Hrw.org |date=11 October 1999 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulting Saudi royalty could itself be an offense punishable by death.

Homosexuality and cross-dressing are dealt with in print news through news coverage of criminal matters, the [[HIV/AIDS]] pandemic or allusions to perceived Western [[decadence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemId=1228 |title=CREDO Action |publisher=Workingforchange.com |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001137/http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemId=1228|archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; No endorsement of [[LGBT]] rights is permitted.

Radio and TV programs are similarly banned from expressing support for LGBT rights, but homosexuality and cross-dressing can be discussed as long as the negative attitudes and biases are reinforced. A call-in TV show may feature a discussion about the immorality or "illness" of homosexuality, or, as in the case of [[Mirel Radoi]], coverage may focus on a celebrity, in this case a Romanian-born  football player, implying, as a false insult, that another football player was gay.

The government does not allow public movie theaters to exist, and permission to hold film festivals is rarely granted, but censored versions of films can be legally purchased in many retail stores. LGBT themes are generally one of the themes that is edited out of the movie. Customs agents keep a list of films or TV shows that are not allowed to be brought into the kingdom.

Government regulation of the Internet generally falls under the Royal Decrees On Anti-Cyber Crime (2007). Article 6 prohibits creating, distributing or accessing online content or webpages that the government deems to be [[pornographic]] or in violation of religious values or public morals or is a threat to public health, safety or order.&lt;ref name="WIPO 2007"&gt;{{cite web | title=Saudi Arabia: Anti-Cyber crime Law (promulgated by Royal Decree No. M/17 in 8 Rabi'I 1428 (March 26, 2007)) | website=WIPO | date=26 March 2007 | url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=328209 | accessdate=15 December 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi government has frequently blocked Internet users in the kingdom from accessing web pages or other online content that express support for LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaymiddleeast.com/news/article18.htm New Page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416162219/http://www.gaymiddleeast.com/news/article18.htm |date=16 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on the Internet extent to blogs, social media and video upload webpages.

In 2010, a twenty-seven-year-old Saudi man was charged with [[homosexuality]] and impersonating a police officer when he posted a comical video of himself online, where he discusses popular culture, shows off his chest hair and flirts with the camera man. He was sentenced to a year in prison, with 1,000 lashes, and ordered to pay a fine of 5,000 rials (US $1,333).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2010/03/17/saudi-arabia-1000-lashes-for-youtube-video/ |title=Saudi Arabia: 1,000 lashes for YouTube video |publisher=GlobalVoices |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=22 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and associations===
Clubs, charities and political associations require permission from the government to exist, which will not be given to any organization that supports LGBT rights or even seeks to act as a social club for the LGBT community.

==Living conditions==
The criminal penalties against homosexuality and cross-dressing are regularly and strictly enforced against Saudi citizens as well as expatriates working in the kingdom.

==Gender identity==

The Saudi government views cross-dressing and being transgender as being prohibited under [[Islamic jurisprudence]], and is therefore illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifge.org/news/1998/sept/nws9278.htm |title=GenderNews Posting of Sept 28 |publisher=Ifge.org |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal sanctions for cross-dressing tend to be the same for homosexuality, i.e. torture, whippings, fines, imprisonment, capital punishment, and, for foreigners, deportation.

The Saudi government does not permit sex change operations to occur in the kingdom, and it does not allow people to obtain new legal documents to have their gender changed on their documents. Much like with homosexuality, family members may feel obligated to kill an LGBT sibling or relative in order to "save face" or restore the family's honor and esteem within the community.

In 2017 two [[transgender]] Pakistanis were tortured to death by Saudi police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/transgender-pakistani-saudi-arabia-tortured-death-amna-meeno-11-custody-lgbt-rights-human-a7607446.html|title=Two transgender Pakistanis 'tortured to death' by police in Saudi Arabia|date=2 March 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a statement from the Saudi interior ministry said the reports were "totally wrong and nobody was tortured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-transgender/activists-say-two-pakistani-transgenderwomen-beaten-to-death-in-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN16D2GU|title=Saudi Arabia denies Pakistani reports transgender women killed by poli|date=7 March 2017|accessdate=17 December 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewkhalij.org/ar/node/61296|title="الداخلية" السعودية تنفي ضرب باكستانيتين من المتحولين جنسيا حتى الموت - الخليج الجديد|website=Thenewkhalij.org|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS==
By law, all Saudi citizens who are infected with HIV or AIDS are entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy and employment opportunities. The government has produced educational material on how the disease is spread and since the 1980s Abdullah al-Hokail, a Saudi doctor who specializes in the pandemic, has been allowed to air public service announcements on television about the disease and how it is spread.&lt;ref name="arabnews2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=89477&amp;d=3&amp;m=12&amp;y=2006 |title=AIDS Patients to Receive Free Treatment in Govt Hospitals |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515220536/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=89477&amp;d=3&amp;m=12&amp;y=2006 |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, ignorance, fear and prejudice are often directed at people living with the disease. While the government has designated several hospitals to treat those people infected with AIDS or HIV, other hospitals often refuse to care for such people or fail to treat them in a compassionate and humane manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poz.com/articles/saudi_hiv_discrimination_1_13767.shtml |title=POZ – POZ Magazine – POZ.com – Newsfeed : Reporting HIV-Related Discrimination in Saudi Arabia |publisher=POZ.com |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute government information about the disease because of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68051&amp;d=7&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 |title='Aids, What Aids?' |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=7 August 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[condom]]s are legal, but until recently, they were rarely available anywhere other than certain hospitals or medical supply stores.

===1990s===
In the late 1990s the Saudi government began to slowly step up a public education campaign about AIDS-HIV. It started to recognize [[World AIDS Day]], and the Arabic and English daily newspapers were permitted to run articles and opinions that expressed the need for more education about the disease and more compassion for those people infected. The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret, as the official policy was often that the disease was not a serious problem in a kingdom because Saudis followed the principles of traditional Islamic morality.

===2003===
In 2003 the government announced that it knew of 6,787 cases, and in 2004 the official number rose to 7,808. The government statistics claim that most of the registered cases are foreign males who contracted the disease through "forbidden" sexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aegis.com/news/ap/2004/AP041156.html |title=AEGiS-AP: AIDS Cases In Saudi Arabia Increases To 7,808 From 6,787 |publisher=Aegis.com |date=24 November 2004 |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234019/http://www.aegis.com/news/ap/2004/AP041156.html |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
In June 2006, the Ministry of Health publicly admitted that more than 10,000 Saudi citizens were either infected with HIV or had AIDS.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fattah |first=Hassan M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/world/middleeast/08saudi.html?ex=1312689600&amp;en=33be290edcfff957&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Saudi Arabia Begins to Face Hidden AIDS Problem – New York Times |location=Saudi Arabia |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006 the ''[[Arab News]]'' ran an editorial that called for greater public awareness of how the virus is spread and more compassion for those people infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=90516&amp;d=30&amp;m=12&amp;y=2006 |title=Editorial: Battle Against Prejudice |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=30 December 2006 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a Saudi citizen named [[Rami al-Harithi]] revealed that he had become infected with HIV while having surgery and has become an official proponent of education and showing compassion to those people infected.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"/&gt; Saudi [[Princess Alia bint Abdullah]] has been involved in the [[Saudi AIDS Society]], which was permitted in December 2006 to hold a public charity art auction followed by a discussion on how the disease was impacting the kingdom that included two Saudis living with HIV. The event was organized with the help of the Saudi National Program for Combating AIDS which is chaired by Dr. Sana Filimban.

===2007===
In January 2007 a Saudi economics professor at King Abdul Aziz University was permitted to conduct of survey of a handful of Saudi University students on their level of education about the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=90668&amp;d=6&amp;m=1&amp;y=2007 |title=Survey Provides Insight Into AIDS Awareness Among Youth |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the work on AIDS-HIV education has been supported by members of the Saudi royal family or medical doctors, there is an attempt to gain permission to create some independent AIDS societies, one of which is called [[Al-Husna Society]], that would work on helping people infected with the disease find employment, education families and work to fight the prejudice that faces people infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/27/africa/ME_GEN_Saudi_Facing_AIDS.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a government-funded&lt;ref name="USStateD_2002licence"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |vauthors= |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Saudi Arabia |work= |publisher=[[United States State Department]] |date=25 February 2009 |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/nea/119126.htm |doi= |accessdate=2011-03-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xSOsteh6?url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/nea/119126.htm |archivedate=25 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; organization, the [[National Society for Human Rights]], published a document suggesting ways to improve the treatment of people living with the disease. The proposed ''"Bill of Rights"'' document was criticized by [[Human Rights Watch]] for allegedly undermining human rights and global efforts to fight the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/24/saudia17158.htm |title=News &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreigners and HIV/AIDS===
Foreigners who are applying for a work visa are required to demonstrate that they are not infected with the virus before they can enter the country, and are required to get a test upon arrival at a  government accredited lab. To be issued  their first work permit, they are also required to perform the test again before the renewal of a residency or work permit. Any foreigner that is discovered to be infected will be deported to the country of origin as soon as they are deemed fit to travel. Foreigners are not given access to any HIV medications and while awaiting deportation may be segregated (imprisoned) from the rest of society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/GIS.Servlets.HTMLTemplate?tf=tgam/search/tgam/SearchFullStory.html&amp;cf=tgam/search/tgam/SearchFullStory.cfg&amp;configFileLoc=tgam/config&amp;encoded_keywords=saudi+arabia&amp;option=&amp;start_row=3&amp;current_row=3&amp;start_row_offset1=&amp;num_rows=1&amp;search_results_start=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925234159/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/GIS.Servlets.HTMLTemplate?tf=tgam%2Fsearch%2Ftgam%2FSearchFullStory.html|date=25 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Language of Love''''' ({{Lang-sv|Ur kärlekens språk}}) is a 1969 Swedish sex [[educational film]] directed by [[Torgny Wickman]]. It was an international success.

The film had two sequels, ''[[Mera ur kärlekens språk]]'' in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=4859 |title=Mera ur Kärlekens språk (1970) |work=[[Swedish Film Database]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kärlekens XYZ]]'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=4872 |title=Kärlekens XYZ (1971) |work=[[Swedish Film Database]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the three films were edited together into a new film, ''Det bästa ur Kärlekens språk-filmerna'' ("The Best from the ''Language of Love'' Films").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfi.se/sv/svensk-filmdatabas/Item/?type=MOVIE&amp;itemid=4909 |title=Det bästa ur Kärlekens språk-filmerna (1973) |work=[[Swedish Film Database]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mera ur kärlekens språk'' (''More from the Language of Love'') had equally successful box office though it dealt more with alternate sexuality and lifestyles and also with the disabled.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Remakes of the first two films appeared in 2004 (''[[Kärlekens språk]]'' a.k.a. ''Kärlekens språk 2000'') and in 2009 (''Mera ur kärlekens språk''), both directed by [[Anders Lennberg]].

The film included split screen visions of couples having sex with Ravel's Bolero playing in the background.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5981">The '''Children's Book Council of Australia Awards''' was started by the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] (CBCA) in 1946 with one category.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Book of the Year Awards |publisher=Children's Book Council of Australia |url=http://cbca.org.au/awardshistory.htm |accessdate=2011-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120234613/http://cbca.org.au/awardshistory.htm |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The awards have grown and now there are five categories in the ''Book of the Year Awards'' and numerous other awards presented annually by the National Office and CBCA branches in each State and Territory.

The winner of the inaugural award received a flower, "a camellia".&lt;ref name = "foundation"&gt;{{cite web |title= History of the Awards Foundation  |publisher= Children's Book Council of Australia |url= http://cbca.org.au/foundation.htm |accessdate= 2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times the awards have been funded through Government grants (1966–1988), and lately by individual and corporation donations and sponsorships. The CBCA decided in 1995 to establish an Award Foundation to secure the funding for these awards for the future.&lt;ref name = "foundation" /&gt;

== Children’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Awards ==

Five award categories are selected annually. They are:

* '''[[Children's Book of the Year Award: Older Readers|CBCA Book of the Year: Older Readers]]''' — for readers in their secondary years of schooling&lt;ref name="nodiff" /&gt;
* '''[[Children's Book of the Year Award: Younger Readers|CBCA Book of the Year: Younger Readers]]''' — for readers from the middle to upper primary years&lt;ref name="nodiff"&gt;Until 1982 there was no division between ''Older'' and ''Younger Readers''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Children's Book of the Year Award: Early Childhood|CBCA Book of the Year: Early Childhood]]''' — for children who are at pre-reading or early stages of reading&lt;ref&gt;The ''Early Childhood Award'' was introduced in 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Children's Book of the Year Award: Picture Book|CBCA Book of the Year: Picture Book]]''' — for outstanding books of the Picture Book genre&lt;ref&gt;The ''Picture Book Award'' was established as a separate award in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Children's Book of the Year Award: Eve Pownall Award for Information Books|Eve Pownall Award for Information Books]]''' — for books that document factual material&lt;ref&gt;The ''Eve Pownall Award for Information Books'' was presented by Eve Pownall's family in 1988, then by the Children's Book Council from 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australian Children's Choice Awards ==

The CBCA Book of the Year awards are a literary award. Recognising that children themselves may have differing opinions on the books, the CBCA support several awards which seek to poll the views of children themselves.

* '''[[BILBY Award|Books I Love Best Yearly]]''' (BILBY Awards) — CBCA Queensland Branch.&lt;ref&gt;http://qld.cbca.org.au/bilby.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[COOL Award|Canberra’s Own Outstanding List]]''' (COOL Awards) — Libraries ACT have been convening the COOL Awards since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.act.gov.au/library_services/kids/cool_awards&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kanga''' (previously CROW Awards) — The CROW Award (Children Reading Outstanding Writers) was a South Australian popular choice award. After 1998 it went into recess, in 2003 it was briefly resurrected as the Kanga Awards by a consortium of bookshops, government and enthusiast bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latrobe.edu.au/childlit/Awards/CROW-KANGA.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Kids Own Australian Literature Awards''' (KOALA) — The KOALA Awards for NSW children are managed by a volunteer committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koalansw.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kids' Reading Oz Choice''' (KROC Awards) — Managed by the City of Darwin Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darwin.nt.gov.au/libraries/programs-and-services/young-people/kroc-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''West Australian Young Readers' Book Awards''' (WAYRBA) — Was started by members of the CBCA Western Australia Branch, but is now run by a separate committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://wayrba.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Young Australian Best Book Awards''' (YABBA) — The YABBA Awards is operated and managed by a volunteer committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://yabba.org.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Masurian ethnolect''' (Masurian: ''Mazurská gádkä''; {{lang-pl|Mazurski}}; {{lang-de|Masurisch}}), according to some linguists, is a dialect group of the [[Polish language]]; others consider Masurian as a separate language, spoken by [[Masurians]] in a part of [[East Prussia]] that is now in [[Poland]].

== History ==
Since the 14th century, some settlers from [[Masovia]] started to settle in southern [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], which had been devastated by the crusades of the [[Teutonic Knights]] against the native [[Old Prussians]]. According to other sources, people from Masovia did not move to southern Prussia until the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], Prussia having become [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] in 1525. The Masurians were mostly of the Protestant faith, in contrast to the neighboring [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] people of the [[Duchy of Masovia]], which was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Polish kingdom]] in 1526. A new dialect developed in Prussia, isolated from the remaining Polish language area. The Masurian dialect group has many [[Low Saxon language|Low Saxon]], [[German language|German]] and [[Old Prussian]] words mixed in with Polish-language endings.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;{{cite book|last=Braun|first=Hermann|authorlink=Herrmann Broun|title=Alte und neue Bilder aus Masuren: Eine Geschichte der Stadt und des Kreises Angerburg|year=1888/1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1870s, [[German Empire|Imperial German]] officials restricted the usage of languages other than German in Prussia's eastern provinces.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia 1600–1947|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard|location=Cambridge|pages=776|isbn=0-674-02385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While in 1880 Masurians were still treated as Poles by the German Empire, at the turn of century the German authorities undertook several measures to Germanise and separate them from the Polish nation by creating a separate identity.&lt;ref&gt;Becoming German: Lessons from the Past for the Present'' Brian McCook in Leitkultur and Nationalstolz-Tabu -German Phenomena? Bonn, April 2002 Alexander von Humboldt Foundation pages 33-42&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]] the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] was held on July 11, 1920 according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], in which the Masurians had to decide whether they wanted to be part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] or remain in German East Prussia; about 98% voted for Germany.

By the early 20th century, most Masurians were at least bilingual and could speak Low Saxon and German; in some areas about half of them still spoke Masurian, at least at home. In 1900, according to the German census there were 142,049 Masurians speaking Masurian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/fremdsprachen.html|title=Geschichte der fremdsprachigen Minderheiten in Deutschland 1871–1945|last=Rademacher|first=Michael|website=www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, only 40,869 people gave Masurian as their native language, many considering [[German language|German]] their first language, considering Masurian merely as their domestic [[dialect]], By the early 1920s there were also some Masurians who had their separate identity, claiming that Masurians are a nation. Most of them were members of ''[[Masurenbund]]''. Their main goal was to grant Masurians some minority laws inside Germany, but there were also some separatists. In the early 1930s, support for the [[Nazi Party]] was high in Masuria, especially in elections in 1932 and 1933. Nazi political rallies were organized in the Masurian dialect during the campaigning.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;

After 1933 the usage of the Masurian dialect was prohibited by the National Socialist authorities. By 1938 most Masurian place and personal names had been changed to "pure" German substitutes. From 1939 on it was forbidden to hold church services in Masurian.

The replacement of Masurian in favor of German was not completed by the time the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] conquered Masurian [[East Prussia]] in January 1945, in [[World War II]]. The territory was transferred to Poland according to the postwar [[Potsdam Conference]]. During the wartime fighting and post-war deportations in the subsequent decades, most Masurian-speakers left Masuria for western Germany, especially to post-war [[West Germany]], where they were quickly assimilated into the German mainstream.

== Situation in 21st century ==
According to some scientists like Andrzej Sakson, there are about 5,000 – 10,000 ethnic Masurians left in Poland. According to the Polish census from 2011 there are only 1,376 of them who identify themselves as Masurians. Most Masurians live in Germany now, but due to the German law the ethnicity and nationality are not determined in their census.

There is a lack of surveys on the knowledge of the ethnolect both in Poland and Germany, but there are mostly elders who can communicate in Masurian with some fluency. The sole group who speak Masurian on a daily basis are so called Russian Masurians, who are the descendants of colonists who arrived to [[Siberia]] at the end of the 19th century. They have lived in isolation from the other groups, thus they were neither Germanised, nor Polonised. Their speech acquired many Russian loanwords, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mojemazury.pl/291555,Mazurskie-wioski-na-Syberii.html#axzz4HgcwLQNw|title=Mazurskie wioski na Syberii|website=mojemazury.pl|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic features ==
* ''Mazurzenie'': the consonants corresponding to Standard Polish ''cz'', ''sz'', ''dż'', ''ż'' are pronounced ''c'', ''s'', ''dz'', ''z''
* Asynchronous pronunciation of soft labials ''b', p', f', w''' – ''bj''/''bź'', ''pj''/''pś'', ''fj''/''fś'', ''wj''/''wź''
* Sometimes, intensive palatalization of ''k'', ''g'', ''ch'' to ''ć'', ''dź'', ''ś'' (a similar process to the [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] palatalization)
* [[Labialization]] of the vowel ''o'' (sometimes also ''u'') in Anlaut
* Vowel ''y'' approaching ''i''
* Before  ''ł'' vowels ''i'' and ''y'' pronounced like ''u'', e.g. ''buł'', ''zuł'' (''był'', ''żył'')
* Denasalization of the [[nasal vowels]] ''ą'' and ''ę'' as ''o'' and ''e''
* In some varieties ''ę'' becomes ''ã'' (nasal ''a''), which is pronounced after denasalization ''an'', analogical changes for groups ''eN'', like. ''dzień'' – ''dzian''

== Dialects of Masurian ==
Masurian has three to five dialects:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pomazursku.pl/index.php/22-2/|title=Gwary mazurskie {{!}} Pomazursku.pl – mazurskie niejsce w jinternecÿe|website=pomazursku.pl|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ostróda dialect (Ostróda, Olsztynek) – Denasalization of the [[nasal vowels]] ''ą'' and ''ę'' as ''o'' and ''e'' – No ''Mazurzenie'' (the consonants corresponding to Standard Polish ''cz, sz, dż, ż'' are pronounced ''c, s, dz, z'') – Common ''á'' – [[Labialization]]  (''ô, û – uo, uu)'' – Before  ''ł'' vowels ''i'' and ''y'' pronounced like ''u'', e.g. ''buł'', ''zuł'' (''był'', ''żył'').
* West-Masurian dialect (Działdowo, Nidzica, Szczytno) – Irregularly occurring ''á'' and labialization – ''Mni''  where Polish ''mi'' ( ''mniasto, kamnień)'' – As in Ostróda district appear and have dominant position  ''psi, bzi, (w)zi, f(si)'' to ''pchi, bhI'' etc.  - Denasalization of the [[nasal vowels]] ''ą'' and ''ę'' as ''o'' and ''e.''
* Center-Masurian dialect (Giżycko, Mrągowo, Pisz, Biała Piska) – The most common intermediate ''á'' – The most common archaic  ''ř'' (in Polish sound as ''rż'') – Frequent labialization – Appear and have dominant position  ''pchi, bhI'' to ''psi, bzi'' etc.  - Dominate pronunciation ''ni'' instead of ''mni'' – ''niasto, kanień'' etc.  - Soft ''k, g, ch'' when is before ''a'' for example ''kia, gia, chia'' – Polish ''ą'' i ''ę'' like ''ón'', ''on'', ''én'', ''en.''
* East-Masurian dialect (Łek, Ôleck) – Polish  ''ś, ć, ź'' pronounced like ''sz'', ''cz'', ''ż'' (for example ''spacz'', ''bÿcz)'' – ''Á'' almost does not exist – Frequently  ''a'' is something between ''a'' and ''e'' (''ä – mätkiä'') – Synchronous pronunciation of soft labials ''b', p', f', w''' change to ''bj,'' ''pj,''  ''fj,'' ''wj'' – ''Ch''  change to ''ś'' (kosianÿ, siätä) – Less frequent ''é'' and ''ó.''
* North-Masurian dialect (Węgorzewo, Gołdap) – in the early 20th century almost disappeared, in the area Węgorzewa known for up to a few percent of the population (in the nineteenth century, more than half), in district of Gołdap 1% (in the nineteenth century, approx. 20%).  -  Very archaic sound for ''r'' – A relatively frequent ''á.''

Creating conditional, as in majority of slavic languages, one takes a verb and cuts the last part of verb which correspond for infinitive mode (for example verb terminations ''ač, eč&lt;u&gt;)&lt;/u&gt;'' and then we should add  the part that correspond for conditional mode. For example, "zna&lt;u&gt;č&lt;/u&gt;" (know) -&gt; zna&lt;u&gt;bÿ&lt;/u&gt;.

"Bÿ" in Masurian has also one more function, can be used making questions at the begging of some sentence or also can mean "whether", "or" and "if". For example, "Lejduje ni niénso/niéso, bÿ sźwÿnina, bÿ réntozina". Translation to Polish: "Lubię mięso, czy to wieprzowinę, czy wołowinę"

==Origin and definition==
The term "medium" (the singular form of "media") is defined as "one of the means or channels of general communication in society, as newspapers, radio, television etc."&lt;ref name="dict_thed"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The definition of medium | work = Dictionary.com | accessdate = 2015-08-10 | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/medium }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of human communication through designed channels, i.e. not [[Speech production|vocalization]] or gestures, dates back to ancient [[cave paintings]], drawn [[map]]s and [[writing]].

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (centred on present-day [[Iran]]) played an important role in the field of communication. It has the first real mail or [[postal system]], which is said to have been developed by the Persian emperor [[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 550 BC) after his conquest of [[Medes]]. The role of the system as an [[intelligence gathering]] apparatus is well documented, and the service was (later) called ''angariae'', a term that in time turned to indicate a [[tax system]].  The [[Old Testament]] ([[Esther]], VIII) makes mention of this system: [[Xerxes I|Ahasuerus]], king of Medes, used couriers for communicating his decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The word ''communication'' is derived from the [[Latin]] root ''communicare''. This was due to the [[Roman Empire]] also devising what might be described as a [[mail]] or postal system, in order to centralize control of the empire from [[Rome]]. This allowed for [[personal letter]]s and for Rome to gather knowledge about events in its many widespread provinces. More advanced postal systems later appeared in the Islamic [[Caliphate]] and the [[Mongol Empire]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

The term ''media'' in its modern application relating to communication channels is traced back to its first use as such by Canadian communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who stated in ''Counterblast'' (1954): "The media are not toys; they should not be in the hands of Mother Goose and Peter Pan executives. They can be entrusted only to new artists, because they are art forms." By the mid-1960s, the term had spread to general use in North America and the United Kingdom. (''Mass media'', in contrast, was, according to [[H.L. Mencken]], used as early as 1923 in the United States.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colombo's All-Time Great Canadian Quotations |date=1994 |first=John Robert |last=Colombo |publisher=Stoddart Publishing |isbn=0-7737-5639-6 |p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic media==
{{Main|Electronic media}}
In the last century, a revolution in [[telecommunications]] has greatly altered communication by providing new media for long distance communication. The [[Reginald Aubrey Fessenden|first transatlantic two-way radio broadcast]] occurred in 1906 and led to common communication via analog and digital media:
* [[analog signal|Analog]] telecommunications include some [[radio]] systems, historical [[telephony]] systems, and historical [[television]] broadcasts.
* [[Digital telecommunications]] allow for [[computer-mediated communication]], [[telegraphy]], and [[computer network]]s.
The difference between analog and digital photography is that digital photography is easier to edit and have a lot of choices after taking photos, but analog photography is more simple and you have to accept the photo if you don't like it. In digital photography you can edit the photo even before taking it, unlike analog which had limited amount of time.

Modern communication media now allow for intense long-distance exchanges between larger numbers of people ([[many-to-many]] communication via [[e-mail]], [[Internet forum]]s, and [[Telecommunications port|teleportation]]). On the other hand, many traditional [[broadcast]] media and mass media favor [[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]] communication (television, [[film|cinema]], radio, [[newspaper]], [[magazine]]s, and also [[social media]]).

Electronic media usage is growing, although concern has arisen that it distracts youth from face-to-face contact with friends and family. Research on the [[social engagement]] effect is mixed. One study by Wellman found that "33% of Internet users said that the Internet had improved their connections to friends 'a lot', and 23% said it had increased the quality of their communication with family members by a similar amount. Young people in particular took advantage of the social side of the Internet. Nearly half (49%) of the 18- to 29-year-olds said that the Internet had improved their connections to friends a lot. On the other hand, 19% of employed Internet users said that the Internet had increased the amount of time they spent working in home".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Leung, Lo, Xiong, &amp; Wu p.&amp;nbsp;377 &amp; 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic media now comes in the forms of tablets, laptops, desktops, cell phones, mp3 players, DVDs, game systems, radios, and television. Technology has spiked to record highs within the last decade, thus changing the dynamic of communication. The spike in electronic media really started to grow in 2007 when the release of the first iPhone came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Peter|title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update: Introducing the iPhone|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1054764/macworld-expo/liveupdate.html|website=Macworld|publisher=PCWorld|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning of electronic media, as it is known in various spheres, has changed with the passage of time. The term ''media'' has achieved a broader meaning nowadays as compared to that given it a decade ago. Earlier, there was multimedia, once only a piece of software (application software) used to play audio (sound) and video (visual object with or without sound). Following this, it was CD (Compact Disc) and DVD (Digital Versatile Disc), then camera of 3G (third generation) applications in the field.

In modern terms, the term "media" includes all the software which are used in PC (computer) or laptop or mobile phone installed for normal or better performance of the system; today, however, hard discs (used to increase the installation capacity of data) of computer are an example of electronic media. This type of hard disc is becoming increasingly smaller in size.

The latest inclusion in the field is magnetic media (magnetic stripe) whose application is common in the fastest growing information technology field. Modern day IT media is commonly used in the banking sector and by the Income Tax Department for the purpose of providing the easiest and fastest possible services to consumers. In this [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic strip]], account information linking to all the data relating to a particular consumer is stored. The main features of these types of media are prepared unrecorded (blank form), and data is normally stored at a later stage as per the requirement of its user or consumer.

==Social impact==
Media technology has made viewing increasingly easier as time has passed throughout history. Children today are encouraged to use media tools in school and are expected to have a general understanding of the various technologies available. The internet is arguably one of the most effective tools in media for communication tools such as [[e-mail]], [[Skype]], and [[Facebook]] have brought people closer together and created new [[online community|online communities]]. However, some may argue that certain types of media can hinder face-to-face. Therefore, it is an important source of communication.

In a large consumer-driven society, electronic media (such as television) and [[print media]] (such as newspapers) are important for distributing [[Advertisement#Media|advertisement media]]. More technologically advanced societies have access to goods and services through [[new media|newer media]] than less technologically advanced societies.
In addition to this "advertising" role, media is nowadays a tool to share knowledge all around the world. Analysing the evolution of medium within the society, Popkin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Journalism, Newspaper and newsheets|last = Popkin|first = Dewald|publisher = |year = 2004|isbn = |location = Europe 1450-1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; assesses the important role of media, by building [[media and politics|connection between politics]], culture and economic life and the society: for instance periodical newspaper has been an opportunity to first advertise and second to be up-to-date with current foreign affairs or the nation economic situation. In the mean time,  Willinsky&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Access Principle: The Case for Open Access to Research and Scholarship|last = Willinsky|first = Frank|publisher = |year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was promoting the role of modern technology as a way to come across cultural, gender, national barriers. He saw in internet an opportunity to establish a fair and equal system of knowledge: as internet may be accessible to anyone, any published information may be read and consulted by anyone. Therefore, internet is a sustainable solution to overcome the "gap" between developed and developing countries as both will get a chance to learn from each other. Canagarajah&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Internationalizing Knowledge Construction and Dissemination|last = Canagarajah|first = Suresh|date = 2010|journal = The Modern Language Journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2010.01105.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; is addressing the issue of unbalanced relations between the North and South countries, asserting that Western countries tend to impose their own ideas on developing countries.Therefore, internet is way to re-establish balance, by for instance enhance publication of newspaper, academic journal from developing countries. Christen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Does information really want to be free?|last = Christen|first = Kim|date = 2012|journal = International Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the one who created a system that provide access to knowledge and protect people's customs and culture. Indeed, in some traditional societies, some genders cannot have access to a certain type of knowledge therefore respecting these customs limit the scope of dissemination but still allow the diffusion of knowledge. Within this process of dissemination, media would play a role of "intermediaries", that is say translation an academic research into a journalistic format, accessible by lay audience ( Levin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = To know is not enough: research knowledge and its use|last = Levin|first = Ben|date = February 2013|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Consequently, media is a modern form of communication aiming at spreading knowledge within the whole world, regardless any form of discrimination.

Media, through media and [[Models of communication#Psychology of communication|communications psychology]], has helped to connect diverse people from far and near geographical location. It has also helped in the aspect of on-line or Internet businesses and other activities that have an on-line version. All media intended to affect human behavior is initiated through communication and the intended behavior is couched in psychology. Therefore, understanding media and communications psychology is fundamental in understanding the social and individual effects of media. The expanding field of media and communications psychology combines these established disciplines in a new way.

Timing change based on innovation and efficiency may not have a direct correlation with technology.  The [[information revolution]] is based on modern advancements.  During the 19th century, the information "boom" rapidly advanced because of postal systems, increase in newspaper accessibility, as well as schools "modernizing". These advancements were made due to the increase of people becoming literate and educated.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The methodology of communication although has changed and dispersed in numerous directions based on the source of its [[sociocultural]] impact. Biases in the media that affects religious or ethnic minorities takes the form of [[Racial bias in criminal news|racism in the media]] and [[Media bias#Religious bias|religious bias in the media]].

==Games as a medium for communication==
Games are a medium used to transfer messages. Apart from the usual graphic, auditory and narrative elements in video games, the game mechanics make it unique in the media field.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Following [[Marshal McLuhan]]'s quote "the medium is the message", Earnest Adams and Joris Dormans make a point in their book ''Game Mechanics: Advanced Game Design'' that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McLuhan |first=Marshal |date=June 25, 2012 |title= Game Mechanics: Advanced Game Design |url= https://www.amazon.com/Game-Mechanics-Advanced-Design-Voices/dp/0321820274 |location=US |publisher=New Riders |page=147 |isbn= 0321820274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=“To use a game to communicate, you don’t just produce a clever signal to convey your message. Instead, you construct a machine—the game’s mechanics—that produces the signal for you.” |author=Marshal Mcluhan }}
 
The players interact with the game and infer the message by observing the game's output. The game mechanics can discriminate against particular actions while encouraging others, thus leading the players to conclude that a certain behavior is more likely to produce the desired outcomes. Although this is commonly and successfully used for entertainment purposes it can also be used as a tool for public relations – for example as advergaming.}

Gamification has been used to communicate in other areas as well. The game design video lessons show [[Extra Credits]] has criticized China's [[Sesame Credit]] for gamifying the act of "being an obedient citizen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHcTKWiZ8sI |title=Propaganda Games: Sesame Credit - The True Danger of Gamification |work=[[Extra Credits]] |date=16 December 2015 |access-date=6 February 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using tools that are commonly used in games can incentivize a specific behavior to increase one's credit.

== Regulations ==
{{Main|Media independence}}
The role of [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] (license broadcaster institutions, content providers, platforms) and the resistance to political and commercial interference in the autonomy of the media sector are both considered as significant components of media independence. In order to ensure media independence, [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] should be placed outside of governments' directives. this can be measured through legislation, agency statutes and rules.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite report|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018 |last=|first= |publisher=UNESCO |year=2018 |isbn= |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government regulations ===

==== Licensing ====
The process of issuing licenses in many regions still lacks transparency and is considered to follow procedures that are obscure and concealing. In many countries, regulatory authorities stand accused of political bias in favor of the government and [[ruling party]], whereby some prospective broadcasters have been denied licenses or threatened with the withdrawal of licenses. In many countries, diversity of content and views have diminished as [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fostered directly or indirectly by States.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This not only impacts on [[competition]] but leads to a concentration of power with potentially excessive influence on [[public opinion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanretty, Chris. 2014. Media outlets and their moguls: Why concentrated individual or family ownership is bad for editorial independence. European Journal of Communication 29 (3): 335–350.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley et al. cite failure to renew or retain licenses for editorially critical media; folding the regulator into government ministries or reducing its competences and mandates for action; and lack of due process in the adoption of regulatory decisions, among others, as examples in which these regulators are formally compliant with sets of legal requirements on independence, but their main task in reality is seen to be that of enforcing [[political agenda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Steve, Kreszentia Duer, Toby Mendel, and Sean O. Siochru. 2008. Broadcasting, Voice, and Accountability : A Public Interest Approach to Policy, Law, and Regulation. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Government endorsed appointments ====
State control is also evident in the increasing politicization of regulatory bodies operationalized through transfers and appointments of party-aligned individuals  to senior positions in regulatory authorities.

==== Internet regulation ====
Governments worldwide have sought to extend regulation to internet companies, whether [[Internet providers|connectivity providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, and whether domestically or foreign-based. The impact on journalistic content can be severe, as internet companies can err too much on the side of caution and take down news reports, including algorithmically, while offering inadequate opportunities for redress to the affected news producers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Self-regulation ===

==== At the regional level ====
In [[Western Europe]], [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] provides an alternative to state regulatory authorities. In such contexts, [[newspaper]]s have historically been free of licensing and regulation, and there has been repeated pressure for them to self-regulate or at least to have in-house [[Ombudsman|ombudsmen]]. However, it has often been difficult to establish meaningful self-regulatory entities.

In many cases, self-regulations exists in the shadow of state regulation, and is conscious of the possibility of [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]]. In many countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], self-regulatory structures seems to be lacking or have not historically been perceived as efficient and effective.&lt;ref&gt;Fengler, Susanne, Tobias Eberwein, Salvador Alsius, Olivier Baisnée, Klaus Bichler, Boguslawa Dobek-Ostrowska, Huub Evers, et al. 2015. How effective is media self-regulation? Results from a comparative survey of European journalists. European Journal of Communication 30 (3): 249–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of satellite delivered channels, delivered directly to viewers, or through cable or online systems, renders much larger the sphere of unregulated programing. There are, however, varying efforts to regulate the access of [[programmer]]s to satellite transponders in parts of the [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]n region, the [[Arab world|Arab region]] and in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter was an example of efforts to bring formal standards and some regulatory authority to bear on what is transmitted, but it appears to not have been implemented.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite report |year=2014 |title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002270/227025e.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International organizations and NGO's ====
Self-regulation is expressed as a preferential system by journalists but also as a support for media freedom and development organizations by intergovernmental organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s. There has been a continued trend of establishing self-regulatory bodies, such as press councils, in conflict and post-conflict situations.

Major internet companies have responded to pressure by governments and the public by elaborating self-regulatory and complaints systems at the individual company level, using principles they have developed under the framework of the [[Global Network Initiative]]. The Global Network Initiative has grown to include several large telecom companies alongside internet companies such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and others, as well as [[Civil society|civil society organizations]] and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Global Network Initiative |date=March 28, 2017 |title=Global Network Initiative Adds Seven Companies in Milestone Expansion of Freedom of Expression and Privacy Initiative |url=https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/global-network-initiative-adds-seven-companies-in-milestone-expansion-of-freedom-of-expression-and-privacy-initiative/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]]’s 2013 publication, ICT Technology Sector Guide on Implementing the [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], impacts on the presence of independent journalism by defining the limits of what should or should not be carried and prioritized in the most popular digital spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=European Commission |author=Shift and Institute for Human Rights and Business |date=2013 |title=ICT Sector Guide on Implementing  the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights |url=https://www.ihrb.org/pdf/eu-sector-guidance/EC-Guides/ICT/EC-Guide_ICT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Private sector ====
[[File:RDR_indicator_scores_for_policy_transparency_in_regards_to_third-party_requests_for_content_or_account_restriction.png |thumb |upright=.9 |Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regards to third-party requests for content or account restriction]]
[[File:Ranking_Digital_Rights_2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regard to their terms of service enforcement (which impact upon content or account restrictions)]]
Public pressure on technology giants has motivated the development of new strategies aimed not only at identifying ‘[[fake news]]’, but also at eliminating some of the structural causes of their emergence and proliferation. Facebook has created new buttons for users to report content they believe is false, following previous strategies aimed at countering [[Online hate speech|hate speech and harassment online]]. These changes reflect broader transformations occurring among tech giants to increase their transparency. As indicated by the [[Open Technology Institute|Ranking Digital Rights]] Corporate Accountability Index, most large internet companies have reportedly become relatively more forthcoming in terms of their policies about transparency in regard to third party requests to remove or access content, especially in the case of requests from governments.&lt;ref name=RDR2015&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2015. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RDR2017&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, the study signaled a number of companies that have become more opaque when it comes to disclosing how they enforce their own terms of service, in restricting certain types of content and account.&lt;ref name=RDR2017/&gt;

==== Fact-checking and news literacy ====
In addition to responding to pressure for more clearly defined self-regulatory mechanisms, and galvanized by the debates over so-called ‘fake news’, internet companies such as Facebook have launched campaigns to educate users about how to more easily distinguish between ‘fake news’ and real news sources. Ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|United Kingdom national election in 2017]], for example, Facebook published a series of advertisements in newspapers with ‘Tips for Spotting False News’ which suggested 10 things that might signal whether a story is genuine or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379|title=Tips to Spot False News {{!}} Facebook Help Center {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been broader initiatives bringing together a variety of donors and actors to promote [[Fact checking|fact-checking]] and [[Information and media literacy|news literacy]], such as the News Integrity Initiative at the [[City University of New York]]’s School of Journalism. This 14 million USD investment by groups including the [[Ford Foundation]] and Facebook was launched in 2017 so its full impact remains to be seen. It will, however, complement the offerings of other networks such as the International Fact-Checking Network launched by the [[Poynter Institute]] in 2015 which seeks to outline the parameters of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles|title=International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers’ code of principles|website=Poynter|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''Melkite'''" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|l|k|aɪ|t}}), also written "'''Melchite'''", refers to various [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and their members originating in the [[Middle East]]. The term comes from the Central Semitic root-word M-L-K found in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''malkoyo'' ({{Script/Serto|ܡܠܟܝܐ}}), {{Lang-he-n|'מלך'}} ''Melk-i'' or ''Melech-i'', and {{lang-ar|ملكي}} ''Malak-ī'', meaning "royal", and by extension, "imperial".&lt;ref&gt;Dick (2004), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers specifically to the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] as an [[ethnoreligious]] group.&lt;ref name=Brockp76&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xa1zdxyfxLYC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=melkites+assyrian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=go7GTtyLFYeB4gS0_ugo&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=An introduction to Syriac studies|author=	Sebastian P. Brock|edition=2, revised, illustrated|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|year=2006|ISBN=9781593333492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Melkites view themselves as the [[Early Christianity|first Christian community]], dating the Melkite Church back to the time of the [[Apostles]].&lt;ref name=Littlep322&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTuZJxwYltEC&amp;dq=melkites+arab&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Peacemakers in action: profiles of religion in conflict resolution|author=David Little, Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding|edition=illustrated|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2007|ISBN=9780521853583}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first community is said to have been a mixed one made up of individuals who were originally [[Greeks|Greek]], Greco-[[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Syriac people|Syriac]], and [[Jewish]].

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] and the Judeo-Greek "wisdom" literature popular in the late [[Second Temple]] era amongst both Hellenized Jews (known as ''Mityavnim'') and gentile Greek [[proselyte]] converts to Judaism played an important part in the formation of the Melkite tradition.

After the Islamic conquests of the [[Levant]] in the 7th century, the Melkite community started incorporating Arabic language in the liturgical traditions as the Middle East became gradually [[Arabization|Arabized]].&lt;ref name=Littlep322/&gt;
[[File:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|thumb|right|250px|11th-century Melchite [[Hirmologion]] written in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] Sertâ book script, from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Mount Sinai]], now part of the [[Schøyen Collection]].]]
The term ''Melkite'' was originally used as a [[pejorative]] term after the acrimonious division that occurred in [[Eastern Christianity]] after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). It was used by [[non-Chalcedonian]]s to refer to those who backed the council and the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] (''malko'' and its cognates are Semitic words for "king"). The Melkites were generally Greek-speaking city-dwellers living in the west of the [[Levant]] and in [[Egypt]], as opposed to the more provincial [[Syriac language|Syriac]]- and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]-speaking non-Chalcedonians. The Melkite Church was organised into three historic [[patriarchate]]s — [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]] —  in union with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]], over the ensuing centuries those Churches which rejected this council recognised different patriarchs in Alexandria ([[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]]) and Antioch ([[Syriac Orthodox Church]]). The Nubian kingdom of [[Makuria]] (in modern Sudan) in contrast to their Non-Chalcedonian [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] neighbours, was also Chalcedonian, from c. 575 until c. 710 and still had a large Melkite minority until the 15th century.

From 1342, [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[clergy]] were based in [[Damascus]] and other areas, and worked toward a union between Rome and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]. At that time, the nature of the [[East-West Schism]], normally dated to 1054, was undefined, and many of those who continued to worship and work within the Melkite Church became identified as a pro-Western party. In 1724, [[Cyril VI of Antioch|Cyril VI]] (Seraphim Tanas) was elected in Damascus by the Synod as Patriarch of Antioch. Considering this to be a Catholic [[takeover]] attempt, [[Jeremias III of Constantinople]] imposed a deacon, the Greek [[monk]] [[Sylvester of Antioch|Sylvester]] to rule the patriarchate instead of Cyril. After being ordained a priest, then bishop, he was given Turkish protection to overthrow Cyril. Sylvester's heavy-handed leadership of the church encouraged many to re-examine the validity of Cyril's claim to the patriarchal throne.

The newly elected [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) also recognised the legitimacy of Cyril's claim and recognized him and his followers as being in communion with Rome. From that point onwards, the Melkite Church was divided between the Greek Orthodox ([[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]]), who continued to be appointed by the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople until the late 19th century, and the Greek Catholics ([[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]), who recognize the authority of the Pope of Rome. However, it is now only the Catholic group who continue to use the title ''Melkite''; thus, in modern usage, the term applies almost exclusively to the [[Arabic]]-speaking [[Greek Catholic]]s from the [[Middle East]].

Some typically [[Greeks|Grecian]] "Ancient [[Synagogal]]" [[priest]]ly [[rite]]s{{which|date=November 2016}} and [[hymn]]s have survived partially to the present{{cn|date=November 2016}}, notably in the distinct [[church service]]s of the Melkite and [[Greek Orthodox]] communities of the [[Hatay Province]] of Southern Turkey, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Members of these communities still call themselves [[Rûm]] which literally means "Roman" or "Asian Greek" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (that is, those of the [[Byzantine Empire|(Eastern) Roman Empire]], what English speakers often call "Byzantine"). The term "Rûm" is used in preference to "Ionani" or "Yāvāni" which means "European-[[wikt:Greek|Greek]]" or [[wikt:Ionian|Ionian]] in Classical Arabic and [[Biblical Hebrew]].

'''Pania''', often styled "Pania of the Reef", is a figure of [[Māori mythology]], and a symbol of the [[New Zealand]] city of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]]. A statue of Pania on Napier's Marine Parade is a tourist attraction.

==The legend of Pania of the Reef==
Pania was a beautiful maiden who lived in the sea on the east coast of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. By daylight she swam about with creatures of her [[reef]] world but after sunset would go to a stream that ran into the bay where the city of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] now exists. She would travel up the stream to an area where she could rest among the [[New Zealand flax|flax]] bushes. Karitoki, the very handsome son of a [[Ariki|Māori chief]], quenched his thirst every evening at the stream where Pania rested because it had the sweetest water. He was unaware she was observing him for many weeks until one night she whispered a faint spell. It carried on the wind to Karitoki who turned around to see Pania emerge from her hiding place.

[[image:Pania Of The Reef.jpg|thumb|left|''Pania of the Reef'']]
Karitoki had never seen someone so beautiful and instantly fell in love. Pania fell in love also, and they pledged their lives to each other and were secretly married. Pania and Karitoki went to his ''[[whare]]'' (house), but because it was dark no-one saw them enter. At sunrise, Pania prepared to leave but Karitoki tried to stop her. She explained that as a creature of the ocean, when the sirens of the sea called her each morning, she could not survive if she did not go to them. She promised to return every evening and their marriage continued on that basis.

Karitoki boasted to his friends about his beautiful wife, but no one believed him because they had never seen her. Frustrated by this, Karitoki consulted a ''[[kaumatua]]'' (wise elder) in the village who believed Karitoki as he knew ocean maidens did exist. The kaumatua told Karitoki that being a sea creature, Pania would not be allowed to return to the sea if she swallowed cooked food.

That night, as Pania slept, Karitoki took a morsel of cooked food and put it in Pania's mouth. As he did so, Ruru the ''[[morepork]]'' ([[owl]]) called a loud warning and Pania was startled from her sleep. Horrified that Karitoki had put her life in jeopardy, Pania fled and ran to the sea. Her people came to the surface and drew her down into the depths as Karitoki swam frantically about the ocean looking for her. He never saw her again.

When people now look deep into the water over the reef, some say they can see Pania with arms outstretched, appealing to her former lover. It is unknown whether she is imploring him to explain his treachery, or expressing her continuing love.

The sea off Napier is now protected by Moremore, the son of Pania and Karitoki. He is the ''[[kaitiaki]]'' (guardian) of the area, a [[taniwha]] (spirit) who often disguises himself as a [[shark]], a [[stingray]] or an [[octopus]].

==The Napier statue==
[[Image:Napier-PossiblyPaniaOfTheReef.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Pania of the Reef'' at night.]]A 1.5 metre statue of Pania was unveiled at Napier's Marine Parade on 10 June 1954 by then [[Prime Minister]] [[Sidney Holland]], and has since been much photographed by tourists. 

The statue was commissioned by members of the Thirty Thousand Club after the [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Aotearoa]], Frederick Augustus Bennett, related the legend of Pania to them. Several students from [[Hukarere Girls College]] were photographed as models for the statue, and eventually, Mei Irihapiti Robin (now Mei Whaitiri, the mother of local MP [[Meka Whaitiri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meka Whaitiri: The story so far |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/365386/meka-whaitiri-the-story-so-far |accessdate=31 August 2018 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was selected. A clay likeness of the photograph of Mei and an actual traditional Piupiu skirt were made by the Italian Marble Company of Carrara in [[Carrara]], Italy. The clay model was then used to produce the [[bronze]] statue, which is estimated to weigh between 60 and 70&amp;nbsp;kg. 

The statue has often been compared to [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|''The Little Mermaid'' statue]] in [[Copenhagen]]; there is a resemblance between the two figures, both statues are small, bronze, and near the ocean, and both are based on similar stories.

===Vandalism and theft===
In 1982, the statue was shot in the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawkesbaytoday.co.nz/local/news/editorial-pania-theft-excuse-for-pot-shots/3661103/ Hawke's Bay Today article]&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was later repaired. On 27 October 2005 the statue was stolen.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10352292"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/crime/news/article.cfm?c_id=30&amp;objectid=10352292 |title=Iconic bronze statue stolen from Napier tourist spot |date=27 October 2005 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10352419"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10352419 |title=Napier still in shock over theft of Pania |author=NZPA and Rebecca Walsh |date=28 October 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police were unsure of the motive but thought activism unlikely, a prank unlikely because theft was premeditated, and theft of the bronze for meltdown was unlikely because it was worth only about [[New Zealand dollar|NZD$200]]. They thought a ransom was possible because a statue worth $250,000 earlier stolen from a restaurant in [[Waikanae]] was returned after $10,000 ransom was paid.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_620515"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/423466/620515 |title=Sculpture returned after ransom paid |date=18 October 2005 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pania'' was discovered by Jeff Foley and recovered by police on November 4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3467753a10,00.html Recovery of the statue (Stuff.co.nz article)]&lt;/ref&gt; restored, then replaced on November 16.

The '''Polish minority in Latvia''' numbers about 51,548 and (according to the Latvian data from 2011) forms 2.3% of the population of [[Latvia]]. Poles are concentrated in the former [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] region, with about 18,000 in [[Daugavpils]] (Dyneburg) and 17,000 in [[Riga]]. People of Polish ethnicity have lived on the territory of modern Latvia since the 16th century. Most have status as [[Non-citizens (Latvia)]], as [[citizens of Poland]], or as citizens of Latvia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Racial literacy''' is a concept developed by [[sociologist]] [[France Winddance Twine]].  She describes it as "a form of racial socialization and [[antiracist]] training that...parents of African-descent children practiced in their efforts to defend their children against racism" in her research done in the [[United Kingdom]] with [[mixed-race]] families.

She further describes it as "cultural strategies and practices designed and employed by parents to teach children of African and Caribbean heritage (1) detect, document, and name antiblack racist ideologies, semiotics, and practices; (2) provide discursive resources that counter racism; and (3) provide aesthetic and material resources (including art, toys, books, music) that valorize and strengthen their connections to the transatlantic culture of black people in Africa, the Caribbean and the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/contours/1.2/twine.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910183846/http://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/contours/1.2/twine.html |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twine's concept of racial literacy is to be distinguished from the term 'race literacy' as conceptualized by [[Lani Guinier]], a professor of law and critical race scholar at [[Harvard university]]. The concept of racial literacy as conceptualized by Twine refers to a set of practices designed by parents and others to teach their children how to recognize, respond to and counter forms of everyday racism. The emphasis here is on teaching children as well as adults how to identify routine forms of racism and to develop strategies for countering it and coping with it.

'''Rohilkhand''' is a region of northwestern [[Uttar Pradesh]] state of [[India]], named after the [[Rohilla]] Afghan tribes. The region was known as ''Madhyadesh'' in the [[Hindu]] epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9083753/Rohilkhand Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Rohilkhand]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohilkhand lies on the upper [[Ganges]] alluvial plain and has an area of about 25,000&amp;nbsp;km²/10,000 square miles (in and around the [[Bareilly|City of Bareilly]]). It is bounded by the [[Ganges|Ganges River]] on the south and the west by [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Nepal]] on the north, and by the [[Awadh]] region to the east. It includes cities of [[Bareilly]], [[Moradabad]], [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], [[Bijnore]], [[Pilibhit]], [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Budaun]], [[Amroha]]

==Origin the of the name==
The area was made famous by the previous settlement of [[Rohilla]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rohilkhand |volume=23 |page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] highlanders of the [[Yusufzai]] and other tribes who were awarded the ''Katehr'' region in northern India by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] to suppress others and for their bravery against uprising rulers. Later it gained fame as Rohilkhand due to large settlements of Rohilla [[Pashtun people|Pathan]]s in the [[Bareilly|City of Bareilly]] and [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]]. ''Roh'' means mountains in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and ''Rohilla'' means ''mountaineer''.&lt;ref name=Roh&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rohilla |volume=23 |page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucknow-Pathans"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.isamasih-lucknow.org/3.html|title = Pathan|publisher = Isa-Masih in Lucknow|accessdate = 2007-02-17|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110613024309/http://www.isamasih-lucknow.org/3.html|archivedate = 13 June 2011|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roh was the homeland of the Pashtuns now also known as [[Pashtunistan]], in the southern foothills of the [[Hindu Kush]].

== History ==
About 1673, two brothers, left their native hills in [[Shahdara|Shahdarah]] and obtained some petty office under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. Mr. Rohilla's grandson,Chirag-eh-Rohilla was eventually appointed governor of Shahdarah in East Delhi. In 1737, an Afghan named Jai-AL-Rohilla  was the [[jagirdar]] of area around [[Farrukhabad]] (bordering Rohilkhand on the southwest), and Rohilkhand was then known as Kuttahir was in the occupation of a band of Afghan mercenary soldiers known as Rohillas. Taking advantage of the invasion of [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], Ali Mahomed added in 1748 to the lands already acquired by him those formerly owned by officers absent on field service. In this way, he acquired the whole of Kutt[[ahir]] and changed its name to Rohilkhand.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} 

Rohilkhand was invaded by the [[Marathas]] after [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|3rd Panipat war]]. The first invasion of Maratha on Rohillakhand took place on 1751–1752,the invasion was result of the charming persona of three beautiful queens of Rohillkhand, namely Begum-eh-khaas Pragya, Paulmi -eh-Shiba and Sadhna-eh-Hayat, the [[wives of chirag|wives of Chirag]]  The [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] were requested by [[Safdarjung]], the [[Nawab of Oudh]], in 1752, to help him defeat Afghani Rohilla. The Maratha forces and Awadh forces besiegedthe  Rohillas, who had sought refuge in [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] but had to retreat when [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] invaded India .&lt;ref name="Agrawal"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZdCrUxFAHEC&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Studies In Mughal History |first=Ashvini |last=Agrawal |publisher= |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agrawal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47sfj8DUwNgC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Indian States: A Biographical, Historical, and Administrative Survey |first1=Somerset |last1=Playne |first2=R. V. |last2=Solomon |first3=J. W. |last3=Bond |first4=Arnold |last4=Wright |publisher= |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1772, [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], led by [[Mahadji Sindhia]] defeated Rohilla chieftain [[Zabita Khan]], whose possessions lay west to Rohilkhand and they also destroyed Rohilla tribal chief [[Najib-ul-Daula]]'s grave, scattering the bones all around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPq640stHJ0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8 |title=The Great Maratha: Mahadaji Scindia |first=N. G. |last=Rathod |publisher= |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1772-73, Mahadji destroyed the power of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] [[Rohillas]] in Rohilkhand and captured [[Najibabad]]. After plundering Rohillakhand Maratha proceed towards [[Oudh State|Oudh]]. Sensing the same fate as Rohilla, Nawab made frantic calls to [[Company rule in India|British]] troops in [[Bengal]]. British company knew that Nawab of Oudh didn't possess any danger for British company, whereas Maratha will try to invade Bengal and Bihar after overrunning Oudh. British company dispatched 20,000 British troops on the order of then Viceroy of British India. British wanted to free Rohillakhand from Maratha and give it to Nawab. The Maratha and British armies came face to face in Ram Ghat, but the sudden demise of then Peshwa and the civil war in [[Pune|Poona]] to choose the next Peshwa forced Maratha to retreat. Rohilla decided not to pay because there was no war between the two states. Further, British made Oudh a buffer state in order to protect it from Maratha, and from there on, British troops start protecting Oudh. The subsidy of one British brigade to provide protection to Nawab and Oudh from Maratha was decided to be Rs 2,10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MS_jrForJOoC&amp;pg=PA57 |title=History of Modern India: 1707 A.D. to Upto 2000 A.D. |first=Radhey Shyam |last=Chaurasia |publisher= |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohilkhand was under the rule of Rohillas with their capital in [[Bareilly|City of Bareilly]] until the [[Rohilla War]] of 1774–75. The Rohillas were defeated and driven from their former capital of [[Bareilly]] by the Nawab of Oudh with the assistance of the East India Company's troops. The state of [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]] was then established under the Nawab of Oudh. In 1803, British annexed Rohilkhand in [[Doab#Upper_Doab|Upper Doab]].

==Jung Bahadur Rana==
After King [[Surendra of Nepal|Surendra]] issued a royal decree (sanad) that formalized the dominance of the Kunwar family  along with giving [[Jung Bahadur Rana|Jung Bahadur]] the complete authority over all internal administration, including civil, military, and judicial affairs, and all foreign relations, including the powers to make war and peace.[[Jung Bahadur Rana|Jung Bahadur]] was made great king (maharajah) of Kaski and Lamjung districts, in effect serving as their independent ruler and the right to use the honorific term '''shri''' three times (Sri Teen) with his name.In his sanad of 1856 King Surendra stated that the line of succession would go to  Junga's seven brothers and then to Junga's sons and nephew in order of seniority.&lt;ref name="JoshiRose1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bhuwan Lal Joshi|author2=Leo E.

==Chandra Shumsher's Revision==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4296">'''Romany media''' started to develop in the last decades, with an evolution influenced by the [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] status of the [[Romani people]] (living as [[Romani people by country|minority in many countries]]).

==Film==

==Internet==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The scattered status of the Roma people and the relatively recent evolution of the Romany media determined an important role for the [[Internet]] as fast and easy accessible means of communication. The Romany media presence on Internet includes news websites like [http://www.dzeno.cz/?r_id=28 Dženo Association], [http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php Romea.cz] or [http://www.roma-service.at/dromablog/ dROMa-Blog (in German and Romani)], also news networks like ''Roma Virtual Network''.

==Television==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

There are Romany TV stations (like ''TV Šutel'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat-address.com/tt/TV-Sutel.html TV Šutel at lyngsat-address.com]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Šuto Orizari]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]) or Romany programs at local TV stations, like [[:rmy:Karavana le Romengi|Karavana le Romengiri]], a Romany program presented on a 2 hrs. time/week rented by the [[Party of the Roma]] in [[Romania]] from [[Oglinda TV]] (the other content of this TV station has nothing in common with the Romany program, it just happened to be the one who accepted the lending). In Czech Republic is internet Romany TV - [http://www.romea.tv ROMEA TV]. Most of the Romany TV stations are in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]].

The '''Silt'e people''' are an ethnic group in southern [[Ethiopia]]. They inhabit today's [[Silt'e Zone]] which is part of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region]]. Silt'e denote their origin to the city of [[Harar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prunnier|first1=Gerrard|title=Understanding Contemporary Ethiopia|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnxeCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=silte+harar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyiuvzzMLNAhXqx4MKHXnEDk04ChDoAQhQMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=silte%20harar&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable number of Silt'e live in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Adama]] and other cities and smaller urban centres of southern Ethiopia where they make a living, e.g., as merchants or keepers of petty shops. In the countryside, the Silt'e practice [[mixed farming]] and cultivate [[ensete]].  
 
The term Silt'e is the modern ethnonym of the speakers of the [[Silt'e language]]. Today's Silt'e comprise the following major historical sub-groups: Azernet, Berbere, Alichcho, Wuriro, Melga (or Ulbareg) and [[Silte (woreda)|Silt'i]] (or Summusilt'i). The name Silt'i (for the subgroup) is derived from the alleged ancestor Gen Silt'i. The modern ethnonym Silt'e was chosen in memory of this ancestor and as a reminiscence of the old Islamic sultanate of [[Hadiya Kingdom|Hadiyya or Hadiya]] the Silte people claim a historical relation to.

The great majority of the Silt'e population is [[Muslim]] making up 97.60% the population followed by [[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity]] at 2.03%. Until the second half of the twentieth century the Silt'e were considered as being part of the [[Gurage]] (but called Adiyya or Hadiyya by the Sebat Bet Gurage). Silte people are also called Adere by the neighboring Arsi-Oromo which might indicate the relationship to the Harari who live (in and around the historic city of Harar) miles away from where the Silte people are inhabiting. The two ethnic groups (Silte and Harari) share somewhat similar language and the same religion. Other designations were ''Islam'' or East Gurage (after their language which forms part of the East Gurage language area). After the fall of the [[Derg]] regime in 1991 a political movement formed to establish an independent ethnic identity for the Silt'e, as they now called themselves. Ten years later, the Silt'e were successful in obtaining an administrative independence from the Gurage Zone in the creation of the Silt'e Zone.

'''Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst''' (5 May 1882 – 27 September 1960) was an English campaigner for the [[suffragette]] movement, a prominent [[Left Communism|left communist]] and, later, an activist in the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. She spent much of her later life agitating on behalf of Ethiopia, where she eventually moved.

==Early life==
Estelle Sylvia Pankhurst (she later dropped her first forename) was born at Drayton Terrace, [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]], a daughter of [[Richard Pankhurst]] and [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], who both later became founding members of the [[Independent Labour Party]] and were much concerned with [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="Spartacus"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simkin|first1=John|title=Sylvia Pankhurst|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WpankhurstS.htm|website=Spartacus|publisher=Spartacus Educational Ltd|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia and her sisters, [[Christabel Pankhurst|Christabel]] and [[Adela Pankhurst|Adela]], attended [[Manchester High School for Girls]], and all three became suffragists. 

Sylvia Pankhurst trained as an artist at the [[Manchester School of Art]], and, in 1900, won a scholarship to the [[Royal College of Art]] in South Kensington, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=37833|title=Pankhurst, (Estelle) Sylvia (1882–1960)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suffragism==
[[File:Suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst Suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|Pankhurst protesting in Trafalgar Square, London, against British policy in India, 1932.]]
In 1906, Sylvia Pankhurst started to work full-time for the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) with her sister Christabel and their mother. She applied her artistic talents on behalf of the WSPU, devising its logo and various leaflets, banners, and posters as well as the decoration of its meeting halls.&lt;ref name=year1906&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winslow|first1=Barbara Winslow|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1907 she toured industrial towns in England and Scotland, painting portraits of working-class women in their working environments.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite web|last=Chambers|first=Emma|title=Women Workers of England|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/display/bp-spotlight-sylvia-pankhurst|publisher=Tate Gallery|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent time in Leicester where she was welcomed by [[Alice Hawkins]] who she knew through the [[Independent Labour Party]]. They were soon joined by [[Mary Gawthorpe]] and they established a WSPU presence in Leicester.&lt;ref name="Crawford23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Crawford|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2EK9P7-ZMsC&amp;pg=PA281|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-43402-1|pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Emmeline and Christabel, Sylvia retained an affiliation with the [[labour movement]] and concentrated her activity on local campaigning. She and [[Amy Bull]] founded the East London Federation of the WSPU.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, ‘Bull , Amy Maud (1877–1953)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63868, accessed 1 Jan 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia also contributed articles to the WSPU's newspaper, ''[[Votes for Women (newspaper)|Votes for Women]]'' and, in 1911, she published a propagandist history of the WSPU's campaign, ''The Suffragette: The History of the Women's Militant Suffrage Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, John (2007), "Writing and Re-Writing Suffrage History: Sylvia Pankhurst's 'The Suffragette'", ''Women's History Magazine''&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like many suffragists she spent time in prison, being arrested on numerous occasions whilst campaigning for the rights of women.  Sylvia was aged 24 when she went to prison for the first time.  During the period between February 1913 and July 1914 Sylvia Pankhurst, was arrested eight times, each time being repeatedly force-fed. She gave several accounts of her experience of force feeding and time in prison. One such account was written for an American Publication called McClure’s Magazine in 1913.  By 1914, Sylvia had many disagreements with the route the WSPU was taking. It had become independent of any political party, but she wanted it to become an explicitly [[socialist]] organisation tackling wider issues than women's suffrage, and aligned with the Independent Labour Party. She had a close personal relationship with the Labour politician [[Keir Hardie]]. On 1 November 1913, Pankhurst showed her support in the [[Dublin Lockout]] and spoke at a meeting in London. The members of the WSPU, particularly her sister Christabel, did not agree with her actions, and consequently expelled her from the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Geoffrey|year=2016|title=Sylvia Pankhurst and the Irish revolution|url=|journal=History Ireland|volume=24|pages=38–41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her expulsion led to her founding of the East London Federation of Suffragettes in 1914 which over the years evolved politically and changed its name accordingly, first to the Women's Suffrage Federation and then to the [[Workers' Socialist Federation]]. She founded the newspaper of the WSF, ''[[Women's Dreadnought]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[Workers' Dreadnought]]''. The federation [[Opposition_to_World_War_I#Women|campaigned against the First World War]] and some of its members hid [[conscientious objector]]s from the police.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==First World War==
[[File:Sylvia-Pankhurst 1.jpg|thumb|Sylvia Pankhurst {{circa}} 1910.]]
During the First World War Sylvia Pankhurst was horrified to see her mother Emmeline and her sister Christabel become enthusiastic supporters of the war drive and campaign in favour of military [[conscription]]. She was opposed to the war, and was publicly attacked in the newly renamed ''[[#Suffragism|WSPU]]'' newspaper ''Britannia''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edmund|last2=Frow|first2=Ruth|title=The Battle of Bexley Square: Salford Unemployed Workers' Demonstration - 1st October 1931|date=1994|publisher=Working Class Movement Library|location=Salford|isbn=978-0-9523410-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her organisation attempted to defend the interests of women in the poorer parts of London. It set up "cost-price" restaurants to feed the hungry without the taint of charity. It also established a toy factory to give work to women who had become unemployed because of the war. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} she and her comrades also worked to defend the right of soldiers' wives to decent allowances while their husbands were away, both practically, by setting up legal advice centres, and politically, by running campaigns to oblige the government to take into account the poverty of soldiers' wives. 

In 1915, Pankhurst gave her enthusiastic support to the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom|International Women's Peace Congress]], held at [[The Hague]]. This support lost her some of her allies at home and contrasted sharply with the stance of her sister Christabel, who, following the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of February 1917 and [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s rise to power, journeyed to Russia to advocate against its withdrawal from the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Davis, ''Sylvia Pankhurst: A Life in Radical Politics'' (Pluto Press, 1999); {{ISBN|0-7453-1518-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communism==
The WSF continued to move towards [[left-wing politics]] and hosted the inaugural meeting of the [[Communist Party (British Section of the Third International)|Communist Party (BSTI)]]. ''Workers' Dreadnought'' published Sylvia Pankhurst's "A Constitution for British Soviets" to coincide with this meeting. In this article she highlighted the potential role of what she called Household Soviets – "In order that mothers and those who are organisers of the family life of the community may be adequately represented, and may take their due part in the management of society, a system of household Soviets shall be built up."&lt;ref&gt;''Workers' Dreadnought'', Vol. VII, No. 13, 19 June 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CP(BSTI) was opposed to [[parliamentarism]], in contrast to the views of the newly founded [[British Socialist Party#BSP as a proto-communist party .281918-1920.29|British Socialist Party]] which formed the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) in August 1920. The CP(BSTI) soon dissolved itself into the larger, official Communist Party, but this unity was short-lived. When the leadership of the CPGB proposed that Pankhurst hand over the ''Workers Dreadnought'' to the party she revolted. As a result she was expelled from the CPGB and moved to found the short-lived [[Communist Workers Party (UK)|Communist Workers Party]]. 

By this time she was an adherent of [[left communism|left]] or [[council communism]]. She attended meetings of the Communist International in Russia and [[Amsterdam]], and those of the [[Italian Socialist Party]]. She disagreed with [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] on his advice to work with the British Labour Party and was supportive of "left communists" such as [[Anton Pannekoek]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Partner and son==
Pankhurst objected to entering into a marriage contract and taking a husband's name. Near the end of the [[First World War]] she began living with Italian anarchist [[Silvio Corio]]&lt;ref&gt;https://libcom.org/history/corio-silvio%C2%AC%C2%AC-1875-1954-aka-crastinus-qualunque&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Woodford Green]], where she lived for over 30 years&amp;nbsp;— a [[blue plaque]] and Pankhurst Green opposite [[Woodford tube station]] commemorate her ties to the area. In 1927, at the age of 45, she gave birth to a son, [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard]]. As she refused to marry the child's father, her mother broke ties with her and did not speak to her again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/12/courageous-suffragettes-helen-pankhurst-film|title=It was like time travel.

==Supporter of Ethiopia==
[[File:Sylvia Pankhurst Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Pankhurst's grave]]
In the early 1930s Pankhurst drifted away from Communist politics but remained involved in movements connected with [[anti-fascism]] and [[anti-colonialism]]. In 1932 she was instrumental in the establishment of the Socialist Workers' National Health Council.&lt;ref name=Socialist_Doctor&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Annual General Meeting|journal=The Socialist Doctor|volume=1|issue=4|date=June 1932|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/history/socialistdoc4.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110716115105/http://www.sochealth.co.uk/history/socialistdoc4.htm|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She responded to the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] by publishing ''The New Times and Ethiopia News'' from 1936, and became a supporter of [[Haile Selassie]]. She raised funds for [[Ethiopia]]'s first teaching hospital, and wrote extensively on [[Culture of Ethiopia|Ethiopian art and culture]], carrying out research that was published in her book ''Ethiopia: A Cultural History'' (London: Lalibela House, 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36322972|title=Sylvia Pankhurst's Ethiopian legacy|last=Jeffrey|first=James|date=2016-06-18|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1936 [[MI5]] monitored Pankhurst's correspondence.&lt;ref name=mi5&gt;[http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/soviet-intelligence-agents-and-british-communists.html Communists and Suspected Communists: Sylvia Pankhurst file ref KV 2/1570] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090916151451/http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/soviet-intelligence-agents-and-british-communists.html |date=16 September 2009 }}, mi5.gov.uk; accessed 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 she wrote to [[Viscount Swinton]], then chairing a committee investigating [[Fifth Column]]ists, and enclosed lists of active Fascists still at large and of anti-Fascists who had been [[internment|interned]]. A copy of this letter on [[MI5]]'s file carries a note in Swinton's hand reading: "I should think a most doubtful source of information."&lt;ref name=mi5/&gt;

After the post-war liberation of Ethiopia she became a strong supporter of union between Ethiopia and the former [[Italian Somaliland]], and MI5 continued to follow her activities. In 1948 MI5 considered strategies for "muzzling the tiresome Miss Sylvia Pankhurst". Pankhurst became a friend and adviser to the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, and in 1956 she moved to [[Addis Ababa]] with her son Richard at Haile Selassie's invitation. She then founded a monthly journal, ''Ethiopia Observer'', in which she reported on many aspects of Ethiopian life and development.&lt;ref name="owen.org"&gt;Fifty Years Since the Death of Sylvia Pankhurst, Ethiopians Pay Tribute – Owen Abroad

==Death and posthumous recognition==
Pankhurst died in [[Addis Ababa]] in 1960, aged 78, and received a full [[state funeral]] at which Haile Selassie named her "an honorary Ethiopian". She is the only foreigner buried in front of [[Holy Trinity Cathedral (Addis Ababa)|Holy Trinity Cathedral]] in Addis Ababa, in a section reserved for patriots of the Italian war.&lt;ref name="owen.org"/&gt;

According to a biography published by the Mexican newspaper ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'', his father and head and founder of the [[Juarez Cartel]], [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]], had told Carrillo Leyva not to enter the drug trafficking business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="58879">'''Violence Against Women''' is "the word or concept (that) has been used in a broad, inclusive manner to encompass [[verbal abuse]], intimidation, physical harassment, homicide, sexual assault, and rape (of women in particular)."&lt;ref&gt;Dobash, R. Emerson. and Russell Dobash. Rethinking Violence against Women. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of violence is gender-biased. Violence occurs precisely because of their gender, specifically because the victims are women.

According to the United Nation's [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women." It is likewise "one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men." This act of violence can be argued to be a kind of hate crime since the crine committed is primarily based upon the victim's membership in a certain demographic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "So, What's a Hate Crime Anyway?"

== History of violence against Filipino women ==

=== Pre-colonial Period ===
The Philippines' early history goes as far back as 30,000 years ago when the Negritos (the primary people of the Philippine archipelago) were believed to have journeyed to the Philippines by land bridges from Mainland Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Philippines (Cultures of the World)|last = Tope|first = Lily Rose|publisher = Benchmark Books/Marshall Cavendish|year = 2002|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Nonan-Mercado|first2 = Detch|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6-BWFruOcDQC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=land+bridges+in+the+philippines&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMIrvmAhq2FyQIVQhQsCh2sxwCj#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20bridges%20in%20the%20philippines&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-colonial society offered women the greatest opportunities in relation to their social positions. Filipino women were allowed to hold high positions in their communities (as healers and priestesses). It was also common for women to take leadership roles in the barangays (See [[Barangay]]) and to fight as warriors. During the pre-colonial period, one of the first things that a man learned was that he had to respect women. At this particular point in history, disrespecting women was unthinkable. If a man was caught disrespecting women, he was labelled negatively by the rest of society.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Role of Women from Pre-Hispanic to Spanish era|url = https://tonkshistory.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/the-role-of-women-from-pre-hispanic-to-spanish-era/|website = Tonks|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the heads of the barangays (in terms of both the economic and political matters) were often men, women at that time already had rights. Some rights of women during the pre-colonial period are as follows:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hunt, Dee Dicen, and Cora Sta. Ana-Gatbonton. "Filipino Women and Sexual Violence: Speaking Out and Providing Services." Centre for Philippine Concerns-Australia, Brisbane Branch, 24 Nov. 2000. Web. 23 Sept. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
# to be treated as an equal by her husband and to share his honors 
# to retain her maiden name
# to freely dispose of the property she had brought into the marriage 
# to be consulted or informed by her husband about his business affairs and contracts 
# to divorce her husband in case of non-support or maltreatment 
# to assume the headship in the barangay
# to have a baby or not, whether she is married or not
# to name her children
All of the rights mentioned above were freely exercised by women in the Philippines even before the country was colonized by the Spaniards, Americans, and the Japanese. Furthermore, "women had an unquestioned preferred role in religious ceremonies as ''babaylanes'' or ''catalones'' (priestesses)."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It can be said that early men and women were equal in the pre-colonial society. The Filipino woman then was rarely abused and discriminated against - she was in fact a woman of strength and power.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Colonial Period ===
[[File:Philippine life in town and country (1905) (14582245888).jpg|thumb|311x311px|Filipino women of the lower class (during the Spanish occupation) ready for Church.]]

==== Spanish occupation (1565-1898) ====
Under the service of the King of Spain, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] led an expedition to further explore territories that were not yet discovered by Europe. On March 16, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan reached the land—Sugubu, now known as Cebu (See [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)]]). Spain ruled the Philippines for over 333 years where the Spaniards treated both men and women poorly. The Spaniards saw the Filipinos as 'indios', seeing themselves as of higher social standing than the natives. In the process of colonization, the Spaniards harmed and committed several acts of violence against Filipino women. With the emergence of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the conditions of men - more specifically, the women - worsened.

Several narratives and works mention how Filipino women experienced all kinds of exploitation during the Spanish occupation. In general, women were unable to execute their rights and were restricted by certain norms and expectations in society. Filipino women were not allowed to share their ideas nor participate in the decision-making process. They tilled the land with their husbands as peasants for pittance. Women stayed as inferior to men and were discriminated against not only by men, but by the very institutions they belonged to in society (i.e. family, Church, community, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Rafal, Myra. "Indigenous Women in the Philippines and Its Combat to Injustice: A Channel for Women’s Reinforcement Operation." 5 (2011): n. pag. IPDER. Far Eastern University. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Filipino men were also considered as peasants or low-lives, Filipino women under the Spanish occupation were far inferior to peasants—they were arguably seen as slaves.

Aside from the discrimination, some Filipinas were violated by parish priests as many young women were often raped or sexually abused in beaterios.

Furthermore, during Spain's 333 year rule in the Philippines, the colonists had to fight off the Chinese pirates, Dutch forces, Portuguese forces, and indigenous revolts. Moros from Western Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago also raided the coastal Christian areas of Luzon and the Visayas. Because of these conflicts in the archipelago, Filipinos were occasionally captured as prisoners and as a result, many of the women were sold to the opposing forces as slaves.

With the Spaniards taking control of all aspects of Philippine society, the identity of the Filipino woman as a woman of strength and power was soon forgotten. The Spaniards created a new image of the ideal Filipino woman. The ideal Filipino woman was someone who was overly religious, submissive, and obedient.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; While men were given the opportunity to study, women were forced into learning religion and home-making. A Filipina was to become one of two things: a nun or a wife. The real Filipina was replaced by the ideal woman (the "Maria Clara") dictated by the Spaniards.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Women were no longer allowed to hold high ranking positions in society and as mentioned earlier, were banned from participating in public and political events.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; During the Spanish occupation, women were seen as inferior to men and as such, men rose as the dominant gender, establishing a patriarchal society that has prevailed to this very day.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==== American rule (1898-1946) ====
In the year 1898, the United States seized control over the Philippines shortly after defeating the remaining Spanish forces in the country. With the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], the Philippines was turned over by the Spaniards to the Americans for $20 million. Still coming to terms with their new-found freedom, the Filipinos went against the American forces as the Americans tried to establish control over the country (See [[Philippine–American War]]).

At the time of the Filipino-American war, as with all wars, there was a massive amount of bloodshed. Records estimate that about 1.5 million people died out of a total of 6 million people in the Philippines. Filipino civilians: 250,000–1,000,000 died, largely because of famine and disease;&lt;ref name=burdeos2008p14casualties&gt;{{Harvnb|Burdeos|2008|p=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=tN__4jLTnd8C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=250,000+1,000,000 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 200,000 who died from cholera. While there are many estimates for civilian deaths, with some even going well over a million for the war, modern historians generally place the death toll between 200,000 and 1,000,000.

In an account by an American soldier, he mentioned that at one point, the Americans were forced to burn barrios as there was too much insurgent activity. They resulted to torturing men and women alike in hopes that they could provide the information they needed. During the war, the Americans did not spare women and as such, Filipino women were raped (for information), physically hurt, or killed. Since the husbands of the women were away for war, the women were often left at home and became vulnerable targets to various abuses by the American soldiers. In one of the accounts of General Jacob Smith about the war, he stated that he ordered a Major Waller to kill and burn everyone and everything at Balangiga in the Samar province and not to take in any prisoners. He even specified that all those who were capable of wielding a gun must die and everyone age 10 and up must be killed. Overall, it can be seen that during the American rule in the Philippines, Filipino women were widely abused. Stories of American soldiers raping Filipino women have been reported and heard of countless times but no one knows to what extend or if it's greatly exaggerated. While Americans did not take a lot of prisoners during the war, the Americans resorted to killing almost everyone—all the women at sight.

Besides the bloodshed, women in the Philippines were still discriminated against. An instance of such discrimination was evident in public schools as the teachers did not care nor support the idea of gender equality.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = AMERICAN COLONIAL EDUCATION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE STATUS OF FILIPINO WOMEN|last = Sobritchea|first = Carolyn Israel|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = University of the Philippines (UP)|pages = |url = http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-28-1990/sobritchea.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though women were allowed to vote, the society still preferred male candidates and did not allow women to run for public office.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Filipino parents were also led to believe that sending their daughters to secondary and tertiary levels of education was a waste.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This was because the Filipino woman during the American occupation was largely dependent on her husband. Her status in life was solely reflected by the image of the man that she would wed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; While women were given the right to education, women were still seen as inferior to men. The Filipino woman was forced to fit into the roles of a daughter and a wife. Even if education flourished in the country (as the literacy rate increased), gender parity was not successful. The women in the Philippines at that time were still arguably "not free" as they remained bound in and limited by the expectations of society.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

==== Japanese occupation (1942-1945) ====
The [[Pacific War]] began mainly because Japan - an emerging power in Asia - sought "to create a great Empire." On December 8, 1941, Japan "opened a surprise attack on the Philippines - attacking without warning - just ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor." Unshaken by the presence of the Americans in the Philippines, the Japanese forces landed at the Lingayen Gulf and continued on to conquer the rest of Manila. With Manila falling to the hands of the Japanese forces, the troops from the Land of the Rising Sun invaded the whole of the Philippines, occupying it from 1942-1945 (See [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]).

During the Japanese occupation, Filipino women were greatly abused and violated. At this particular time in history, Filipino women were threatened and forced to labor as "[[comfort women]]." Upon their arrival in the country, the Japanese built "houses of relaxation" or comfort stations where Korean, Filipino, and Chinese women were brought and forced into service.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women made to be Comfort Women - Philippines|url = http://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html|website = www.awf.or.jp|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941-1942 - when the Japanese soldiers were just starting to invade the Philippines - thousands of Filipino women were taken from their homes and forced to provide the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] all kinds of sexual services. Because most of the men were at war, the women were left practically defenseless in their own homes and without a choice but to submit their bodies to the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Aida. Violence against Women in Times of War and Peace. Quezon City: UP Center for Women's Studies and Ford Foundation, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, even "their fathers or husbands were killed in front of them (the women) and their other family members."

Countless accounts and testimonies of women tell the horrific stories of how Filipino women were grabbed off the streets and "taken to Japanese military camps or garrisons, which were former wither municipal/provincial building, big private houses, elementary/high school buildings, hospitals, or churches."&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; In these camps, the women were sexually abused and raped usually by a group of Japanese soldiers. Oftentimes, it was young girls that were "recruited" to become comfort women. These girls' ages would range from six to 20 years old. The period of confinement ranged from three days to more than a year. Some stories say that aside from sexual services, the Japanese did more than rape women.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, Alfonso. Heroic Virgins and Women Patriots. 1st ed. Quezon City: University of the Philippines, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The Filipino women were subjected to other kinds of violence and trauma, particularly from confinement, starvation, and maltreatment. In some cases, the Japanese went as far as killing women who fought back or escaped.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henson, Maria. A Filipina's Story of Prostitution and Slavery under the Japanese Military. Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publisher, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-colonial Period ===
Violence against women was not as widespread or public compared to the years when the Philippines was under the rule of the Spaniards, Americans, and the Japanese.

After [[World War II]], more and more women had become politicized.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women in politics : limits and possibilities ; the Philippine case  / Carmel V. Abao and Elizabeth U. Yang . - part  4|url = http://library.fes.de/fulltext/iez/01109004.htm#E9E4|website = library.fes.de|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, not too many women were present in mainstream politics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Eventually, many Filipino women "joined ideological groups, while others became combatants of the rebel movements."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Various pro-women groups flourished such as MAKABAKA (Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan), KABAPA (Katipunan ng Bagong Pilipinas), and [[GABRIELA Women's Party|GABRIELA]] (General Assembly Binding Women for Reforms, Integrity, Equality, Leadership, and Action).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Not a lot of these movements, however, survived throughout the years. Most - if not all - groups disbanded, mostly dying out during the Marcos regime (See [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)]]). The disbanded feminist group members scattered across different political parties, while others joined forces with GABRIELA.

The postcolonial era brought about "patriarchal contradictions [and] the dichotomized icons of idealized femininity and degraded whoredom, of feminine plenitude and feminine lack."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ashok, Savitri (2009). "Gender, Language, and Identity in Dogeaters: A Postcolonial Critique". ''Postcolonial Text'' '''5''' (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the Philippines "were removed from the reigning paradigm of patriarchy (thrice colonized in the process of history, first by the patriarchy within and then by the colonizers from without and then again by the nation-builders)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instead of setting right the wrongs let loose by the colonizing patriarchs, "the national patriarchy continued the colonization of women by desecrating the female body and by degrading women to mere bodies."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The "performative display of violence on the female body (therefore) carried out by the country’s power-wielders contains, besides its pornographic import, the ominous implication that it will be told and retold as a moral tale to threaten women into submission and subjugation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While it was not as rampant as in the previous years, violence against women still happened during the postcolonial period as women in the Philippines were often sexually abused, harassed, and objectified by the rest of society.

===Contemporary History ===
Today, violence against women remains to be one of the most persistent and alarming issues that the Philippines has faced.

According to a survey conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in 2008, one in every five Filipino women aged 15 to 49 has experienced violence.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics on violence against Filipino women {{!}} Philippine Commission on Women|url = http://www.pcw.gov.ph/statistics/201405/statistics-violence-against-filipino-women|website = www.pcw.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the NSO conducted the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), the survey introduced different types of violence that were done to women or experienced by Filipino women at least once their lives. The types of violence that were indicated were: physical violence, sexual violence, physical violence during pregnancy, and spousal violence.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The results of the survey revealed that women in the Philippines experience all sorts of violence.   
* 14.4 percent of married women were said to have experienced physical abuse from their spouse, while about one-third (or 37 percent) of separated or widowed women admitted to experiencing abuse.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   
* In the issue of sexual violence, one in twenty-five women age 15-49 (who have had sex) has experienced being forced into sexual intercourse at least once.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   
* The numbers on physical violence during pregnancy showed that four percent of women (who have ever been pregnant) have experienced physical violence from their partners during pregnancy. The incidents of abuse increased slowly with the number of children living, decreased slightly with age and education level, and degenerated steadily with wealth quintile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   
* Finally, in terms of spousal abuse, 23 percent of ever-married women experienced emotional and other forms of non-personal violence. One in seven ever-married women experienced abuse and violence from their husbands, while eight percent were sexually abused. Patterns in the frequency of spousal violence were found to be similar with the violence experienced by women ages 15–49 (but most likely higher among separated, widowed, and divorced; currently married women who have been married more than once, and in CARAGA region, Central Visayas, and in SOCCSKSARGEN). The survey also revealed that spousal violence declined as the husband's age, education, and wealth quintile increased.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
In the reports of the Philippine National Police (PNP), the statistics revealed that there has been a steady increase in VAW cases reported to them from 1997-2013. 
* The year 2013 was reported to have had the most cases of VAW in history. The number of VAW cases increased to 49.9 percent from 2012 to 2013. From these reports, a total of 16,517 cases was filed under the complaint or violation of the RA 9262 (in 2013).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* According to the information gathered by the PNP, the general category of the violation of RA 9262 is the most prominent type of VAW, accounting for 57 percent of the total number of VAW cases reported. Physical injury comes in at second with an accumulated 19.7 percent of the reported VAW Cases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Region 6 (or Western Visayas) was found to have had the highest number of reported VAW cases nationwide in 2013 with a record-breaking 4,833 reported cases (which accounts for 20.3 percent of the total reported VAW cases in the Philippines). Among the highest number of VAW cases was Region 11 (Davao) with 18.5 percent and Region 7 (Central Visayas) with 14.5 percent. The region which had the least amount of reported VAW cases was the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) with just 86 cases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
These reports, however, do not imply an increase or decrease in the incidences of VAW as it only shows the cases which were reported to the PNP. This means that either the incidences of VAW has been increasing or that awareness about VAW is becoming greater.

As for the survey of the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), the board researched and looked into the numbers related to violence of women in especially difficult circumstances (or WEDC). WEDC includes women who are victims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, maltreatment, battering, illegal recruitment, involuntary prostitution, armed conflict, human trafficking, detention, and others like HIV patients/potentials, abandoned, emotionally distressed, unwed mothers, sexually exploited, voluntary committed/surrendered, and neglected victims of disaster.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nscb.gov.ph/headlines/StatsSpeak/2008/090808_rav_wedc.asp|title = Statistics on Violence Against Women and Children: A Morally Rejuvenating Philippine Society?|date = September 8, 2008|accessdate = November 5, 2015|website = National Statistical Coordination Board|publisher = |last = Virola|first = Romulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The number of WEDC who have been served by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) (1998-2007) has dwindled over the years. The most common cases of WEDC are women who are physically abused/maltreated/battered followed by the group that includes HIV patients/potentials, emotionally distressed, stranded, unwed mothers, neglected victims of disaster, and sexually abused women.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* NCR used to have the most number of WEDC, but in 2007, Regions III, X, IX,  VII and  VIII (in that order) overtook the region on the category of the most number of WEDC.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* In 2007, the most common case of WEDC of physical abuse/maltreatment/battering is most rampant in Region IX, followed by Region VII, CAR, Region III and  Region II.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* According to the NSCB, girls who are abused are usually outnumbered by boys two to one. Majority of these girls range from ages 10 to 18.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
Aside from the types of violence mentioned above, Filipino women experience violence, specifically in how women are often objectified in media. Cases of women being forced to pose in magazines or use their bodies for money (i.e. pornography) are growing more and more each day. More than magazines and videos, many women (especially, celebrities) have been targeted and exposed through sex scandals and the release of their private (often, nude) pictures on the internet. On a more daily basis, Filipino women also experience violence in being 'cat-called' on the streets as well as being touched and/or sexually harassed by co-workers, classmates, friends, and even strangers on the commute (Cat-calling happens when "people shout uncalled for and sexual comments at women on the street").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Catcalling happens to most women between the ages of 11 and 17|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11637697/Catcalling-Women-sexually-harassed-on-the-street-from-puberty.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Acid_attack_victim.jpg|thumb|318x318px|"Acid has a devastating effect on the human body, often permanently blinding the victim and denying them the use of their hands."]]

== Types of violence ==
Violence against women may take different forms at the individual, community, and the societal level. The most common forms of violence include that of rape, domestic violence, stalking, sexual harassment, human trafficking, forced prostitution, state violence, and female genital mutilation.

Due to the many variations of violence against women, it will be divided into two main categories, namely physical and psychological/emotional abuse.

=== Physical abuse ===

Physical abuse concentrates on the unwanted contact or violation of the body of the female. The following are the types of physical abuse:
# '''Physical abuse:''' Any unwanted physical contact caused by another person resulting in harm, injury, and/or discomfort (e.g., slapping, kicking, restraining, hitting, and choking).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of violence against women {{!}} womenshealth.gov|url = https://www.womenshealth.gov/violence-against-women/types-of-violence/|website = www.womenshealth.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* ''Domestic violence'' is assault or abuse between spouses with the likelihood of victimization being more likely between people sharing a bond of intimacy. The World Health Organization conducted a study in 2014 that showed 38% of murders of women were committed by an intimate partner, while the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey revealed that one-fourth of women from ages 15–49 who had ever been married experienced emotional, physical, or sexual violence from their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR294/FR294.pdf|title = 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* ''Honor killing'' is a form of domestic violence, a traditional practice involving the murder of a woman for bringing shame upon the family, often for reasons such as the refusal to enter an arranged marriage, attempt to leave a marriage, adultery, becoming a victim of rape, or for disobeying social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Ethics - Honour crimes|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h1|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dowry violence is another variation, denoting violence out of a husband's family's dissatisfaction with dowry provided by a wife. Dowry violence has often resulted in suicides and bride burning. While the practice is more prevalent in cultures where women are regarded by religion as second class citizens, honor killing occurs worldwide. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the United Nations estimated that almost 5000 women fall victims to honor killings every year. 
#* ''Acid throwing'' refers to the use of acid on a person "with the intention of injuring or disfiguring." The act itself is often motivated by personal conflicts in sexual or intimate relationships, conflicts over land and property, gang violence, and religious reasons. Acid attacks involve the use of nitric, sulphuric, or hydrochloric acid and result in permanent physical scarring or blindness with subsequent emotional and psychological trauma as later effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.cambodianacidsurvivorscharity.org/docs/breaking_the_silence.pdf|title =Breaking the Silence|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131219010314/http://www.cambodianacidsurvivorscharity.org/docs/breaking_the_silence.pdf|archive-date =2013-12-19|dead-url =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CNN.com - Bangladesh combats an acid onslaught against women - November 11, 2000 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/south/11/11/bangladesh.acid.ap/index.html |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922210725/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ASIANOW/south/11/11/bangladesh.acid.ap/index.html |archivedate=September 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are female in 75-80% of occurrences worldwide.

#* ''Stalking'' is unwanted or obsessive attention towards an individual by another person or party. This kind of abuse paves the way for harassment and invasion of privacy, often escalating to extreme violence. 
# '''Sexual abuse:''' Any forced and unwanted sexual activities (e.g., rape, forcing her to have sex with others, treating her as a sex object, refusing to allow or forcing her to use contraception, etc.).
#* ''Rape'' is a form of sexual assault, involving sexual intercourse where a participant does not provide consent to the act. 5813 counts of rape were reported in the Philippines in 2009 with 6.3 counts occurring for every 100,000 people in the same year. Marital rape is a common form of rape. This type of sexual assault usually involves a married couple.
#* ''Sexual harassment'' is abusive behavior of a sexual nature occurring outside of the home, often in the workplace. 
#* ''Human trafficking'', according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, refers to the acquisition of persons by means of force, fraud, or deception, with the intent of exploitation. Oftentimes, victims of human trafficking are forced into prostitution, fueling the worldwide sex industry. Since 2009, the Philippines has been on the Tier 2 Watch List of the Trafficking in Persons Report of the US State Department for failure to report progress in convicting perpetrators of the local sex trade, where reportedly 375,000 women in between the ages of 15-20 are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sunday Tribune |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article.tvt?_scope%3DTribuneFTF%26id%3D77709 |website=www.webcitation.org |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5OzhDYYFa?url=http://www.tribune.ie/article.tvt?_scope=TribuneFTF&amp;id=77709 |archivedate=2007-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trafficking in Persons Report 2009|url = https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/|website = www.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=CBC News: The Lens - Selling Sex in Heaven - Facts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/thelens/heaven_facts.html |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822002110/http://www.cbc.ca/thelens/heaven_facts.html |archivedate=August 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the DSWD rescued 632 victims of human trafficking, 408 of whom were female minors and 36 of whom were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Child trafficking in RP unstoppable – DSWD |url=http://ecpatinternational.com/EI/Resource_newsclippings.asp?id=928 |website=ecpatinternational.com |accessdate=2015-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116103319/http://ecpatinternational.com/EI/Resource_newsclippings.asp?id=928 |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An online article by Rev. Father Shay Cullen from The Vatican in 2004 named several hotspots of the Philippines's sex industry, identifying Metro Manila and tourist destinations such as Angeles City, Olongapo City, towns in Bulacan, Batangas, Cebu City, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro City as well as several sex tourism beach resorts in Puerto Galera, Pagsanjan, Laguna, and San Fernando.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = People on the Move, No 96 (Suppl.)|url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/migrants/pom2004_96-suppl/rc_pc_migrants_pom96-suppl_cullen.html|website = www.vatican.va|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have been trafficked overseas as well with the number of women smuggled abroad ranging from 300,000-400,000 a year.

A 1995 article by The Manila Chronicle reports that 150 Filipino women were trafficked into several northern African countries by international syndicates where they were sold to night club owners. Mail-order brides are a common fate for trafficked women with nearly 5000 entering the United States every year since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Filipina Mail-Order Brides Vulnerable to Abuse|url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/10/211_53320.html|website = koreatimes|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological/Emotional Abuse ===

Psychological/emotional abuse deals with the types of violations that degrade one's dignity, provoke fear, and/or inflicts trauma on another person. The different variations are as follows:&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* '''Verbal abuse:''' The use of negative comments that are offensive, embarrassing, or threatening (e.g., name calling, false accusations, lying, saying one thing and meaning another, etc.).
* '''Social Abuse:''' Any behavior resulting in the isolation and alienation of a woman from friends or family or any actions that suggest she is inferior due to her gender or her different socio-economic background (e.g., controlling what she does, whom she sees and talks to, treating her like a servant, making a scene in public, etc.).

== Impact of violence against women ==
[[File:Woman crying in bathroom.jpg|thumb|335x335px|Victims of violence against women often bear psychological scars of the abuse, haunted by the feelings of fear or shame.]]

≈≈ Impact on Individuals ≈≈

The effects of violence against women vary widely, depending "on the nature of the particular incident, the woman’s relationship with her abuser, and the context in which it took place."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ending Violence Against Women: A Challenge for Development and Humanitarian Work|last = Pickup|first = Francine|publisher = Oxford: Oxfam.|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Williams|last3 = Sweetman|first2 = Suzanne|first3 = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of violence of this nature "typically have (various) physical, psychological, and social consequences."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In terms of its physical effects, violence against women has been linked to many serious health consequences such as physical injuries, disability, chronic health problems (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal disorders, various chronic pain syndromes, hypertension, etc.), sexual and reproductive health problems (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases, spread of HIV/AIDS, high-risk pregnancies, etc.), and in extreme cases—death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gender/violence/v8.pdf|title = Violence against women: Health consequences|date = July 1997|accessdate = 30 October 2015|website = who.int|publisher = World Health Organization|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from physical effects, victims of violence also experience psychological health problems. These effects include anxiety, fear, mistrust of others, inability to concentrate, loneliness, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, psychosomatic illnesses, withdrawal, and alcohol or drug use.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

As a result of the violence inflicted against them, the victims are forced to deal with rejection, ostracism, and social stigma at the community level.

Acts of violence also affect the overall productivity of women. The economic impact of abuse may extend to losses in women's earning potential. Women who have experienced violence may have a reduced contribution to society precisely because "damage to their confidence result to fear of venturing into public spaces (this can often curtail women’s education, which in turn can limit their income-generating opportunities)." The negative impact on the women's self-image prevents the victims from reaching their full potential and self-realization.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This may be partly because girls who are victims of violence are likely to be anxious or depressed, unable to perform to the best of their ability. Because of their experience of having no control over their own bodies, the world has become a threatening place where they avoid challenges of any kind.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Violence against women affects the whole family ===

* Children exposed to intimate partner violence in the home are more likely to:&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/pvl_infographic.pdf|title = Violence Against Women: The Health Sector Responds|date = |accessdate = 30 October 2015|website = who.int|publisher = World Health Organization|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Use alcohol and drugs in harmful ways

==Legislation and laws==
In 1937, the women in the Philippines were first granted the right to vote through the Women's Suffrage Bill (which was approved in a special plebiscite mandated by Commonwealth Act No. 34).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women's History Timeline {{!}} www.bloomu.edu|url = https://www.bloomu.edu/wrc/timeline|website = www.bloomu.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presidential Museum and Library • TODAY IN HISTORY: In 1937, women’s suffrage in the...|url = http://tumblr.malacanang.gov.ph/post/49232114250/today-in-history-in-1937-womens-suffrage-in-the|website = tumblr.malacanang.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-10-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208052621/http://tumblr.malacanang.gov.ph/post/49232114250/today-in-history-in-1937-womens-suffrage-in-the|archive-date = 2015-12-08|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at that time, women were repeatedly look down upon, abused, and discriminated against in society.

Before special laws addressing violence against women were passed, women could only resort to the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]] for defense. Today, the Philippine government has passed several legislation and laws that address the problem of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Philippine initiatives to eliminate VAW {{!}} Philippine Commission on Women|url = http://www.pcw.gov.ph/focus-areas/violence-against-women/initiatives|website = www.pcw.gov.ph|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Philippine laws that aim to protect women are: Republic Act No. 9262, Republic Act No. 9710, and Republic Act No. 8371.

=== Republic Act No. 9262 ===
Republic Act No. 9262 is known as ''The Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act of 2004''.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing "the need to protect the family and its members particularly women and children from violence and threats to their personal safety and security", RA 9262 was signed by former [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on March 2, 2004.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the RA 9262, VAW refers to "any act or a series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife, former wife, or against a woman with whom the person has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or with whom he has a common child, or against her child whether legitimate or illegitimate, within or without the family abode, which result in or is likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological harm or suffering, or economic abuse including threats of such acts, battery, assault, coercion, harassment, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, RA 9262 gives women and their children the right to file a protection order. A protection order is "an order issued for the purpose of preventing further acts of violence against a woman or her child and granting other necessary relief."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection order "safeguards the victim from further harm, minimizing any disruption in the victim's daily life and facilitating the opportunity and ability of the victim to independently regain control over her life."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of protection orders that may be issued are: the barangay protection order (BPO), the temporary protection order (TPO), and the permanent protection order (PPO).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For BPOs, the order is usually issued by the ''Punong Barangay'' or ''Barangay Kagawad.'' Barangay officials are expected to "respond immediately to a call for help or request for assistance or protection of the victim."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, they are expected to "arrest the suspected perpetrator without a warrant when any of the acts of violence is occurring, or when he/she has personal knowledge that any act of abuse has just been committed, and there is imminent danger to the life or limb of the victim."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any barangay official or law enforcer who fails to report the incident shall be liable for a fine not exceeding P10,000 and/or whenever applicable, criminal, civil, or administrative liability.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9262|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2004/ra_9262_2004.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic Act No. 9710 ===
Known as the ''Magna Carta of Women'', Republic Act No. 9710 "affirms the role of women in national building and ensures the substantive equality of women and men" in society.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9710|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9710_2009.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pushing for the empowerment of women and for equal opportunities for both women and men, RA 9710 highlights the state's position, particularly of how the state "condemns discrimination against women in all its forms and pursues."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9710|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9710_2009.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; RA 9710 was signed on August 14, 2009 by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9710|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9710_2009.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MCW consists of provisions on: (1) the principle of human rights of women, (2) the definition of women's rights, (3) the duties related to the human rights of women, (4) the rights and empowerment of women (especially those in affected by calamities or disasters, in the marginalized sectors, or in especially difficult situations), (5) the institutional mechanisms through which rights of women are protected and upheld, and finally, (6) the implementing rules and regulations concerning the Magna Carta.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 9710|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9710_2009.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic Act No. 8371 ===
Republic Act No. 8371 is known as ''The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997''.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 8371|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1997/ra_8371_1997.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed on October 29, 1997, RA 8371 highlights the state's recognition and promotion of all the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs).&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 8371|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1997/ra_8371_1997.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under RA 8371, ICCs or IPs "refer to a group of people or homogenous societies identified by self-ascription and ascription by other, who have continuously lived as organized community on communally bounded and defined territory, and who have, under claims of ownership since time immemorial, occupied, possessed customs, tradition, and other distinctive cultural traits or who have, through resistance to political, social, and cultural inroads of colonization, non-indigenous religions and culture, became historically differentiated from the majority of Filipinos."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|title = R.A. 8371|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1997/ra_8371_1997.html|website = www.lawphil.net|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, non-government, and other organizations ==

===Philippine Commission on Women===

Formerly known as the ''National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women'' (NCRFW), the [[Philippine Commission on Women]] (PCW) serves as the voice for Filipino women. The organization performs as the main body, which relay gender and feminist concerns to the Philippine government. The PCW is the main advocate of gender equality and women empowerment in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcw.gov.ph/pcw|title = HERSTORY|date = |accessdate = October 23, 2015|website = Philippine Commission on Women|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCW was first established on January 7, 1975 upon the passing of Presidential Decree No. 633. The PCW acted as the main consultant of the President regarding matters concerning the welfare of women in the country.

Its main priorities during that time were as follows:

* Organizing women into a nationwide movement called "Balikatan sa Kaunlaran" (or shoulder-to-shoulder in development) (This organization is now registered as an independent women's organization.)
* Conducting policy studies and lobbying for the issuance of executive and legislative measures concerning women
* Establishing a clearinghouse and information center on women
* Monitoring the implementation of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

After the Martial Law, the new administration ordered for a change in the Constitution, which led the NCRFW to revise its platform and ultimately, decide to prioritize the "mainstreaming [of] women’s concerns in policy making, planning, and programming of all government agencies." The organization's main concern now is not to be merely an adviser to the President, but to voice out the concerns of Filipino women in society, spearhead the creation of laws that support the welfare of women, and make sure that all women that work not only in government agencies, but also in the whole Philippines, get the rightful and equal treatment as men do.

The establishment of the gender equality principle in the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Philippine Constitution]] indicated that the concern for the welfare of women rose as one of the top priorities of the government. Only two years after the integration of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the very first Philippine Development Plan for Women (PDPW) - which would go on for 3 years (1989-1992) - was established through Executive Order No. 348. This was followed by the passing of RA 7192, also known as the Women in Nation-Building Act. The Women in Nation Building Act advocates for the equal treatment of women and men in Philippine society. It likewise promotes the equal importance of women in the building of the Philippine nation.

As mentioned earlier, the NCRFW kept its name until the establishment of RA 9710 (or the Magna Carta of Women). Upon the passing of the Magna Carta, the organization modified from its original name to a new one—today, it is better known as the ''Philippine Commission on Women.''

=== GABRIELA Women's Party ===

General Assembly Binding Women for Reforms, Integrity, Equality, Leadership, and Action or [[GABRIELA Women's Party|GABRIELA]], for short, is a leftist Philippine organization—specifically a party list that advocates issues related to that of women and children. It is composed of over 200 organizations and institutions all concerned about the welfare of women in the Philippines.

GABRIELA was established in April 1984 after 10,000 women came together and protested against the Marcos administration. It was also at this particular point of history that the group decided to name their organization as "GABRIELA" in honor of the woman who fought alongside the Katipunan against the Spaniards in the 18th century, [[Gabriela Silang]].

GABRIELA is focused on addressing issues that affect women such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, gender inequality, sex trafficking, and rape culture as well as issues that affect the Philippines in general namely poverty, militarism, health, and globalization.

=== SAVE Our Women ===
Stop the Abuse and Violence against Our Women (SAVE Our Women) was founded in 2007 in Baguio city. It is a local non-government organization that provides psycho-social support and referrals to female survivors of domestic and intimate-relationship violence (and their children). The organization also aims to spread awareness about the realities and prevalence of domestic and intimate-relationship violence through information dissemination of facts, statistics, procedures, and Philippines laws that protect women, prosecute abusers, and prevent further abuse. Mainly serving Baguio City and suburbs, SAVE Our Women works with various agencies and volunteers, including lawyers, guidance counselors, and other service-providers, in the city to spread its advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Squarespace - Claim This Domain|url = http://www.saveourwomenphilippines.com|website = www.saveourwomenphilippines.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bathaluman Crisis Centre Foundation ===
The Bathaluman Crisis Centre Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 1991 to help female survivors of violence. The foundation provides a support system, including a service and referral centre, to help survivors deal with their physical trauma.&lt;ref name="unifem-eseasia1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unifem-eseasia.org/projects/evaw/vawngo/vamphil.htm|title = Organizations Addressing VAW: Philippines|publisher = UNIFEM|date = 2 November 2001|accessdate = 2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdhgsea.org/autopage/show_page.php?h=26&amp;s_id=8&amp;d_id=8 |title=Bathaluman Crisis Center Foundation Inc., Davao City, Philippines |publisher=terre des hommes Southeast Asia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's Crisis Centre ===
Established in 1989, the Women's Crisis Centre (WCC) provides a supportive and affirming environment in which women who have survived violence can interact with other survivors through group counselling, education programs, recreation activities, or skills training.&lt;ref name="unifem-eseasia1" /&gt;

===Bantay Bata 163===
[[Bantay Bata]] is a welfare organization and foundation founded by ABS-CBN in 1997.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs-cbnfoundation.com/bb163/about.html|title = About Us|date = |accessdate = November 5, 2015|website = Bantay Bata|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of Bantay Bata is to respond to children's needs. They respond to reports about domestic violence and child abuse. Bantay Bata also helps children who have serious illnesses or are inflicted with rare diseases. Its emergency hotline is 1-6-3 and is accessible anywhere in the Philippines. Concerns of Bantay Bata include child abuse, child neglect, child trafficking, and domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/philippines/best_practices|title = Philippines Best Practices|date = |accessdate = November 5, 2015|website = A web resource for combatting human trafficking|publisher = |last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003526/http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/philippines/best_practices|archive-date = March 4, 2016|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its headquarters is located in Mother Ignacia, Quezon City, the foundation has ventured out of Metro Manila and has offices in cities and municipalities all over the Philippines. This helps the foundation to respond immediately and cater to reports more efficiently. A recent addition to their services is their online counseling for child abuse victims and child-family relationships.

Furthermore, Bantay Bata spearheads psychosocial activities that help the child victims cope with their difficult pasts and experiences. The foundation also organizes seminars all over the country, raising awareness about child abuse, domestic violence, or child trafficking.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some Bantay Bata projects include medical-dental services, child counseling, the Children's Crisis Center (which serves as a temporary home for child abuse victims until their cases are resolved), and the Children's Village (which takes in children who need further attention and care).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs-cbnfoundation.com/bb163/programs.html|title = Programs &amp; Services|date = |accessdate = November 5, 2015|website = Bantay Bata|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in Italy''' refers to females who are from (or reside) in [[Italy]]. The legal and social status of Italian women has undergone rapid transformations and changes during the past decades. This includes [[family law]]s, the enactment of [[discrimination|anti-discrimination measures]], and reforms to the penal code (in particular with regard to crimes of violence against women).&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2014/493052/IPOL-FEMM_NT%282014%29493052_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''For the Roman period, see [[Women in Ancient Rome]].''
===Women in Pre-modern Italy===
During the [[Middle ages]], Italian women were considered to have very few social powers and resources, although some widows inherited ruling positions from their husbands (such in the case of [[Matilde of Canossa]]). Educated women could find opportunities of leadership only in religious convents (such as [[Clare of Assisi]] and [[Catherine of Siena]]).

The Renaissance (15th–16th centuries) challenged conventional customs from the Medieval period. Women were still confined to the roles of "monaca, moglie, serva, cortigiana" ("nun, wife, servant, courtesan").&lt;ref&gt;Sara F. Matthews-Grieco (a cura di), ''Monaca, moglie, serva, cortigiana: vita e immagine delle donne tra Rinascimento e Controriforma'' (Firenze: Morgana, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; However, literacy spread among upper-class women in Italy and a growing number of them stepped out into the secular intellectual circles. Venetian-born [[Christine de Pizan]] wrote ''The City of Ladies'' in 1404, and in it she described women's gender as having no innate inferiority to men's, although being born to serve the other sex. Some women were able to gain an education on their own, or received tutoring from their father or husband.

[[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]] in Florence; [[Veronica Gambara]] at Correggio; [[Veronica Franco]] and [[Moderata Fonte]] in Venice; and [[Vittoria Colonna]] in Rome were among the renowned women intellectuals of the time. Powerful women rulers of the Italian Renaissance, such as [[Isabella d'Este]], [[Catherine de' Medici]], or [[Lucrezia Borgia]], combined political skill with cultural interests and patronage. Unlike her peers, [[Isabella di Morra]] (an important poet of the time) was kept a virtual prisoner in her own castle and her tragic life makes her a symbol of female oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Gaetana Marrone, ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies: A-J'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007, p. 1242&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Italian women intellectuals were embraced by contemporary culture as learned daughters, wives, mothers, and equal partners in their household.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Sarah Gwyneth (2010). ''The Birth of Feminism: woman as intellect in Renaissance Italy and England''. Harvard University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were composers [[Francesca Caccini]] and [[Leonora Baroni]], and painter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]. Outside the family setting, Italian women continued to find opportunities in the convent, and now increasingly also as singers in the theatre ([[Anna Renzi]]—described as the first diva in the history of opera—and [[Barbara Strozzi]] are two examples). In 1678, [[Elena Cornaro Piscopia]] was the first woman in Italy to receive an academical degree, in philosophy, from the [[University of Padua]].

[[File:Maria Gaetana Agnesi.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]], an Italian mathematician and linguist who was, according to [[Dirk Jan Struik]], "the first important woman mathematician since [[Hypatia]] [fifth century A.D.]".]]

[[File:Rita Levi Montalcini.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], 1986 Nobel Prize winner for Medicine]]
In the 18th-century, the Enlightenment offered for the first time to Italian women (such as [[Laura Bassi]], [[Cristina Roccati]], [[Anna Morandi Manzolini]], and [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]]) the possibility to engage in the fields of science and mathematics. Italian sopranos and ''prime donne''  continued to be famous all around Europe, such as [[Vittoria Tesi]], [[Caterina Gabrielli]], [[Lucrezia Aguiari]], and [[Faustina Bordoni]]. Other notable women of the period include painter [[Rosalba Carriera]] and composer [[Maria Margherita Grimani]].

===Women of the Risorgimento===
The Napoleonic Age and the Italian Risorgimento offered for the first time to Italian women the opportunity to be politically engaged.&lt;ref&gt;Antonietta Drago, ''Donne e amori del Risorgimento'' (Milano, Palazzi, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799 in Naples, poet [[Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel]] was executed as one of the protagonists of the short-lived [[Parthenopean Republic]]. In the early 19th century, some of the most influential salons where Italian patriots, revolutionaries, and intellectuals were meeting were run by women, such as [[Bianca Milesi Mojon]], [[Clara Maffei]], [[Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso]], and Antonietta De Pace. Some women even distinguished themselves in the battlefield, such as [[Anita Garibaldi]] (the wife of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]), Rosalia Montmasson (the only woman to have joined the [[Expedition of the Thousand]]), [[Giuseppina Vadalà]], who along with her sister Paolina led an anti-Bourbon revolt in Messina in 1848, and [[Giuseppa Bolognara Calcagno]], who fought as a soldier in [[Expedition of the Thousand|Garibaldi's liberation of Sicily]].

===The Kingdom of Italy (1861–1925)===

Between 1861 and 1925, women were not permitted to vote in the new Italian state. In 1864, [[Anna Maria Mozzoni]] triggered a widespread women's movement in Italy, through the publication of ''Woman and her social relationships on the occasion of the revision of the Italian Civil Code'' (''La donna e i suoi rapporti sociali in occasione della revisione del codice italiano''). In 1868, [[Alaide Gualberta Beccari]] began publishing the journal "Women" in Padua.

A growing percentage of young women were now employed in factories, but were excluded from political life and were particularly exploited. Under the influence of socialist leaders, such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]], women became active in the constitution of the first Labour Unions. In 1902, the first law to protect the labour of women (and children) was approved; it forbade them working in mines and limited women to twelve hours of work per day.

By the 1880s, women were making inroads into higher education. In 1877, Ernestina Puritz Manasse-Paper was the first woman to receive a university degree in modern Italy, in medicine, and in 1907 [[Rina Monti]] was the first female professor in an Italian University.

The most famous women of the time were actresses [[Eleonora Duse]], [[Lyda Borelli]], and [[Francesca Bertini]]; writers [[Matilde Serao]], [[Sibilla Aleramo]], [[Carolina Invernizio]], and [[Grazia Deledda]] (who won the 1926 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]); sopranos [[Luisa Tetrazzini]] and [[Lina Cavalieri]]; and educator [[Maria Montessori]].

===Under the Fascist regime (1925–1945)===

Even before the [[March on Rome]], despite the difficulties of the revolutionary period ([[Biennio Rosso]]), there were still a hundred militant fascist women, while in Monza the first women's fascist group was founded on 12 May 1920.

The first point of the fascist Manifesto of Piazza Sansepolcro asked "vote and eligibility for women", the law of 22 November 1925 established in fact the female vote in local elections.

In 1938, moreover, Mussolini even tried to ensure the representation of women in the Chamber of Fasci and Corporations, but the king Vittorio Emanuele III opposed the idea. Which makes understand by which environments arrived the greatest resistances to overcoming the old social and cultural patterns. The truth is that fascism intended to offer women "a third way between the oratory and the house" . "The nationalization of all the individual destinies called each person, man or woman, to participate actively in the construction of the greatness of their country, "as Annalisa Terranova wrote in his "Camiciette Nere".
Notable for that time were the rules that established the ban of the dismissal in case of pregnancy and a waiting period for maternity.

More than only this laws: challenging the prevailing moralism, fascism will bring to stadiums  thousands of young girls, in an attempt of collective mobilization that basically created something from nothing&amp;nbsp;— women's sports&amp;nbsp;— entirely absent in Italy before 1922.

In 1935, G.A. Chiurco is even more explicit: "The fascist state can't conceive the woman locked in her house." Not always, unfortunately, this awareness came to dismantle the old pre&amp;nbsp;— fascist prejudices, even though it is thanks to the regime's effort if in the Olympics of 1936 Italy conquered  a historic gold medal in the 80 meters hurdles with the athlete Ondina Valla, who celebrated with a fascist salute from the top step of the podium. Valla was then received with full honors in Venice Square by Mussolini.

The young Italian women of the regime "were no longer attached to the skirt of their mothers and had managed to stop with the imprisonment of older sisters, which, at their age, came out of the house only in mom's or aunt's company," acknowledged the anti-fascist Victoria de Grazia.

And last but not least is remarkable experience of the SAF (Servizio Ausiliario Femminile): the first female army in the world wanted by Mussolini during the period of the Italian Social Republic (1943-1945).

===The Italian Republic (1945–present)===

After WW2, women were given the right to vote in national elections and to be elected to government positions. The new Italian Constitution of 1948 affirmed that women had equal rights. It was not however until the 1970s that women in Italy scored some major achievements with the introduction of laws regulating divorce (1970), abortion (1978), and the approval in 1975 of the new family code.

Famous women of the period include politicians [[Nilde Iotti]], [[Tina Anselmi]], and [[Emma Bonino]]; actresses [[Anna Magnani]], [[Sofia Loren]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]]; soprano [[Renata Tebaldi]]; ballet dancer [[Carla Fracci]]; costume designer [[Milena Canonero]]; sportwomen [[Sara Simeoni]], [[Deborah Compagnoni]], [[Valentina Vezzali]], and [[Federica Pellegrini]]; writers [[Natalia Ginzburg]], [[Elsa Morante]], [[Alda Merini]], and [[Oriana Fallaci]]; architect [[Gae Aulenti]]; scientist and 1986 Nobel Prize winner [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]]; astrophysicist [[Margherita Hack]]; astronaut [[Samantha Cristoforetti]]; pharmacologist [[Elena Cattaneo]]; and [[CERN]] Director-General [[Fabiola Gianotti]].

==Issues in present time==
Today, women have the same legal rights as men, and have mainly the same job, business, and education opportunities.&lt;ref name=kwin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Italy/Women%E2%80%99s-Rights-in-Italy/314|title=Professional Translation Services Agency&amp;nbsp;— Kwintessential London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive rights and health===
{{further|Abortion in Italy}}
The [[maternal mortality]] rate in Italy is 4 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010), one of the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html|title=The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;— Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate is 0.3% of adults (aged 15–49)—estimates of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|title=The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;— Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion laws were liberalized in 1978: abortion is usually legal during the first trimester of pregnancy, while at later stages of pregnancy it is permitted only for medical reasons, such as problems with the health of the mother or fetal defects.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/italy.doc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice it is often difficult to obtain an abortion, due to the rising number of doctors and nurses who refuse to perform an abortion based on moral/religious opposition, which they are legally allowed to do.&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inchieste.repubblica.it/it/repubblica/rep-it/inchiesta-italiana/2013/05/23/news/torna_l_aborto_clandestino-59480523/?ref=HREC2-6|title=Torna l'aborto clandestino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
[[Divorce]] in Italy was legalized in 1970. Obtaining a divorce in Italy is still a lengthy and complicated process, requiring a period of [[legal separation]] before it can be granted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/world/europe/15italy.html|title=Divorce Tourists Go Abroad to Quickly Dissolve Their Italian Marriages|date=15 August 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the period of separation has been reduced in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-divorce-idUSKBN0NE1JD20150423|title='Divorce Italian style' becomes easier, faster with new law|date=23 April 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1969, after the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] struck down the law as unconstitutional, because it discriminated against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/role-traditions-divorce-italy|title=Role of Traditions: Divorce in Italy&amp;nbsp;— impowr.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Law No. 151/1975 provided for [[gender equality]] within marriage, abolishing the legal dominance of the husband.&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session20/A-HRC-20-16-Add2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cohabitation#Italy|Unmarried cohabitation in Italy]] and births outside of marriage are not as common as in many other Western countries, but in recent years they have increased. In 2017, 30,9% of all births were outside of marriage, but there are significant differences by regions, with unmarried births being more common in the North than in the South.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato927532.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has a low [[total fertility rate]], with 1.32 children born/woman (in 2017),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato927532.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. Of women born in 1968, 20% stayed [[childless]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ined.fr/fichier/s_rubrique/26128/540.population.societies.2017.january.en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the EU, only Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Poland, and Portugal have a lower total fertility rate than Italy.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0|title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female education===
[[File:Maria_Piantanida_e_una_sua_classe.jpg|thumb|School girls, 1949/1950]]
{{Main|Education in Italy}}
Women in Italy tend to have highly favorable results, and mainly excel in secondary and tertiary education.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt; Ever since the [[Italian economic miracle]], the [[literacy rate]] of women as well as university enrolment has gone up dramatically in Italy.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt; The literacy rate of women is only slightly lower than that of men (as of 2011, the literacy rate was
98.7% female and 99.2% male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;— Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of Italian university graduates are female, and women are excellently represented in all academic subjects, including [[mathematics]], [[information technology]], and other technological areas which are usually occupied by males.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt;

===Work===
Female standards at work are generally of a high quality and professional, but are not as good as in education.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt; The probability of a woman getting employed is mainly related to her qualifications, and 80% of women who graduate from university go on to seek jobs.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt;  Women in Italy face a number of challenges. Although gender roles are not as strict as they have been in the past, sexual and domestic abuse is still quite prevalent in Italy. On average, women do 3.7 hours more housework than men. Men make up the majority of the parliament (women represent less than a third of the parliament).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm|title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women in Italy are not adequately represented in the workforce, as Italy has one of the lowest rates of employment for women of the countries within the European Union. Women's [[employment rate]] (for ages 15–64) is 47.8% (in 2015), compared to 66.5% for men.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R#|title=LFS by sex and age&amp;nbsp;— indicators|first=|last=OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women are still frequently expected to stay at home and care for the house and children, as opposed to earning a salary and becoming a breadwinner, and few senior managerial positions are held by women. Furthermore, there are unequal standards and expectations for the few women who actually make it into a professional setting. For example, 9% of working Italian mothers have lost their jobs due to pregnancy. Although legislation protects pregnant women (in accordance with EU [[Directive (European Union)|directives]]), the social climate still does not reflect full equality, nor does it protect against abuse. An infamous practice in Italy is that of "white resignation" (''dimissione in bianco''), whereby female employees are asked as condition for their employment or promotion to sign undated [[resignation]] papers, which are kept by the employer who adds a date on them when the woman is pregnant so that she "resigns" at that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2012-000233+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=Written question - Blank resignation letters   - E-000233/2012|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social views, particularly in Southern Italy, remain quite conservative. Italian lawmakers are working to further protect and support women as they break gender stereotypes and join the workforce, but complete cultural change is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/a-call-for-aid-not-laws-to-help-women-in-italy.html|title=A Call for Aid, Not Laws, to Help Women in Italy|date=19 August 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7337145.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Business&amp;nbsp;— Why Italy's women are out of work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304073204579171840922681228|title='Mancession' Pushes Italian Women Back Into Workforce|first=Giada|last=Zampano|date=2 November 2013|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, the proportion of women in the workforce has increased in recent years: according to [[World Bank]], in 1990 women made up 36.3% of the labour force, while by 2016 they made up 42.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS|title=Labor force, female (% of total labor force) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women holding [[white-collar worker|white collar]], high level, or office jobs tend to get paid the same as men, but women with [[blue collar]] or manual positions are paid 1/3 less than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=kwin/&gt;

===Culture and society===
Today, there is a growing acceptance of gender equality, and people (especially in the North&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eilmensile.it/2012/02/20/sud-italia-questo-non-e-un-paese-per-donne/|title=Sud Italia, questo non è un Paese per donne&amp;nbsp;— E&amp;nbsp;— il mensile online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) tend to be far more liberal towards women getting jobs, going to university, and doing stereotypically male things. However, in some parts of society, women are still stereotyped as being simply housewives and mothers, also reflected in the fact of a higher-than-EU average female unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7337145.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Business&amp;nbsp;— Why Italy's women are out of work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about the appropriate social behaviour of women have traditionally had a very strong impact on the state institutions, and it has long been held that a woman's 'honour' is more important then her well-being. Until the 1970s, rape victims were often expected and forced to marry their rapist. In 1965, [[Franca Viola]], a 17-year-old girl from [[Sicily]], created a sensation when she refused to marry the man who [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and raped her. In refusing this "rehabilitating marriage" to the perpetrator, she went against the traditional social norms of the time which dictated such a solution. Until 1981, the Criminal Code itself supported this practice, by exonerating the rapist who married his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivaldeldiritto.it/app/document-detail.jsp?id_prodotto=2996&amp;IdC1=1169&amp;css=&amp;tipo=0 |title=Festival del diritto |publisher=Festivaldeldiritto.it |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Franca Viola incident was made into a movie called ''[[La moglie più bella]]''.

In more recent times the media, particularly TV shows, have been accused of promoting sexist stereotypes. In 2017, one talk-show of a state-owned broadcaster was cancelled after accusations that it promoted discriminatory views of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39326989|title=Italian broadcaster cancels 'sexist' show|first=Lamia|last=Estatie|date=20 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against women===
In recent years, Italy has taken steps to address [[violence against women]] and [[domestic violence]], including creating Law No. 38 of 23 April 2009.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt; Italy has also ratified the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, as in other [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean-European]] areas, the concept of [[family honor|family honour]] was very important in Italy. Indeed, until 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances for so-called [[honor killings|honour killings]].&lt;ref&gt;Until 1981 the law read: ''Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the '''offence to his honour or that of his family''' will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister''.[http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf][http://www.diritto24.ilsole24ore.com/guidaAlDiritto/codici/codicePenale/articolo/716/art-587-omicidio-e-lesione-personale-a-causa-di-onore.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditionally, honour crimes used to be more prevalent in [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/explainer-why-hard-to-stop-honor-killings-religion/25404748.html|title=Explainer:  Why Is It So Hard To Stop 'Honor Killings'?|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibellulaitalianistica.it/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/HonorKillingEditAnnaCafaro.pdf|title=Revista de italianistica&amp;nbsp;— Revista italia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10164">{{nihongo|'''Yellow cab'''|イエローキャブ|Ierō Kyabu}} is a term referring to an [[ethnic stereotype]] of [[Japanese women]], and by extension other East Asians, suggesting that they are sexually available to foreign men. The term combines the use of [[Color terminology for race|"yellow" to refer to Asians]] and the image of a [[Taxicab|yellow taxicab]] which can be "ridden at any time". It specifically refers to wealthy women who travel overseas or to foreign enclaves in Japan seeking to meet [[gaijin|foreign men]].&lt;ref name="Turner 2000: 9"&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is alleged to have been coined by English-speaking foreigners who encountered such women in the late 1980s, but was quickly appropriated by the Japanese media as a way of sensationalizing and censuring the women's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese term is a ''[[gairaigo]]'' (i.e., [[transliteration|transliterated]] from English).

==Social context==
Women described as "yellow cabs" can often be observed in so-called "border regions" consisting of highly transient, ethnically and culturally mixed populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar studying the "yellow cab" phenomenon listed the [[Roppongi]] district of [[Tokyo]], [[United States Forces Japan]] bases in locations such as [[Yokosuka]], [[Yokota Air Base|Yokota]], [[Misawa Air Base|Misawa]], [[Iwakuni]], [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], and [[Okinawa]] as possible locations in Japan, and [[Hawaii]], [[New York City]], and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sources disagree as to the question of power in these relationships. One argument analyses the phenomenon in terms of consumer patterns: the women are in the financially superior position due to the strength of the Japanese yen and their own disposable income, and are using their power to purchase sex; one such woman even described her foreign boyfriends as "pets".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing argument puts the phenomenon in the context of a larger "romanticization and eroticization" of the West and specifically of [[English language|English]] speakers by Japanese women, and asserts that it is actually the Western men in such relationships who have power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Piller|Takahashi|2006|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phenomenon is not limited to the West; some women also seek out local tour guides in [[Bali]] and [[Thailand]] as "holiday lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ma|1996|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women engaged in these activities sometimes assert that it is no more than a female reflection of the much larger phenomenon of Japanese men's sex tours to foreign countries; some scholars agree with this self-assessment, bluntly referring to such women as "female [[sex tourism|sex tourists]]".&lt;ref name="Marling 2006: 98"&gt;{{harvnb|Marling|2006|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the women and their relation to Japanese society, some authors describe the women's taking-on of foreign partners, especially men of African descent, as "socially, economically, and politically liberating" and a threat to Japanese men; others point out that the pursuit of foreign men was neither a permanent rejection of Japanese patriarchy nor of Japanese men themselves, and that many women engaged in such relationships eventually went on to marry Japanese men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|2001|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There was coverage of the "yellow cab" phenomenon as early as 1987, but public attention to it received a major boost from [[Shōko Ieda]]'s 1991 book ''Yellow Cab'', which featured interviews with and reporting on young Japanese women overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ma|1996|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her research assistant George Sarratt later denounced major portions of the book as fraudulent.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|2001|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television broadcasts on the phenomenon especially focused on relations between [[Black people|black]] men and Japanese women, and the stereotypically perceived danger of being infected with [[AIDS]]; Japan's [[TV Asahi]] aired a segment on the subject in 1992 which included several staged scenes; [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] followed up with a 90-minute documentary in 1993.&lt;ref name="Cooper-Chen 1997: 213-214"&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper-Chen|Kodama|1997|pp=213–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The use of the term by Japanese men has been described as "reverse [[orientalism]]".&lt;ref name="Turner 2000: 9"/&gt; However, the controversy itself was used by women's media to engage in critique of Japanese male behaviours; such critique was often characterised by "relentless denigration" of Japanese men, as in [[Makiko Iizuka]]'s 1993 book, ''The Guys who Can't Even Hitch a Ride on a Cab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2003|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, women labelled as "yellow cabs" have also been known to [[reappropriation|reappropriate]] the term as a mark of pride; in particular, [[Amy Yamada]] is "notorious" for using her work to "flaunt" her image as a "yellow cab", a trend that was apparent in her work even before the emergence of the "yellow cab" stereotype, as in her 1985 book ''[[Bedtime Eyes]]'', which won that year's [[Bungei Prize]].&lt;ref name="Marling 2006: 98"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|1996|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese hip hop]] artist [[Hime (rapper)|Hime]], the self-described voice of the "Japanese doll", also turns the stereotype on its head, stating that being a "yellow cab" means that the woman is in the "driver's seat".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condry|2006|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the negative media coverage, Japanese female professionals in the [[New York City]] area organised the {{nihongo|"Group to think about yellow cabs"|イエローキャブを考える会|Ierō Kyabu wo Kangaeru Kai}}; they asserted that the image of Japanese women overseas had been damaged by the media and that the phenomenon was nowhere near as widespread as the media coverage attempted to portray it to be, and sought to combat the negative coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ma|1996|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest group also questioned whether the term was truly widespread in the United States, as the documentaries claimed; one telephone survey of 200 people they conducted in the New York area did not find a single individual familiar with the use of the term "yellow cab" in this sense.&lt;ref name="Cooper-Chen 1997: 213-214"/&gt; 

The group continued to be active until late 1993; they were later criticised for their "legacy of denial and disavowal of the possibility of Japanese women's racialized desire for foreign men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|2001|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars studying their activities described their attempts to deny or downplay the phenomenon as an "image battle", and one which they lost; women returning to Japan from studying or working overseas often reported that they suffered insulting insinuations about their sexual behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsky|2001|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporting on the phenomenon in Japanese media was generally supplanted in the mid-1990s by a "new [[moral panic|panic]]" regarding women's sexuality, specifically the ''[[enjo kōsai]]'' (compensated dating) phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLelland|2003|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
