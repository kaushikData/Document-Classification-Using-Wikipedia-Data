The film was a critical and commercial success, making $152 million at the worldwide box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=timetokill.htm|title=A Time to Kill (1996) - Box Office Mojo|website=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the town of [[Canton, Mississippi]], ten-year-old African American Tonya Hailey ([[Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly]]) is abducted, raped, and beaten by two local men, Billy Ray Cobb ([[Nicky Katt]]) and Pete Willard ([[Doug Hutchison]]). The duo dump her in a nearby river after a failed attempt to hang her. Tonya survives, and the two men are arrested by Sheriff Ozzie Walls ([[Charles S. Dutton]]).

Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), contacts Jake Brigance ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), a white lawyer who previously defended his brother. Brigance admits the possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse and opens fire with an automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Dwayne Looney ([[Chris Cooper]]) with a ricochet, whose leg is later amputated. Carl Lee is arrested and Brigance agrees to defend him.

The rape and subsequent revenge killing gain national media attention. The district attorney, Rufus Buckley ([[Kevin Spacey]]), decides to seek the death penalty, and presiding Judge Omar Noose ([[Patrick McGoohan]]) denies Brigance a change of venue to a more ethnically-diverse county, meaning that Carl Lee will have an all-white jury. Brigance seeks help from his defense team: law student Ellen Roark ([[Sandra Bullock]]), close friend Harry Rex Vonner ([[Oliver Platt]]), and former mentor and longtime activist Lucien Wilbanks ([[Donald Sutherland]]), a once-great civil rights lawyer. Meanwhile, Billy Ray's brother, Freddie Lee Cobb ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), plans to avenge his brother's death by joining and enlisting the help of the Mississippi branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its Grand Dragon, Stump Sisson ([[Kurtwood Smith]]). 

On the first day of the trial, the Klan rallies, only to be outnumbered by counter-protesters consisting of the area's black and multiracial residents, as well as whites who support Carl Lee. The protest erupts into a violent riot that results in dozens of injuries and the death of Stump Sisson. The Klan also begins to target Brigance, assaulting his elderly secretary and her husband, who ends up dying of a fatal heart attack brought on by the assault. They also burn a cross on his lawn and threaten his wife and daughter. When Brigance refuses to back down, Cobb kidnaps and assaults Roark. The Klan then increases their attacks, including burning Brigance's house.

Dispirited, Brigance tells Carl Lee that there is little hope for an acquittal. Carl Lee replies that he had chosen him as an attorney because even a racist jury would listen to a white man; as "one of the bad guys," he has an influence that a black man will never have. During closing arguments, a deeply-shaken Brigance tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the entire ordeal of Tonya. Brigance then asks the jury, in his final comment, to "now imagine she's white."

After deliberation, a black child runs out of the courthouse and screams, "He's innocent!" Jubilation ensues amongst the supporters outside. The Klan members, enraged, begin yelling in anger. Meanwhile, Sheriff Walls arrests Freddie Lee for his crimes, as well as a corrupt deputy who is also a member of the Klan and is standing next to the sheriff.

Brigance brings his wife and daughter to a family cookout at Carl Lee's house to celebrate his freedom.

==Reception==

===Box office performance===
According to Boxofficemojo.com, the movie performed well, earning over $108 million domestically.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning a 65% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 52 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1072381-time_to_kill/|title=A Time to Kill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a critical consensus reading: "Overlong and superficial, A Time to Kill nonetheless succeeds on the strength of its skillful craftsmanship and top-notch performances". It has a score of 54 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 21 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/timetokill?q=A+Time+to+Kill|title=A Time to Kill|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, saying: "I was absorbed by ''A Time to Kill'', and found the performances strong and convincing," and added that "this is the best of the film versions of Grisham novels, I think, and it has been directed with skill by Joel Schumacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960726/REVIEWS/607260302/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=A Time To Kill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not without its detractors, however. Anthony Puccinelli gave the film one star, calling it "worthless" and remarking: "''A Time to Kill'' argues for vigilantism but disguises its message by making the vigilante black, allowing viewers to think their blood lust and thirst for revenge is actually empathy for the oppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0896/08166.html|title=Chicago Reader|website=Chicago Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] felt that "they [Schumacher and screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]]] cram[med] in too much," adding, "This distracts from the heart of the picture, which is in the bond between Carl Lee (the brilliant [Samuel L.] Jackson is quietly devastating) and Jake, a husband and father who knows he, too, would have shot anyone who raped his little girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947309/review/5947310/a_time_to_kill |title=Movie Reviews and Ratings from Peter Travers &amp;#124; Rolling Stone Movies |work=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Siskel remarked it was "An overwrought, contrived courtroom thriller", "cornball" and concluded "This story has been recycled out of countless better movies."

Grisham enjoyed the film, remarking: "When all was said and done I was happy with it, happy we were able to find a kid like Matthew McConaughey. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a good one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,587688,00.html|title=John Grisham issues judgment on ALL his novels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction in France====
In France, the film has been the subject of much controversy. Critics have accused the movie of making an apology for the [[death penalty]] and [[right of self-defense]]. A question mark was added at the end of the title ("Le Droit de tuer ?"/"The Right to Kill ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=15283.html|title=Le Droit de tuer ?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=60362 A time to kill – Cinémathèque française&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722194626/http://cinema.encyclopedie.films.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=60362 |date=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) so as not to shock the audience. [[Amnesty International]] France uses the word "disturbing" when referring to the film in one of its documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyinternational.be/dossierpapierlibre.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616161901/http://www.amnestyinternational.be/dossierpapierlibre.pdf |archivedate=2004-06-16 |df= }}{{Failed verification|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' described the film as "nauseating", "stinking", almost "fascist", with a script "ultra-populist" that makes you want to "vomit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesinrocks.com/cine/cinema-article/article/le-droit-de-tuer/ Les Inrocks : Le Droit de tuer ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704084432/http://www.lesinrocks.com/cine/cinema-article/article/le-droit-de-tuer/ |date=2010-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libération]] criticized the script, calling it "extremely dirty": the movie, says the newspaper, "militates in favour of the black cause only to legitimize, after many plot buckles (resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan, the deceits of court, threats of [m]any kinds) the mentally ill gesture of the avenging father". According to Libération, the movie "justifies the indefensible" with a "dripping sentimentalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101197567-cinema-sur-fond-de-conflit-racial-et-d-autodefense-un-droit-de-tuer-extremement-scabreux-joel-schumacher-filme-l-injustifiable-le-droit-de-tuer-de-joel-schumacher-avec-matthew-mcconaughey-sandra-bullo|title=CINEMA.

==Political activism==

===Early public service===
In 1949 Lowenstein worked as a special assistant on the staff of Senator [[Frank Porter Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1964/1/17/allard-lowenstein-plast-october-and-november/ Allard Lowenstein: Silhouette], by Sanford J. Ungar, The Harvard Crimson, January 17, 1964,&lt;/ref&gt; and he was a foreign policy assistant on Senator [[Hubert Horatio Humphrey|Hubert H. Humphrey's]] staff in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lowensteinbio.htm Biography, Allard K. Lowenstein], Yale Law School web site, accessed March 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s Lowenstein spent time in Mississippi as part of the [[Freedom Summer]] and an interview of Lowenstein was featured in episode 5 of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] documentary ''[[Eyes on the Prize]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lowensteinbio.htm Biography, Allard K. Lowenstein], Yale Law School web site, accessed January 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa and national politics===
In 1959, Lowenstein made a clandestine tour of [[South-West Africa]], now [[Namibia]]. While he was there, he collected testimony against the [[South Africa]]n-controlled government (South-West Africa was a [[United Nations Trust Territory]]).  After his return, he spent a year promoting his findings to various student organizations and then wrote a book, ''[[A Brutal Mandate]]'', with an introduction by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], with whom he had worked in 1957 at the [[American Association for the United Nations]].&lt;!-- Yale bio citable for the book and for working in '57 w/ Eleanor Roosevelt; citation needed for the rest of this.--&gt;

In 1960 Lowenstein was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"/&gt;

In 1964, he attended the [[1964 Republican National Convention]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} with his close friend and Congressional colleague&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Geoffrey Kabaservice, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tlr7zOjQjOMC&amp;pg=PA322&amp;lpg=PA322 ''Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, from Eisenhower to the Tea Party''], Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Rumsfeld]].

[[File:AllardLowenstein.jpg|250px|thumb|Allard Lowenstein at congressional race fundraiser, August 29, 1976]]

In 1966 he helped Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in writing his famous [[Day of Affirmation Address]], given to the [[National Union of South African Students]] at the [[University of Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Halberstam |first=David |title=The Unfinished Odyssey of Robert Kennedy |publisher=Open Road Media |date=5 March 2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CEk1cJ_gyfEC&amp;dq= |isbn=9781480405899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Dump Johnson" movement and 1968 presidential race===
Along with [[Curtis Gans]] in 1967, and later that fall joined by Wisconsin's [[Midge Miller]], Lowenstein started the [[Dump Johnson movement|"Dump Johnson" movement]], approaching Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and, at Kennedy's suggestion, [[George McGovern]] about challenging President Johnson in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Democratic primaries]].  When Kennedy and McGovern both declined, Lowenstein, a delegate to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], recruited and worked for [[Eugene McCarthy]], to whose [[Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign, 1968|candidacy]] he remained loyal, even after Kennedy's late entry into the race (before Johnson bowed out).  Johnson's withdrawal from the presidential nomination process has been attributed to the impact of the "Dump Johnson" movement, culminating in the historical precedent of McCarthy's strong showing against Johnson in the New Hampshire primary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1968/1/8/lowenstein-the-making-of-a-liberal/ Lowenstein: The Making of a Liberal 1968: Catalyst for McCarthy], by Robert M. Krim, The Harvard Crimson, January 8, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QD8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 Magazine article, Coalition Against the Humphrey Steamroller], by William A. McWhirter, LIFE Magazine, July 12, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election to Congress===
Lowenstein was elected to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1968 but was defeated in a modified district in 1970 by [[New York State Senate|New York State Senator]] [[Norman F. Lent]] by 9,300 votes, effectively [[gerrymander]]ed out of office by the Republican-controlled state legislature, which determined the district's boundaries.  [[Long Island]]'s generally liberal [[Five Towns]] region had been removed from the district, and the far more conservative [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]] added.  Lowenstein captured 46% of the vote in the new district.

===ADA leadership, "Dump Nixon" movement and Nixon Enemies List===
The 1970 election was viewed nationwide as a referendum on President Richard Nixon's conduct of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Transcript online"/&gt;  In 1971, Lowenstein became head of the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and spearheaded the [[Dump Nixon movement|"Dump Nixon" movement]], earning himself the number 7 spot on [[Nixon's Enemies List]].

===Campaigns for Congress===
In 1972, Lowenstein ran unsuccessfully for Congress in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] against Congressman [[John J. Rooney]], a [[conservative Democrat]] supported by the party "machine," in the Democratic primary.  After Rooney's victory was challenged and the election recalled due to allegations of fraud, Rooney narrowly won the rescheduled primary, but Lowenstein continued in the race on the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]] line, finishing with 28% of the vote.

After an abortive 1974 [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] bid, Lowenstein unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican Congressman [[John Wydler]] in a largely Republican district in Long Island in 1974 and 1976, receiving crucial support and endorsements from some local conservative Republicans as well as conservative [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] His 52% to 48% defeat in 1974 was the strongest showing of any Democrat in that Congressional district to date, largely attributed to Nixon's recent resignation, the [[Watergate scandal]] and Lowenstein's national reputation.

===Robert F. Kennedy assassination===
Lowenstein was one of the most vocal critics of the unwillingness of Los Angeles and federal authorities to reopen the investigation into the June 6, 1968, [[assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy]].  Lowenstein's one-hour appearance on the PBS television show ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' in 1975, where he was interviewed by [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], was one of the first times the American public were shown that many elements of ballistic and forensic evidence were radically at odds with eyewitness testimony and the assumption that [[Sirhan Sirhan]] alone had shot Senator Kennedy.

===United Nations appointment and final campaign for Congress===
[[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] appointed Lowenstein as [[United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and thus head the United States delegation to the thirty-third regular annual session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000477 |title=LOWENSTEIN, Allard Kenneth - Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lowenstein served with the rank of ambassador from August 1977 to June 1978 in the capacity of alternate United States Representative for Special Political Affairs to the United Nations.

In 1978 he resigned his U.N. post to run for Congress in Manhattan's "Silk Stocking District", narrowly losing the Democratic primary to Carter Burden, who in turn lost the general election to Republican [[S. William Green]].

==Associations with conservatives==
Lowenstein was a close friend of conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr., who featured Lowenstein on numerous ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' programs, publicly endorsed his candidacies for U.S. Congress, and delivered a eulogy at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;''Firing Line'', [http://hoohila.stanford.edu/firingline/programView2.php?programID=843 "Allard Lowenstein: A Retrospective", Episode #415] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104063943/http://hoohila.stanford.edu/firingline/programView2.php?programID=843 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, May 18, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Jr., William F., ''On The Firing Line: The Public Life of Our Public Figures'', 1988, pp. 423–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowenstein reportedly was Republican [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s "best friend in Congress" during Lowenstein's term of office, the two having become good friends while serving as Congressional aides in the late 1950s.  Despite their party and ideological differences, Rumsfeld joined Lowenstein on the victory platform upon Lowenstein's election to Congress in 1968.  In 1970, Rumsfeld publicly defended Lowenstein against his Republican opponent's attacks, only to recant and endorse the opponent, [[Norman Lent]], under pressure from the Nassau County (Long Island) Republican organization and Nixon White House.  Rumsfeld's public reversal contributed to Lowenstein's reelection defeat and the end of their friendship.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Lowenstein's subsequent campaigns for Congress from Long Island against Republican incumbent [[John Wydler]] in a largely Republican district were significantly aided by active, public support from several local conservative Republicans.

==Family==
Lowenstein was married to Jennifer Lowenstein (née Lyman, now Littlefield) from 1966 to 1977, when they divorced, and the two had three children: Frank Graham, Thomas Kennedy, and Katharine Eleanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaiser |first=Robert |date=March 15, 1980 |title=Ex-Rep.

==Death==
Lowenstein was murdered in his [[Manhattan]] office on March 14, 1980, at age 51 by a mentally ill gunman, Dennis Sweeney.

At his funeral in New York City on March 18, 1980, eulogies were delivered at his family's request by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Firing Line'', [http://hoohila.stanford.edu/firingline/programView2.php?programID=843 "Allard Lowenstein: A Retrospective", Episode #415] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104063943/http://hoohila.stanford.edu/firingline/programView2.php?programID=843 |date=November 4, 2013 }}, May 18, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Jr., William F., ''On The Firing Line: The Public Life of Our Public Figures'', 1988, pp. 423,433-434.&lt;/ref&gt;

A veteran of the [[United States Army]], Lowenstein is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=gravestone/&gt;

Lowenstein was well known for his ability to attract energetic young volunteers for his political causes. In the early 1960s, he briefly served as dean of Stern Hall, then a men's dormitory at [[Stanford University]], during which time he met and befriended undergraduate students [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]] and Sweeney. Over a decade later, in 1980, Lowenstein was shot in [[New York City]] by Sweeney, now mentally ill and convinced that Lowenstein was plotting against him. Sweeney then calmly waited for the police to arrive and arrest him. Lowenstein, Sweeney, and the shooting are discussed in Harris's autobiographical book ''[[Dreams Die Hard]]'' as well as in [[Richard Cummings (writer)|Richard Cummings]]'s biography of Lowenstein, ''The Pied Piper''.

Sweeney was eventually found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and committed to full-time psychiatric treatment for [[schizophrenia]]. By 1992, Sweeney was on 16-hour-a-day furloughs. Members of the Lowenstein family, who had opposed prosecutorial plans to seek a sentence of death for Sweeney, expressed grave concern about the supervision Sweeney would receive and anger that a murderer was being given such privileges.

On June 30, 2000, a judge found that Sweeney was no longer a danger to society and granted him a conditional release from all levels of custody.&lt;ref&gt;Blaine Harden and Nina Bernstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/31/nyregion/legally-insane-special-report-voices-his-head-muted-killer-rejoins-world.html?pagewanted=1 Legally Insane/A special report; Voices in His Head Muted, A Killer Rejoins the World], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (July 31, 2000).  Retrieved July 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and memorials==
[[Hofstra University]] established the Allard K. Lowenstein Civil Rights Scholarship in 2007.

[[Yale Law School]] also has several programs named in honor of Lowenstein.  The [http://www.yale.edu/lowenstein Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Project] was founded in 1981 shortly after Lowenstein's death to honor his contributions in the field of human rights and provide law students with a vehicle to continue his work.  The [http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lowensteinclinic.htm Lowenstein Human Rights Clinic], an outgrowth of the Project, is a clinical course in which law students participate in legal and advocacy research and writing projects for academic credit.

Lowenstein's papers are held as a special collection of the Long Beach (New York) Public Library and offer much material relative to his activities and his times. The [[Long Beach, New York]] Public Library is also named after Lowenstein (since the 1980s).

In 1980, Lowenstein received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national&lt;/ref&gt;

An area adjacent to the [[United Nations]] headquarters in New York City is named Allard K. Lowenstein Square.

In 1983, the documentary film ''Citizen: The Political Life of Allard K. Lowenstein'' was produced by Brogan De Paor, [[Mike Farrell]] and Julie Thompson and directed by Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;IMBd, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413906/fullcredits ''Citizen: The Political Life of Allard K.

Singer/songwriter [[Harry Chapin]] dedicated a live performance of his song "Remember When the Music"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harrychapin.com/music/remember.shtml|title=The Harry Chapin Archive at HarryChapin.com|website=harrychapin.com|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Lowenstein, as recorded on the album ''Bottom Line Encore Series: Harry Chapin''.

==In popular culture==

Lowenstein was portrayed by [[Brent Spiner]] in the 1984 television miniseries ''[[Robert Kennedy and His Times]]'', based on the book by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]]

The award was presented by Baroness Helena Kennedy, QC, Elena Kudimova, Anna Politkovskaya's sister, Jude Kelly, founder of WOW, Commissioner Cressida Rose Dick CBE, Emma Hopkins, OBE, Leila Alikarami (Iran), 2009 Anna Politkovskaya Award winner and Mariana Katzarova, founder of RAW in WAR.]]

The ''' Anna Politkovskaya Award''' was established in 2006 to remember and honor the Russian campaigning journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]] (1958–2006), murdered in Moscow on 7 October 2006 in order to silence her reporting about the war in Chechnya. 

The award is presented annually by the international human rights organisation, [http://www.rawinwar.org RAW in WAR (Reach All Women in War)] and honours women human rights defenders from around the world, who work in war and conflict zones, often at great personal risk.&lt;ref name=RAW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rawinwar.org/content/view/148/213/ |title=Anna Politkovskaya Award  |publisher=Reach All Women in War|accessdate = 21 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariana Katzarova, a friend and a human rights colleague of Politkovskaya, founded RAW in WAR (Reach All Women in WAR) and the Anna Politkovskaya Award in 2006 in London, after being a journalist and human rights advocate in the war zones of Kosovo, Bosnia and Chechnya.

In 2016, to mark the tenth anniversary of the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, an additional special award was presented to a woman human rights defender from Russia who, like Anna Politkovskaya and the first winner of the award, [[Natalia Estemirova]], who was murdered in Chechnya in 2009, has worked to build peace in conflict zones and help civilians trapped between opposing armed forces. The special award was presented to [[Valentina Cherevatenko]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawinwar.org/valentina/ RAW in WAR website – Valentina Cherevatenko (Russia) 2016: Winner of the Special Anna Politkovskaya Award, 6 October 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; who, since 1990, has intervened  in a succession of conflicts in the former Soviet Union, working through her organisation, the Women of the Don NGO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawinwar.org/ See RAW in WAR website, News 12 March 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Better Business Bureau''' ('''BBB'''), founded in 1912, is a private, nonprofit organization whose self-described mission is to focus on advancing marketplace trust,&lt;ref name="BBB Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Better Business Bureau Vision, Mission &amp; Vision|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/vision-mission-and-values//|publisher=Council of Better Business Bureaus|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 106 independently incorporated local BBB organizations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], coordinated under the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/ |title=Council of Better Business Bureaus – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Better Business Bureau is not affiliated with any governmental agency. Businesses that affiliate with the BBB and adhere to its standards do so through [[industry self-regulation]]. To avoid bias, the BBB's policy is to refrain from recommending or endorsing any specific business, product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/frequently-asked-questions/ |title=The Better Business Bureau FAQs and Information – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been the subject of controversy, particularly related to its alleged practice of giving higher ratings to businesses that pay a membership fee. The BBB disputes the claim that payment from businesses is required for them to receive an "A"&amp;nbsp;rating.&lt;ref name="ABC Resigned" /&gt;  Business consultant and previous national Manager of Customer Service for [[Checker Auto Parts]] Eva Love observed, "Complaining about a business to the Better Business Bureau is like complaining to the mouse's mother after a mouse steals your cheese. It will help if the wind is blowing in your direction."&lt;ref&gt;Sixty Years In The American Southwest, A. Rasmussen, J&amp;S Books, Uniontown, Wa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 400,000 local businesses in North America are accredited by the BBB.&lt;ref name=annual&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbb.org/council/about/annual-reports/|title=CBBB Annual Reports|publisher=BBB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB prospects successfully vetted businesses to become dues-paying 'accredited businesses' that pledge and continue to adhere to the BBB Code of Business Practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/about/vision-mission-and-values/ |title=BBB Code of Business Practices – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the BBB allows accredited businesses in good standing to use its trademarked logo in marketing materials.

==History==
{{Cleanup|section|reason=article sections needs major overhaul. Entire section was commented in without solving previous source issue.|date=September 2017}}

"Medical quackery and the promotions of nostrums and worthless drugs were among the most prominent abuses which led to the establishment of formal self-regulation in business and, in turn, to the creation of the NBBB."&lt;ref name=Ladimer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ladimer |first=Irving |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1256406&amp;blobtype=pdf |format=PDF |title=The Health Advertising Program of the National Better Business Bureau  |journal= A.J.P.H. |volume= 55|issue= 8|date= August 1965 |pmc=1256406 |pmid=14326419 |pages=1217–27 |doi=10.2105/ajph.55.8.1217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Better Business Bureau has been credited to several court cases, such as [[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]], initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the [[Coca-Cola Company]], in 1906 after the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] had become law. [[Samuel Candler Dobbs]], sales manager of Coca-Cola and later its president, took up the cause of [[Truth in Advertising (organization)|truth in advertising]] in the wake of those judgments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1909, Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the "Ten Commandments of Advertising," one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission,&amp;nbsp;Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World  (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus,&amp;nbsp;Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) was established.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Structure and funding==
The 112 BBBs are independently governed by their own boards of directors and must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the CBBB. The CBBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as by senior executives from major corporations, and community leaders such as academics and legal experts. Each BBB is run separately and is chiefly funded by its accredited businesses, who often serve on its board. A study by a business school dean at [[Marquette University]] found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.&lt;ref name=Parmar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/Investigating-the-Better-Business-Bureau-23879/?page=all|title= Is the BBB Too Cozy With the Firms It Monitors?|first=Neil |last=Parmar|date=September 24, 2008|work=[[SmartMoney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. CBBB receives membership dues from BBBs, which amounted to US $4,884,226 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990_pdf_archive/237/237079691/237079691_200912_990O.pdf|title=Income Tax Form 990|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute resolution procedures===
The organization's dispute resolution procedures are established by the Council of the Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no‑cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB.  The BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process/ |title=Dispute Resolution Processes and Guides – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402220704/http://www.bbb.org/us/Dispute-Resolution-Services/Process |archive-date=2012-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by the BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roos |first=Dave |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/better-business-bureau4.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "File a Complaint with a BBB " |publisher=Money.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternative entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoples-law.org/node/901 |title=Alternatives to Going to Court &amp;#124; The People's Law Library |publisher=Peoples-law.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a BBB receives a consumer dispute, the BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of the BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that the BBB compiles scores based upon their ability to collect their money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Associated Press |author2=Patrick Preston |url=http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |title=Better Business Bureau Changes Ratings System Following Criticism |publisher=NBC 4i |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130002526/http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2010/nov/19/better-business-bureau-changes-ratings-system-foll-ar-296803/ |archive-date=2013-01-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Advertising Division====
The '''National Advertising Division''' of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in the United States and Canada reviews factual claims made in national advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2221968/|title=How New Is "New"? How Improved Is "Improved"?|first=Seth|last=Stevenson|date=13 July 2009|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; They offer alternative [[dispute resolution]] services for advertisers, typically reaching a conclusion within 90 days of a filing.  Compliance with findings is voluntary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Rating system and accreditation==
Until 2008, the BBB rated companies "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory." On January 1, 2009, the BBB moved to a new system based on a school-style A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to F rating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enewspf.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7686:new-bbb-letter-grade-a-through-f-ratings-system-helps-businesses-evaluate-suppliers-improve-operations-&amp;catid=88888960&amp;Itemid=88889783 |title=New BBB Letter-Grade A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Through F Ratings System Helps Businesses Evaluate Suppliers, Improve Operations |publisher=eNews Park Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16 factors have been posted on each business review since the program's inception&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/business-reviews/ratings/ |title=What are BBB Ratings? |publisher=BBB |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050613/http://www.bbb.org/business-reviews/ratings/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the details on the points awarded as well.&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"/&gt; Initially there was a 17th factor worth 4&amp;nbsp;points for businesses that were Accredited and paid a fee to BBB.  That process was changed in November 2010 in response to criticism in the media and from the Connecticut attorney general who accused BBB of using "pay to play" tactics.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"/&gt;

If a business chooses not to provide basic information, such as size and start date, the BBB may assign a not-rated (NR) rating.&lt;ref name="What are BBB Ratings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/pressroom/2010/11/the-better-business-bureau-checks-up-on-companies-but-who-checks-up-on-the-better-business-bureau-brian-ross-investigates-on.html |title=The Better Business Bureau checks up on companies but who checks up on the Better Business Bureau? |publisher=blogs.absnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low rating due solely to a company not providing information would read: "BBB does not have sufficient background information on this business."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A business is eligible for BBB accreditation if it meets, in the opinion of the BBB, the "BBB Standards for Trust".&lt;ref name="BBB Mission"/&gt; There are eight BBB Standards for Trust that the BBB expects its accredited businesses to adhere to build trust ("maintain a positive track record in the marketplace"), advertise honestly, tell the truth, be transparent, honor promises, be responsive (address marketplace disputes), safeguard privacy (protect consumer data) and embody integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-standards-for-trust/ |title=The Better Business Bureau Standards for Trust – U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323122353/http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-standards-for-trust |archive-date=2012-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Connecticut Attorney General|Attorney General of Connecticut]] demanded that the BBB stop using its weighted letter grade system, calling it "potentially harmful and misleading" to consumers.&lt;ref name=Rhee/&gt; Responding to the Attorney General of Connecticut and others, the BBB has since modified its letter grade system.&lt;ref name="nbc4i1"/&gt;

==Criticism==

In 2010 ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' reported in a segment titled "The Best Ratings Money Can Buy" about the irregularities in BBB ratings.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2020"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/business-bureau-best-ratings-money-buy/story?id=12123843|title=BBB Ratings|publisher=[[ABC News|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They reported that a man created two dummy companies which received ''A+'' ratings as soon as he had paid the membership fee. They also reported that business owners were told that the only way to improve their rating was by paying the fee. In one case a ''C'' was turned to an ''A'' immediately after a payment and in another case a C‑minus became an ''A+''. The chef [[Wolfgang Puck]] said that some of his businesses receive ''F''{{'s}} because he refuses to pay a fee. [[Ritz Carlton]], which does not belong either, also receives Fs for not responding to its complaints.&lt;ref name=Rhee&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror Group Gets 'A' Rating From Better Business Bureau? Consumer Watchdog Accused of Running 'Pay for Play' Scheme With Grading System|first1=JOSEPH |last1=Rhee |first2=Brian |last2=Ross |date=November 12, 2010 |work=20/20|url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=12123843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has stated the BBB ratings system will cease awarding points to businesses for being BBB members.&lt;ref&gt;"A Message from the President of CBBB", November 18, 2010, reproduced at {{cite web |url=http://reloroundtable.com/blog/examinercom/bbb-revises-rating-system-to-regain-consumer-trust/ |title=BBB revises rating system to regain consumer trust |publisher=RELO RoundTable |accessdate=2010-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national BBB's executive committee voted to address the public's perception of the ratings system. It voted that the BBB ratings system would no longer give additional points to businesses because they are accredited.&lt;!--The BBB ratings system no longer gives additional points to businesses who pay accreditation fees. -- Commented out as this fails verification -- warranting an {{fv}} tag. -- The PR says the system WILL change, not that it HAS changed.

In Canada, CBC News reported in 2010 that Canadian BBBs were downgrading the ratings scores of businesses who stopped paying their dues. For example, a moving business who had an ''A'' rating and had been a BBB member for 20&amp;nbsp;years, dropped to a D‑minus rating when they allegedly no longer wanted to pay dues.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News, The National, November 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

BBBs have been accused of unduly protecting companies. If a branch does not act reasonably on behalf of a consumer, a complaint may be filed with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Moreover, recent reports have suggested that the Austin chapter of the Better Business Bureau refused to resolve complaints against companies if customers do not pay a $70 mediation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/your-money/13haggler.html?hp|title=Complaint Resolved? Well, Not Exactly|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=13 March 2011|first=David|last=Segal|date=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, while the BBB publishes names of corporations, it withholds the names of individuals lodging complaints.  The BBB also publishes the complainant's claim without any attempt at verification.  The net result is that the BBB can be used to launch anonymous attacks on businesses with the onus falling on the business to refute any untrue or exaggerated claims made by the complainant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Criticism on case resolutions ===
It has been reported that the BBB encourages and solicits money from the very businesses they monitor which, again, raises the question of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feefighters.com/blog/the-bbb-is-a-scam/ |title=Report: Better Business Bureau BBB &amp; CBBB |author=FeeFighters |date=July 22, 2011 |publisher=FeeFighters.com |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB states that they hold their Accredited businesses to a higher standard, as outlined in their Accreditation standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-accreditation-standards/ |title=BBB Online Business Best Practices – - U.S. BBB |publisher=Bbb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063642/http://www.bbb.org/us/bbb-accreditation-standards |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is likely the reason for such backronyms as, "Better for Businesses Bureau" and "Bribes from Businesses Bureau," popular nicknames for the organization presumably stemming from the frustration regarding the above criticisms.

===Integration of US and Canadian operations===
On August 16, 2011 the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced the formal integration of operations in the United States &amp; Canada, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations|title=Login|publisher=|access-date=2015-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122223359/http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBBB Board of Directors voted earlier this month on the integration plan. The Council of Better Business Bureaus is the international headquarters of the BBB system and the governing body that licenses local BBBs and provides support services to increase their effectiveness.

According to the statement, integration marks the way "...for an improved customer experience for those who purchase goods and services across the border." "The U.S. and Canada remain each other's largest trading partners," noted Stephen A. Cox, President and CEO of CBBB. "We are really one North American marketplace, and the BBB system now reflects that. Not only will it be easier for consumers to check out businesses in either country, it will be simpler for them to file a complaint or resolve a dispute."

The move was supported by the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus (CCBBB). "Given the advances in technology and the globalization of services, it no longer makes sense to maintain two separate systems," said M. Jean Lemyre, chair of the CCBBB. "The vast majority of consumers initially contact BBB through the Internet. Aligning BBB services into one integrated system will be more efficient for businesses in Canada, and will ensure that consumers continue to receive the high quality of services they've come to expect from BBB."&lt;ref name="thespec.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2164412-hamilton-better-business-bureau-vows-to-stay-open/|title=Hamilton Better Business Bureau vows to stay open|date=24 August 2011|publisher=|via=The Hamilton Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|title=Login|publisher=|access-date=2015-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122223359/http://www.bbb.org/council/migration/bbb-news-releases/2011/08/better-business-bureau-integrates-us-and-canadian-operations/|archive-date=2015-01-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windsorchamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Oct-31-2011-Battle-brews-over-business-accreditation-in-Windsor.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122231908/http://www.windsorchamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Oct-31-2011-Battle-brews-over-business-accreditation-in-Windsor.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBB Revokes Trademark Authorization from four Canadian offices===
The Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) revoked the BBB name &amp; trademark from four Canadian Better Business Bureaus. The CBBB said it made the move to withdraw trademark authorization from the offices in Hamilton, Windsor, Montreal and St. John's after determining these four Canadian offices did not meet the defined standards of operation.

CBBB realigned the boundaries of its affected Canadian offices and folded them into larger offices. Hamilton has been gathered under the banner of the BBB's Kitchener office,&lt;ref name="thespec.com"/&gt; while the territories in SW Ontario (including Windsor) are now part of the Western Ontario region&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"/&gt; based in London, ON.

The former President of the Better Business Bureau of Windsor and South Western Ontario claims that he continues to operate under the name [[IntegrityLink]] in 2011, although services offered under that name have not been verified and the CBBB maintains concerns that some of the former BBB's continue to make use of proprietary information to which they are no longer entitled.&lt;ref name="thespec.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsorchamber.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="windsor-star-2011-08-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=d2d6c03b-cd79-47fc-8446-2151aa050783 |title=Local BBB president not happy with change |first=Kristie |last=Pearce |newspaper=The Windsor Star |date=August 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903070737/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=d2d6c03b-cd79-47fc-8446-2151aa050783 |archivedate=September 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011 the Hamilton, Montreal &amp; St. John's offices have also changed their names or closed following what they termed a takeover by the U.S.-based Council of Better Business Bureaus.&lt;ref name="toronto-star-2011-09-07" /&gt;  The Hamilton, Ontario BBB adopted the name Canadian Businesses and Charity Bureau.&lt;ref name="spectator-2011"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Catholic Civil Rights League''' is a Canadian lay Catholic organization which makes statements in the media about Catholicism and which lobbies the government and takes part in court cases to advocate policies in line with its interpretation of Catholic teachings. The CCRL has played a prominent role in Canadian social debates surrounding [[abortion]], [[same-sex marriage]] and [[prostitution]], where it has argued from a [[social conservative]] standpoint, in line with [[Catholic social teaching]]. The organization works closely with other Catholic organizations on social issues that matter for the Church.

==Media==
The League opposes what it views as anti-Catholicism and anti-religion in the media. It responds to criticism of Catholic teaching in the media and to comedy programs about Catholic characters which it views as blasphemous, sometimes filing complaints with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) and Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

==Court and tribunal cases==
CCRL has been involved in a number of cases which relate to its interpretation of Catholicism, opposing [[same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] in several cases in the late 90s and early 2000s, and opposing the Ontario court's decision in the "three-parent case" which determined that a child's second custodial parent could become his legal parent without a non-custodial biological parent surrendering parental status. It has also taken a socially conservative position in a case challenging Canada's restrictions on prostitution, and advocated for policies protecting discrimination and hate speech against LGBT people, and displays of graphic anti-abortion posters where not permitted, as an expression of religious belief.

==Lobbying==
CCRL does not directly campaign for candidates. It has made presentations to parliamentary committees opposing assisted suicide in the mid-90s and at present, and same-sex marriage in 2005.

The '''Christian Values Party''' ({{lang-sv|Kristna värdepartiet}}) is a [[Christian right|Christian conservative]] party in Sweden. It was founded in January 2014 in opposition to the mainstream [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]]. The party opposes [[abortion]], [[LGBT parenting|same-sex]] or single adoption, and sex education, and advocates state policy to promote exclusively heterosexual marriage, homeschooling and parochial schooling, and sharper penalties for severe violent and sexual offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kristnavardepartiet.se/principprogram.html|title=Kristna värdepartiet - Principprogram|publisher=Kristna värdepartiet|date=29 September 2014|accessdate=25 May 2015|language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Citizinvestor''' is an American-based [[civic crowdfunding]] website that describes itself as a "crowdfunding and [[civic engagement]] platform for local government projects."

==Overview==

Citizinvestor is an online [[crowdfunding]] platform specifically focused on raising money for public projects and community [[infrastructure]], started in [[Tampa, Florida]] by Jordan Raynor, Tony DeSisto, Erik Rapprich, and Joy Randels.&lt;ref name=Tampa&gt;{{cite news|last=Morelli|first=Keith|title=Kayak commute dream is a citizen-investor idea|url=http://tbo.com/news/kayak-commute-dream-is-a-citizen-investor-idea-510157|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=Tampa Tribune|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techpresident.com/news/22626/kickstarter-inspiring-civically-minded-crowdfunding-sites|title=Three Kickstarter-Inspired, Civically Minded Crowdfunding Sites|last=Neubauer|first=Miranda|date=31 July 2012|website=TechPresident|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20130414193053/http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/citizinvestor-launches-in-philadelphia/19234/3|title=Citizinvestor Launches in Philadelphia|date=2013-04-14|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in partnership with the city of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mashable.com/2012/10/10/city-crowdfunding/#9qcVtK84DGqf|title=Crowdfunding Startups Let You Be Your City's Urban Planner|last=Drell|first=Lauren|work=Mashable|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.phillymag.com/the_philly_post/2012/09/14/philadelphia-citizinvestor-citizens/|title=With “Citizinvestors,” Philly Will Try to Crowdfund its Way to a Better Future – Philadelphia Magazine|last=Mathis|first=Joel|date=2012-09-14|work=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was inspired by a case in [[Davis Islands (Tampa)|Davis Islands]] where the community wanted a swimming pool repaired, but the city did not have the finances to do so;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1680600/citizinvestor-crowdfunding-for-community-projects|title=Citizinvestor: Crowdfunding For Community Projects|last=Schiller|first=Ben|date=2012-10-01|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizens successfully raised the funds with events and going door-to-door and this became the model for Citizinvestor.&lt;ref name="Tampa" /&gt; The founders hope to "spark a rise of [[Micro-philanthropy|micro philanthropists]]".&lt;ref name="Tampa" /&gt; The platform allows citizens to promote independent projects through a [[petition]] process and also works with city officials to crowdfund civic projects that were planned but abandoned due to budget constraints.&lt;ref name="Tampa" /&gt;

While anyone can start petitions for new projects, projects can only be submitted by government entities, usually [[Local government|municipal governments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Donations are [[tax deductible]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and donors are not charged if their project does not reach its funding target.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unlike other crowdfunding platforms, no perks/rewards are offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The site's initial focus was on projects: between $10,000 and $20,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Citizinvestor also offers a [[software as a service]] product, Citizinvestor Connect. Local [[municipalities]], [[public-private partnerships]], [[Economic development organization|economic development organizations]], and [[nonprofits]] can license the platform and customize it for their organization, leveraging it to raise funds and engage with their community.

The '''Core Issues Trust''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Christian]] organisation, which focuses on issues of homosexuality, both Christian and non-Christian.

Core Issues Trust offers support to those seeking to change homosexual behaviour and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does CORE claim to 'cure' homosexuality?|url=http://www.core-issues.org/learning/mod/resource/view.php?id=110|publisher=Core Issues Trust|accessdate=12 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824204835/http://www.core-issues.org/learning/mod/resource/view.php?id=110|archivedate=24 August 2012|date=8 July 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trust considers human sexuality in both men and women to be fluid; the brain malleable; and that sexual identity, feelings and patterning may change. 

In April, 2012, the group received disparaging media coverage following a public campaign, which included advertisements on [[London buses]] claiming that therapy could change sexual orientation. Although the campaign was passed by the [[Committee of Advertising Practice]], it was subsequently banned by London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/gay-cure-bus-advert-banned-174625264.html '''Yahoo News''' - Gay Cure Bus Advert Banned]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/12/anti-gay-adverts-boris-johnson '''The Guardian, April 13, 2012''' - Boris Johnson bans 'gay cure' bus adverts]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate group''' is two or more [[individual]]s, usually in the form of a [[family]], [[clan]], [[organization]], or [[company]]. A major distinction between different [[political culture]]s is whether they believe the [[individual]] is the basic unit of their society, in which case they are [[Individualism|individualistic]], or whether corporate groups are the basic unit of their society, in which case they are [[corporatism|corporatist]].&lt;ref&gt;William Stewart, ''Understanding Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;

In social psychology and biology, research shows that [[penguin]]s reside in densely populated corporate breeding colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Murchison, Carl Allanmore; Allee, Warder Clyde. ''A handbook of social psychology, Volume 1''. 1967. Pp. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, different [[culture]]s have different [[belief]]s about what the basic unit of the culture is. These assumptions affect their beliefs about what the proper concern of the [[government]] should be.

[[File:Nero Lugdunum sestertius 691535.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nero]]nian coin with the reverse depicting the goddesses [[Annona (goddess)|Annona]], the personification of the grain supply, and [[Ceres (goddess)|Ceres]], whose temple was the site of the dole]]

In [[ancient Rome]], the Roman government used the term '''''Cura Annonae''''' ("care for the grain supply"), in honour of their goddess [[annona (goddess)|Annona]], to describe the import and distribution of grain to the residents of the city of Rome.  Rome imported most of the grain consumed by its population, estimated to number one million people by the second century CE.  Most of the grain was distributed through commercial or non-subsidized channels, but a dole of subsidized or free grain, and later bread, was provided by the government to about 200,000 of the poorer residents of the city of Rome. 

A regular and predictable supply of grain and the grain dole were part of the Roman leadership's strategy of maintaining tranquility among a restive urban population by providing them with what the poet [[Juvenal]] sarcastically called "[[bread and circuses]]."  In 22 CE, the emperor [[Tiberius]] said that the Cura Annonae if neglected would be 'the utter ruin of the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickman|first=G.E.|title=The Grain Trade Under the Roman Empire|journal=Memoirs from the American Academy in Rome|date=1980|volume=36|pages=263}}. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most important sources of the grain, mostly [[durum]] [[wheat]], were [[Egypt]], North Africa (21st century [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]]), and [[Sicily]]. The logistics of moving the grain by sea from those places to Rome required many hundreds of ships, some very large, and an extensive system for collecting the grain and distributing it inside Rome itself.  The archaeological records of the grain trade are sparse, due to the  
perishability of grain which has made its detection difficult for archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Unlike, for example, the archaeological remains of jars or containers ([[amphora]]) used to transport wine and olive oil of which thousands have been found.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The population of the city of Rome declined precipitously during the 5th, the last century of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and 6th centuries CE. It is unknown when the Cura Annonae ended.  It may have persisted into the 6th century.    

[[File:Europe 180ad roman trade map.png|thumb|right|300px|Roman trade routes, 180 CE.]]
==History of the grain dole==
The city of Rome grew rapidly in the centuries of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]], reaching a population approaching one million in the second century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson J.W., Ortman S.G.,
Lobo J. (2017) "Urbanism and the division of labour in the Roman Empire." J. R. Soc. Interface 14, p. 10. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0367], accessed 5 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the city grew beyond the capacity of the nearby rural areas to meet the food needs of the city.  In addition to the need for commercial imports of grain to Rome, free or subsidized grain was distributed to a large percentage of the Roman population.  

In the early centuries of the Republic, the Roman government intervened sporadically to distribute free or subsidized grain to its population.  Regular distribution began in 123 BCE with a grain law proposed by [[Gaius Gracchus]] and approved by the Roman popular assembly. Adult male citizens (over 14 years of age) of Rome were entitled to buy at a below-market price five "modii", about {{convert|33|kg|lb}}, of grain monthly. Approximately 40,000 adult males were eligible for the grain. In 62 and 58 BCE the number of Romans eligible for grain was expanded and grain became free to its recipients.  The numbers of those receiving free or subsidized grain expanded to an estimated 320,000 before being reduced to 150,000 by [[Julius Caesar]] and then set at 200,000 by [[Augustus Caesar]], a number that remained more or less stable until near the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, Paul, "The Food Supply of the Capital," in ''The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome, '' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; 
Cristofori, Alessandro "Grain Distribution on Late Republican Rome," pp 146-151. [https://www.academia.edu/853118/Grain_Distribution_in_Late_Republican_Rome], accessed 17 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 3rd century CE, the dole of grain was replaced by bread, probably during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211 CE).  Severus also began providing [[olive oil]] to residents of Rome, and later the emperor [[Aurelian]] (270-275) ordered the distribution of [[wine]] and [[pork]].&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, pp. 266-267&lt;/ref&gt; The doles of bread, olive oil, wine, and pork apparently continued until near the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, although the decline in the population of the city of Rome reduced the quantities of food required.&lt;ref&gt;Linn, Jason (Fall 2012), "The Roman Grain Supply, 441-455", ''Journal of Late Antiquity'', Vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 298-299, and note 3, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The dole in the early Roman Empire is estimated to account for 15 to 33 percent of the total grain imported and consumed in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, David and Temin, Peter (May 2007), "The Organization of the Grain Trade in the Early Roman Empire," ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 60, No. 2, p. 316. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Supply==
By the late 200s BCE, grain was being shipped to the city of Rome from [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]. In the first century BCE, the three major sources of wheat were Sardinia, Sicily, and North [[Africa]], i.e. the region centered on the ancient city of [[Carthage]], present day [[Tunisia]].  With the incorporation of [[Egypt]] into the Roman empire and the rule of the emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BCE-14 CE), [[Egypt]] became the main source of supply of grain for Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; By the 70s CE, the historian [[Josephus]] was claiming that Africa fed Rome for eight months of the year and Egypt only four.  Although that statement may ignore grain from Sicily, and overestimate the importance of Africa, there is little doubt among historians that Africa and Egypt were the most important sources of grain for Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), pp 263-264&lt;/ref&gt; To help assure that the grain supply would be adequate for Rome, in the first century BCE, Graccus settled 6,000 colonists near Carthage, giving them about {{convert|25|ha|acre}} each to grow grain.&lt;ref&gt;Cristofori, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grain made into bread was, by far, the most important element in the Roman diet.  Several scholars have attempted to compute the total amount of grain need to supply the city of Rome.  Rickman estimated that Rome needed 40 million ''modii'' (200,000 metric tons) of grain per year to feed its population.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), p. 264. A modii of grain weighs six to seven kilograms.&lt;/ref&gt;  Erdkamp estimated that the amount needed would be at least 150,000 metric tons, calculating that each resident of the city consumed {{convert|200|kg|lb}} of grain per year.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;  The total population of Rome assumed in calculating these estimates was between 750,000 and one million people.  David Mattingly and Gregory Aldrete &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome, The Archaeology of the Ancient City, The Feeding of Imperial Rome, Editors John Coulston and Hazel Dodge, 2000, reprinted 2011, pp. 142-165, {{ISBN|978-0-947816-55-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the amount of imported grain at 237,000 metric tons for 1 million inhabitants;&lt;ref&gt;p. 154 (they also estimated the amount of wine and oil; and the number of shiploads, an average of 250 tons of products per ship, to carry at 1,692 and the number of ships arriving daily at 17 per day from April to September, 4 months, 100 days (sic!) not 120)&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of grain would provide 2,326 calories daily per person not including other foods such as meats, seafood, fruit, legumes, vegetable and dairy.

==Shipping== 
[[File:Haifa-maritime-museum-Roman-grain-ship-2c-1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A model of a small Roman grain ship. Large ones had three [[mast (sailing)|masts]].]]
[[File:Plan of Alexandria c 30 BC Otto Puchstein 1890s EN.svg|thumb|left|250px|Alexandria, Egypt and its port, 30 BCE.]]
The [[shipping lane]]s that connected Rome with its centers of grain supply (Egypt, North Africa, Sicily and perhaps other places.) had strategic importance. Whoever controlled the grain supply had an important measure of control over the city of Rome. Rome was dependent upon the prompt arrival of imported grain.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;  

The provision of grain to Rome was a major shipping and administrative task for the Romans.  It was not feasible to supply Rome's needs by land transport. It was "cheaper to ship grain from one end of the Mediterranean to the other" by sea than "to cart it by land some 75 miles [120 kilometers]."&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a large fleet of sea-worthy grain ships was required to bring grain from relatively nearby Sicily and Sardinia, more distant North Africa, and much more distant Egypt.  In straight line distances (and sailing ships did not normally travel in straight lines), distances from Sicily to Rome were more than {{convert|500|km|mile}}, from Carthage in North Africa more than {{convert|600|km|mi}}, and from Egypt more than {{convert|2000|km|mi}}. Sailing times from the ports of Ostia (near Rome) and [[Puteoli]] (near Naples) to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt might be as brief as 14 days.  Returning to Rome would take much longer as the winds were adverse and ships had to hug coastlines and travel in a round-about manner.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; "The voyage...from Alexandria to Rome was a continuous fight against foul winds." [[Lionel Casson]] estimated that average time for the voyage was nearly 70 days.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, Lionel (1950), "The Isis and her Voyage," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association,'' Vol. 81, pp. 50-51. downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Grain was packed into sacks, rather than carried loose in the holds of ships.&lt;Ref&gt;Casson, Lionel, "Trade in the Ancient World," http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/anthro/jbeatty/CORESEA/TRADE_IN_ANCIENT_WORLD.pdf, accessed 22 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Casson estimates the outward freighters "raced down from Ostia or Pozzuoli to Alexandria with the wind on their heels in ten days to two weeks" and the voyage back laden with grain "...took at least a month and on occasion two or more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Casson |first1=Lionel |title=The ancient mariners : seafarers and sea fighters of the Mediterranean in ancient times |date=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 0-691-01477-9 |pages=207-208 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given also the time needed for loading and unloading the grain ships by hand, the ships traversing the Egypt to Rome route likely only completed one round trip per year. Several round trips per year could be accomplished from North Africa or Sicily. Spain was also an important source of olive oil, and possibly grain.&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, op. cit. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grain from Egypt.''' The harvest season for grain in ancient Egypt was from April to early June.  The annual [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile Flood]] began in June and thus harvest had to be finished before the river's waters covered the land. The grain in Egypt was apparently acquired by Rome as a tax on farmers.  The grain was moved mostly by barge on the various [[distributaries]] of the [[Nile River]] to [[Lake Mareotis]] bordering the southern part of the city of Alexandria. There it was inspected for quality and, when accepted, transported by canal to the [[port of Alexandria]], the Great Harbor, where it was loaded on ships for Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Given, Michael (2004), ''The Archaeology of the Colonized,'' New York: Routledge, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grain from North Africa.''' Twenty-nine Mediterranean ports (not including Egypt) possibly exporting grain to Rome have been found by archaeologists in northern Africa, ranging in location from 21st century Libya to Morocco. The largest was probably Carthage. Given the lack of navigable rivers in the region grain had to be transported to these ports by land, suggesting that, because of the cost of land transport, the grain was grown in close proximity to the ports.  The grain was probably transported to the ports in four-wheeled carts drawn by four oxen, each cart carrying {{convert|350|kg|lb}} to {{convert|500|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Grain from ancient Cyraenica (Libya) may have been important because an early harvest there could supply Rome before other grain-growing regions had been harvested.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David L. (Oct 2014), "Africa in the Roman Empire: Connectivity, the Economy, and Artificial Port Structures," ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 118, No. 4, pp. 565-593&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival each year of the first fleets of grain ships was an eagerly awaited event in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The last leg.''' On arrival in the post of Ostia, at the mouth of the [[Tiber River]], the grain was off-loaded from its transport ship and loaded onto barges which were hauled up the river by animal or man power to the city of Rome, approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} upriver.&lt;ref&gt;Boetto, Giulia, "Merchant Vessels and Maritime Commerce in Roman Times," [https://www2.rgzm.de/navis/Themes/Commercio/CommerceEnglish.htm], accessed 28 Sep 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival in Rome, the grain was stored in large warehouses, called ''horrea,'' until needed. Most of the horrea from the 1st century CE onwards were state-owned.&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp (1980), pp. 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
Hundreds or even thousands of ships were required to transport grain to Rome. The government of Rome encouraged building large ships for grain transport.  Some had a capacity of carrying 50,000 modii (350 tons) or even more.  Ships of much larger capacity are suggested in [[Lucian]] and the [[Acts of the Apostles]].  Grain transport presented special problems.  Grain must be kept cool and dry to prevent sprouting and infestations of pests and mold and prevented from shifting from side to side in the hold of the ship which could impact the seaworthiness of the transport ship. Grain that was wet could sink the ship by expanding and splitting the sideboards of the hull.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman (1980), pp. 261-263&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rome-Portus-Vatican-Fresco.gif|thumb|right|250px|An idealized plan of [[Portus]], constructed about 113 CE to serve the city of Rome.]]
[[Lucian]], c. 150 CE, described a very large grain ship taking shelter in the port of [[Piraeus]], [[Greece]].  The [[Isis (ship)|Isis]] was {{convert|55|m|ft}} in length and had a beam of more than a quarter of that.  From the deck to the bottom of the cargo hold was {{convert|13|m|ft}}. Casson calculated that the cargo capacity was 1200 to 1300 metric tons of grain.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, (1950), pp. 43, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;an estimate that has not been verified by archaeological findings.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, Geoffrey (2008), "Ports, Ships, and Power in the Roman World," ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Supplementary Volumes,'' Vol. 6 ''The Maritime World of Ancient Rome,'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The grain ships were propelled entirely by sails, and not by banks of oarsmen as were Roman warships. 

Casson reconstructed a voyage from Alexandria, Egypt to Rome.  A grain ship leaving Alexandria, would first steer north east to [[Cyprus]], then follow the south coast of [[Asia Minor]] (21st century Turkey) westwards, and proceed along the south shore of [[Crete]], stopping as needed at one of several ports enroute.  From Crete the grain ship would strike out across the Mediterranean Sea westwards toward the island of [[Malta]], the objective being [[Syracuse, Sicily]] and the [[Straits of Messina]].  After passing through the Straits, large grain ships would dock at the port of Puteoli, near [[Naples]], or after port improvements about 113 CE, at Ostia near Rome. From Puteoli the cargo of the large ships would be off-loaded onto smaller ships and taken to Ostia. Smaller ships coming from North Africa or Egypt could proceed directly to Ostia for unloading.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, pp. 47-50&lt;/ref&gt;        

'''The voyage of Paul'''. The experience of [[Paul the Apostle]] in 62 CE illustrates the dangers of the voyage from Egypt to Rome. Paul boarded a Rome-bound grain ship in Asia Minor. The ship was large, with 276 people aboard, counting both crew and passengers. The voyage was late in the sailing season, after the [[Day of Atonement]] (which is usually in early October) and the winds were adverse.  Following the usual route along the south shore of Crete, Paul's ship was blown off course and wrecked on the island of [[Malta]]. He spent the winter on Malta, then proceeded onward to Puteoli and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Nicolle (1990), "The Ship of Saint Paul: Historical Background," ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol 53, No. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ship owners.''' The ships involved in the grain trade were privately owned.  The Roman government provided subsidies and tax exclusions to encourage ship-building and the grain trade and took the risk of shipping on itself by providing a form of insurance to ship owners.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Michael and Ryan, Neal (2009), "The Roman Empire and the Grain Fleets: Contracting out Public Services in Antiquity," pp. 9-12.

==Milling and baking==
[[File:Barbegal mill 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Barbegal|sixteen overshot wheels at Barbegal]] are considered the biggest [[ancient history|ancient]] mill complex. Their capacity was sufficient to feed the whole nearby city of [[Arles]]]]
[[File:Roda de Vitruvi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A model of a water-powered Roman grain mill.]]
[[File:Ancient roman bread Pompeii Museum Boscoreale.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A fossilized loaf of Roman Bread.]]

Bread was the most important item in the Roman diet.  A shortage of grain to make bread, or a large increase in the price of grain, could -- and often did -- have serious political consequences, including riots of the populace which impacted the stability of the Roman government.  A dole of grain was given monthly to the poorer people of Rome. Grain was sold to those not qualifying for the dole, or to those who needed grain in addition to what they received in the dole.  The precise details of how grain was marketed in Rome, however, are a "major puzzle."&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, pp. 262-263, 268-270&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early centuries of the Roman republic and Empire, the individuals receiving the grain took it to one of many small flour mills in the city to have it ground into flour and then either baked the flour into bread at a home oven, a communal oven, or one of the numerous bakeries in every district of the city. Hand-driven mills for grain were known in the 5th century BCE in Greece, and presumably spread to Rome shortly.  Hand-driven mills had only small capactity of grinding grain into flour, serving an individual household or a few households. Animal driven mills (usually using donkeys) with a much larger capacity appeared in Rome by the 3rd century BCE, and the establishment of bakeries probably accompanied the adoption of animal driven mills. [[Watermill|Water driven mills]] with still greater capacity were first utilized in the 1st century BCE, but their development required a large investment in infrastructure, especially of [[Roman aqueducts|aqueducts]], and their use to grind nearly all of the grain for the city of Rome did not come until the late 2nd or 3rd centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;"Roman Mills," ''Ancient Encyclopedia'', [https://www.ancient.eu/article/907/roman-mills/kl], accessed 1 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Rabun (2010), "Bread and Waterr; Septimus Severus and the Rise of the curator Aquarum et Miniciae," ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome,'' Vol 55, pp. 199-200. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A steady supply of water was needed for watermills and this came from the [[Aqua Traiana]], an aqueduct bringing water some {{convert|40|km|mi}} from springs near [[Lake Bracciano]] to [[Janiculum]] hill just outside the walls of the city of Rome. The aqueduct was inaugurated in 109 CE and the water it carried was used initially as drinking and bathing water.&lt;ref&gt;"Trajan Inaugurates Aqua Traiana", ''History Channel,''   https://www.historychannel.com.au/this-day-in-history/trajan-inaugurates-aqua-traiana/, accessed 2 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt; A famine (and resultant riots) in 190 CE caused by corruption in the grain distribution system influenced the Roman government under Emperor [[Septimus Severus]] to intervene and convert the distribution of grain to the populace into the distribution of flour. The watermills constructed at Janiculum "were intended to centralize, regularize, and perhaps even deprivatize the city's milling operations."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 204,209&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the date when the watermills came into operation vary, but it was probably in the early 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;      

The conversion of a grain supply for the citizens of the city of Rome to a flour supply carried with it a host of problems. Flour is much more perishable than grain, and its distribution would have to carried out more often. Little is known about the initial distribution system for the flour produced by the watermills. The Emperor [[Aurelian]] (270-275 CE) is usually credited with changing or completing the change of the food distribution system from grain or flour to bread, and adding olive oil, salt, and pork to the products distributed to the populace. These products had been distributed sporadically before Aurelian. Aurelian is also credited with increasing the size of the loaves of bread without increasing the price of a loaf, a measure that was undoubtedly popular with the Romans who were not receiving free bread and other products through the dole.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alaric (2004), ''Aurelian and the Third Century'', London: Routledge, pp, 139-140&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century CE, Rome had 290 granaries and warehouses and 254 bakeries which were regulated and monitored by the state and given privileges to ensure their cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, James J. (2009), ''The Ruin of the Roman Empire,'' New York: Ecco, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Cura Annonae==
The population of the city of Rome was at its peaked at possibly more than one million people from the late 1st century to the 3rd century CE and thereafter declined by 400 CE to 700,000-800,000, between 400,000 to 500,000 in 452, and thereafter to a population estimated at only 100,000 in 500 CE, declining still further thereafter in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its "decreasing population, smaller army, and more land to feed its population,"&lt;ref&gt;Linn, jason (Fall 2012), "The Roman Grain Supply, 442-455," ''Journal of Late Antiquity,'' Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 320-321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twine, Kevin (1992), "The City in Decline: Rome in Late Antiquity," ''Middle States Geographer,'' Vol. 25, [https://msaag.aag.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/26_Twine.pdf], accessed 2 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Rome did not need many of its watermills, storehouses, bakeries, and port and transportation facilities.  Writing in the early 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] noted the large decrease in the population and the existence of watermills. "The vast numbers of the Roman people in old time are evidenced by the extensive Provinces from which their food supply was drawn ...and the enormous multitude of mills, which could only have been made for use, not for ornament."&lt;ref&gt; "From Quern to Computer: The History of Flour Milling, [https://millsarchive.org/explore/features-and-articles/entry/171161/from-quern-to-computer-the-history-of-flour-milling/11664], accessed 2 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The date when the Cura Annoae ended is unknown, but it may have lasted into the 6th century CE. In 500 CE, the [[Ostrogoth]] king [[Theodoric the Great]] visited Rome and promised food to its inhabitants, possibly restoring the Cura Annonae or continuing it.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt;  In 537 CE, the [[Byzantine]] General [[Belisarius]] and his army were besieged inside Rome by the [[Ostrogoths]].  The Goths blocked the aqueduct providing water for the watermills, thus limiting the capacity of Rome to make flour.  Belisarius set up a [[Ship mill|ship mill]] on the [[Tiber River]] to grind grain and continue to provide the occupants of the city with bread.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, John Bagnell (1923). ''History of the Later Roman Empire,'' Vols. I &amp; II. New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and the grain supply==
[[File:Maria in Cosmedin Statio Annonae Säulen.JPG|thumb|The columns of the ''statio annonae'' are now part of the church of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome. Another ''statio'' was found near the [[Museo Nazionale Romano#Crypta Balbi|Crypta Balbi]].]]
Throughout most of the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], the care of the grain supply ''(cura annonae)'' was part of the [[aedile|aedile's]] duties. The [[Annona (goddess)|''annona'' was personified as a goddess]], and the grain dole was distributed from the Temple of [[Ceres (goddess)|Ceres]]. As early as 440 BC, however,&lt;ref&gt;If the statement made by [[Livy]] iv. 12, 13 is correct, which has been doubted.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Roman Senate]] may have appointed a special officer called the ''[[praefectus annonae]]'' with greatly extended powers.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Annona|volume=2|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An emergency ''cura annonae'' was an important source of influence and power for [[Pompey]] in his later career. Under the [[Principate]], the position of ''praefectus annonae'' became permanent, while a range of privileges, including grants of citizenship and exemption from certain duties, were extended to ship-owners who signed contracts to transport grain to the city.

A large part of the city's supply was obtained through the free market. Prices in the city were invariably high, and merchants could count on making a profit. Grain was also collected as tax in kind from certain provinces; some of this was distributed to officials and soldiers and some was sold at market rates.

Grain supply was an important issue for the [[Gracchi]], with the elder brother [[Tiberius Gracchus]] arguing that consolidation of Roman agricultural lands in the hands of a few had pushed landless Romans into the city, where they found poverty rather than employment. The grain supply was a consistent plank in the [[populares|popularist]] platform for political leaders who appealed to the ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remembering the Roman People'' (Oxford University Press, 2009) ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; But the unpopularity of these laws led to more conservative laws attempting to rein in the ''Gracchi'' reforms such as the ''lex Octavia'' and the ''lex Terentia Cassia''.{{sfn | Garnsey | 1989 }}

The price of grain became a major issue when the Roman province of Sicily revolted repeatedly, thus pushing the price to unaffordable levels. Lowering grain prices became an important part of the political platform of the radical [[populares|popularist]] [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]], who acquired the office of [[tribune|plebeian tribune]] an unusual three times.

The official responsible for the provision of the ''alimenta'' was the ''Curator alimentorum''. During the empire, this post became an important bureaucratic position to be filled by the senatorial elite prior to achieving a [[Roman consul|consulship]]. The last known official to hold this post was [[Titus Flavius Postumius Quietus]], probably during the early 270s.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat, ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'' (2004), pg. 123. Note that Southern wrongly identifies this official as [[Titus Flavius Postumius Varus|Postumius Varus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later emperors all used free or greatly subsidized grain to keep the populace fed. The political use of the grain supply along with [[Gladiator|gladiatorial games]] and other [[ludi|entertainments]] gave rise to the saying "[[Bread and circuses]]" from one of the bitter satires of Juvenal (60-140 A.D) as if the population of the city did nothing but live off free grain and go to entertainments (circus races were actually held on average only 17 days a year and gladiatorial shows 5-7 days in a year).  The machinery of the Annona civilis became more complex over time.&lt;ref&gt;Southern, Pat, ''The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine'' (2004), pg. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[devaluation|devaluation of currency]] in the course of the third century, the army was paid in rationed supplies (''annonae'') as well as in [[Coin|specie]] from the later third century, through a cumbrous administration of collection and redistribution. The role of the state in distributing the ''annona'' remained a central feature of its unity and power: "the cessation of this state function in the fifth century was a major factor leading to economic fragmentation, as was the end of the grain requisition for the city of Rome"&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, ''The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity AD 395-600'', 1993:84.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by [[Tunahan Kuzu]] and [[Selçuk Öztürk]], two Turkish-Dutch members of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], after leaving the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] on 13 November 2014. On 9 February 2015, they gave their parliamentary group the name Denk and published a political manifesto for the establishment of a movement for migrants and a "tolerant and solidary society" which, among other things, calls for a "racism registry".

In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 parliamentary election]], Denk secured three seats, ensuring that Kuzu, and Öztürk would remain in parliament. The third seat is occupied by [[Farid Azarkan]].

The movement drew up a political manifesto in February 2015, from which the political party Thinking Netherlands (Denk) emerged in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bewegingdenk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/manifest-denk.pdf |format=PDF |title=Een Nieuke Politieke Beweging |publisher=Bewegingdenk.nl |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bewegingdenk.nl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bewegingdenk.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Verkiezingsprogramma_DENK_2017-2021.pdf |format=PDF |title=Denkend Aan Nederland |publisher=Bewegingdenk.nl |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=September 2018}}

The Denk programme argues for the following five points:
*a [[toleration|tolerant]] society in which we accept each other.
*a caring society in which we look out for each other.
*a learning society in which we utilize everyone's talents.
*a [[sustainability|sustainable society]] where we have to think about our environment.
*a just society, promoting [[social justice|international justice]].

The movement wants to establish a monument in memory of labour, and they want knowledge of migration history as a key target in education. They propose that the term "[[social integration|integration]]" should be replaced by the word "acceptance". The movement would abolish the term "immigrant". It notes that people with a non-western background are less likely to find a job or internship and often have negative experiences with law enforcement. The manifesto states that racism in the Netherlands is [[Structural racism|structural]] and [[Institutional racism|institutional]] in nature and therefore wants a so-called "racism registry" to be set up, in which manifestations of racism are registered.

The movement proposes that in education, [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] in the classroom is commensurate with the diversity of the class (including the teacher). The movement has a policy that in every school in the Netherlands, both in primary and secondary education, study of Chinese, Arabic, and Turkish must be introduced as optional subjects. According to the movement, education in these languages will be useful for the country's [[Economy of the Netherlands|economy]] and [[Foreign relations of the Netherlands|international relations]]. According to the manifesto, imams should not only be appointed to mosques, but also in health care, prisons and the [[Armed forces of the Netherlands|armed forces]].

Denk's view is that the [[UN|United Nations]] and its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] need fundamental [[Reform of the United Nations|reform]] and that the [[EU|European Union]] should pursue an independent [[Foreign relations of the European Union|foreign policy]]. The movement wants to tackle Islamic extremism by tackling its root causes, which, according to the party, consist of hopelessness, [[social exclusion]], and injustice. On the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the party advocates that Europe strengthen the international position of Palestine and that the Netherlands [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognises the State of Palestine]].

==Controversy==
The party's program for the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 Dutch parliamentary elections]], in the context of the [[Armenian genocide]], mourns both the Turkish and the Armenian sides, while calling for an "independent international investigation". Denk claims that there is no consensus regarding the scale and cause of the tragedy, and calls for "reason and unification". Within that framework, the party does not use the term [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="bewegingdenk.nl"/&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=September 2018}}

The two leaders and founders of the party have been criticised for being "closely linked to the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]]" of Turkish leader [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], and "do not criticize Erdogan and Turkish government policies." The party was the sole party in the Netherlands that did not call for the release of a Turkish-Dutch blogger who was arrested for a tweet about Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How will Turkish Germans vote in the country's upcoming election?|url=http://www.dw.com/en/how-will-turkish-germans-vote-in-the-countrys-upcoming-election/a-40229374|work=Deutsche Welle|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has also been heavily criticised for refusing to distance itself from the [[2016–present purges in Turkey|purges in Turkey since 2016]].&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{Cite news|title=6 most eyecatching fringe parties in the Dutch election|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/6-fringe-parties-in-the-dutch-election-netherlands-denk-artikel-1-geenpeil-piratenpartij-vnl-voor-nederland-niet-stemmers/|work=Politico|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' reported in February 2017 that Denk was using fake social media profiles in order to influence public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andreas KouwenhovenHugo Logtenberg 10 februari 2017 |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/02/10/nep-aanhang-online-actief-voor-denk-6642349-a1545568 |title=Nep-aanhang is online actief voor politieke partij Denk - NRC |website=Nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Denk released a video on their Facebook page in which Kuzu and Azarkan downplayed the allegations, questioned the motives of NRC Handelsblad, and suggested that other parties make greater use of fake social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/DenkNL/videos/1867956370155814/ |title=Dit is hoe de media (NRC) werken |publisher=[[Facebook]] |date=2017-02-11 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, authorised party leader Kuzu acknowledged that there had been some internet trolls from the youth department of DENK who would be called to account for their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/democratie/-jongeren-van-partij-denk-aangesproken-op-nepprofielen-~a8ad605f/|title=Jongeren van partij Denk aangesproken op nepprofielen|website=[[Trouw]]|accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2158227-kuzu-trollen-verleden-tijd-bij-denk.html |title=Kuzu: trollen verleden tijd bij Denk &amp;#124; NOS |website=Nos.nl |date=2017-02-14 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some days after, Kuzu also called Azarkan to account for his role in the use of fake social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Door: ANP |url=http://www.nu.nl/politiek/4475226/kuzu-spreekt-tweede-man-denk-inzet-trollen.html |title=Kuzu spreekt tweede man Denk aan op inzet 'trollen' &amp;#124; NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op |website=Nu.nl |date=2017-02-16 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nederland/achtergrond/2017/02/denk-453590/ |title=Kuzu tegen tweede man Denk: zo gaan wij niet te werk |website=Elsevier.nl |date=2017-02-17 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Directorate of Religious Affairs|Diyanet]] has allowed Denk to spread its propaganda in mosques under its control (in 2018, these were 146) located in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öztürk|first=Ahmet Erdi|last2=Sözeri|first2=Semiha|date=|title=Diyanet as a Turkish Foreign Policy Tool: Evidence from the Netherlands and Bulgaria|url=https://www.academia.edu/36059631/Diyanet_as_a_Turkish_Foreign_Policy_Tool_Evidence_from_the_Netherlands_and_Bulgaria|journal=Religion and Politics Section of the American Political Science Association|language=en|volume=|pages=3, 12-13, 15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919132327/https://www.academia.edu/36059631/Diyanet_as_a_Turkish_Foreign_Policy_Tool_Evidence_from_the_Netherlands_and_Bulgaria|archive-date=19 September 2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance''' or '''EAPL–CFA''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos lenkų rinkimų akcija – Krikščioniškų šeimų sąjunga}} or '''LLRA–KŠS'''; {{lang-pl|Akcja Wyborcza Polaków na Litwie – Związek Chrześcijańskich Rodzin}} or '''AWPL–ZCHR''') is a [[List of political parties in Lithuania|political party]] in [[Lithuania]]. It represents the [[Poles in Lithuania|Polish minority]] and positions itself as [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]].&lt;ref name=Nordsieck/&gt;&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; It has 8 seats in the [[Seimas]], one seat in the [[European Parliament]], and 11 seats in coalition with the Russian Alliance in the [[Vilnius City Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Municipal election in Lithuania |author= |url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/analytics/?doc=37796 |publisher=|newspaper=baltic-course.com |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed in 1994 from the political wing of the [[Association of Poles in Lithuania]], LLRA experienced a surge in support in the 2000s, under the leadership of [[Valdemar Tomaševski]]. It increased its representation from under 2% [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2000|in 2000]], leading to the party being invited to join the governing coalition:&lt;ref name="Lithuanian coalition"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lithuanian coalition |author= |url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=31768 |newspaper=[[Warsaw Business Journal]] |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an invitation they rejected.  They increased their vote again to 3.8% [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2004|in 2004]] and 4.8% in [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2008|2008]]: just short of the 5% [[election threshold]] for any of the Seimas's 70 proportional representation seats. In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Lithuania)|2009 European election]], they won 8.2% and one seat.  The party's vote is concentrated in the south-east of the country, around the capital, where the Polish minority is located.  At the [[Lithuanian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 election]], LLRA broke through 5% in a parliamentary election for the first time: qualifying for proportional representation seats.

In the Seimas, the party sits with fellow centre-right party [[Order and Justice]]. LLRA's MEP (its leader Valdemar Tomaševski) sits in the [[European Parliament]] with the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]], which includes the Polish [[Law and Justice]] and [[Poland Comes First]], and the party is a member of the [[Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe|ACRE]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
At the beginning of 1994 the law on social organisations was adopted. According to this law, social organisations had to transform into political parties or simply remain social organizations. Till that time the [[Association of Poles in Lithuania]] (LLA) was a public-political organisation. Thus it had the option to act both in social and political spheres. The Polish community which did not have its own party faced the difficult task of keeping the Association and simultaneously enabling its participation in the political life of Lithuania at the same time. The creation of the party required a lot of organizational effort. In this situation the central administration of the LLA convened the 5th Extraordinary Conference of the LLA on 14 August. During the Conference the decision was adopted to transform the APL into a social organisation and support the efforts of the group initiating the establishment of a party set up under the name of the Electoral Action of the LLA. Finally, on 23 October after pressure from the [[Lithuanian Ministry of Justice]] to remove the word ‘Union’ from the name of the party, it was registered as the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (LLRA). During the Founding Conference of 1994 and 1997 [[Jan Senkevič]] was elected as LLRA leader. In 1999 during the 3rd LLRA Conference Valdemar Tomaševski became the chairman of the organisation. Moreover, Tomaševski was elected as leader in the 4th and 5th LLRA Conferences.

The LLRA takes part in various elections – starting with municipal through parliamentary and ending with the elections to the [[European Parliament]] in 2004. During the whole period of its existence the LLRA took part in defense of the interests of the Polish minority in Lithuania. The [[Union of the Russians of Lithuania]] had cooperated with the LLRA in elections, running within a common list in 2004.

In 2016, Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania changed its name to '''Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pavadinimas LLRA-KŠS – oficialiai įregistruotas|url=http://www.awpl.lt/?p=4213&amp;lang=lt|website=LLRA-KŠS|accessdate=24 October 2017|language=lt-LT|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The party's primary aim is not ideological, but the protection and enhancement of the rights of the [[Poles in Lithuania|Polish minority]],&lt;ref name="May Contain Nuts"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bale |first1=Tim |last2=Hanley |first2=Seán |last3=Szczerbiak |first3=Aleks |year= |title='May Contain Nuts'?

It supports a more influential political role for the Roman Catholic Church, mandatory religious education in schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrytas.lt/-13356036341334249029-p2-llra-pirmininku-perrinktas-v-tomaševskis-norėtų-būti-premjeras-papildyta.htm LLRA pirmininku perrinktas V. Tomaševskis norėtų būti premjeras (papildyta)]&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduction in the number of Lithuanian [[Seimas|parliamentarians]] from 141 to 101 coupled to an increase in the number of local councillors. Since 2005, it unsuccessfully tried to submit bills to penalize abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Monitoring Institute, "[https://www.liberties.eu/en/news/lithuania-abortion-ban-initiative Polish Minority Party Wants to Ban Abortions in Lithuania]", ''[[Liberties]]'', 28 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==External relations==
LLRA is a member of the Europe-wide anti-[[Federal Europe|federalist]] [[Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists]] (AECR), along with both [[Law and Justice]] and [[Poland Comes First]] from Poland. It is also member of the AECR's associated [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political grouping]], the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]], having resisted intensive lobbying from the Polish [[Civic Platform]] to join the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP group]],&lt;ref name="May Contain Nuts" /&gt; to which Civic Platform belong and to which LLRA had been considered likely to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Polski eurodeputowany z Litwy w EPP? |author= |url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/317623.html |newspaper=[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its youth wing belongs to the [[European Young Conservatives]].

The party currently sits with fellow centre-right party [[Order and Justice]] in the [[Seimas]].  They have agreed an [[electoral alliance]] with the [[Lithuanian Russian Union]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Ethyl cellulose''' is a derivative of [[cellulose]] in which some of the [[hydroxyl group]]s on the repeating [[glucose]] units are converted into [[ethyl group|ethyl]] [[ether]] groups.  The number of ethyl groups can vary depending on the manufacturer.

It is mainly used as a thin-film coating material for coating paper, vitamin and medical pills, and for thickeners in cosmetics and in industrial processes.

Food grade ethyl cellulose is one of few non-toxic films and thickeners which are not water soluble. This property allows it to be used to safeguard ingredients from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dow.com/dowwolff/en/industrial_solutions/polymers/ethylcellulose/|title=Ethylcellulose|website=www.dow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethyl cellulose is also used as a food additive as an [[emulsifier]] (E462).

This is a list of [[food desert]] issues and solutions by [[country]].

== Africa ==

African food deserts are complex due to accelerated [[urbanization]], the various ways individuals acquire food through formal and informal food economy markets, familial dynamics of the household, and African social, political and economic effects.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; African food deserts have been defined as "poor, often informal, urban neighborhoods characterized by high [[Food security|food insecurity]] and low dietary diversity, with multiple markets and market and non-market food sources but variable household access to food."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12132-014-9225-5 |title=Africa's Urban Food Deserts |journal=Urban Forum |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=143–51 |year=2014 |last1=Battersby |first1=Jane |last2=Crush |first2=Jonathan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of a food desert often relates to the distance between residents and the nearest supermarket. In Western nations, supermarkets prevail over traders and vendors but food sourcing methods within Africa are reversed. Certain regions have an informal economy where traders and vendors are available within the areas they live and other local areas.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Urban agriculture]] also plays a big role within Africa as [[pastoralism]] is widely practiced – populations raise their own livestock and grow their own food creating informal rural-urban food transfer systems. These practices vary throughout Africa but do not increase food security and limits community resources to create a food desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/19320248.2012.702448 |title=The Crisis of Food Insecurity in African Cities |journal=Journal of Hunger &amp; Environmental Nutrition |volume=7 |issue=2–3 |pages=271–92 |year=2012 |last1=Crush |first1=Jonathan |last2=Frayne |first2=Bruce |last3=Pendleton |first3=Wade }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income populations are still more inclined to source food in these ways, however supermarket growth in both urban and rural areas is cutting off these food sourcing methods and worsening food security.&lt;ref name=Battersby2012 /&gt;

Accordingly, households within the same food desert source food differently.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Most neighborhoods have a mix of various income levels. Those with higher incomes have better access to transportation and are more likely to shop at the nearest grocery store. Lower income households tend to stick to sourcing food from local vendors with more limited operating hours or through pastoralism.&lt;ref name=Battersby2012&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0467.2012.00401.x |title=Beyond the Food Desert: Finding Ways to Speak About Urban Food Security in South Africa |journal=Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=141–59 |year=2012 |last1=Battersby |first1=Jane }}&lt;/ref&gt; The African Food Security Urban Network (AFSUN) found that nearly 70% of poor urban African households sourced part of their food needs from vendors and traders and 79% of these households utilized a supermarket. When these studies took frequency into account, it was found that poor Africans use informal vendors more often for most of their needs and go to supermarkets to buy large quantities of a [[Staple food|staple]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

With economic growth contributing to the building of supermarkets and other urban renewal practices, land space is taken from pastoral communities that grow and harvest their own food and reduces the resources vendors use to attain the products they sell, limiting their business practices and giving rise to food deserts in Africa.&lt;ref name=Battersby2012 /&gt; Modern food systems in towns and cities are coming about rapidly changing and destabilizing the already high food insecurity practices already in place.

The AFSUN survey results indicate a wide variety of factors, such as gender, income, and education affect access to nutritious food.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Households headed by a man have greater access to food than those headed by a woman.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is due to various socio-political towards women that do not affect modern, Western women who have more access to financial opportunities. In Africa, female heads of households are twice as likely to be food insecure than men. Women have less mobility within Africa and thus rely more on less secure food sourcing practices.

=== South Africa ===
==== Transportation problems ====
African cities suffer from a large degree of fragmentation which leads to the poor having to utilize public transportation to travel large distances, spending up to 3 hours a day in transit. With much of the day wasted in transit, poor Africans have less time to spend on shopping or preparing food which forces them to buy more expensive, less nutritious, already prepared foods from either [[Street food|street vendors]] or restaurants.&lt;ref name=Battersby2012 /&gt; This fragmentation and mobility also leads to many poor Africans shopping for groceries in places outside their township. A study in Soweto, Johannesburg in 2004 showed most urban poor spend about 50% of their expenses in places outside of the towns in which they reside.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Impacts ====

The 1995 Income and Expenditure Survey conducted in South Africa assessed an urban food insecurity rate of 27 percent, relative to the rural rate of 62 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Central Statistical Service. "Income and Expenditure Survey 1995." DataFirst. N.p., 25 Oct. 2012. Web. 10 Nov. 2016. https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/264&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies such as the National Food Consumption Survey of 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1079/PHN2005816 |title=The National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS): South Africa, 1999 |journal=Public Health Nutrition |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2007 |last1=Labadarios |first1=D |last2=Steyn |first2=NP |last3=Maunder |first3=E |last4=MacIntryre |first4=U |last5=Gericke |first5=G |last6=Swart |first6=R |last7=Huskisson |first7=J |last8=Dannhauser |first8=A |last9=Vorster |first9=HH |last10=Nesmvuni |first10=AE |last11=Nel |first11=JH }}&lt;/ref&gt; and South African Social Attitudes Survey of 2008 independently assessed the urban food insecurity rate to be roughly half of that of the rural rate.&lt;ref&gt;Human Sciences Research Council. "South African Social Attitudes Survey 2008." DataFirst. N.p., 1 July 2014. Web. 10 Nov. 2016. https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/488&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 survey conducted on rural [[Eastern Cape]], rural [[Western Cape]] and urban [[Cape Town]] assessed [[Food security|food insecurity]] to be 83, 69, and 81 percent, respectively. This survey took into account other urban African factors than distribution of market retailers such as supermarkets to include the tendency of residents to utilize formal food sources over informal like agriculture and local markets.&lt;ref name=Battersby2012 /&gt;

== Australia ==

===Socioeconomic Disparities===

In Australia jobs are organized into low or high class using Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) which considers skills,education,and experience to place the job.The location of food deserts are put into areas where peoples jobs and income are considered on the low side of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zarnowiecki, |first1=Dorota |title=Socioeconomic Disparities in Food Consumption and Availability. |journal=Nutridate 28 |date=May 2017 |volume=2 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Australia, a dearth of high quality and affordable fruit and vegetables in isolated regions was identified as one factor limiting consumption along with produce seasonality.&lt;ref name="Western Australia Study"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-842X.2005.tb00070.x |pmid=15915624 |title= Health working with Industry to promote fruit and vegetables: a case study of the Western Australian Fruit and Vegetable Campaign with reflection on effectiveness and inter-sectoral action |journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |volume= 29 |pages=176–182 |year= 2005 |last1=Miller |first1=Margaret |last2= Pollard |first2=Christina }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2014 review found that the less populous and very remote areas of the state had fewer grocery stores and higher prices for fruit, vegetables and dairy than in the city. Economically it is reported that in areas with low income families would have to spend 56% of their income of just buying healthy food for their families. lack or availability to fresher food leads to unhealthy food consumption resulting in what is described as a "obesogenic" neighborhood which simply means that the environments food surroundings do not support healthy eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zarnowiecki, |first1=Dorota |title=Socioeconomic Disparities in Food Consumption and Availability. |journal=Nutridate 28 |date=May 2017 |volume=2 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these stores, 20% did not generally supply produce that met all quality standards with a few exceptions, unlike urban areas with exceptions for lettuce and green beans in Perth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.6133/apjcn.2014.23.4.12 |pmid=25516329 |title= Geographic factors as determinants of food security: a Western Australian food pricing and quality study |journal= Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume= 23 |issue=4 |pages=703–713 |year= 2014 |last1= Pollard |first1=Christina M |last2= Landrigan |first2=Timothy J |last3=Ellies |first3=Pernilla L|last4= Kerr |first4=Deborah A|last5= Lester |first5=Matthew L|last6= Goodchild |first6=Stanley E }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Geographical data were not analyzed for prevalence of low income residents to define areas as food deserts.

===Effects===

A five-year campaign to increase access to healthy foods started in 1990 and led by the Department of Health in Western Australia and industry groups had mixed success.&lt;ref name="Western Australia Study"/&gt; By also creating community programs that provide food and transport services to families that live the the 1,600 meter radius away from a grocery store. And also focusing on prevention of diabetes and diabetes management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dragging the chain on making a difference |journal=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2018 |url=https://eds-b-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.xula.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=6eb57ebb-49ce-4bc1-a374-aac04b4fbe06%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=edsgcl.547635157&amp;db=edsgov |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor health effects that can come from not having sustainable food options can be childhood obesity and even health issues like asthma.Although long term health effects can come from the minor health problems like heart disease caused from the obesity and type 2 diabetes. And if these bad habits continue unchanged a person effected by these disease could die prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=ABC |title=Experts Identify Australia’s Fresh Food Dead Zones with Big Health Problems. |date=October 18 |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department later developed a new private/public partnership to address access and consumption of fruit and vegetables.&lt;ref name = "Western Australia audit"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1743-8462-5-27 |pmid=19108736 |pmc=2621230 |title=Selecting interventions to promote fruit and vegetable consumption: From policy to action, a planning framework case study in Western Australia |journal=Australia and New Zealand Health Policy |volume=5 |pages=27 |year=2008 |last1=Pollard |first1=Christina M |last2=Lewis |first2=Janette M |last3=Binns |first3=Colin W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 audit found some progress generated as a result in incentive's fruit and vegetable access, but no headway in identifying and addressing any supply issues in development planning or elucidating cost, quality and access issues for remote, rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name = "Western Australia audit"/&gt;

== Europe ==
"European (non-UK) food access research also frequently highlights the problem of poverty in relation to accessing a healthy diet." French researches have noted that lower income consumers have a tendency to reach for more affordable items such as high caloric foods, (i.e. cereals, sweets, and added fats) instead of nutrient rich single source foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/00070701211202403 |title=Access to healthy food in Nantes, France |journal=British Food Journal |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=224–38 |year=2012 |last1=Shaw |first1=Hillary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===

British food deserts can be broadly classified into twelve geographical types, based on the interaction of socioeconomic factors of physical access to shops, financial access (affordability of) healthy food, and attitudes towards consumption of healthy food, the desire to consume it rather than fast / convenience food, possession of cooking skills, that is, psychological access. These twelve neighbourhood types are 1) inner city executive flat areas (too fast lifestyle to cook healthily), 2) inner city ethnic minority areas (cost of food vs low wages), 3) inner city deprived areas severed by main roads from retail areas (poor physical access), 4) declining suburban areas (shops closing, poor physical access to supermarkets), 5) planned local authority housing areas (low income, and shops often lack fresh produce), 6) student residence areas (preference for fast food outlets, little demand for fresh produce), 7) Wealthy suburban areas, most shop by car, but some less mobile pensioners with no car. Areas 8 – 12 are rural food deserts. 8) is small market town centres losing trade to out-of-town supermarkets, leaving the car-less without easy access, 9) market town suburbs, poor bus service to centre perhaps 1 or 2 miles (2 – 3 kilometres) distant, 10), smaller rural towns, lack full range of fresh produce, 11) remoter villages, no shop, and under-served by mobile shops, 12) dispersed settlements, no focal point for shop.&lt;ref&gt;(Shaw H, The Consuming Geographies of Food: Diet, Food Deserts and Obesity, 2014, Routledge, 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;132–133), see also http://www.fooddeserts.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Furey et al. describes food desert creation as arising where "high competition from large chain supermarkets has created a void".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1015218502547 |year=2001 |last1=Furey |first1=Sinéad |title=An investigation of the potential existence of 'food deserts' in rural and urban areas of Northern Ireland |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=447–457 |last2=Strugnell |first2=Christopher |last3=McIlveen |first3=Heather }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implications ====
Food deserts are defined by a [[Supermarket shortage|shortage of supermarkets]] and other stores that carry affordable healthful food.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/ap036/12716_ap036_1_.pdf|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences|last=|first=|date=Jun 2009|website=|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service|access-date=13 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audit research suggests that supermarkets are the most effective way to supply communities with a wide selection of fresh and relatively affordable healthful food. Moreover, they are typically open year-round, provide convenient hours of operation and generally accept food stamps from the [http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)] and [http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)].&lt;ref&gt;Neckerman, K.

===== Affordability =====
Compared to residents of higher-income neighborhoods, low [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) individuals tend to have diets higher in meat and [[Convenience food|processed foods]] and a lower intake of fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="yeh"&gt;Ming-Chen Yeh and David L.

Income may play a big role in determining the eating habits of families in food deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/food-deserts/414534/|title=Are Food Deserts to Blame for America's Poor Eating Habits?|last=Cortright|first=Joe|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those impacted by food deserts are typically impoverished,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with an average income between $5,000 and $20,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubowitz |first1=Tamara |last2=Zenk |first2=Shannon N. |last3=Ghosh-Dastidar |first3=Bonnie |last4=Cohen |first4=Deborah A. |last5=Beckman |first5=Robin |last6=Hunter |first6=Gerald |last7=Steiner |first7=Elizabeth D. |last8=Collins |first8=Rebecca L. |date=August 2015 |title=Healthy food access for urban food desert residents: examination of the food environment, food purchasing practices, diet and BMI |journal=Public Health Nutrition |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=2220–2230 |doi=10.1017/s1368980014002742|pmc=4457716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the USDA, "Research that considers the prices paid for the same food across household income levels indicates that while some of the very poorest households—those earning less than $8,000 per year—may pay between 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent more for their groceries than households earning slightly more, households earning between $8,000 and $30,000 tend to pay the lowest prices for groceries, whereas higher income households pay significantly higher prices."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Access to affordable and nutritious food: Measuring and understanding food deserts and their consequences: Report to Congress.

{{main|Supermarket shortage}}
Chain supermarkets benefit from economies of scale to offer consumers low prices, but are less prevalent in low-income urban areas.  In the United States, the number of supermarkets in low income neighborhoods is approximately 30% less than in the highest-income neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.1999.tb00071.x |jstor=23859959 |ssrn=2026583 |title=Do the Poor Pay More for Food?

In the absence of other grocery outlets, residents in low-income urban areas are often "forced to depend on small stores with limited selections of foods at substantially higher prices".&lt;ref name=morland /&gt; Fringe food retailers have market power to increase prices (around 30-60%) off a limited product selection dominated by processed foods.&lt;ref name="bitler"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Steven J.|last1=Haider|first2=Marianne|last2=Bitler|date=March 2009|title=An Economic View of Food Deserts in the United States|url=http://www.npc.umich.edu/news/events/food-access/final_bitler_haider.pdf|conference=Understanding the Economic Concepts and Characteristics of Food Access|conferenceurl=http://www.npc.umich.edu/news/events/food-access/index.php|publisher=National Poverty Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research finds "retail prices for the same foods to be higher in deprived areas" that have a dearth of supermarkets and food stores.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Findings from the USDA support that prices for similar goods are on average higher at convenience stores than at supermarkets.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  As a result, people of low SES ultimately spend up to 37% more on their food purchases.&lt;ref name="morland"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(01)00403-2 |pmid=11777675 |title=Neighborhood characteristics associated with the location of food stores and food service places |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=23–9 |year=2002 |last1=Morland |first1=Kimberly |last2=Wing |first2=Steve |last3=Diez Roux |first3=Ana |last4=Poole |first4=Charles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller communities have fewer choices in food retailers.

A study in Iowa showed that grocers in four rural counties had lower costs on key foods that make up a nutritionally balanced diet than did larger supermarkets outside these food deserts (greater than 20 miles away).&lt;ref name="Morton2007"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Starved for access: life in rural America's food deserts |url=http://www.ruralsociology.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Rural-Realities-1-4.pdf |journal=Rural Realities |publisher=Rural Sociological Society |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=1–10 |last1=Morton |first1=Lois Wright |last2=Blanchard |first2=Troy C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grocery stores in low income communities have less variety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Small rural grocers and stores in areas where consumers are less interested in buying produce will carry less fruits and vegetables because they are more expensive compared to processed foods, especially in food deserts.

In a study on urban food environments, participants described the lack of supermarkets as a "practical impediment to healthful food purchase and a symbol of their neighborhoods' social and economic struggles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11524-010-9441-9 |pmid=20354910 |pmc=2871079 |title=The Contribution of Urban Foodways to Health Disparities |journal=Journal of Urban Health |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=381–93 |year=2010 |last1=Cannuscio |first1=Carolyn C. |last2=Weiss |first2=Eve E. |last3=Asch |first3=David A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Health outcomes =====
There are diet and health implications for those who live in areas where nutritious food is not readily available; some claims, such as linking food deserts with obesity in children, are disputed.&lt;ref name="Story09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ford" /&gt;

A summary report by [[The Colorado Health Foundation]] concluded that individuals with access to [[supermarket]]s tend to have healthier diets and a lower risk of [[Chronic condition|chronic disease]] such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Beck, C. 2010"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Beck |first1= Christina |title= Food Access in Colorado |year=2010 |url=http://www.coloradohealth.org/sites/default/files/documents/2017-01/TCHF_Food_Access_Report_web-Food%20Access%20in%20CO.pdf |publisher=Colorado Health Foundation, Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Food deserts are correlated with many poor health outcomes.  Other studies find a link between better access to supermarkets and lowered risk of [[obesity]]. As well, better access to convenience stores is associated with a higher risk of obesity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* A lack of plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains) correlates with an increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Studies show that food insecurity can impact the health of elderly adults including lower BMI, limited activity and malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick 19–40"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ajae/aav044 |title=The Impact of Food Deserts on Food Insufficiency and SNAP Participation among the Elderly |journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume=98 |pages=19–40 |year=2016 |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Katie |last2=Greenhalgh-Stanley |first2=Nadia |last3=Ver Ploeg |first3=Michele }}&lt;/ref&gt; An elderly person without consistent access to enough fruits and vegetables and the proper variety of nutrients are at higher risk for health problems and future ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.05.005 |pmid=23769545 |pmc=3713183 |title=Fruit and vegetable intake among older adults: A scoping review |journal=Maturitas |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=305–12 |year=2013 |last1=Nicklett |first1=Emily J. |last2=Kadell |first2=Andria R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study inversely correlated distance from supermarkets and decreased availability of healthy foods with increases in body mass index and risk of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctdatahaven.org/know/index.php/Research_Availability_Healthy_Food_FoodDeserts |title=Review: Research on Availability of Healthy Food in Food Deserts.

While correlations have been found, the causal pathways are complex and not fully understood. Most studies on food environments and health are cross-sectional and thus cannot make causal conclusions. Improvements in research are needed before causal relationships can be explicitly defined.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Transportation barriers to food access ====
According to 2010 reports from the USDA, approximately 29.7 million people (9.7% of the population) live in low-income areas that are more than 1 mile from a supermarket.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Often the only close places for residents to purchase food are convenience stores or corner shops.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;Bauer, Katherine W. (2004, January 201). Price and Availability Matter. From The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/01/23/can-wal-mart-make-us-healthier/access-to-healthy-foods-and-lower-prices-matter&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 study utilizing GIS determined that among the most impoverished neighborhoods in [[Detroit]], African American ones were on average 1.1 miles farther from the nearest supermarket than white ones and 28% of their residents did not own a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.042150 |pmid=15798127 |pmc=1449238 |title=Neighborhood Racial Composition, Neighborhood Poverty, and the Spatial Accessibility of Supermarkets in Metropolitan Detroit |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=660–7 |year=2005 |last1=Zenk |first1=Shannon N. |last2=Schulz |first2=Amy J. |last3=Israel |first3=Barbara A. |last4=James |first4=Sherman A. |last5=Bao |first5=Shuming |last6=Wilson |first6=Mark L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban areas usually have private and public transportation such as buses and trains available, but rural areas typically offer little to no public transportation even though the grocery stores are far from home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to The Reinvestment Fund (TRF) and Low Supermarket Access areas (TRF 2012), the density of car ownerships is much lower in poorer communities.&lt;ref name="Ploeg et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppu035 |title=Measuring Food Access and Food Deserts for Policy Purposes  |journal=Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=205–25 |year=2014 |last1=Ver Ploeg |first1=M. |last2=Dutko |first2=P. |last3=Breneman |first3=V. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessing healthy foods then becomes more difficult without reliable transportation. The Food Access Research Atlas (ERS 2013) maps out the measurement of food access in both low- and high-income communities. Under this measure, they point out the significance of number of cars within and a number of supermarkets in the area.&lt;ref name="Ploeg et al 2014" /&gt;

And so, many people in low-income neighborhoods may spend more on transportation to bring their groceries home. [[The Colorado Health Foundation]] found that taxi cab drivers make more trips to grocery stores at the beginning of the month when food stamps are distributed and at the end of the month before they expire.&lt;ref name="Beck, C. 2010" /&gt;  Fortunately, vehicle availability has improved over the past couple of decades has been helping disadvantaged residents overcome economic barriers and food access barriers in both rural and urban food deserts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dutko, P. |url=http://www.choicesmagazine.org/choices-magazine/theme-articles/an-evaluation-of-food-deserts-in-america/food-deserts-suffer-persistent-socioeconomic-disadvantage | title = Food Deserts Suffer Persistent Socioeconomic Disadvantage | journal = Choices | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–4 | date = Fall 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elders are particularly affected by the obstacle of distance presented by rural food deserts. A survey by the [[interest group]] and [[insurer]] [[AARP]] reported that at age 75 and older, 83% of men and 60% of women still drive, down from 93% and 84% respectively at age 65 and lower than the 78% and 80% of the next lowest group, 16-24 year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Lynott |first1= Jana |last2=Figueiredo |first2= Carlos |title= How the Travel Patterns of Older Adults Are Changing: Highlights from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey |pages=4 |year=2011 |url=http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/transportation/info-04-2011/fs218-transportation.html|publisher=AARP Public Policy Institute, Washington, D.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Rural transport problem|lack of decent public transportation services]] in rural areas can therefore make it harder for elderly to shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sog.unc.edu/resources/microsites/building-assets-rural-future/improve-access-nutritious-food-rural-areas|title=Improve Access to Nutritious Food in Rural Areas|website=www.sog.unc.edu|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is 9.6% more probable that elders without a car living in a food desert will skip meals than those with one.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick 19–40"/&gt; Because of their lack of access to vehicles, older people are more likely to be dependent on those in their community to get food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2752/152897903786769616 |title=Grocery Store Access Patterns in Rural Food Deserts |journal=Journal for the Study of Food and Society |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=35–48 |year=2003 |last1=Bitto |first1=Ella Annette |last2=Morton |first2=Lois Wright |last3=Oakland |first3=Mary Jan |last4=Sand |first4=Mary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities ====
[[File:Baltimorepiechart.jpg|thumb|Data from 2006 depicting the percentage of races living in areas with low access to healthy foods. This issue predominantly affects the African-American community.&lt;ref name=policylink /&gt;]]
Health disparities related to food access and consumption are associated with residential segregation, low incomes, and neighborhood deprivation.  Morland ''et al.'' found that areas with a majority of convenience stores had a higher prevalence of overweight and obese individuals compared to areas with only supermarkets.&lt;ref name=morland /&gt;  A lack of adequate food sources and limited transportation available to low-income communities may contribute to poor nutrition.&lt;ref name=morland /&gt;

Research has documented differences in supermarket access between poor and non-poor urban areas. Baker ''et al.'' found that mixed-race areas were significantly less likely to have access to foods that adhere to a healthful diet compared to predominantly white, high income areas.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2008.00026.x |pmid=18366535 |title=Disparities in obesity prevalence due to variation in the retail food environment: Three testable hypotheses |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=216–28 |year=2008 |last1=Ford |first1=Paula B |last2=Dzewaltowski |first2=David A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Mari Gallagher found African Americans to be farther from healthful foods than other racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;Examining the Impact of Food Deserts on Public Health in Chicago, Mari Gallagher Research &amp; Consulting Group, 2006.

Each additional supermarket increased fruit and vegetable intake by 32%.&lt;ref name="Morland Obesity"/&gt;

A 2010 study analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assess the health outcomes of women participating in SNAP and the [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]] program.&lt;ref name ="Cheese"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michael |last1=Correll |year=2010 |title=Getting Fat on Government Cheese: The Connection Between Social Welfare Participation, Gender, and Obesity in America |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183&amp;context=djglp |journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy |volume=18 |pages=45–77 |ssrn=1921920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study primarily critically assessed the structure of current social welfare policies, but noted that 25% of food stamp program participants lack easy access to a supermarket.

A 2008 report claimed that in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], African-American neighborhoods lack independent and chain supermarkets unlike Hispanic communities, although none are full-service chains.

==== Proposed solutions ====
===== Transportation initiatives =====
The USDA released an extensive report to Congress in 2009 as a request to reform the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. Study recommendations for addressing access issues in food deserts included the above options as well as transportation reforms.&lt;ref name="VerPloeg2009"/&gt;  Where growing vehicle availability is insufficient, better public transportation in rural food deserts or promoting safe walking and biking environments in urban areas may help.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morton2007" /&gt;  Proposed solutions include utilizing a combination of public and private resources.&lt;ref name="Morton2007" /&gt; Current transit assistance and meal-provisioning programs that are already established in many communities, such Meals on Wheels, have initiatives that focus on providing food residents with limited mobility and ability to shop at traditional food retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Meals on Wheels Association of America.

===== Incentivizing supermarket and grocery store number =====
{{main|Supermarket_shortage#Case_studies}}
State and local governments are implementing public-private partnerships that use a combination of financing initiatives and community-level interventions to target areas with lower healthy food access.&lt;ref name="VerPloeg2009" /&gt;  The progenitor program was Pennsylvania's Fresh Food Financing Initiative, a public-private partnership started in 2004 with state seed funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0740 |pmid=20194989|title=Policy solutions to the 'grocery gap' |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=473–480 |year=2010 |last1=Story |first1=A|last2=Manon |first2=M |last3=Treuhaft |first3=S|last4=Giang |first4=T|last5=Harries |first5=C|last6=McCoubrey |first6=K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0740 |pmid=24594793 |pmc=4204010|title=Moving From Policy to Implementation: A Methodology and Lessons Learned to Determine Eligibility for Healthy Food Financing Projects|journal=J Public Health Manag Pract |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=498–505 |year=2014 |last1=Story |first1=Caroline |last2=Harries|first2=Julia |last3=Koprak |first3=Candace |last4=Weiss|first4=Stephanie |last5=Parker|first5=Kathryn M|last6=Karpyn|first6=Allison }}&lt;/ref&gt; Success of the initiative led to the creation of similar programs in at least seven states and cities, like the New York City Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; In early 2010 the Obama administration unveiled the related [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/community-economic-development/healthy-food-financing Healthy Food Financing Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/02/20100219a.html |title=Obama Administration Details Healthy Food Financing Initiative (Archived copy) |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801224105/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/02/20100219a.html |date=2010|archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities have coordinated with local business and community leaders to solve food scarcity issues. In 2008, [[La Salle University]] and [[The Fresh Grocer]] teamed up to open a grocery store in [[Germantown, Philadelphia]]. The Germantown neighborhood was plagued with a decades-long food desert, but thanks to a coordination between two enterprises, the Fresh Grocer was able to provide more than 250 jobs to Philadelphians and provide healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivegrocer.com/la-salle-university-fresh-grocer-opens-today|title=La Salle University Fresh Grocer Opens Today – ProgressiveGrocer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2009-08-22/news/25276116_1_supermarket-shoprite-pizza-shops |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623203310/http://articles.philly.com/2009-08-22/news/25276116_1_supermarket-shoprite-pizza-shops |archivedate=2016-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Community/family help =====

Families often work together and develop a network of sharing&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/088610999801300206 |title=Income Packaging as a Survival Strategy for Welfare Mothers |journal=Affilia |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=211–32 |year=1998 |last1=Miranne |first1=K.

People living in food deserts often use this approach to feed their families.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

===== Foodsheds =====
{{Main|Foodshed}}
Foodshed planning is an integral part of policy for not only New York, but other cities such as Chicago, Toronto and Cincinnati.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Nevin |last1= Cohen |first2=Nicholas|last2= Freudenberg |first3=Craig|last3= Willingham |date=April 24, 2017 |title= Growing a Regional Food Shed in New York: Lessons from Chicago, Toronto and Cincinnati|publisher=City University of New York Urban Food Policy Institute |location=New York, NY|url=http://www.cunyurbanfoodpolicy.org/news/2017/4/19/regional-food-in-other-cities |access-date=July 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University's 2010 New York City Regional Foodshed Initiative set out to analyze local food production capacity of the Metropolitan Region as part of a strategy to increase availability of affordable, healthful food in all neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vanessa Espaillat |last=Bonnelly |date=January 28, 2010 |title=The New York City Regional Foodshed |url=http://urbandesignlab.columbia.edu/projects/food-and-the-urban-environment/nyc-regional-food-shed-initiative/|publisher=Columbia University The Earth Institute Urban Design Lab |location=New York, NY |access-date=July 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some projects increase the availability of healthy affordable food by establishing community-run markets, farmers markets, mobile grocery carts or stores, and urban agriculture projects.&lt;ref name="VerPloeg2009" /&gt;

====== Farmers' markets ======
{{further|Farmers'_market#Canada_and_United_States}}
Some [[Local food|food movements]] hold that locally grown food at farmers' markets is superior to that typically in supermarkets.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best Practices &amp; Challenges for Farmers Market Incentive Programs: A Guide for Policymakers &amp; Practitioners |journal=The Graduate Journal of Food Studies |url=https://gradfoodstudies.org/2016/06/30/best-practices-challenges-for-farmers-market-incentive-programs-a-guide-for-policymakers-practitioners/ |volume=1 |number=1|year=2016 |last1= Donovan |first1=Jeanie |last2= Madore |first2= Amy |last3= Randall |first3= Megan |last4= Vickery |first4= Kate }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these markets are often too costly for the budget-conscious.&lt;ref name="pmid22005633" /&gt;  Government programs like SNAP and WIC often in partnership with nonprofit organizations subsidize low-income individuals to purchase produce from farmers' markets.{{sfn|Ver Ploeg|2009|p=107}}&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;

In rural Bertie County, the poorest county in North Carolina, community members in conjunction with a public high school class designed and constructed a pavilion to serve as a home for a local farmers' market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Ariel |year=2011 |title=High school students build a farmer's market in a food desert |publisher=Fast Company |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1678622/high-school-students-build-a-farmers-market-in-a-food-desert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Community gardens ======
{{main|Community gardening in the United States}}

Community involvement and the incorporation of local organizations and volunteerism can improve the effectiveness of food safety nets and alternative solutions such as community gardens (''e.g.'', see [[Urban agriculture in West Oakland]]).&lt;ref name="smithmorton" /&gt;

===== Internet stores =====
{{further|Online_food_ordering#Food_cooperatives}}
{{further|Online food ordering#Timeline of online food delivery}}
Internet delivery options overcome distance barriers in food deserts with [[meal kit]] services and [[online shopping]] for fresh groceries from retailers and food cooperatives.

State and federal agencies in New York created a program to allow food stamp recipients the option to purchase healthful foods online for home delivery. In the fall of 2016 this pilot program was launched in conjunction with an established food delivery company, FreshDirect, for two zip codes in the Bronx. The hope is that online food delivery can eliminate food deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodstamps.org/articles/article/2014/04/11/use-your-ebt-to-shop-for-groceries-online|title=Use Your EBT to Shop for Groceries Online|last=FoodStamps|website=www.foodstamps.org|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshdirect.com/browse.jsp?id=about_ebt|title=FreshDirect – About EBT at FreshDirect|website=FreshDirect|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====

{{main|Nutrition#Advice_and_guidance}}
Research suggests that food deserts are not the real problem, eating habits are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/takes-grocery-store-eliminate-food-desert/|title=Why it takes more than a grocery store to eliminate a 'food desert'|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, one study found that 89.3% of people in a community were either "highly interested" or "interested" in education on preparing healthier food options.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2011.06.298|title=Community Food Assessment in an Urban Food Desert|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|volume=111|issue=9|pages=A82|year=2011|last1=Braunstein|first1=N.S.|last2=Ewell|first2=J.B.|last3=Santos|first3=C.|last4=Palmer|first4=A.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Avenues to increase education and outreach about diet and health by the federal government include &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the [http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-education-snap-ed SNAP Education (SNAP-Ed)] and [https://nifa.usda.gov/program/expanded-food-and-nutrition-education-program-efnep Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14170">A '''foreign area officer''' ('''FAO''') is a [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] from any of the five branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who is a regionally focused expert in [[politics|political]]-[[military]] operations.  Such officers possess a unique combination of strategic focus and regional expertise, with political, [[culture|cultural]], [[sociology|sociological]], [[economy|economic]], and [[geography|geographic]] awareness. Foreign language proficiency is an unequivocal necessity in at least one of the dominant languages in their specified region.  

A FAO will typically serve overseas tours as a [[Military attaché|defense attaché]], a [[United States Security Assistance Organizations|security assistance officer]], or as a political-military planner in a service's headquarters, [[Joint Chiefs of Staff|Joint Staff]], [[Major Command]]s, [[Unified Combatant Command]]s, or in agencies of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. They also serve as [[arms control]] specialists, country desk officers, [[liaison officer]]s, and [[Exchange officer|Military Personnel Exchange Program (MPEP)]] officer to host nation or coalition allies. Recently, increasing numbers of FAOs are serving as political and cultural advisors to combatant staffs in support of the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. Presently, there are just over 2,200 FAOs in active operational capacities, while roughly 25 percent are still in training. The services plan to recruit and train more than 170 a year, with almost 1,100 new FAOs entering the program by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Defense. “Defense Language Transformation Roadmap” 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roles and responsibilities of FAOs are extensive and varied. They advise senior leaders on political-military operations and relations with other nations, provide cultural expertise to forward-deployed commands conducting military operations, build and maintain long-term relationships with foreign leaders, develop and coordinate security cooperation, execute security assistance programs with host nations, and develop reports on diplomatic, information, military, and economic activities.

==Army==
The Army Foreign Area Officer Program (Functional area 48) is a single-track FAO program managed by G-35, SSF, which is the Strategic Leadership Division. It is by far the largest and oldest FAO program of the Services. The Proponent Office is responsible for establishing policy guidance and FAO career field development as well as establishing specific programs focused on the accession, training, education, distribution, utilization, deployment, and separation of FAOs. Currently, there are 1,257 Army FAOs either in training or fully qualified.  

Army FAOs are categorized by areas of concentration that correspond with their respective [[List of United States Army careers|military occupational specialty]], further grouped in scope by functional areas. Army FAOs are divided into nine categories of regional areas of expertise and language skills:&lt;ref name="DODD 1315.17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/131517p.pdf|title=Department of Defense Directive 1315.17 - Service Foreign Area Officer (FAO) Programs|last=Wolfowitz|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Wolfowitz|date=April 28, 2005|work=[[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]]|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 48J – [[Africa]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|south]] of the [[Sahara]]

==Marine Corps==
The International Affairs Officer Program replaced the FAO and International Relations Officer Program in the Marine Corps in 2000, which is an umbrella program that governs two separate, but interrelated [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|military occupational specialty]]: the Foreign Area Officer (994x) and the Regional Affairs Officer (982x) designations. Much like the USAF dual-track system, RAOs are basically FAOs without local language skills. There are approximately 280 FAOs and 80 RAOs in the Marine Corps, distributed amongst the following specialties:&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donhcs.com/hsr/20_october/doc/Boraz%20Behind%20the%20Curve%20culture%20centric%20skills.pdf|title=Behind the Curve in Culture-Centric Skills|last=Boraz|first=[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|LCDR]] Steven C.|date=June 2005|publisher=[[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]]|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy==
The Navy FAO Branch is a [[Restricted Line Officer|restricted line]] community of the Navy.&lt;ref name="OPNAVINST 1301.10B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/01000%20Military%20Personnel%20Support/01-300%20Assignment%20and%20Distribution%20Services/1301.10B.pdf|title=OPNAVINST 1301.10B Navy Foreign Area Officer (FAO) Program|last=Morgan Jr.|first=[[Vice admiral (United States)|VADM]] John G.|date=May 4, 2006|work=Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Plans, Policy, and Operations)|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy has approximately 350 FAOs either fully qualified or in training. The community is expected to achieve 400 officers by 2019. As with the Army, the Navy has a single-track system, where officers from other Navy communities transfer over to Foreign Area Officer permanently. Navy FAOs are assigned the 1710 [[List of Naval Officer Designators|designator]]. 

Navy FAOs are apportioned amongst the five regional [[Unified Combatant Command]]s:
* [[United States European Command]]
* [[United States Central Command]]
* [[United States Africa Command]]
* [[United States Pacific Command]]
* [[United States Southern Command]]

==Air Force==
The International Affairs Specialist Program is the Air Force component, and encompasses two officer types: the Regional Affairs Strategist and Political-Military Affairs Strategist. Both tracks remain under the [[Air Force Specialty Code]] 16: 16F for RAS and 16P for PAS. PAS development begins in conjunction with Intermediate Developmental Education, and officers serve in similar positions as RAS officers do, but perform duties that require a broad knowledge of political-military affairs rather than regional expertise with foreign language skills.&lt;ref name="DOAP 600–3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/p600_3.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031224121220/http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/p600_3.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 24, 2003 |title=Department of the Army Pamphlet 600–3: Commissioned Officer Professional Development and Career Management |last=Casey, Jr. |first=GEN George W. |authorlink=George W. Casey, Jr. |date=February 1, 2010 |work=[[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAS officers are distributed amongst the following subcategories:&lt;ref&gt;http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3_5/publication/afi16-109/afi16-109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* E – Southeast Asia
* F – Middle East/North Africa
* G – Sub-Saharan Africa
* H – Western Europe
* J - South Asia
* K - China
* L - Generalist

==Accession &amp; training==
Acceptance into the FAO programs typically requires at least 7–10 years of commissioned service, since most FAO positions are designated for that of a field-grade officer (Marines being the exception, who only require 3 years). The FAO accession process is lengthy process and requires meticulous review of every candidate applying. While all DoD branches are in the process of expanding their FAO (or FAO equivalent) Programs, FAO accession remains one of the most highly competitive processes of the US military.{{fact|date=April 2010}} On average, more than eight candidates compete for every single FAO slot available. Generally speaking, applicants must have at a minimum the following:
* [[Classified information in the United States|Top secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] [[security clearance]], (or at least be eligible)
* Primary MOS or warfare area qualification
* Broad military experience in their assigned MOS
* A score of 95 or better on the [[Defense Language Aptitude Battery]] or a [[Defense Language Proficiency Tests]] score of 2/2.
* 2.7 [[Grade (education)|GPA]] or higher (on a scale of 4.0) with an [[undergraduate degree]]
* Must have a [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay-grade of O3]] or above

FAO training varies amongst all four DoD branches, but usually takes a minimum of 3–5 years before FAOs can utilize their skills in an operational capacity, depending upon the qualifications of the candidate at the time of accession.
* 1 year at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]] where a graduate degree is completed in [[national security]] affairs with an emphasis on the target region.
* Foreign Area Officer Orientation Course, a 3-day introductory course into their career path.
* 6 - 15 months of basic language training, depending upon the language(s) selected and the level of difficulty, at either the [[Defense Language Institute]] Foreign Language Center in Monterey or Defense Language Institute-[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].
* 6-12 months conducting in-country training for area familiarization, language enrichment, professional development in the target region, etc.
* Subsequent FAO tours.

A long road exists between accession and full FAO qualification. It takes between 3–5 years of training, education, and actual FAO tour performance before FAO trainees are ever even considered for full designation and qualification as an FAO. Standard requirements of fully qualified FAOs generally include the following:
* Advanced degree(s) with a regional focus.
* Defense Language Proficiency Test score of 2 in listening and 2 in reading, and a goal of 1+ in speaking.
* Regional Expertise at a level 3 or above, per [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] Instruction 3126.01.
* Defense Language Aptitude Battery general score of 95 (prior to being considered for acceptance into the FAO program).
* Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance.
* [[Joint Professional Military Education]] Phase 1 complete (if applicable, typically for Navy and Marines).
* Overseas assignment and screening clearance.
* At least one overseas FAO tour in progress or completed.

The [[Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness]] is the proponent for FAO programs for the DoD. He or she establishes DoD accession, education, and utilization policy for Foreign Area Officers. FAO guidance, directives, and standards for all military branch FAO programs are promulgated by DoD Directive 1315.17.&lt;ref name="DODD 1315.17" /&gt; The [[Under Secretary of Defense for Policy]] and the [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] oversees FAO capabilities, needs, and utilization in the DoD Agencies that they respectively supervise. For combat support activities, such oversight is conducted in conjunction with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The [[Defense Language Office]] ensures a strategic focus on meeting present and future requirements for language and regional expertise, among military and civilian employees. This office's main responsibilities are to oversee and manage the implementation of a comprehensive Department-wide Language Transformation Roadmap; identify policy, procedural, and resource needs associated with providing needed language capability; oversee policy regarding the development, management, and utilization of civilian employees and members of the Armed Forces; and conduct research and analyze studies, reports, and lessons learned from the Global War on Terrorism and current military operations as they pertain to language and regional area expertise.

==Leadership==
While promotion levels vary between the branches, retention rates of FAOs are higher than service averages.{{fact|date=April 2010}} The bulk of the FAO community is primarily composed of [[Field officer|field grade officers]], though [[General officer|general]] and [[flag officer]]s include [[General (United States)|General]] [[John Abizaid]], [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Christopher G. Cavoli]], Lieutenant General [[Karl Eikenberry]], Lieutenant General [[Keith Dayton]], Major General Charles Hooper, Major General [[Robin Fontes]], Brigadier General Richard M. Lake, Brigadier General Henry Nowak, Brigadier General Mark O’Neill, Brigadier General Kevin Ryan, Brigadier General John Adams, and Rear Admiral Douglas Venlet.

'''{{lang|fr|Francs-tireurs}}''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃.ti.ʁœʁ|pron}}, [[French language|French]] for "free shooters") was a term for [[irregular military]] applied to formations deployed by [[France]] during the early stages of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71). The term was revived and used by [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] to name two major [[French Resistance]] movements set up to fight against the Germans during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRpartisans.htm French Partisans]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes used to refer more generally to [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters who operate outside the [[laws of war]].&lt;ref name=RT&gt;Rupert Ticehurst, [http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNHY "The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict"], 30 April 1997, ''International Review of the Red Cross'', No. 317, pp. 125–134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the sections in this article [[#Franco-Prussian War|Franco-Prussian War]] and [[#Prisoner status|Prisoner status]] and the article [[Hostages Trial]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During the wars of the [[French Revolution]], a {{lang|fr|franc-tireur}} was a member of a corps of [[light infantry]] organized separately from the regular army. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word {{lang|es|francotirador}} and the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word {{lang|pt|franco-atirador}}, meaning [[sharpshooter]] or [[sniper]], are derived from the word {{lang|fr|franc-tireur}}.

==Franco-Prussian War==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Francs-tireurs.jpg|thumb|Francs-tireurs in the [[Vosges]] during the Franco-Prussian War.]]

Francs-tireurs were an outgrowth of [[rifle]] clubs or unofficial military societies formed in the east of France at the time of the [[Luxembourg crisis]] of 1867. The members were chiefly concerned with the practice of rifle-shooting. In case of war, they were expected to act as [[militia]] or [[light infantry|light troops]]. They wore no [[uniform]]s, but they armed themselves with the best existing rifles, and elected their own officers.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] described them as "at once a valuable asset to the armed strength of France and a possible menace to internal order under military discipline." The societies strenuously and effectively resisted all efforts to bring them under normal military discipline.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In July 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the French Minister of War assumed control over the societies to organize them for field service. It was not until 4 November, by which time the {{lang|fr|[[levée en masse]]}} (universal [[conscription]]) was in force, that the militias were placed under the orders of the generals in the field. They were sometimes organized in large bodies and incorporated in the mass of the armies, but more usually they continued to work in small bands, blowing up culverts on the invaders' lines of communication, cutting off small reconnaissance parties, surprising small posts, etc.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' describes it as "now acknowledged, even by the Germans", that the {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}}, by these relatively unconventional tactics, "paralysed large detachments of the enemy, contested every step of his advance (as in the [[Loire River|Loire]] campaign), and prevented him from gaining information, and that their soldierly qualities improved with experience."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

{{lang|fr|Francs-tireurs}} blew up the Moselle [[railway bridge]] at [[Fontenoy-sur-Moselle]], on 22 January 1871. The defense of [[Châteaudun]] (18 October 1870) was conducted by {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}} of [[Cannes]] and [[Nantes]], along with [[Lipowski]]'s Paris corps.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Francs-tireurs|volume=11|pages=15–16|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans executed captured {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}} as irregular, armed non-combatants, essentially what also came to be called [[guerrilla]]s or [[insurgent]]s. The German armies and popular press vilified the {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}} as murderers and highwaymen; the insurgents seemed to have a sense of the most vulnerable parts of the German armies in France. The Germans reacted to {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}} ambushes with harsh reprisals against the nearest village or town, where they killed civilians. Whole regiments or divisions often took part in "pacifying actions" in areas with significant {{lang|fr|franc-tireur}} activity; this created a lasting enmity and hatred between the occupying German soldiers and French civilians.

==World War I==
The experiences of French guerrilla attacks and of the [[asymmetric warfare]] during the Franco-Prussian War had a profound effect on the [[German General Staff]]. During [[World War I]], they carried out an unusually harsh and severe occupation of areas which they conquered. Hostages were regularly executed in response to reports of sniping in French and Belgian communities. The occupying German forces were reportedly very fearful of spontaneous civil resistance, which led to these arrests and executions, some of which were preemptive or at least before actual violent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= Barbara |last= Tuchman |title=The Guns of August |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1962 |isbn= 034538623X |pages=317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the attacks attributed by the German occupiers to Belgian francs-tireurs were actually carried out by [[Belgian Army]] [[sniper]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= Anthony |last= Vanderlinden |title=FN Browning Pistols: Side-Arms that Shaped World History |publisher=Wet Dog Publications |year=2013 |isbn= 0970799799 |pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, General [[Erich Ludendorff]], Germany's chief military strategist and its commander-in-chief on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] at the end of the war, tried to defend German behavior in his memoir published in 1919, the two-volume ''Meine Kriegserinnerungen, 1914–1918''. It was published that same year in London by Hutchinson as ''My War Memories, 1914–1918'' and in [[New York City|New York]] by Harper as ''Ludendorff's Own Story, August 1914 – November 1918''.

In an article in the 13 September 1919 issue of ''[[The Illustrated London News|Illustrated London News]]'', the writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] responded to Ludendorff's book by remarking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is astounding how clumsy Prussians are at this sort of thing. Ludendorff cannot be a fool, at any rate, at his own trade; for his military measures were often very effective. But without being a fool when he effects his measures, he becomes a most lurid and lamentable fool when he justifies them. For in fact he could not have chosen a more unfortunate example. A franc-tireur is emphatically not a person whose warfare is bound to disgust any soldier. He is emphatically not a type about which a general soldierly spirit feels any bitterness. He is not a perfidious or barbarous or fantastically fiendish foe. On the contrary, a "franc-tireur" is generally a man for whom any generous soldier would be sorry, as he would for an honourable prisoner of war. What is a "franc-tireur"? A "franc-tireur" is a free man, who fights to defend his own farm or family against foreign aggressors, but who does not happen to possess certain badges and articles of clothing catalogued by Prussia in 1870. In other words, a "franc-tireur" is you or I or any other healthy man who found himself, when attacked, in accidental possession of a gun or pistol, and not in accidental possession of a particular cap or a particular pair of trousers. The distinction is not a moral distinction at all, but a crude and recent official distinction made by the [[militarism]] of [[Potsdam]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:FTP-p012904.jpg|thumb|Francs-tireurs and Allied paratroopers reporting on the situation during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944.]]

Two major [[Résistance]] groups adopted the name {{lang|fr|Franc-Tireur}} during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The first to be established was the ''[[Franc-Tireur (movement)|Franc-Tireur]]'' group founded in [[Lyon]] in 1940. The second was the {{lang|fr|[[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]]}} (FTP, Partisan irregular riflemen), which were established as the military branch of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). They only became active in the resistance after the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.

Although individual communists had opposed the German occupation of France, the official [[Communist]] position was not to offer resistance, as the [[Soviet Union]] was in a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with Germany. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, this position changed.

The PCF initially called their group the {{lang|fr|Organisation Spéciale}} (OS); a number of its leaders had served in the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (notably, "[[Colonel]]" [[Henri Rol-Tanguy]]).

A number of smaller resistance groups united in the {{lang|fr|Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP)}} under [[Pierre Villon]], the former editor of the magazine {{lang|fr|[[L'Humanité|L’Humanité]]}}. Their job was four-fold: to destroy rail lines carrying men and materials to the eastern front, sabotage factories working for the Germans, punish traitors and collaborators, and kill the occupying soldiers. "A [[librarian]] called [[Michel Bernstein (forger)|Michel Bernstein]] became a master forger of false documents." And "[[France Bloch-Sérazin|France Bloch]], a young chemist with two science degrees, who as a Jew had lost her job in the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|French National Museum of Natural History]], was given the job of making explosives." Bloch was arrested by the French police and was beheaded by guillotine in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Carolina. 2011. ''A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship and Resistance in Occupied France'', New York: Harper Collins, pp. 64, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

FTP became the first [[resistance group]] in France to deliberately kill a German.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In February 1944, the FTP agreed to merge with the {{lang|fr|[[Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur]]}}.

The foreign workers' section of the FTP, the [[FTP-MOI]] ({{lang|fr|Francs-Tireurs et Partisans—Main d'Œuvre Immigrée}}), became especially famous after the [[Manouchian Group]] was captured, its members executed, and ten of its members advertised as foreign criminals by the infamous [[Affiche Rouge]]. The Manouchian Group operated in the [[Paris]] metropolitan area, but other FTP-MOI groups operated in [[Lyon]] and the [[South of France]], where they carried out armed resistance. Many of its immigrant members throughout the country were [[Jew]]ish artists, writers and intellectuals, who had gone to France for the cultural circles in Paris. Others had taken refuge in France to escape [[Nazi]] persecution in their home countries. [[Alter Mojze Goldman]], father of [[Pierre Goldman]] and [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]], was a member of FTP-MOI, as was the Hungarian photographer, [[Ervin Marton]], who achieved international recognition after the war.

==Prisoner status==
Before the two [[world war]]s, the term {{lang|fr|franc-tireur}} was sometimes used for an armed fighter who, if captured, was not necessarily entitled to [[prisoner of war]] status. An issue of disagreement at the 1899 [[Hague Conventions (1899)|Hague Conference]], the controversy generated the [[Martens Clause]]. The Martens Clause was introduced as a compromise between the [[Great Power]]s, who considered ''francs-tireurs'' to be [[unlawful combatant]]s subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst, [http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNHY "The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict"], 30 April 1997, ''International Review of the Red Cross'', No. 317, pp. 125–134. In hist footnote 1 cites: The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, "Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845–1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (IRRC), No. 312, May–June 1996, pp. 300–314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst [http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JNHY "The Martens Clause and the Laws of Armed Conflict"], 30 April 1997, ''International Review of the Red Cross'' no 317, p.125–134. In hist footnote 2 cites: F. Kalshoven, ''Constraints on the Waging of War'', Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, during the [[Hostages Trial]],&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Wilhelm List, et al.'', 11 Tr. of War Crim. Bef. Nuremberg Mil. Trib. 1248 (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; the seventh of the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Trials]], the tribunal found that, on the question of partisans, according to the then-current [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|laws of war]], the partisan fighters in southeast Europe could not be considered lawful belligerents under Article 1 of the Hague Convention.&lt;ref name="HT"&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/List4.htm#NOTES "The hostages trial, trial of Wilhelm List and others: Notes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208103815/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/List4.htm |date=2005-02-08 }}, [[University of the West of England]] original source: United Nations War Crimes Commission, ''Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals'', Volume VIII, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to [[Wilhelm List]], the tribunal stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are obliged to hold that such guerrillas were francs tireurs who, upon capture, could be subjected to the death penalty. Consequently, no criminal responsibility attaches to the defendant List because of the execution of captured partisans...&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The post-war [[Geneva Convention]] established new protocols; according to Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1949, {{lang|fr|francs-tireurs}} are entitled to prisoner-of-war status provided that they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, have a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry arms openly, and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.

==Other uses==
{{lang|fr|Le Franc-Tireur}} was the name of an [[Underground newspaper|underground]] French Resistance newspaper published by the group in Lyon by the same name.

The '''Galician People's Front''' ({{lang-gl|Frente Popular Galega}}) is a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] political organization with a socialist and [[Galician independence|independentist]] ideology.

==History==
After the [[Galician People's Union]] (UPG) accepted the participation of the [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego]] (BNG) in the [[Galician Parliament]] in 1986, 13 members of its Central Committee led by [[Mariano Abalo]] and [[Xan Carballo]] left the party and created the Communist Collective. On 25 July 1986, the group was transformed into the [[Communist Party of National Liberation]] (PCLN). Later, the 3rd National Assembly of the BNG expelled the group because they gave support to [[Herri Batasuna]].

In 1987, the PCLN and [[Galiza Ceibe-OLN]], along with other small organizations, created the FPG. In June 1989, they suffered a split as the sectors that supported the armed struggle of the [[EGPGC]] broke away and formed [[Assembleia do Povo Unido]].

In the [[Galician parliamentary election, 2001|Elections for the Galician Parliament 2001]], the group obtained 3,176 votes (0.3%), in the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|Elections for the Spanish Parliament 2004]], it obtained 2,257 votes (0.12%), and in the [[Galician parliamentary election, 2005|Elections for the Galician Parliament 2005]], it obtained 2,982 votes (0.2%).

Since 2012, the FPG is integrated in [[Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood]].

'''Hawkama''' is the name for the regional institute of corporate governance launched by the [[Dubai]] International Financial Centre in cooperation with the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OeCD) and other international bodies.

After [[Independence Day (India)|India's independence in 1947]], Congress formed the [[Government of India|central government of India]], and many regional state governments.&lt;ref name=britannica-lead&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian National Congress, Political Party, India|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=8 April 2017}} '''Quote:''' "broadly based political party of India. Formed in 1885, the Indian National Congress dominated the Indian movement for independence from Great Britain. It subsequently formed most of India's governments from the time of independence and often had a strong presence in many state governments."&lt;/ref&gt; Congress became India's dominant political party; {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, in the 15 general elections since independence, it has won an outright majority on six occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further four times, heading the central government for 49 years. There have been seven Congress [[List of Prime Ministers of India|Prime Ministers]], the first being [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (1947–1964), and the most recent [[Manmohan Singh]] (2004–2014).

From 2004 to 2014, the Congress-led [[United Progressive Alliance]], a coalition of several regional parties, formed the Indian government, and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The leader of the party during the period, [[Sonia Gandhi]] has served the longest term as the president of the party. {{As of|2018|May}}, the party is in power in four legislative assemblies: [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Mizoram]], [[Karnataka]] (in an alliance with the [[Janata Dal (Secular)|JD(S)]]), and the union territory of [[Puducherry]] (in an alliance with the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]]).

==History==
{{Main|History of the Indian National Congress}}
The history of the Indian National Congress (INC) falls into two distinct eras:
* The pre-independence era, when the party was the umbrella organisation leading the campaign for independence;
* The post-independence era, when the party has had a prominent place in Indian politics.

The Indian National Congress conducted its first session in [[Bombay]] from 28–31 December 1885 at the initiative of retired [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Civil Service officer]] [[Allan Octavian Hume]].

Hume took the initiative, and in March 1885 a notice convening the first meeting of the Indian National Union to be held in [[Poona]] the following December was issued.&lt;ref name=pattabhi&gt;Sitaramayya, B.

====Early years====

[[File:Gopal krishan gokhale.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a constitutional social reformer and moderate nationalist, was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1905.]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, Congress' demands became more radical in the face of constant opposition from the British government, and the party decided to advocate in favour of the independence movement because it would allow a new political system in which Congress could be a major party. By 1905, a division opened between the moderates led by Gokhale, who downplayed public agitation, and the new extremists who advocated agitation, and regarded the pursuit of social reform as a distraction from nationalism. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], who tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public [[Ganapati]] festivals he inaugurated in western India, was prominent among the extremists.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley A. Wolpert, ''Tilak and Gokhale: Revolution and Reform in the Making of Modern India'' (1962) p 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress included a number of prominent political figures. [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], a member of the sister [[Indian National Association]], was elected president of the party in 1886 and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the [[British House of Commons]] (1892–1895). Congress also included Bal Gangadhar Tilak, [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], and [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]]. Jinnah was a member of the moderate group in the Congress, favouring [[Hindu]]–[[Muslim]] unity in achieving self-government.{{sfn|Singh|pp=41–42}} Later he became the leader of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and instrumental in the creation of [[Pakistan]]. Congress was transformed into a mass movement by [[Surendranath Banerjee]] during the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal in 1905]], and the resultant [[Swadeshi movement]].&lt;ref name="INC"/&gt;

====Congress as a mass movement====
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|right|thumb|Mahatma Gandhi spinning yarn, in the late 1920s]]
Mahatma Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915. With the help of the moderate group led by Ghokhale, Gandhi became president of Congress. After the [[First World War]], the party became associated with Gandhi, who remained its unofficial spiritual leader and icon.&lt;ref name=M.Ghandi1&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahatma Gandhi|authorlink1=Gandhi|title=The Gandhi Reader: A Sourcebook of His Life and Writings|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802131614|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed an alliance with the [[Khilafat Movement]] in 1920 to fight for preservation of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]], and rights for Indians using civil disobedience or ''[[satyagraha]]'' as the tool for agitation.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Minault, ''The Khilafat movement'' p 69&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, after the deaths of policemen at [[Chauri Chaura incident|Chauri Chaura]], Gandhi suspended the agitation. In protest, a number of leaders, [[Chittaranjan Das]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Motilal Nehru]], resigned to set up the [[Swaraj Party]]. The Khilafat movement collapsed and Congress was split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gAW8GreFqjkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=The+Khilafat+movement+collapsed+and+Congress+was+split.#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Khilafat%20movement%20collapsed%20and%20Congress%20was%20split. |title=The Khilafat Movement: Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India - Gail Minault - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.in |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of Gandhi's popularity and his ''satyagraha'' art of revolution led to support from [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Rajendra Prasad|Dr. Rajendra Prasad]], [[Khan Mohammad Abbas Khan]], [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], [[C. Rajagopalachari|Chakravarti Rajgopalachari]], [[Anugrah Narayan Sinha|Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Jivatram Kripalani]], and [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]]. As a result of prevailing nationalism, Gandhi's popularity, and the party's attempts at eradicating [[caste]] differences, [[untouchability]], poverty, and religious and ethnic divisions, Congress became a forceful and dominant group. Although its members were predominantly Hindu, it had members from other religions, economic classes, and ethnic and linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Agrawal |first1=Lion M.

At the Congress 1929 Lahore session under the presidency of Jawaharlal Nehru, [[Purna Swaraj]] (complete independence) was declared as the party's goal, declaring 26 January 1930 as "Purna Swaraj Diwas" (Independence Day). The same year, Srinivas Iyenger was expelled from the party for demanding full independence, not just [[home rule]] as demanded by Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mainbharathun.org/inc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721001422/http://www.mainbharathun.org/inc.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2010 |title=Main Bharat Hun |publisher=Main Bharat Hun |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Subhas Chandra Bose.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Subhas Chandra Bose]] served as president of the Congress during 1938–39.]]

After the passage of the [[Government of India Act of 1935]], [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|provincial elections]] were held in India in the winter of 1936–37 in eleven provinces: [[Madras Presidency|Madras]], [[Central Provinces]], Bihar, Orissa, [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], [[Bombay Presidency]], Assam, NWFP, Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. After contesting these elections, the Indian National Congress gained power in eight of them except Bengal, Punjab, and Sindh. The All-India Muslim League failed to form a government in any province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Muslims and Partition of India|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|isbn=9788171563746|page=240|author1=[[S.

In 1939, [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], the elected president in both 1938 and 1939, resigned from Congress over the selection of the working committee. The party was not the sole representative of the Indian [[polity]], other parties included the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha]], and the [[All India Forward Bloc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dates of time spent in Britain:&amp;nbsp;1919–21 |url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/subhas-chandra-bose |title=Subhas Chandra Bose &amp;#124; |publisher=Open.ac.uk |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was an umbrella organisation, sheltering radical socialists, traditionalists, and Hindu and Muslim conservatives. Gandhi expelled all the socialist groupings, including the Congress Socialist Party, the Krishak Praja Party, and the Swarajya Party, along with Subhas Chandra Bose, in 1939.&lt;ref name=M.Ghandi1 /&gt;

In 1946, the British tried the Indian soldiers who had fought alongside the Japanese during World War II in the [[INA trials]]. In response, Congress helped form the [[INA Defence Committee]], which assembled a legal team to defend the case of the soldiers of the Azad Hind government. The team included several famous lawyers, including [[Bhulabhai Desai]], [[Asaf Ali]], and Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/about-the-legal-profession/lawyers-in-the-indian-freedom-movement/ |title=Lawyers in the Indian Freedom Movement – The Bar Council of India |publisher=Barcouncilofindia.org |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Congress members initially supported the sailors who led the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny]], but they withdrew support at a critical juncture and the mutiny failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Manimugdha S |title=Royal Indian Navy Mutiny: Historian remembers last secular uprising of India |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/parthian-shot/royal-indian-navy-mutiny-historian-remembers-last-secular-uprising-of-india/ |website=The Times of India |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Raghavan |first1=Srinath |title=Revisiting the 1946 Royal Indian Navy mutiny |url=https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/mj2aFxWkWrLwae44ANxrEO/Revisiting-the-1946-Royal-Indian-Navy-mutiny.html |website=[[Mint (newspaper)|Livemint]] |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
After Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country. In 1952, in the [[Indian general election, 1951|first general election]] held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures. It held power nationally until 1977, when it was defeated by the Janata coalition. It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989, when it was once again defeated. The party formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009, when it led the United Progressive Alliance. During this period the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a [[neoliberal]] economic outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1:48 pm |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/captains-musings/new-year-aspirations-can-india-hope-for-a-centrist-progressive-liberal-party/ |title=New year aspirations — Can India hope for a centrist progressive liberal party? |publisher=Blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party's rivals at state level have been national parties including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPIM), and various regional parties, such as the [[Telugu Desam Party]], [[All India Trinamool Congress|Trinamool Congress]] and [[Aam Aadmi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why India's opposition is nearly irrelevant |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/04/28/why-indias-opposition-is-nearly-irrelevant |website=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A post-[[Partition of India|partition]] successor to the party survived as the [[Pakistan National Congress]], a party which represented the rights of religious minorities in the state. The party's support was strongest in the Bengali-speaking province of [[East Pakistan]]. After the Bangladeshi War of Independence, it became known as the [[Bangladeshi National Congress]], but was dissolved in 1975 by the government.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book|title=Major governments of Asia|author=George McTurnan Kahin, Harold C.

From 1951 until his death in 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru was the paramount leader of the party.

{{See also|The Emergency (India)|Assassination of Indira Gandhi|Indian general election, 1977|1984 anti-Sikh riots}}
After Shastri's death, Congress elected Indira Gandhi as leader over [[Morarji Desai]]. Once again, politician [[K. Kamaraj]] was instrumental in achieving this result. In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In mid-1969, she was involved in a dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues. The two major issues were Gandhi supporting the independent candidate, [[V. V. Giri]], rather than the official Congress party candidate, [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]], for the vacant post of the [[President of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, M.P., 1981.

''Asian Survey'', 10(3), pp. 256-262.&lt;/ref&gt; The second issue was Mrs. Gandhi's abrupt nationalization of the 14 biggest banks in India, which resulted in the resignation of the finance minister, Morarji Desai. Later in the year, the Congress party president, [[S. Nijalingappa]], expelled her from the party for indiscipline.&lt;ref name=socialism&gt;{{cite news|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi|work=[[The Economic Times]]|agency=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

The New Congress Party's popular support began to wane in the mid-1970s. From 1975, Gandhi's government grew increasingly more authoritarian and unrest among the opposition grew. On 12 June 1975, the [[Allahabad High Court|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of India's parliament, void on the grounds of electoral malpractice.&lt;ref name=emergency&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emergency, and Indian democracy|url=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html|website=sscnet.ucla.edu|publisher=UCLA Division of Social Science|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]. She moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. In response to increasing disorder and lawlessness, Gandhi's cabinet and government recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[State of Emergency in India|State of Emergency]], which he did on 25 June 1975 based on the provisions of [[Part Eleven of the Constitution of India|Article 352]] of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency papers found |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/Emergency-papers-found/articleshow/20839450.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=6 June 2018 |date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future prime ministers [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and Manmohan Singh continued the economic reform policies begun by Rao's government.

By 1996, the party's image was suffering from allegations of corruption, and in elections that year, Congress was reduced to 140 seats, its lowest number in the Lok Sabha to that point.

====Sonia/Rahul era (1998 - onward)====
[[File:Sonia Gandhi (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=|[[Sonia Gandhi]], the leader of INC from 1998 to 2017]]

The 1998 general election saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2145_98.htm|title=India Parliamentary Chamber: Lok Sabha|website=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs, and had stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP), led by [[Sharad Pawar]]. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere. The remainder continued to be known as the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nationalist-Congress-Party|title=Nationalist Congress Party|work=[[Britannica]]|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonia Gandhi struggled to revive the party in her early years as its president; she was under continuous scrutiny for her foreign birth and lack of political acumen. In the snap elections called by the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) government in 1999, Congress' tally further plummeted to just 114 seats.&lt;ref name="negi"/&gt; Although the leadership structure was unaltered as the party campaigned strongly in the assembly elections that followed, Gandhi began to make such strategic changes as abandoning the party's 1998 Pachmarhi resolution of ''ekla chalo'', or "go it alone" policy, and formed alliances with other like-minded parties. In the intervening years, the party was successful at various legislative assembly elections; at one point, Congress ruled 15 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband  death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=16 December 2017|date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2004 general election, Congress forged alliances with regional parties including the NCP and the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/election/2004/may/14congress.htm|title=The mathematics of politics|website=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=16 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's campaign emphasised social inclusion and the welfare of the common masses{{emdash}}an ideology that Gandhi herself endorsed for Congress during her presidency{{emdash}}with slogans such as ''Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath'' ("Congress hand in hand with the common man"), contrasting with the NDA's "[[India Shining]]" campaign.&lt;ref name="negi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/politics/sonia-gandhis-legacy-she-reinvented-herself-to-fight-off-challenges-but-also-had-her-share-of-failures-1606229.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's Legacy: She Reinvented Herself to Fight Off Challenges but also Had Her Share of Failures|last=Negi|first=Saroj|website=[[India Today]]|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/sonia-gandhi-congress-president-rahul-gandhi-politics-4983911/|title=Sonia Gandhi retires as Congress president, to remain active in politics|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 December 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-sonia-gandhi-makes-way-4984673/ |title=As Sonia Gandhi makes way|last=Chowdhary|first=Neerja|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naqshbandi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html |title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband Rajiv's death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-gandhi/sonia-gandhi-keeps-congress-hopes-alive-in-india-polls-idUSTRE53D1XH20090414 |title=Sonia Gandhi keeps Congress hopes alive in India polls|last=Chandra|first=Rina|publisher=Reuters|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 222 seats in the new parliament, defeating the NDA by a substantial margin. With the subsequent support of the communist front, Congress won a majority and formed a new government. Despite massive support from within the party, Gandhi declined the post of prime minister, choosing to appoint Manmohan Singh instead. She remained as party president and headed the [[National Advisory Council]] (NAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hands-on influence for Sonia Gandhi as NAC head|url=http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/bwgztbqFBjfiC4WnGGye3H/Handson-influence-for-Sonia-Gandhi-as-NAC-head.html|accessdate=17 August 2016|last=Mathew|first=Liz|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Livemint]]|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first term in office, the UPA government passed several social reform bills. These included an [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act|employment guarantee]] bill, the [[Right to Information Act]], and a [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act|right to education]] act. The NAC, as well as [[Left Front (West Bengal)|the Left Front]] that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manmohan survives trust vote|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/trustvote/|work=India Today|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Lok Sabha elections held soon after, Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling it to form a government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government, and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP, are broadly credited with the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bidwai|first=Praful|title=Reading the Verdict|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=archiveSearch&amp;aid=20090619261209100&amp;ais=12&amp;avol=26|work=Frontline|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party had lost much of its popular support, mainly because of several years of poor economic conditions in the country, and growing discontent over a series of corruption allegations involving government officials, including the [[2G spectrum case]] and the [[Indian coal allocation scam]].&lt;ref name=2G&gt;{{cite news|title=2G spectrum scam|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-is-the-2g-scam-all-about/1/188832.html|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=India Today|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coal&gt;{{cite news|title=Coal Block Allocations Scam|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-what-is-the-indian-coal-allocation-scam-1828830|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress won only 44 seats,&lt;ref name=performance&gt;{{cite news|title=List of Congress winners|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lok-sabha-election-results-list-of-congress-winners/472493-37-64.html|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was its worst-ever performance in a national election and brought into question whether it would continue to be identified as an officially recognised party.&lt;ref name=result&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress Vote Share Dips Below 20 Per Cent for First Time|url=http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/election-results-2014-congress-vote-share-dips-below-20-per-cent-for-first-time-526000|accessdate=22 June 2014|work=[[NDTV India]]|date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi retired as party president in December 2017, having served for a record nineteen years.

==Election symbols==
[[File:Cow and Calf INC.svg|thumb|right|Election symbol of Indira's Congress (R) party during the period 1971–1977]]

{{as of|2014}}, the [[election symbol]] of Congress, as approved by the [[Election Commission of India]], is an image of a right hand with its palm facing front and its fingers pressed together;&lt;ref name=hand&gt;{{cite news|title=A Short History of the Congress Hand|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/03/28/a-short-history-of-the-congress-hand/|accessdate=27 June 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|agency=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is usually shown in the centre of a tricolor flag.

Those elected as members of the states' legislative assemblies form the Congress Legislature Parties in the various state assemblies; their chairperson is usually the party's nominee for Chief Ministership. The party is also organised into various committees, and sections; it publishes a daily newspaper, the ''[[The National Herald (India)|National Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="Kumar1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kedar Nath Kumar|title=Political Parties in India, Their Ideology and Organisation|url={{Google books|x3pJ8t4rxIsC|page=PA41|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-205-9|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a party with a structure, Congress under Indira Gandhi did not hold any organizational elections after 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress Indira to Sonia Gandhi|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz Publications|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8178353401|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npdqD_TXucQC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22indian+national+congress%22++%22internal+democracy%22+sonia#v=snippet&amp;q=%22internal%20democracy%22|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AICC is composed of delegates sent from the PCCs.&lt;ref name="Kumar1990"/&gt; The delegates elect Congress committees, including the [[Congress Working Committee]], consisting of senior party leaders and office bearers. The AICC takes all important executive and political decisions. Since Indira Gandhi formed Congress&amp;nbsp;(I) in 1978, the [[Congress President|President of the Indian National Congress]] has effectively been: the party's national leader, head of the organisation, head of the Working Committee and all chief Congress committees, chief spokesman, and Congress' choice for [[Prime Minister of India]]. Constitutionally, the president is elected by the PCCs and members of the AICC; however, this procedure has often been by-passed by the Working Committee, which has elected its own candidate.&lt;ref name="Kumar1990"/&gt;

The Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) consists of elected MPs in the Lok Sabha and [[Rajya Sabha]]. There is also a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in each state. The CLP consists of all Congress [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) in each state. In cases of states where the Congress is single-handedly ruling the government, the CLP leader is the [[Chief Minister]]. Other directly affiliated groups include: the [[National Students Union of India]] (NSUI), the [[Indian Youth Congress]] &amp;mdash; the party's youth wing, the [[Indian National Trade Union Congress]], [[Mahila Congress]], its women's division, and Congress [[Seva Dal]]&amp;mdash;its voluntary organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalbaba.com/election-2014/all-india-2014-results-partywise/|title=All India 2014 Results|website=Political Baba}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/lok-sabha-election-2014/data|title=Lok Sabha Election 2014 Analysis, Infographics, Election 2014 Map, Election 2014 Charts|website=Firstpost|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142920/http://www.firstpost.com/lok-sabha-election-2014/data|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynasticism===
Dynasticism is fairly common in many political parties in India,however,the congress can be described as dynastic party par excellence.Six members of the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]] have been presidents of the party.The party started turning into a family firm controlled by Indira Gandhi's family during [[The Emergency (India)|the emergency]].This was characterized by servility and sycophancy towards the family which later turned into hereditary succession of Gandhi family members to power.&lt;ref name="Bose2013"/&gt; Since the formation of Congress(I) by Indira Gandhi in 1978,the party president has been from her family except for the period between 1991 and 1998.

==Ideology and policies==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
{{Social democracy sidebar}}
Congress is a [[Civic nationalism|civic nationalist]] party that follows a form of [[nationalism]] that supports the values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite book|author=N. S. Gehlot|title=The Congress Party in India: Policies, Culture, Performance|url={{Google books|06HLD2_3Qj4C|page=PA177|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1991|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7100-306-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout much of the Cold War period, Congress supported a foreign policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]] that called for India to form ties with both the Western and Eastern Blocs, but to avoid formal alliances with either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jawaharlal-nehru-the-architect-of-indias-foreign-policy/articleshow/58767014.cms |title=Non-Aligned Movement: Jawaharlal Nehru – The architect of India's foreign policy &amp;#124; India News - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2017-05-20 |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  support for Pakistan led the party to endorse a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=11:36 pm |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ChanakyaCode/the-indo-pak-war-1965-and-the-tashkent-agreement-role-of-external-powers/ |title=The Indo-Pak war 1965 and the Tashkent agreement: Role of external powers |publisher=Blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the premiership to Manmohan Singh.

===Economic policy===
The history of economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods. The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector. The second period began with economic liberalization in 1991.

At the beginning of the first period, the Congress prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru implemented policies based on [[import substitution industrialization]] and advocated a [[mixed economy]] where the government-controlled [[public sector]] would co-exist with the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=243}} He believed that the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public-sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.{{sfn| Kopstein|2005|p=364}} This period was called the [[Licence Raj]], or Permit Raj,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989: from [[Sanskrit|Skr.]] ''rāj'': to reign, rule; cognate with [[Latin|L.]] ''rēx'', ''rēg-is'', [[Old Irish|OIr.]] ''rī'', ''rīg'' king (see RICH).&lt;/ref&gt; which was the elaborate system of [[Industrial licensing in India|licences]], regulations, and accompanying [[red tape]] that were required to set up and run businesses in [[India]] between 1947 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm Street Hawking Promise Jobs in Future] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329023451/http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm |date=March 29, 2008 }}, ''[[The Times of India]]'', 2001-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; The Licence Raj was a result of Nehru and his successors' desire to have a [[planned economy]] where all aspects of the economy were controlled by the state, and licences were given to a select few. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something; and, if the licence were granted, the government would regulate production.&lt;ref name="bbcindia1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/55427.stm|title=India: the economy|year=1998|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence raj system continued under Indira Gandhi.In addition,many key sectors such as banking, steel coal, and oil were nationalized.&lt;ref name="Rosser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapila1"&gt;{{Cite book

In 1991, the new Congress-party government, led by P. V. Narasimha Rao, initiated reforms to avert the impending [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 economic crisis]].&lt;ref name="Narasimha Rao was father of economic reform: Pranab"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf|archivedate=25 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025042847/http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf|title= India's Pathway through Financial Crisis|work=globaleconomicgovernance.org|format=PDF|others=Arunabha Ghosh|publisher=Global Economic Governance Programme|accessdate=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms progressed furthest in opening up areas to [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], reforming [[capital markets]], [[Deregulation|deregulating]] domestic business, and reforming the trade regime. The goals of Rao's government were to reduce the [[fiscal deficit]], [[privatization|privatize]] the public sector, and increase investment in infrastructure. Trade reforms and changes in the regulation of [[foreign direct investment]] were introduced in order to open India to foreign trade while stabilising external loans. Rao chose [[Manmohan Singh]] for the job. Singh, an acclaimed economist and former chairman of the Resrve Bank, played a central role in implementing these reforms.

In 2004, Singh became prime minister of the Congress-led UPA government. Singh remained prime minister after the UPA won the 2009 general elections. The UPA government introduced policies aimed at reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Banking on reform|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/banking-on-reform/1059372/|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced  policies aimed at relieving farmers of their debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmer Waiver Scheme- PM statement|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=39122|publisher=PIB|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Singh's government introduced the [[value added tax]], replacing the [[sales tax]]. India was able to resist the worst effects of the global [[Economic crisis of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, R., 2008. Global financial crisis and key risks: impact on India and Asia.

Johnson|accessdate=17 June 2011|date=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh's government continued the [[Golden Quadrilateral]], the Indian  highway modernisation program that was initiated by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee|Vajpayee]]'s government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic benefits of golden Quadilateral|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/economic-benefits-of-the-golden-quadrilateral-project/1/194321.html|publisher=Business today|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both [[market economy|market]] and [[Planned economy|planned economies]]. Congress advocates import substitution industrialisation—the replacement of foreign imports with domestic products. Congress believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development.

===Healthcare and education===
In 2005, the Congress-led government started the National Rural Health Mission, which employed about 500,000 community health workers. It was praised by  economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name="timepoverty"&gt;{{cite news|title=The End of Poverty|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1034738,00.html|first=Jeffrey D.|last=Sachs|date=6 March 2005|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it implemented a proposal to reserve 27% of seats in the All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), and other central higher education institutions, for [[Other Backward Class]]es, which led to the [[2006 Indian anti-reservation protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Students-cry-out-No-reservation-please/articleshow/1513316.cms |title=Students cry out: No reservation please &amp;#124; India News - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2006-05-03 |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Singh government also continued the [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] programme, which includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day school meals and the opening of new schools throughout India, especially in rural areas, to fight [[illiteracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Direct SSA funds for school panels|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/338571/direct-ssa-funds-school-panels.html|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Manmohan Singh's prime-ministership, eight Institutes of Technology were opened in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LS passes bill to provide IIT for eight states.|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/148456/ls-passes-bill-provide-iit.html|publisher=Deccan Herald|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the US in July 2005 to negotiate an [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]]. US president [[George W.

'''''Jasenovac – istina''''' (English: '''''Jasenovac – The Truth''''') is a 2016 documentary film by Croatian filmmaker [[Jakov Sedlar]]. The film contends that the extent of [[The Holocaust in Croatia]] and the [[World War II]]-era [[World War II persecution of Serbs|genocide]] of the country's [[Serbs|Serb]] population was exaggerated through post-war [[communism|communist]] propaganda. It focuses primarily on [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], a [[concentration camp]] run by Croatia's wartime [[fascism|fascist]] [[Ustaše]] government where an estimated 100,000 are believed to have perished, and suggests that the actual death toll never exceeded 18,000. The film also argues that Jasenovac continued being used as a concentration camp by Yugoslavia's communist authorities well after World War II, and that more inmates perished when it was run by the communists than when it was run by the Ustaše.

The film premiered in [[Tel Aviv]] in February 2016 and in [[Zagreb]] two months later. Its Croatian premiere was attended by [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Culture Minister]] [[Zlatko Hasanbegović]], who is alleged to have made a number of pro-fascist statements in the past. The film was panned by scholars, journalists and politicians from the Croatian [[Left-wing politics|left]], who accused the filmmakers of minimizing and relativizing Ustaše atrocities. It was also alleged that the filmmakers had fabricated or misrepresented a number of photographs, correspondences and newspaper reports seen in the film, as well as that they had manipulated videotaped survivor testimony through selective editing. The Israeli ambassador to Croatia, who attended the Zagreb premiere, strongly criticized the film and accused the filmmakers of [[Historical negationism|historical revisionism]], as did representatives of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serb]] and [[Jews of Croatia|Croatian Jewish]] communities.

''Jasenovac – istina'' has been shown as an educational feature in a number of Croatian schools, causing further controversy. Sedlar has said that he intends to screen the film at Holocaust museums and Jewish community centres, and indicated that copies will be donated to university libraries in Europe and North America. In July 2016, a [[non-governmental organization]] called the Anti-Fascist League of Croatia filed a lawsuit against Sedlar alleging the film incited ethnic intolerance and promoted [[Holocaust denial]].

==Production==
[[File:Jakov Sedlar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Director [[Jakov Sedlar]]]]
During [[World War II]], Croats were divided between the [[communism|communist]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], and the [[fascism|fascist]] [[Ustaše]], led by [[Ante Pavelić]]. Pavelić came to power following the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, declared independence from [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and ruled the fascist [[puppet state]] of [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] as a dictator until 1945, when the Ustaše were defeated and the country was reintegrated into Yugoslavia, which fell under communist rule at the war's end.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Economist|title=As its government falls, Croatia is fighting about Communists and fascists again|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21700837-balkan-problem-child-unable-stop-squabbling-even-football-pitch-its-government|date=21 June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in power, the Ustaše had pursued a campaign of extermination against Croatia's minorities, particularly [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] (Gypsies). Between 1941 and 1945, they set up a number of [[concentration camp]]s, the largest of which was [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], which survivors dubbed the "[[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] of the Balkans". An estimated 100,000 prisoners perished at the camp, which was only liberated following Pavelić's defeat in April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Balkan 'Auschwitz' haunts Croatia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4479837.stm|date=25 April 2005|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wartime events continue to influence 21st-century Croatian politics. "For many Croats," ''[[The Economist]]'' reports, "voting has less to do with left- or right-leaning ideological beliefs than with whose side one's family was on during the Second World War."&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;

The film was directed and produced by [[Jakov Sedlar]], written by novelist [[Hrvoje Hitrec]], and narrated by Croatian actors [[Dragan Despot]] and Sanja Marin.&lt;ref name="Novosti"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nikola Bajto|publisher=Novosti|title=Sve laži Jakova Sedlara|trans-title=All the lies of Jakov Sedlar|language=Croatian|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/sve-lai-jakova-sedlara|date=16 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedlar was the [[Government of Croatia|Croatian Government]]'s "official propagandist" during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s, according to the historian [[Vjekoslav Perica]].{{sfn|Perica|2002|p=121}} Sedlar became known for films such as ''[[Gospa]]'' (Madonna) and ''[[Četverored]]'' (Four by Four), which show the events of World War II and the [[Cold War]] from a Croatian nationalist perspective.{{sfn|Perica|2002|p=172}} He also made a number of documentaries glorifying wartime [[President of Croatia|President]] [[Franjo Tuđman]] and his party, the right-wing [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (''Hrvatska Demokratska zajednica''; HDZ). In an apparent bid to increase their credibility abroad, several were filmed in the English language, with actor [[Martin Sheen]] narrating.{{sfn|Fisher|2006|p=112}} Hitrec was another close associate of Tuđman, as well as one of the founding members of the HDZ.&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Politika|title=Hrvatska istina o ustaškom logoru Jasenovac|trans-title=The Croatian truth about the Ustaše camp Jasenovac|language=Serbian|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/354313/Pogledi/Hrvatska-istina-o-ustaskom-logoru-Jasenovac|date=5 May 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he was appointed director of Croatia's state broadcaster, [[Croatian Radiotelevision]].

==Summary==
[[File:Voz Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The train that carried prisoners to Jasenovac]]
The film opens by stating that the number of inmates who perished at Jasenovac has never been accurately ascertained, with estimates ranging from 49,000 to 700,000 dead. It brings up a document from 1946 in which the president of the State Commission on Ascertaining Crimes Committed by Occupying Powers and Their Helpers reports that 15,792 inmates were killed at Jasenovac. The film then offers a glimpse at the 1945 British documentary ''A Painful Reminder: Evidence for All Mankind'', in which it is stated that 20,000 perished at the camp.

After [[World War I]], the film asserts, Croatia was occupied by [[Greater Serbia]]n expansionists and royalist guerillas known as [[Chetniks]], who relegated Croats to the status of second-class citizens. It highlights a number of alleged murders of Croats in interwar Yugoslavia committed by Chetniks. In Jasenovac, the film claims, a Serb merchant named [[Lazar Bačić]] led a band that killed five Croats and terrorized countless others between 1918 and 1941. During this period, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]]'s government implemented discriminatory laws targeting Croats, used the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] to crush a number of peasant revolts and organized the killing of [[Croatian Peasant Party]] leader [[Stjepan Radić]], after which Alexander declared himself royal dictator. Yugoslav jails became filled with Croatian patriots, the film explains, and the name Croatia was erased from all maps. In response to this oppression, a Croat lawyer named [[Ante Pavelić]] founded the Ustaše, a patriotic movement whose aim was to defend Croatian national interests in "all the lands that Croats have historically inhabited". Pavelić was soon exiled to Italy, where he continued plotting against the "Belgrade regime". In 1934, the Ustaše helped organize Alexander's assassination in [[Marseille]]. His funeral was attended by [[Philippe Pétain]] and [[Hermann Göring]]. This fact, the film maintains, was deliberately omitted from Yugoslav [[historiography]].

In April 1941, amidst the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and in response to a Serbian militia's massacre of dozens of defenseless Croatian civilians near [[Bjelovar]], the Ustaše proclaimed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia. Serbian nationalists, unwilling to live in an independent Croatian state, revolted against the Ustaše and initiated a campaign of genocide against the Croatian population. Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, a large number of these nationalists joined the Partisans in terrorizing Croat population centres. Pavelić, meanwhile, was misled into implementing German-style [[anti-Jewish laws]], similar to those that Yugoslavia had implemented even before the invasion. Bačić and his son fled Jasenovac and sought refuge in Serbia, it is said, where they offered their services to collaborationist leader [[Milan Nedić]]. Bačić's property, which housed a brick factory prior to the invasion, was transformed into a "concentration and labour" camp and resumed production. At its height, the camp's brick factory employed 180 inmates. Hundreds of workers died from disease, exhaustion, or by drowning in a nearby marsh. The camp was used to detain all opponents of Pavelić's regime regardless of ethnicity, the film asserts, and it is claimed that most inmates were Croats.

Thousands of Jews are said to have sought refuge in Croatia before 1941, enticed by the Croats' historical [[Judeophilia]]. Hundreds converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] at the urging of Archbishop [[Aloysius Stepinac]], thereby saving their own lives. Pavelić's wife, the film claims, was Jewish herself, as were many senior Ustaše officials. The viewer is shown a letter allegedly authored by Pavelić, asking government minister [[Mile Budak]] to spare the lives of Jews who had not committed any crimes against the state. The film claims that hundreds of Jasenovac inmates were killed in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing raids in 1944–45. Between 1941 and 1945, inmates were allowed to stage concerts, book readings and play football, the film maintains, and conditions were more humane than those in German camps. The narrator states that post-war communist propaganda inflated the number of people killed at Jasenovac, from an estimated 18,000 to 600,000–700,000. The viewer is shown a headline from the Partisan newspaper ''[[Vjesnik]]'', said to be dated from April 1945, which says that corpses tossed into the [[Sava]] River at Jasenovac had reached Zagreb. The narrator questions the veracity of this claim, explaining that the Sava flows away from Zagreb and not towards it.

The film expresses doubts about the incomplete list of over 83,000 victims compiled by the Jasenovac Research Institute, which supposedly includes the names of people who had been killed elsewhere by the Germans and Chetniks. It then claims that the Partisans used Jasenovac as a concentration camp of their own between 1945 and 1951, and that more inmates lost their lives while it was under communist control than when it was controlled by the Ustaše. The narrator concedes, however, that there is no documentary evidence proving this hypothesis. Over several months in the summer of 1945, the film contends, the Partisans [[Bleiburg repatriations|massacred]] hundreds of thousands of Croats along the Austrian border, thereby committing one of the worst genocides in European history. Many of those who participated in the killings, it claims, were former Chetniks who had only recently changed allegiance and joined the Partisans. The narrator warns viewers against believing mainstream historical accounts of Croatia's wartime history and states that a number of prominent Croatian citizens, including former presidents [[Stjepan Mesić]] and [[Ivo Josipović]], as well as a number of left-leaning historians and journalists, are conspiring against the country by perpetuating left-wing historical narratives. The film ends with the narrator calling the aforementioned individuals "[[liberalism|liberal]] fascists".

On 6 April, the film was shown at the seminary of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska|Archdiocese]] of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The screening was organized by the Croatian [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] society, and attended by the deputy speaker of the [[Parliament of Croatia|Croatian Parliament]], Ante Sanader.&lt;ref name="Matijanić"/&gt; Its [[DVD]] release was accompanied by a shorter documentary, also directed by Sedlar, titled ''Holokaust u Srbiji, 1941–1945'' (''The Holocaust in Serbia, 1941–1945'') about the [[The Holocaust in Serbia|Holocaust in Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Radiovrh.ca|title=Jasenovac: Istina|url=http://www.radiovrh.ca/pages/jasenovac%20-%20istina%20-%20plakat%20-%20Vancouver%20-%2030-4.pdf|date=30 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jasenovac'' was poorly received by the Croatian [[Left-wing politics|left]].&lt;ref name="al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Al Jazeera|title='Ustašizacija' zemlje uz filmove, pjevače i nogometaše|trans-title=The Ustashization of the country through movies, songs and football|language=Serbo-Croatian|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/ustasizacija-zemlje-uz-filmove-pjevace-i-nogometase|date=22 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also criticized by members of Croatia's Jewish community. The scholar [[Slavko Goldstein]], himself a [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]], said the film promotes the idea that "Jasenovac was not a death camp, but merely a labour camp or a prisoner camp.

There is no single explanation for why this is happening now, and it would be wrong to exaggerate how widespread the phenomenon is.

==Controversy==
===Forged newspaper headline===
{{double image|right|Vjesnik 1945 1.jpg|252|Vjesnik 1945 2.jpg|280|Authentic ''[[Vjesnik]]'' headline ''(left)'' and the doctored headline shown in the film ''(right)''. The latter was most likely created using [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]].}}
In April 2016, Lovro Krnić, a Croatian journalist writing for the website ''Lupiga.com'', proved that one of the newspaper headlines seen in the film was doctored.&lt;ref name="sven"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sven Milekić|publisher=Balkan Insight|title=Croatian Director Reported for Jasenovac Camp Film|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-director-reported-for-jasenovac-camp-film-07-15-2016|date=15 July 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headline in question was said to be from an May 1945 issue of the Croatian [[Unitary National Liberation Front]] newspaper ''[[Vjesnik]]'' and claimed that corpses tossed into the Sava were reaching Zagreb from the direction of Jasenovac.&lt;ref name="Lovro"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lovro Krnić|publisher=Lupiga|title=Jasenovac – fotošopirana istina: Sedlarov udarni argument o plivanju leševa uzvodno je loša montaža|trans-title=Jasenovac – the photoshopped truth: Sedlar's key argument about floating bodies is but a poorly rendered montage|language=Croatian|url=http://lupiga.com/vijesti/otkrivamo-jasenovac-fotosopirana-istina-sedlarov-udarni-argument-o-plivanju-leseva-uzvodno-je-losa-fotomontaza|date=7 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of its inclusion in the film was to demonstrate that the Partisans were spreading lies about Jasenovac as early as May 1945, given that the Sava flows eastwards away from Zagreb and not towards it.&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt;

Shortly after the premiere, Krnić went through the Zagreb state archives and examined all the May 1945 issues of ''Vjesnik'', the newspaper in question. He found that no such headline exists. Upon closer inspection, Krnić discovered that the headline seen in the film had been crudely doctored, likely using [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]], since the article seen below the doctored headline matches with another news story unrelated to Jasenovac. By comparing other articles present on the front page, Krnić concluded that the original issue of ''Vjesnik'' used for the forgery was published on 15 May 1945, and that nothing except the main headline was changed for the film, except the publication date itself, which was obscured in Sedlar's film by a faked damage effect.&lt;ref name="Lovro"/&gt; Sedlar denied forging the headline and maintained that it was authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Večernji list|title=Sedlar: Naslovnica Vjesnika prikazana u filmu je autentična|trans-title=Sedlar: The Vjesnik headline seen in the film is authentic|language=Croatian|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/sedlar-naslovnica-vjesnika-prikazana-u-filmu-je-autenticna-1074712|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for [[N1 (television)|N1]], a regional news channel, Sedlar said he paid an unnamed private collector in Belgrade to film his copy of the ''Vjesnik'' issue, adding that the people who own it are "thieves" who probably "stole it somewhere", and saying he does not own a copy himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=N1|title=Sedlar u intervjuu za N1 opovrgava korištenje fotomontaže|trans-title=In an Interview for N1 Sedlar denies using photomontage|language=Croatian|url=http://hr.n1info.com/a115889/Vijesti/Sedlar-u-intervjuu-za-N1-opovrgava-koristenje-fotomontaze.html|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other alleged misrepresentations and errors===
Journalists and scholars uncovered further inaccuracies and misrepresentations in the weeks following the film's release. Journalist Nikola Bajto found that a photograph purporting to show interwar Chetniks in the vicinity of Jasenovac actually depicted World War II-era [[Slovene Home Guard]]s, as evidenced by the [[Slovene language]] slogan ''Svoboda ali Smrt'' ("Freedom or Death") on the banner they are seen holding, which would have been written in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] had the depicted individuals actually been Chetniks.&lt;ref name="Sven"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sven Milekic|publisher=Balkan Insight|title=Dishonour for Zagreb Over 'Alternative Facts' About Holocaust|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/dishonour-for-zagreb-over-alternative-facts-about-holocaust-04-21-2017|date=21 April 2017|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph purporting to show a football team made up of camp inmates, supposedly proving that inmates were allowed to partake in recreational activities, was also found to have been misrepresented by the filmmakers. The photograph was taken in the 1970s and shows players from a local lower-league team called [[NK Balkan Jasenovac]].&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt;

At one point in the film, the narrator refers to late Croatian demographer [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] (who authored a number of scholarly studies on wartime deaths in Yugoslavia) by the traditionally Serb [[given name]] of [[Dragutin (given name)|Dragutin]], calling him "Dragutin Žerjavić". The intention, according to Croatian journalist Vladimir Matijanić, was to discredit Žerjavić's findings by implying that he was an ethnic Serb.&lt;ref name="Matijanić"/&gt; Bajto also criticized the portion of the film where a photograph of Pétain and Göring at King Alexander's 1934 funeral is shown, with the narrator claiming that any mention of their attendance was omitted from official Yugoslav historiography. Bajto explained that Pétain and Göring had been among hundreds of European dignitaries at the funeral, and that their presence was not indicative of any pro-fascist sympathies on the part of the Yugoslav monarchy. He notes that their attendance there was not only never concealed, but that the very book from which the filmmakers obtained the photograph had been published in Serbia in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt;

The Anti-Fascist League of Croatia, a local [[non-governmental organization]], alleges that the purported Pavelić–Budak correspondence shown in the film is not authentic, and suggests the letters shown were written on a model of typewriter that was not produced until after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tihomir Ponoš|publisher=Novi list|title=Antifašistička liga prijavila Jakova Sedlara zbog poticanja na nasilje i mržnju|trans-title=The Anti-Fascist League Reports Sedlar for Inciting Violence and Hatred|language=Croatian|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Antifasisticka-liga-prijavila-Jakova-Sedlara-zbog-poticanja-na-nasilje-i-mrznju|date=16 July 2016|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein stated that he had never come across the papers before.

"While they cannot be identified, they do not look as if they are over 80, as they would have to be if they were guards in 1950."&lt;ref name="Sven"/&gt;

Historians also criticized the filmmakers for suggesting that hundreds of thousands of Ustaše prisoners were executed by the Partisans after the war, saying there is no evidence to substantiate such a figure.&lt;ref name="Sven"/&gt; The filmmakers were also criticized for claiming that the [[Zagreb Synagogue]] was the only surviving synagogue in a wartime European capital; it was destroyed along with more than 20 other Croatian synagogues during the war.&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt; Photographs of the various stages of the months-long destruction of the Zagreb Synagogue were even taken and exhibited publicly at the [[Antisemitic Exhibition in Zagreb]] by Ustaše themselves in May 1942. "The filmmakers are portraying the Jewish experience in wartime Croatia in the best possible light," Matijanić wrote. "There is no mention of the deportation of Zagreb's chief [[rabbi]] to Auschwitz, where he was killed."&lt;ref name="Matijanić"/&gt; "The irony," Bajto notes, "is that Sedlar and Hitrec lied and manipulated while accusing the Partisans of doing just that." He goes on to call the entire film "a lie".&lt;ref name="Novosti"/&gt;

===Inclusion in educational institutions===
In April 2016, the film was played as part of the religious studies curriculum at a [[high school]] in [[Sisak]].&lt;ref name="al Jazeera"/&gt; The incident caused an uproar among Croatia's anti-fascist left. The Croatian daily ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' called the incident "scandalous". The school's principal rejected criticism that it was irresponsible to show the film to high schoolers, arguing that any film could be shown in the classroom as long as it was not banned outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Jutarnji list|title=Skandal u Sisačkoj Srednjoj Školi: Na satu vjeronauka đaci gledali Sedlarov film 'Jasenovac – istina'|trans-title=Scandal in a Sisak high school: Student view Sedlar's film "Jasenovac: The Truth" in religious studies class|language=Croatian|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/skandal-u-sisackoj-srednjoj-skoli-na-satu-vjeronauka-daci-gledali-sedlarov-film-jasenovac-istina-ravnatelj-koliko-znam-film-nije-zabranjen/4047600/|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian journalist Tomislav Šoštarić, writing for [[Al Jazeera Balkans]], attributes such incidents to the resurgence of [[Far-right politics in Croatia|far-right sentiment in Croatia]] following the HDZ's return to power in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|November 2015 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name="al Jazeera"/&gt; A number of the country's high schools have since screened the film in their classrooms, according to the Anti-Fascist League of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Ba.n1|title=Hrvatski reditelj kazneno prijavljen zbog filma o Jasenovcu|trans-title=Lawsuit filed against Jakov Sedlar because of a film about Jasenovac|language=Bosnian|url=http://ba.n1info.com/a105151/Svijet/Regija/Jakov-Sedlar-prijavljen-zbog-filma-o-Jasenovcu.html|date=15 July 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedlar has stated that he intended to screen the film at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as a Jewish community centre in [[New York City]]. He has also stated that the film would be translated into a number of languages and that copies would be donated to dozens of university libraries across Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Tportal.hr|title=Sedlar na promociji svog filma o Jasenovcu napao Goldsteina|trans-title=Sedlar attacks Goldstein at a press conference for Jasenovac film|language=Croatian|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/423380/Sedlar-na-promociji-svog-filma-o-Jasenovcu-napao-Godsteina.html|date=7 April 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yad Vashem was among the recipients of the film. In April 2017, Zuroff criticized the organization for having the film as part of its media repertoire. "The fact that an item is in the collection is in no way an endorsement of its content, but only reflects that it is about our subject of interest," said Robert Rozett, Yad Vashem's libraries director. He noted that the library collection contains more than 161,000 printed items and some 7,000 films, including those that deny the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tamara Zieve|publisher=Jerusalem Post|title=Nazi-hunter Petitions Zagreb to Reject Plans to Honor Filmmaker|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Nazi-hunter-petitions-Zagreb-to-reject-plans-to-honor-filmmaker-488249|date=18 April 2017|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit and award controversy===
In July 2016, the Anti-Fascist League of Croatia filed a lawsuit against Sedlar alleging that the film incited ethnic intolerance and promoted [[Holocaust denial]]. They allege that Sedlar misrepresented the extent and severity of the crimes committed at Jasenovac, trying to portray it as "a communist myth". Sedlar was also accused of deliberately neglecting to discuss the involvement of Ustaše units in war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The lawsuit points to the doctored newspaper headline as evidence, and alleges that the correspondence between Pavelić and Budak that is seen in the film was doctored as well. "By creating untruths," the League asserts, "[Sedlar] says something extremely negative regarding the Serb minority in the film, creating an atmosphere of hatred and intolerance and demonizing certain groups and their members in a typical process of creating the preconditions for promoting animosity and hatred among the public."&lt;ref name="sven"/&gt; In April 2017, Sedlar wrote an open letter to the Zagreb City Council in response to the allegations. "Never, not in a single film or public appearance of mine, have I ever incited hatred or tried to deny any crime; never in any thoughts did I say anything positive about fascism. Fascism, like communism, is an evil that only a sick man can support and promote." Sedlar was subsequently accused of falsely attributing a quote to [[Winston Churchill]] in another part of the letter.&lt;ref name="Sven"/&gt;{{efn|"In the future, fascists will emerge from the ranks of anti-fascists," is the quote that Sedlar attributed to Churchill. According to the [[International Churchill Society]], Churchill never made such a statement.&lt;ref name="Sven"/&gt;}}

In April 2017, the Zagreb City Council received a motion to honour Sedlar from the Committee for Public Recognition, headed by mayor [[Milan Bandić]].&lt;ref name="Milekic"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sven Milekic|title=Zagreb Award For Jasenovac Film Director Draws Protests|publisher=Balkan Insight|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/zagreb-awards-controversial-film-director-04-19-2017|date=20 April 2017|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was criticized by the Croatian Jewish community, as well as by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre. Zuroff wrote a letter to the council requesting that the motion be dismissed. "We urge you to unequivocally reject any proposal to honor Sedlar, whose work belongs in the dustbin of Croatian history and is not worthy of any approval or recognition," Zuroff wrote.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt; On 19 April 2017, the city council announced that it had accepted Sedlar's nomination, and bestowed upon him the Award of the City of Zagreb, along with [[Euro|€]]4,000 in prize money. Rival groups of protesters stood outside the [[Zagreb Assembly]] while the announcement was being made, with anti-fascist and left-wing groups demonstrating against Sedlar and Croatian veterans of the Yugoslav Wars expressing their support.&lt;ref name="Milekic"/&gt;

The '''Kanak Language Academy''' ('''Académie des Langues Kanak'''; '''KLA''') is a local, public educational establishment in [[New Caledonia]].  Founded in 2007, with roots reaching to the [[Nouméa Accords]] of 1998, the legislative assembly endorsed the setting up of the French territory’s first indigenous Kanak languages institute.&lt;ref name="islandsbusiness.com2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=7573/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl|title=The academy's main tasks are to normalise, promote and develop New Caledonia's linguistic heritage|date=19 January 2007 |work=islandsbusiness.com|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is "to establish rules of usage and to help promote and develop all [[Kanak people|Kanak]] languages and dialects".  The KLA is expected to standardise, protect, and develop the about forty Kanak languages and dialects,&lt;ref name="rnzi.com2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=30527|title=New Caledonian indigenous Kanak language academy set up|date=4 March 2007|publisher=Radio New Zealand International|accessdate=6 June 2011|location=Wellington, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as standardize the written form for Kanak languages.

The majority of [[New Caledonian languages]] do not have a written form.  Those that do, have a rudimentary one.  As it was extremely difficult to define the correct spelling of words, a program was developed by the KLA and the [[University of New Caledonia]] that would propose a common writing standard.&lt;ref name="icmm.com2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmm.com/page/13082/vale-inco-contributes-to-the-preservation-of-traditional-languages-in-new-caledonia|title=The language preservation and promotion project|date=2010|publisher=International Council on Mining and Metals |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All the collected data is analyzed by [[Linguistics|linguist]]s that develop a form of writing which is accepted by the speakers.  

KLA publishes dictionaries, folk tales, and glossaries. In 2009, it had three radio broadcasts daily from Monday to Friday. In 2008, it organized a festival, Space Orality.&lt;ref name="alk.gouv.nc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alk.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/alk/actualites/formations_ateliers|title=Formations - Ateliers|work=alk.gouv.nc|language=French|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight project leaders, each working in one of the areas of the country who are supported by academicians. They are selected from New Caledonia's main cultural and traditional clans and confederations.&lt;ref name="islandsbusiness.com2007" /&gt; [[Déwé Gorodey]] was appointed chair of the academy in 2007.&lt;ref name="rnzi.com2007" /&gt; Its current director is Weniko Ihage.&lt;ref name="Ihage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/sorosoro-documents-kanak-languages-in-new-caledonia/|title=Sorosoro documents Kanak languages in New Caledonia|last=Ihage|first=Weniko |publisher=Fondation Chirac|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Local Economic Assessment Package''' (also known as '''“EDR-LEAP”''' or '''“LEAP Model”''') is a [[web-based]], interactive [[database]] and software tool used by local and regional agencies in the US to improve strategies for [[economic development]].  It provides local economic [[Performance measurement|performance measures]], and [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] for comparison of economic development factors against competing regions.  It works by incorporating elements of [[economic base analysis]] as well as [[gap analysis]] and [[business cluster]] analysis to identify needs for improvement and paths for economic growth.

The LEAP Model was originally developed for the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=2200 |title=ARC-LEAP User Instructions for the Appalachian Regional Commission's Local Economic Assessment Package |publisher=Appalachian Regional Commission website, written by Economic Development Research Group, Inc. |accessdate=2008-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920133522/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=2200 |archivedate=September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its theory and applications are discussed in peer-reviewed journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.edrgroup.com/images/stories/Transportation/new-tools-for-economic-de.pdf New Tools for Economic Development Targeting''], by Piercy, B., and Weisbrod, G., Economic Development Journal, International Economic Development Council, Fall 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eda.gov/ImageCache/EDAPublic/documents/pdfdocs2006/edamerica_5ffall2006toolkit_2epdf/v1/edamerica_5ffall2006toolkit.pdf Economic Development Targeting: Laying a Sound Foundation for Your Strategy Plan], by Petraglia, L., Economic Development America, US Economic Development Administration, Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South Point Wind Farm.jpg|thumb|Éoliennes de l'Érable, a wind turbine company, made a request in court to obtain Dr Maillé's data.]]

The '''Maillé affair''' concerns a court ordinance obtained by a private company to force scientist Marie-Ève Maillé to give access to data exposing the identity of her research participants. The researcher documented the conflicts that arose in a municipality of Québec in the context of a windfarm project. Dre Maillé, adjunct professor at [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], refuses to comply to the ordinance because it contravenes the ethical duty of preserving the privacy of research data. The ordinance was retracted in May 2017.

== Sequence of events ==
After a call for bids by [[Hydro-Québec]] in 2005, a [[wind farm]] project is presented by the Enerfín company for the [[regional county municipality]] (RCM) of [[L'Érable Regional County Municipality|l'Érable]]. Eventually, the company receives the contract for the project. Enerfín is a subsidiary of Elecnor, a Spanish [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A. company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title =Some history
 | website =Enerfín
 | access-date =December 18, 2016
 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2008, Enerfín creates the subsidiary Éoliennes de l'Érable to develop the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind farm project divides the citizens of l'Érable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Municipalité Régionale de Comté de L’Érable |author-link=L'Érable Regional County Municipality |date=2009 |title=Mémoire sur le projet d'aménagement du parc éolien de l'Érable |url=http://www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/mandats/eole-mrc-erable/documents/DM174.pdf |publisher= |page=57 |docket= |access-date= December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report presented to the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, a deterioration of social climate was noted, based on several essays submitted by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |author=Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement |date=2010 |title=Rapport d'enquête et d'audience publique sur le projet d'aménagement d'un parc éolien dans la MRC de l'Érable |url=http://www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/rapports/publications/bape267.pdf |publisher=Government of Québec |page=147 |docket= |access-date= December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the tensions, the project is authorized and the wind farm construction starts in 2011. It has been in activity since 2013.

In 2010, Marie-Ève Maillé interviews residents of the RCM of l'Érable in the context of her research. Back then, she was a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] candidate in communication at UQÀM. Her thesis is about information diffusion surrounding the wind farm project and the social division that resulted from the controversial project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Maillé |first=Marie-Ève |date=2012 |title=Information, confiance et cohésion sociale dans un conflit environnemental lié à un projet de parc éolien au Québec |type=PhD |publisher=Université du Québec à Montréal |url=http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/5178/1/D2402.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, she interviews 93 residents, of which 74 are opposed to the project and 14 are supporters. As a researcher, she is committed to protect the privacy of their personal data. This commitment is part of a consent form signed by her and each participant. She obtains her PhD in 2012.

In November 2012, some residents file a request for a class-action lawsuit against Éoliennes de l'Érable, complaining about inconvenience caused by the construction and operation of the wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;

The lawyers of Éoliennes de l'Érable then make a request to obtain the records of the interviews conducted by Maillé for her PhD, as well as the names of the people interviewed, in order to prepare the company's defense. In January 2016, Judge Marc St-Pierre accepts the request and orders Maillé to transmit the data and private information about her research participants to the company's lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jean Rivard &amp; Yvon Bourque v.

In order to avoid being forced to divulge her data, she withdraws her participation as an expert witness in the lawsuit. Despite her withdrawal, in March 2016, Dr Maillé receives a formal notice from the court ordering her to submit her data within five days. She asks Judge St-Pierre to review his judgement. If maintained, the researcher will either have to break the confidentiality agreement she made with her research participants, or expose herself to a lawsuit for contempt of court.

On May 17, 2017, Marie-Ève Maillé is at Victoriaville courthouse. Assisted by lawyers from UQUÀM, the Fonds de recherche du Québec and the Canadian Association of University Teachers, she wants Judge St-Pierre to review his judgement. The confidentiality engagement between the researcher and the research participants is put forward, as well as the [[John Henry Wigmore|Wigmore]] criteria. The new ruling is released on May 31, in favour of the researcher. Judge St-Pierre retracts his preceding judgement, which forced Dr Maillé to disclose her brute research data.&lt;ref&gt;

== Reactions in the scientific community ==
Realizing the importance of the stakes in this situation, several scientists publicly give their support to Dr Maillé. In August 2016, Québec's chief scientist [[Rémi Quirion]] says Maillé's research would never have been funded without the guarantee that the participants would remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/811463/source-identite-uqam-chercheuse-eolienne-entreprise-ordonnance-scientifiques-canadiens

The same day, the director of the Panel on Responsible Conduct of Research, Susan V. Zimmerman emphasizes that it is the researcher's duty to guarantee confidentiality on the information they obtain. On November 3, the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] says it is concerned by the ordinance forcing Dr Maillé to reveal the identity of the participants to her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.caut.ca/news/2016/11/02/caut-urges-defence-of-research-confidentiality-at-uqam

Some days later, vice-rector for research, discovery, creation and innovation of [[Université de Montréal]] reiterates the importance of respecting research participants private life, which is a «key element of ethics of research involving human participants».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 28, 2016, UQÀM files a voluntary [[Intervention (law)|intervention]] to the court, collectively with the [[Fonds québécois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies]], the Fonds de recherche du Québec en santé and the Fonds de recherche du Québec Société et culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

London, Bloomsbury. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; he has participated in prominent and controversial court cases and inquests involving accused [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bombers, the [[Birmingham Six]], [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday incident]], the [[Hillsborough disaster]] and the deaths of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]] and [[Dodi Al-Fayed]]&lt;ref&gt;Thom Dyke, {{cite news|title=Memoirs of a Radical Lawyer|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/09/mansfield-trial-darrow-memoirs|publisher=New Statesman  |accessdate=25 June 2011 | date=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[McLibel case]].

==Early life ==
He grew up in north [[Finchley]], North London, and attended Holmewood Preparatory School ([[Woodside Park (Barnet, London)|Woodside Park]]) before going to [[Highgate School]] and the [[University of Keele]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (Hons) in history and philosophy, before becoming Secretary of Keele's [[Students' Union]].

==Career==
Mansfield was called to the bar at [[Gray's Inn]] in 1967, became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1989 and was elected as a [[Bencher]] of Gray's Inn in 2007.

He is currently the President of the [[Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers]], and is a Professor at Law at [[City University London|City University]]. Mansfield is a regular after dinner and keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/event=11475/ |title=Oxford University - An audience with Michael Mansfield QC |date= |accessdate=2012-04-23 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable cases===

As well as representing those wrongly convicted of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA's]] [[Guildford Four|Guildford]] and [[Birmingham Six|Birmingham]] pub bombings, Mansfield has represented: the [[Angry Brigade]]; the Price sisters; [[Brian Keenan (Irish republican)|Brian Keenan]]; the [[Battle of Orgreave|Orgreave miners]]; [[Mahmood Hussein Mattan]], [[Ruth Ellis]] and [[James Hanratty]] (in posthumous appeals); those involved in the [[1994 London Israeli Embassy attack|Israeli Embassy bombing]]; [[Stephen Lawrence]]'s family; [[Michael Barrymore]] at the [[Stuart Lubbock]] inquest; [[Barry George]] at the inquest into the death of [[Jill Dando]]; the gangster [[Kenneth Noye]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1591240.stm | work=BBC News | title=Road rage killer's appeal rejected | date=10 October 2001}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Noye+hires+Dando+QC%3B+HE+GETS+'THE+BEST'+IN+ROAD-RAGE+APPEAL.-a075596307|title=Noye hires Dando QC; HE GETS 'THE BEST' IN ROAD-RAGE APPEAL.|work=thefreelibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] families; [[Arthur Scargill]]; [[Angela Cannings]];&lt;ref name=tooks/&gt; [[Fatmir Limaj]], a [[Kosovo]]-[[Albania]]n leader prosecuted in [[the Hague]]; [[Mohamed al-Fayed]] in the inquest into the deaths of his son [[Dodi al-Fayed]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]; and the families of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]] and [[Death of Mark Duggan|Mark Duggan]].

===Lockerbie bombing===
Warning against over-reliance upon [[forensic science]] to secure convictions, Michael Mansfield in the [[BBC Scotland]] ''[[Frontline Scotland]]'' TV programme ''Silence over Lockerbie'', broadcast on 14 October 1997, said he wanted to make just one point:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Forensic science is not immutable. They're not written in tablets of stone, and the biggest mistake that anyone can make&amp;mdash;public, expert or anyone else alike&amp;mdash;is to believe that forensic science is somehow beyond reproach: it is not! The biggest miscarriages of justice in the United Kingdom, many of them emanate from cases in which forensic science has been shown to be wrong. And the moment a forensic scientist or anyone else says: 'I am sure this marries up with that' I get worried.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Mansfield has been married twice, to Melian Bordes for 19 years, with whom he had five children (Jonathan, Anna, Louise, Leo and Kieran), and for thirty years to the artist/filmmaker Yvette Vanson, from whom he separated in 2014 and with whom he had a son (Fred).&lt;ref name="Pelling"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pelling|first=Rowan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11792269/Michael-Mansfield-QCs-most-difficult-case-his-daughters-suicide.html|title=Michael Mansfield QC’s most difficult case, his daughter’s suicide|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/86e6162b#b00vc504|title=BBC Radio 4 - ''Desert Island Discs'', Michael Mansfield|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, Anna, died by suicide in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35498851 "Mansfield on daughter's suicide: 'Why didn't you tell me it was that bad?"], ''BBC News'', 4 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity work==
Mansfield is a patron of the animal welfare organisation Viva! (Vegetarians International Voice for Animals) and refers to animal production as "genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viva.org.uk/celebs/michael.html |publisher=viva.org.uk |title=Viva! - Vegetarians International Voice for Animals - Star Supporters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418102917/http://viva.org.uk/celebs/michael.html |archivedate=18 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also patron of Hastings Advice and Representation Centre, a charity providing free welfare benefit advice and representation for local people in Hastings, East Sussex and the surrounding area.

===SOS Silence of Suicide===
Following his daughter's suicide Mansfield established SOS Silence of Suicide, a suicide awareness charity.&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web|title= About Us |url=https://www.sossilenceofsuicide.org/our-story/ |publisher=SOS Silence of Suicide |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers''' ('''MAAF''') is a community for [[atheism|atheists]], [[humanism|humanists]], and [[freethought|freethinkers]] in the military, both within the United States and from around the world. The MAAF can assist [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] members to respond to illegal and insensitive religious [[proselytizing]] on military bases. It is an independent [[501(c)(3)]] organization building community for humanists and other nontheists in the military. The MAAF supports [[Constitution of the United States|constitutional]] [[separation of church and state]] and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights for all service members. It also educates and trains both the military and civilian community about atheism and humanism in the military.

Flagship programs for MAAF are its local Network, with over 70 worldwide points of contact, lay leaders, and local groups from Kyrgyzstan to Japan and throughout the US and its Chaplain Outreach program to educate 5000 military chaplains on how to support atheists and humanists in the military. Supporting those major programs are care package delivery, lay leader and chaplain endorsement, and a robust advocacy program to identify and resolve issues, to make the military a safe place for nontheists.

==History==
[[File:MAAF President Jason Torpy at Reason Rally 2012.JPG|thumb|320px|Jason Torpy, President of the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers (MAAF) at the [[Reason Rally]] held in Washington, DC on March 24, 2012.]] The MAAF was founded with a simple email discussion group in February 1998 by Kathleen Johnson when she was an active duty [[Sergeant First Class]] with the Army's [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigative Division]] (CID). It soon expanded from an online presence and affiliated with other organizations including [[American Atheists]] and the [[Campus Freethought Alliance]] (now CFI On Campus). Early membership, totalling just over 100, included several cadets and midshipmen in ROTC programs and military service academies.&lt;ref name=Military.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Rick (June 15, 2000)|title=History of Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers|url=http://www.military.com/HomePage/UnitPageHistory/0,13506,701019%7C700824,00.html|work=Military.com|accessdate=18 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201172646/http://www.military.com/HomePage/UnitPageHistory/0,13506,701019%7C700824,00.html|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Torpy, current president, took over in 2001 while still an active duty officer, established 501c3 status in 2006, and began working full-time for the organization at the end of 2010.

The group's early efforts included letter writing campaigns reminding public figures such as [[Tom Brokaw]] not to use the phrase, "[[There are no atheists in foxholes]]." One recipient of these letters, broadcaster [[Bob Schieffer]], issued a public apology in response. Other efforts supported active duty military personnel seeking to include, "Atheist" or, "Agnostic" on their dog-tags instead of the more common, "No Rel Pref" which meant the individual had no religious preference.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheist Soldiers Demand to be Recognized|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2006/08/13/beliefwatch-foxholes.html|work=Newsweek|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAAF also encourages Humanists to request that "Humanism" be added to the list of religious preferences. This does not identify humanism as a religion but as a preference about religion, alongside the already-list "none", "atheist", "agnostic", and "No preference". Army chaplains have blocked initial efforts.&lt;ref name="Chaplains block humanists"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Chaplains Deny Soldier Right to Identify as Humanist|url=http://militaryatheists.org/news/2012/01/army-chaplains-deny-soldier-right-to-identify-as-humanist/|work=MAAF|publisher=militaryatheists.org|accessdate=9 Mar 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206021854/http://militaryatheists.org/news/2012/01/army-chaplains-deny-soldier-right-to-identify-as-humanist/|archivedate=2012-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Torpy, who joined MAAF while a cadet at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and who is now a former Army Captain, now leads a board of five current and retired military officers. As of 2007 he was overseeing an organization of more vocal atheist members, "in 15 countries, 45 states, and over 100 military installations and ships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jayne-lyn-stahl/atheists-in-foxholes_b_49537.html |title=Atheists in Foxholes |author=Stahl, Jayne Lyn |date=May 26, 2007 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher= |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102085346/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jayne-lyn-stahl/atheists-in-foxholes_b_49537.html |archivedate=November 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent efforts of the MAAF include public condemnation of the continued refusal by the Boy Scouts of America to accept non-believers.&lt;ref name="BSA Amicus Brief"&gt;{{cite web|title=BSA Amicus Brief|url=http://beta.bsalegal.org/downloads/bsa_pdfs/BWPDFS/Amicus_ACLU.pdf|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=23 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302205111/http://beta.bsalegal.org/downloads/bsa_pdfs/BWPDFS/Amicus_ACLU.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the BSA claims to be a private organization with a legal right to discriminate, the MAAF calls for an end to federal support in the form of funding and free access to military bases.&lt;ref name="Military Atheist Blog - BSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Torpy|first=Jason|title=Time to End Federal Support of Boy Scout Discrimination|url=http://militaryatheists.org/news/2012/07/time-to-end-federal-support-of-boy-scout-discrimination/|publisher=MAAF|accessdate=23 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115026/http://militaryatheists.org/news/2012/07/time-to-end-federal-support-of-boy-scout-discrimination/|archivedate=27 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAAF logo includes the three colors Air Force Blue, Army Green, and Navy Blue.

In 2011 the MAAF including its local MASH Ft Bragg affiliate took on the Army's [[Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] program for its take on spiritual fitness as a major factor in soldier readiness. Both Jason Torpy and Justin Griffith, now military director with American Atheists, argued that the Army's approach, and especially the Army's Spiritual Fitness website were unfairly and illegally sectarian, supporting [[Christianity]] over all other religious beliefs. When the overall fitness of Justin Griffith was questioned because of his score on the Spiritual Fitness portion, he took his complaint to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) and threatened legal action against this unconstitutional religious test.&lt;ref name="Stars &amp; Stripes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Chris|title=Atheist Offers Army a Redone Website, Minus a Controversial Program|url=http://www.stripes.com/blogs/stripes-central/stripes-central-1.8040/atheist-offers-army-a-redone-website-minus-a-controversial-program-1.155871|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Stars &amp; Stripes|date=22 Sep 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304174046/http://www.stripes.com/blogs/stripes-central/stripes-central-1.8040/atheist-offers-army-a-redone-website-minus-a-controversial-program-1.155871|archivedate=4 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodda|first=Chris|title=Mandatory U.S. Army Survey Says Non-Believers Unfit to Serve|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda/mandatory-us-army-survey-_b_801597.html|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=1 Jan 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118123603/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda/mandatory-us-army-survey-_b_801597.html|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no major changes were made as a result of the complaints, the Army did remove a section from the Spiritual Fitness website which equated the military flag folding tradition with Christian religious tenets.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley Hagerty|first=Barbara|title=Army's Spiritual Fitness Test Angers Some|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/13/132904866/armys-spiritual-fitness-test-angers-some-soldiers|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=13 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417203014/http://www.npr.org/2011/01/13/132904866/armys-spiritual-fitness-test-angers-some-soldiers|archivedate=17 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MAAF maintains a running review of violations and plans to turn its attention to new Spiritual Triage and Moral Injury applications of 'spirituality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual Fitness at MAAF|url=http://militaryatheists.org/advocacy/spirituality/|work=MAAF website|accessdate=9 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305020346/http://militaryatheists.org/advocacy/spirituality/|archivedate=5 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirmed to be several thousand, the current membership of MAAF is not publicly specified but the group's list of "Atheists in Foxholes"&lt;ref name="Atheists in Foxholes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheists in Foxholes|url=http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/|accessdate=23 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521112729/http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/|archivedate=21 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has topped 200 who wish to be publicly identified. More certain are the numbers of nonbelievers in the United States military in comparison to the number of chaplains of similar belief. In July, 2012 the MAAF published demographics from the [[United States Department of Defense]] that confirmed that atheists and agnostics in military ranks far outnumber several other groups, such as Hindus, Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists yet have no representation in the chaplain corps. This same study also showed that Evangelical Christians make up an inordinately large proportion of the chaplain corps when compared to the relatively small percentage of military members who hold such beliefs.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dao|first=James|title=Atheist Seek Chaplain Role in the Military|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/27atheists.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=24 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719194702/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/27atheists.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|archivedate=19 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Major reportedly forced attendees to stand at attention while he yelled at, berated and humiliated them. The Major accused them of plotting against Christians and threatened them with punishment before shutting down the meeting. Specialist Hall contacted the MAAF for assistance and was referred to the [[Military Religious Freedom Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-krassner/aholes-of-the-week-6_b_60669.html |title=A**holes of the Week #6 |author=[[Paul Krassner|Krassner, Paul]] |date=August 16, 2007 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher= |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102091921/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-krassner/aholes-of-the-week-6_b_60669.html |archivedate=November 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Specialist Hall voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit and there is no indication that any action was taken against Major Welborn.&lt;ref name="Notice of Voluntary Dismissal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of Voluntary Dismissal|url=http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/legalfiles/dismissal_sep08.pdf|work=Legal Document|publisher=Military Religious Freedom Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062626/http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/legalfiles/dismissal_sep08.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 an affiliated group, the Fort Bragg Military Association of Secular Humanists (MASH)  sought reciprocity after an Evangelical Christian ministry received military command funding to hold a concert at [[Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]]. Active duty Army Sergeant Justin Griffith sought to hold a similar event called Rock Beyond Belief but was initially refused the same level of support. The same group sought the appointment of atheist lay leaders to provide support for the atheist population at the very large Army base. At the same time, Jason Torpy and the MAAF continued efforts to implement humanist chaplains to support the many atheist, agnostics, and humanists on active duty. Senior chaplain officials responded with the argument that atheists were not a religious group and thus did not qualify for such duty. MAAF responded that humanist chaplains would do everything religious chaplains do, including counsel troops and help them follow their faiths. "Humanism fills the same role for atheists that Christianity does for Christians and Judaism does for Jews," Torpy said in an interview. "It answers questions of ultimate concern; it directs our values."&lt;ref name="New York Times 2011"/&gt;

In October, 2012 the United States Army invited Torpy to speak at its twelfth annual Diversity Leadership conference at West Point. At this meeting he made his pitch for the addition of atheist or humanist chaplains. Included in the argument was the fact that the current chaplain corps is overly representative of the evangelical Christian faith along with a claim that atheist and others were being ignored.&lt;ref name="Mother Jones"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinstein|first=Adam|title=America's Atheist Warriors|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/military-atheists-humanists-army-tillman|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=20 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913025011/https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/military-atheists-humanists-army-tillman|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The MAAF created some controversy in 2012 when Jason Torpy sought to remove a group of memorial crosses from a hilltop at Camp Pendleton, California. A set of three, 13 foot (4 meter), wooden crosses erected by a small group of Marines in 2003 had stood without controversy until a news story caught the attention of the MAAF. After threatening a lawsuit claiming violations of church-state separation, the Marine Corps Commandant was forced to decide whether it would stay or go. "This wasn't intended to be a religious memorial, it was just intended to be able to provide a fitting and a dignified memorial to their fallen comrades and frankly controversy was the very last thing on their minds." said retired Marine Colonel Nick Marano. "Marines and others who continue to come here to reflect will be sorry to see them go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Housley|first=Adam|title=Marines fight to protect crosses at Camp Pendleton|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/12/marines-fight-to-protect-crosses-at-camp-pendleton-as-atheist-groups-seek/|work=FoxNews.com|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=22 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220192658/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/12/marines-fight-to-protect-crosses-at-camp-pendleton-as-atheist-groups-seek/|archivedate=20 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAAF addressed a long list of common concerns to distinguish its position from some of the attacks levied by opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Torpy|first=Jason|title=Camp Pendleton Cross Privileges Christianity|url=http://militaryatheists.org/news/2011/11/camp-pendleton-cross-privileges-christianity-marginalizes-non-christians/|work=militaryatheists.org|publisher=MAAF|accessdate=9 Mar 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521110013/http://militaryatheists.org/news/2011/11/camp-pendleton-cross-privileges-christianity-marginalizes-non-christians/|archivedate=2013-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military aid to the civil power''' ('''MACP''') (sometimes '''to the civil authorities''') is a term used to describe the use of the armed forces in support of the civil authorities of a state. The term is used in many countries, with slightly different definitions and implications in each.

== Australia ==
Under certain circumstances, the [[Australian Defence Force]] can be called upon assist with law enforcement. State or Territory civilian police have primary responsibility for law and order. Under section 119 of the [[Constitution of Australia]], "The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence." This is further explained in section 51 of the Defence Act which states that:
{{Quote|text=Where the Governor of a State has proclaimed that domestic violence exists therein, the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], upon the application of the Executive Government of the State, may, by proclamation, declare that domestic violence exists in that State, and may call out the Permanent Forces and in the event of their numbers being insufficient may also call out such of the Emergency Forces and the Reserve Forces as may be necessary for the protection of that State, and the services of the Forces so called out may be utilised accordingly for the protection of that State against domestic violence.}}

Military forces have been deployed twice on the request of State or Territory governments, and deployment authorised on one other occasion but not required:
* September 1970: The Governor-General signed an Order-in-Council authorising the deployment of the Army to [[East New Britain Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], then a territory of Australia, to assist local police with [[riot control]] if necessary. The Army was not required and the Order was revoked in April 1971.
* February 1978: Following the [[Sydney Hilton bombing]], 2,000 armed soldiers were deployed to [[Bowral]] and [[Mittagong]] to protect the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting]] and to protect the road and rail links between [[Sydney]] and the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]].
* March 2002: 2,400 military personnel were deployed to protect the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] at [[Coolum Beach, Queensland]], including armed [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornets]] patrolling overhead, just months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]].

Australian Military Regulations also allow the Federal government to use military forces "on its own initiative, for the protection of its servants or property, or the safeguarding of its interests". This has been done three times:
* April 1983: [[General Dynamics F-111C#RF-111C|RF-111C]] reconnaissance aircraft were used to investigate construction work by the [[Government of Tasmania]] which was preparing to dam the [[Gordon River]] in contravention of federal law. The evidence from the reconnaissance flights was used to gain an injunction from the [[High Court of Australia]] against the work.
* September 1989: Soldiers were deployed to [[Joint Defense Facility Nurrungar]] during a large political demonstration in which 300 protesters broke through the perimeter fence.
* August 2001: The [[Special Air Service Regiment]] was used during the [[Tampa affair]].

In addition, unarmed troops and defence force equipment have been used in industrial disputes, such as the [[1949 Australian coal strike]] and the [[1989 Australian pilots' dispute]], under the "safeguarding of its interests" provisions.

== Canada ==
[[Canada]] has provisions, similar to the UK's [[Military Aid to the Civil Authorities]], for military aid to the civil power inscribed in its [[National Defence Act]], an historical inheritance from its days as a British dominion. However, the application is significantly different due to the [[Federation|federal nature of Canada]], where the maintenance of "law and order" is the exclusive right and responsibility of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]].

The political authority empowered to requisition military aid is therefore the Solicitor General of the affected province, which was provided for under the [[War Measures Act]] and currently the [[Emergencies Act]]. This request is forwarded directly to the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] (not to the federal government of Canada) who is obligated by law to execute the request. However, the Chief of the Defence Staff alone can determine the nature and level of forces to be committed.

The requesting province may subsequently be billed to pay the cost of the military aid, although the federal government most often waives it. One exception in recent years resulted from [[Toronto]] mayor [[Mel Lastman]]'s request for military assistance following a snow storm in 1999, where at least 438 troops were deployed &lt;ref&gt;http://www.citynews.ca/2009/01/12/citynews-rewind-the-day-mel-lastman-called-in-the-army-to-clear-snow/&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[Ontario]] government acceded; this deployment was deemed by the Canadian government to be a trivialization of the military's emergency response role and the requesting authority was billed accordingly.

While the military is legally free to decide how to deal with an issue in regard to which it has been called out, in practice it works under the direction of the police forces or government of the province that has requested its aid. Such requests are made relatively often for specialized resources such as armoured vehicles (e.g. hostage situations) and technical capabilities not possessed by police forces. 

They are also called out in the case of police strikes in those provinces that have unionised provincial police forces. [[Quebec]] has not hesitated to call on the Army for such help {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} because the Army is the only other agency with French speaking members able to replace striking police; the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] has few reserves able to provide a "surge" capability, and its French-speaking capability is more limited.

Significant use of the [[Canadian Forces]] in aid of the Quebec civil power includes two relatively recent major civil crises:
* the [[October crisis]] of 1970
* the [[Oka crisis]] of 1990

As well, the Canadian military have been called in to deal with labour crises, such as cavalry troops shipped to Edmonton to deal with an expected unemployed riot in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Caragata, Alberta Labour, p. 104) &lt;/ref&gt; and armoured cars to use strikers at Stratford in 1934. As well, troops were used to put down domestic rebellions in 1837 ([[1837 rebellions]]), 1869 and 1885 (the first and second Riel rebellions).

The federal government can and does use the military in aid of its own responsibilities, such as guarding federal buildings and facilities. Since 1993, the Canadian Forces have also provided the country's federal counter-terrorist forces, replacing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in that function.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} (See [[JTF2]] for details of request and control of this capability).

== Germany ==
The post-war constitution of Germany strictly forbids the use of military force in police functions. The functions that MACP has in other countries are carried out by special police forces, which are basically under the control of the state governments, not of the federal government. 

For some actions, federal police forces can be used either by orders of the federal administration and federal judiciary or by request of the state government. The counter-terrorist unit [[GSG 9]] is part of the [[Federal Police (Germany)|Bundespolizei]] (until 2005 known as the ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') and is well known in Germany for its antiterrorist missions. However, several state police corps have similar units. The ''Bundesgrenzschutz'' and the GSG 9 were historically combatants and they had military ranks, but have always been under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. 

This strict separation between civil and military power was enacted to prevent the army from becoming a political power again in internal affairs and to secure its subordination to the civil power. Since the 1990s, a number of conservative politicians has called for an abolition of this rule, but there seems to be no majority for such a change. 

But a new law was passed in September 2004, the Air Security Act ({{lang|de|Luftsicherheitsgesetz}}). From September 24, 2004 until February 2005 there was an exception from the use of military force regarding air security: In a case of imminent danger, the [[Bundeswehr]] and its air force branch, the [[German Air Force]] were authorised to use force against an aircraft. 

As ultima ratio, the Minister of Defense was empowered to give the order to shoot down an aircraft if the aircraft was used as a weapon against humans and there was no other way to repel the attack.  Air policing is a traditional task of the [[German Air Force]]. However, the Luftsicherheitsgesetz was declared unconstitutional on February 15, 2006, by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}). The court held that no civil aircraft may be shot down, even if the aircraft is used as a weapon by terrorist. The court held that the passengers' dignity and right to life would be violated if the aircraft was shot down. 

In 2012, the {{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}} judged that the military may intervene in "exceptional, imminent incidents of catastrophic scale" as a last resort. In the case of a hijacked plane by terrorists, the [[German Air Force]] may force the plane back or fire warning shots – a downing of the plane remains forbidden, unless every passenger of the plane is a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Manuel Bewarder, Thorsten Jungholt|title=Paukenschlag in Karlsruhe|url=https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/politik/article108673557/Paukenschlag-in-Karlsruhe.html|accessdate=13 November 2018|work=Welt Online|publisher=Die Welt|date=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Entscheidung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts: Karlsruhe erlaubt Bundeswehreinsatz im Inland|url=http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bundeswehreinsatz114.html|accessdate=13 November 2018|work=Tagesschau.de|publisher=Tagesschau.de|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a case of "exceptional, imminent incidents of catastrophic scale" has to be determined, as ruled by the {{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}} in 2013, by the whole [[Cabinet of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Bundesregierung}}), declaring a regulation void that previously allowed the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Federal Minister of Defence]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverteidigungsminister}}) to decide solely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terrorabwehr: Nur Bundesregierung darf Bundeswehr im Innern einsetzen|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/terrorabwehr-nur-bundesregierung-darf-bundeswehr-im-innern-einsetzen-1.1652878|accessdate=13 November 2018|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] provide assistance through Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) arrangements to the [[Government of Ireland]]. The [[Irish Army|Army]], [[Naval Service (Ireland)|Naval Service]] and [[Air Corps (Ireland)|Air Corps]] also provide [[Military Aid to the Civil Community|Aid to Civil Community]] and Aid to Government departments, particularly in a supplementary role to the [[Garda Síochána]], the national police force. Responsibilities include [[national security]] (Supplementing high risk prisoner escort, intelligence), cash escorts, explosive ordnance disposal, maritime safety, [[search and rescue]], drug interdiction (Navy), fisheries protection (Navy), patrols of vital state installations and border patrols (including armed [[Border checkpoint|checkpoints]]), [[Air medical services|air ambulance service]] and [[Non-combatant evacuation operation|non-combatant evacuation]]. Examples include; [[Garda Air Support Unit]] (GASU) aircraft being flown and maintained by Air Corps personnel, the Air Corps and Naval Service assisting in search and rescue (the [[Irish Coast Guard]] (IRCG) is a civilian agency which operates in the Republic of Ireland and some parts of [[Northern Ireland]]), the [[Army Ranger Wing]] (ARW) carrying out domestic [[counter-terrorism]] operations and the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (Ireland)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]] carrying out domestic [[Counterintelligence|counter-intelligence]] duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Irish Defence Forces|url=http://www.military.ie/info-centre/defence-forces-history/|work=2014|publisher=Defence Forces Ireland|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==

In 2008 the Italian Government decided to use soldiers from the Army, Navy and Air Force to patrol cities and protect risky buildings (embassies, consulates, monuments). When military personnel patrol cities they are always accompanied by an agent from the [[Polizia di Stato]] (State Police), a military from the [[Carabinieri]] or a military from [[Guardia di Finanza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7540585.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carabinieri]] are the 4th Armed force in Italy while [[Guardia di Finanza]] are a military body.

== United Kingdom ==
{{see|Military Aid to the Civil Authorities}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], Military Aid to the Civil Power is one of the three classifications of Military Aid to the Civil Authorities. MACP encompasses the provision of military assistance (armed if necessary) in its maintenance of law, order and public safety using specialist capabilities or equipment in situations beyond the capability of the Civil Power. This includes capabilities such as [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] and [[mountain rescue]] (where it is provided by the [[Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service]])

Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] is the Standing Joint Commander responsible for the planning and execution of civil contingency operations within the UK landmass and territorial waters during any military aid to UK civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2015-to-2020-government-policy-military-aid-to-the-civil-authorities-for-activities-in-the-uk/2015-to-2020-government-policy-military-aid-to-the-civil-authorities-for-activities-in-the-uk|title=2015 to 2020 government policy: Military Aid to the Civil Authorities for activities in the UK|publisher=UK Ministry of Defence|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Defense Support of Civil authorities}}
The [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, generally prohibits Federal military personnel (except the [[United States Coast Guard]]) and units of the [[United States National Guard]] under Federal authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within the [[United States]], except where expressly authorized by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] or [[United States Congress|Congress]].

The original act only referred to the [[United States Army|Army]], but the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] was added in 1956 and the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] have been included by a regulation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. This law is mentioned whenever it appears that the Department of Defense is interfering in domestic disturbances.

However, the National Guard may still be used for police-like duties if still under control of the state, as with the [[1967 Detroit riot]].

Repeated caveats have been added to the Posse Comitatus Act over the years by subsequent legislation.

The '''Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare''' (formerly '''Ministry of Agriculture'''), a branch of the [[Government of India]], is the apex body for formulation and administration of the rules and regulations and laws related to agriculture in [[India]]. The three broad areas of scope for the Ministry are agriculture, [[food processing]] and co-operation. The agriculture ministry is headed by [[Minister of Agriculture (India)|Minister of Agriculture]] [[Radha Mohan Singh]]. [[Gajendra Singh Shekhawat]], [[Krishna Raj]] and [[Parsottambhai Rupala]] are the Ministers of State.

==Background==
Agriculture is the principal source of livelihood for more than half  population of India. Agriculture provides the bulk of wage goods required by non-agriculture sectors and most of the raw materials for the industries sector. [[India]] is a largely agrarian economy - with 52.1% of the population estimated to directly or indirectly employed in agriculture and allied sectors in 2009-10.{{sfn|Economic Survey|2010|p=180}} The combined efforts of Central Government, State Governments and the farming community have succeeded in achieving record production of 244.78 million tonnes of foodgrains during 2010-11. This record production has been achieved through effective transfer of newly developed crop production technologies to farmers under various crop development schemes, such as the [[Agriculture MMP]], which is run under the direction of the Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation. Other causes behind record production include remunerative prices for various crops through enhanced minimum support prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agricoop.nic.in/aboutus.html "About DAC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420032527/http://agricoop.nic.in/aboutus.html |date=20 April 2015 }}, "Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India", Retrieved 2015-4-24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agriculture in India]] is of significance because of this as well as a history of food shortages and a growing population.

==Origins==
Department of Revenue and Agriculture and Commerce was set up in June 1871 to deal with all the agricultural matters in India. Until this ministry was established, matters related to agriculture were within the portfolio of the Home Department.&lt;ref name="Organisational History"/&gt;

In 1881, Department of Revenue &amp; Agriculture was set up to deal with combined portfolios of education, health, agriculture, revenue. However, In 1947, Department of Agriculture was redesignated as Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="Organisational History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agricoop.nic.in/Orghistory.pdf |title=Organisational History of the Department of Agriculture &amp; Cooperation |accessdate=5 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425064805/http://agricoop.nic.in/Orghistory.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Departments==
The Ministry of Agriculture and farmers Welfare consists of the following three Departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605093532/http://india.gov.in/sectors/agriculture/ministry_agriculture.php|title=Ministry of Agriculture - Agriculture - Sectors: National Portal of India|date=5 June 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare. This Department's responsibilities are assigned to it in the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 as amended time to time. Co-operation in this context refers largely to promote farmer co-operative movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903184137/http://www.india.gov.in/outerwin.php?id=http://agricoop.nic.in|title=National Portal of India|date=3 September 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agriculture MMP]] is another program run by this depart that aims to replicate the agricultural e-governance projects being carried in different states at a national level and through a variety of media.
* Department of Agriculture Research and Education. This Department's responsibilities are basic and operation research, technology development, improving linkages between various organisations and state governments across the country. In addition, this Department manages the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903185227/http://www.india.gov.in/outerwin.php?id=http://dare.nic.in/|title=National Portal of India|date=3 September 2011|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries. This Department's primary responsibilities are to increase the productivity of livestock and aquaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004045204/http://dahd.nic.in/index2.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=4 October 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative head of the Ministry are the Secretaries of the three departments.

==Programs==
A leading program of the Ministry is the [[National Agriculture Development Programme|Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana]], which was launched in 2007 on the recommendations of the [[National Development Council (India)|National Development Council]] of India.  This program sought to improve the overall state of agriculture in India by providing stronger planning, better co-ordination and greater funding to improve productivity and overall output. The total budget for this program in 2009-10 was just over INR 38,000 crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkvy.nic.in/#|title=:::Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana:::|work=rkvy.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports and statistics==
The Ministry publishes an annual report titled "Agricultural Statistics At a Glance".  This gives a detailed picture of the state of the India's agriculture including demographics of the agrarian sector, crop production (including state-wise and crop-wise break-ups), rural economic indicators such as credit, etc. The latest report has been published for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eands.dacnet.nic.in/latest_2006.htm|title=Economics And Statistics,Ministry Of Agriculture,Government Of India|website=Eands.dacnet.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture, Information and Tourism of the Kyrgyz Republic''' is the ministry in charge of preservation and promotion of Kyrgyzstani culture in the republic and abroad. The ministry has its roots from the Soviet Union's [[Ministry of Culture (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Culture]], although the current ministry did not succeed directly from the Soviet ministry. Moreover there were no ministries or state committees for tourism in the Soviet Union, because tourists to and from non-communist countries were highly restricted and few in numbers. 

The ministry oversees various arts, cultural and historic sites in the republic, they include but are not limited to  cinemas, circus, libraries, monuments, museums, musical institutions, parks, the National Cultural Center, the Philharmonic Hall and theaters. The ministry also oversees and regulates the republic's artists, as well as the education and promotion of Kyrgyz culture.

==Structure==
The ministry is subdivided into three departments:
===Department of Cinematography===
This department is in charge of the regulation of the film industry in the Kyrgyz Republic as well as the promotion of the republic through films, some of which were showcased internationally. The department has also partnered the [[Prince Claus Fund]] for Culture and Development in establishing the Cinema Development Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kyrgyzcinema.com/| title=Cinema Development Fund| year=2018| accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to enable local filmmakers to have better resources to produce films.

===Department of Information and Mass Communications===
This department is in charge of the regulation of information made via mass media in the republic. An example of the department's scope of work include promoting and initiating the moving of local newspapers into electronic format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kabar.kg/eng/news/ministry-of-culture-will-transfer-its-regional-newspapers-into-electronic-format/| title=Ministry of Culture will transfer regional newspapers into electronic format| date=2018-02-27| accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Tourism===
This department is responsible for organising various cultural and tourism events across the country. These include the [[World Nomad Games]] which was held thrice in the republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/world/2018/09/04/world-nomad-games-begin-kyrgyzstan/1193716002/| title=World Nomad Games begin in Kyrgyzstan| date=2018-09-04| accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Apricot Festival and Karagat Festival. The department also actively promotes the republic's [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Kyrgyzstan|world heritage sites]] in addition to establishing a [[Visa policy of Kyrgyzstan|VISA free regime]] for travellers from over 60 countries, so as to further boost the tourism sector and attract investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://deptourism.gov.kg/%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BC/?lang=tr| title=БЕЗВИЗОВЫЙ РЕЖИМ| year=2012| accessdate=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department has also joined various organisations like the [[World Tourism Organization]] so as learn about sustainability of tourists sites in the republic.

A '''model minority''' is a [[Demography|demographic group]] (whether based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or [[religion]]) whose members are perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. This success is typically measured relatively by [[income]], [[education]], low [[criminality]] and high [[Sociology of the family|family/marital stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cmhc.utexas.edu/modelminority.html#what|title=Model Minority Stereotype|website=cmhc.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is controversial, as it has historically been used to suggest there is no need for government action to adjust for socioeconomic disparities between certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pettersen|first= William|date= 9 January 1966|title= Success Story, Japanese-American Style|url= http://inside.sfuhs.org/dept/history/US_History_reader/Chapter14/modelminority.pdf|newspaper= New York Times |access-date= 9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has most often been applied to contrast [[Asian Americans|Asian-Americans]] (both [[South Asian Americans|South]] &amp; [[East Asians]]) against [[African Americans|African-Americans]] &amp; [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-Americans]] in America. Enforcing the idea that Asian Americans are good law-abiding, productive immigrants/ citizens. While promoting the stereotype that Hispanics and African-Americans are criminally prone, welfare recipient immigrant/ citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poon|first=OiYan|last2=Squire|first2=Dian|last3=Kodama|first3=Corinne|last4=Byrd|first4=Ajani|last5=Chan|first5=Jason|last6=Manzano|first6=Lester|last7=Furr|first7=Sara|last8=Bishundat|first8=Devita|date=2016-06|title=A Critical Review of the Model Minority Myth in Selected Literature on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Higher Education|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0034654315612205|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=86|issue=2|pages=469–502|doi=10.3102/0034654315612205|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generalized statistics are often cited to back up model minority status such as high educational achievement and a high representation in [[White-collar worker|white collar]] professions. A common misconception is that the affected communities usually hold pride in their labeling as the model minority. The model minority stereotype is considered detrimental to relevant minority communities because it is used to justify the exclusion of minorities in the distribution of assistance programs, both public and private, as well as to understate or slight the achievements of individuals within that minority. Furthermore, the idea of the model minority pits minority groups against each other by implying that non-model groups are at fault for falling short of the model minority level of achievement and assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonsun|last2=Lahey|first2=Benjamin B.|date=2006-09-01|title=Testing the Model Minority Stereotype: Youth Behaviors across Racial and Ethnic Groups|journal=The Social service review|volume=80|issue=3|pages=419–452|doi=10.1086/505288|issn=0037-7961|pmc=3093248|pmid=21572913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also been criticized by outlets such as NPR for potentially homogenizing the experiences of Asian Americans on one side and Hispanics &amp; African Americans on the other, despite the different groups experiencing racism in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Model Minority stereotype, and the perpetuation of the belief that any minority has the capability to rise economically without assistance, also completely ignores the very different history of Asian Americans and African-Americans, and sometimes Hispanics, in the U.S.. Beginning with the legalized and widespread slavery of Africans that were kidnapped from Africa, then continuing with Black Codes, Jim Crow, and the new Jim Crow (the [[Prison–industrial complex|Prison-industrial complex]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inheritancemag.com/article/the-model-minority-myth-and-the-wedge-between-black-and-white-america|title=The Model Minority Myth and the Wedge Between Black and White America [Updated] {{!}} Inheritance|work=Inheritance|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of "model minority" is heavily associated with U.S. culture and is not extensively used outside the U.S., though many European countries have concepts of classism that stereotype ethnic groups in a similar manner to model minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/sikhs-hindus-now-part-of-middle-class-britain-354653.html|title=Sikhs, Hindus now part of middle-class Britain|work=News18|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
One of the earliest uses of the term "model minority" was in the 9 January 1966 edition of ''The New York Times Magazine'' by sociologist William Petersen to describe Asian Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite [[marginalization]], have achieved success in the United States. In his essay called "Success Story: Japanese American Style", he wrote that the Japanese cultures have strong work ethics and family values. Furthermore, he wrote that those values prevent them from becoming a "problem minority". A similar article about Chinese Americans was published in ''U.S. News and World Report'' in December 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212130042/http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html|date=December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vernellia R. Randall |url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/01race/model01.htm |title=Are Asians Model Minorities? |publisher=Academic.udayton.edu |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="nyt-2018-correction"&gt;{{cite news|date=2018-08-20|title=Correction appended to "How 'Crazy Rich' Asians Have Led to the Largest Income Gap in the U.S."|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, almost all major U.S. magazines and newspapers printed success stories of Asian Americans.&lt;ref name="asianamericanissues1"/&gt;{{rp|222}}

However, in the 1970s and 1980s, many scholars challenged the model minority stereotype. B. Suzuki published "Education and the Socialization of Asian Americans: A Revisionist Analysis of the 'Model Minority Thesis". In the paper, he disagrees with how the media is portraying Asian Americans. He explains the sociohistorical background and the contemporary social system, and argues that the Model Minority stereotype is a myth.&lt;ref name="asianstudies2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Model Minority Myth Revisited: an Interdisciplinary Approach to Demystifying Asian American Educational Experiences|last=Li|first=Guofang|author2=Lihshing Wang|date=July 10, 2008|publisher=Information Age Publishing|isbn=978-1-59311-951-5|location=|pages=|doi=|id=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

Some have described the creation of the model minority theory as partially a response to the emergence of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], when [[African Americans]] fought for equal rights and the discontinuation of [[racial segregation in the United States]]. In a backlash to the movement, white America presented and used Asian Americans to argue that African Americans could raise up their communities by focusing on education and accepting and conforming to racial segregation and the [[institutional racism]] and discrimination of the time period, as Asian Americans have arguably done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 of 5|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Model Minority Myth|url=http://www.yourpublicmedia.org/content/wnpr/asians-and-model-minority-myth|accessdate=25 May 2013|date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ModelMinority2&gt;{{citation|title=Model Minority Myth Revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ErqcJjHoMyMC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=asian+height+stereotype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDxT13KzUz&amp;sig=pit5aHg3TKO_J7HECpbxySYhGx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6hPaUZD-POfkiALglYDoBQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=asian%20height%20stereotype&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 July 2013|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disregarding the fact that Asian Americans at the time were also marginalized and racially segregated in America thus they also represented lower economic levels and faced many social issues just as other racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=ModelMinority2/&gt; The possible reasons as to why Asian Americans were used by White America as this image of a model minority are that they were viewed as having not been as much of a "threat" to White America due to less of a history of political activism in fighting racism (until after the Black Civil Rights movement, see [[asian American movement]]), their smaller population, the success of their numerous businesses (nearly all of which were small businesses) in their segregated communities, and the fact that during the time period [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]] and [[Filipino American]]s' educational attainment level was meeting the national average equaling Whites in terms of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Educational Attainment of Asian-Americans: A Search for Historical Evidence and Explanations|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/charles/new%20PUBS/A52.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of the model minority stereotype, Asian Americans have now exceeded White Americans in terms of education as well as many other racial and ethnic groups in American society and {{as of|2012|lc=y}} Asian Americans (as a whole) have obtained the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial and ethnic demographic in the country a position that [[African immigration to the United States|African Immigrants and Americans born of those immigrants]] have now started to outperform in.&lt;ref name="AfricanEducated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/01/SDT_Rise_of_Asian_Americans.pdf |title=The Rise of Asian Americans |author=Paul Taylor |author2=D'Vera Cohn |author3=Wendy Wang |author4=Jeffrey S.

Those who resisted the stereotype in the early stages back in the 1960s-1980's could not gain enough support to combat the stereotype, because of the stereotype's so-called "positive" connotations. This led many even within the Asian American community at the time to view it either as a welcomed positive stereotype in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. They did not foresee the negative repercussions to come from this stereotype. Many critics point out that there are more positives than negatives that come with this stereotype while many others believe that there are just as many negatives that come with this stereotype as there are positives and that no stereotype regardless of how positive they try to be or how positive their connotations are should be regarded as a good stereotype. Scientific studies have revealed that positive stereotypes have many negative and damaging consequences both socially and psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/news_events/news-releases/aaron-kay-positive-stereotypes/#.Uc4I4Ubn_IU|title=Fuqua Research Sheds Light on the Dangers of Positive Stereotypes|author=Aaron Kay|date=17 January 2013 |publisher=[[Duke University]]|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201302/the-pain-positive-stereotypes|title=The Pain of Positive Stereotypes|author=Art Markman, Ph.D. |date=February 15, 2013|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/dec/12/stereotypes-bad-even-when-good|title=Why stereotypes are bad even when they're 'good'|author=Oliver Burkemandate|date=12 December 2012|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=28 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2005/12/16/the-negative-impact-of-positiv/|title=The negative impact of positive stereotypes|author=Dave Munger|date=December 16, 2005 |publisher=Scienceblogs|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after the article on Asian Americans being the model minority was published, Asian Americans formed their own movement that fought for their own equal rights and resolution of their own specific social issues, modeling it after the Civil Rights Movement thus effectively challenging White America and the [[social construct]] of racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aam1968.blogspot.com/|title=Asian American Movement 1968|year=2008|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the term was coined to first describe the socioeconomic success of [[Japanese Americans]], although it has eventually evolved to become associated with [[American Jews]] and [[Asian Americans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/sho/summary/v023/23.4freedman.html|title=Project MUSE - Transgressions of a Model Minority|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|doi=10.1353/sho.2005.0147|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/02/08/do_colleges_redline_asian_americans/|title=Do colleges redline Asian-Americans?|last=Miller|first=Kara|date=8 February 2010|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more specifically with East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans)&lt;ref name="LiWang2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2jHy9gv3M0C|title=Model Minority Myth Revisited: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Demystifying Asian American Educational Experiences (Hc)|author1=Guofang Li|author2=Lihshing Wang|date=15 August 2008|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-59311-951-5|page=21|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indians.&lt;ref name="Kramer2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9-yOGSyKrYC&amp;pg=PA213|title=The Emerging Monoculture: Assimilation and the "Model Minority"|author=Eric Mark Kramer|date=28 February 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97312-4|pages=213–|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a model minority has faced backlash from the Asian American community. According to [[Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles]], "the misperception that Asian Americans are doing fine on their own has serious policy implications... politicians won't talk about our community's needs if they assume people don't require assistance." According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', since the 1960s, "the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community, which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like #ModelMinorityMutiny".&lt;ref name="YananWang"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/20/asian-americans-speak-out-against-a-decades-old-model-minority-myth/|title=Asian Americans speak out against a decades-old 'model minority' myth|last1=Wang|first1=Yanan|date=20 October 2015|accessdate=12 January 2016|agency=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model minority stereotype===
There has been a significant change in the perceptions of Asian Americans. In as little as 100 years of American history, [[stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|stereotypes of East Asian Americans]] have changed from them being viewed as poor uneducated laborers to being portrayed as a hard working and a well educated upper middle class minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97journal/Chu.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103051626/http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97journal/Chu.html|date=November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many White Americans erroneously assumed that their perseverance, strong work ethic, and general determination to succeed were extensions of their supposedly quiet natures, rather than common characteristics among most immigrants, Asian Americans came to be viewed as "model minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women of Color and Feminism|last=Rojas|first=Maythee|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=53|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among South Asian Americans, an example of the model minority stereotype are phenomena such as the high rates of educational attainment and above average household incomes in the Indian American community. Pointing to generalized data, another argument for the model minority stereotype is generalized data such as from the [[United States Census Bureau]], where the median household income of Asian Americans is $68,780, higher than the total population's $50,221.&lt;ref name="median income1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-reg=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201:012;ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201PR:012;ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201T:012;ACS_2009_1YR_G00_S0201TPR:012&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-format= |title=American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some Asian American subgroups including East Asians and South Asians are economically successful, other Asian American subgroups such as Southeast Asian Americans which include Hmong, Laotians, Cambodians, and Vietnamese, are less socioeconomically successful.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/20/asian-americans-speak-out-against-a-decades-old-model-minority-myth/ | title=Asian Americans speak out against a decades-old 'model minority' myth | work=Washington Post | date=20 October 2015 | accessdate=18 May 2016 | author=Wang, Yanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model minority model also points to the percentage of Asian Americans at elite universities (elite university being roughly defined as a school in the Top 40 according to U.S. News &amp; World Report.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diverseeducation.com/AsianAmericanBaccalaureate2007.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213154833/http://www.diverseeducation.com/AsianAmericanBaccalaureate2007.asp|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Model minority proponents claim that while Asian Americans are only 5% of the U.S. population, they are over-represented at all these schools. Additionally, Asian Americans go on to win a high proportion of Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name="theamericanconservative.com"&gt;Chougule Pratik, [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/will-american-science-stay-on-top/ "Will American Science Stay On Top?"], ''The American Conservative''&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 20 American physicists to win a Nobel Prize in the 21st century, East Asian Americans, who represent less than 4 percent of the U.S. population, have won 15 percent of prizes.&lt;ref name="theamericanconservative.com"/&gt; Additionally, three science Nobel prizes have been won by Indian-Americans.&lt;ref name="theamericanconservative.com"/&gt;

Asian American students are concentrated in a very small percentage of institutions, in only eight states (and half concentrated in California, New York and Texas).&lt;ref name="aapi"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: Facts, not Fiction: Setting the Record Straight|publisher=National Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education, College Board|url=http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/08-0608-AAPI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as more Asian Americans become Americanized and assimilated, more Asian American students are beginning to attend two-year [[community college]]s (363,798 in 2000) than four-year [[public university|public universities]] (354,564 in 2000), and this trend of attending community college is accelerating.&lt;ref name="aapi"/&gt; Unsurprisingly, West Coast academic institutions are amongst those that have the highest concentrations of Asian Americans.

The most highly educated group of Asian immigrants are Indian.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt; The low numbers for Southeast Asians can be a bit misleading, as a large percent comes from adult immigrants who came to the United States without any college education due to war. For ages 25 to 34, 45% of Vietnamese-Americans have a bachelor's degree or higher compared to 39% of Non-Hispanic Whites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dataferrett.census.gov/ |title=TheDataWeb - DataFerrett (U.S. Census Bureau) |publisher=Dataferrett.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the impacts of the Model minority stereotype, unlike other minority serving institutions, Asian American Pacific Islander serving institutions (AAPISI) did not receive federal recognition until 2007, with the passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which federally recognized the existence of AAPISIs, making them eligible for federal funding and designation as [[Minority Serving Institution|minority serving institution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Edith Wen-Chu|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Issues Today|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|volume=1|page=177|isbn=978-0-313-34751-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s 2003 report ''Crime in the United States'', Asian Americans have the lowest total arrest rates&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_03/pdf/03sec4.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417115544/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_03/pdf/03sec4.pdf|date=April 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a younger average age, and high family stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/03/bakesale.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305071416/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/wew/articles/03/bakesale.html|date=March 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Americans===
The model minority label also includes South Asian communities, in particular, [[Indian American]]s, because of their high socioeconomic success. But, Indian-Asians face a type of racism and discrimination, despite their Model Minority status, that other Asians do not face. One of the forms of this is discrimination based on religion, whether that be Hinduism or Islam - it influences their treatment. Often times, South Asians in America face racism that that is a result of mislabeling like being called Middle-Eastern or Muslim by the way they look, whether they actually identify with those groups.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-murder-of-srinivas-kuchibhotla-beyond-the-minority_us_58ba4a29e4b0fa65b844b373|title=Indian Americans Have Always Faced Racism, But 'Model Minorities' Don't Speak Out|last=Bobba|first=Anuhya|date=2017-03-04|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is discrimination based on skin color, which South and South-East Asians face because some tend to be darker skinned. So while South and South-East Asians reap ''some'' benefits of their Model Minority status, this does not mean they do not suffer harmful stereotypes as well and this further proves the harmful classification of all Asian-Americans into a "Model Minority". The mass grouping of all different Asian ethnicities into one "positive" stereotype deligimatizes the problems that certain Asian immigrants face, because the majority might not face those same negative stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/07/20/424640508/the-negative-in-positive-stereotypes|title=The Negative In Positive Stereotypes|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theaerogram.com/the-roots-of-south-asian-american-workplace-discrimination-are-found-in-our-schools/|title=The Roots Of South Asian American Workplace Discrimination Are Found In Our Schools - The Aerogram|date=2017-12-20|work=The Aerogram|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another result of the Model Minority status of Indian-Asians is their complacency, expressed more often than not. There is conflict within the Indian-Asian immigrant population in the US, as some exalt their "positive" minority status and wish to uphold it, resulting in complacency when attacked racially and even sometimes going as far as to support political candidates that are anti-immigration. The other side of the conflict is those who are effected by racial stereotypes and wish to change that fact instead of accepting it, who believe they should essentially give up their coveted status to stand with other ethnic and racial minority groups against their common white oppressor. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the census report on Asian Americans issued in 2004 by the U.S. Census Bureau, 64% of Indian Americans had a bachelor's degree or higher, the second highest for all national origin groups.  In the same census, 60% of Indian-Americans had management or professional jobs, compared with a national average of 33%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/24/bobby-jindal-indian-americans-opinions-contributors_immigrants_minority.html|title=Indian Americans: The New Model Minority|date=2009-02-24|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Americans, along with Japanese and Filipino Americans, have some of the lowest poverty rates for all communities, as well as one of the lowest rates of single parent households (7% versus the national average of 15%).  Indian Americans also earn the highest average income out of all national origin/ethnic groups. This has resulted in several stereotypes such as that of the "Indian Doctor".&lt;ref name="census.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-murder-of-srinivas-kuchibhotla-beyond-the-minority_us_58ba4a29e4b0fa65b844b373|title=We the People : Asians in the United States|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Census.gov|format=PDF|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should however be noted that there are still pockets of poverty within the community, with around 8% classified as living in poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Issues faced by Southeast Asian Americans ===
The experience of Southeast Asian American populations in the U.S. is cited as evidence that the model minority image is a myth.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Southeast Asian Americans consist of several ethnic groups, including Thai, Vietnamese, Hmong, Lao, and Cambodian. An empirical literature review&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ngo|first=Bic|last2=Lee|first2=Stacey|date=December 2007|title=Complicating the Image of Model Minority Success: A Review of Southeast Asian American Education|url=|journal=Review of Educational Research|volume=77|issue=4|pages=415–453|doi=10.3102/0034654307309918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows that most of the existing data used to justify the model minority image with Asian American academic achievement is aggregated and as a result, ignores important differences among individual Asian ethnic groups. Although many Asian Americans have succeeded academically and socioeconomically, survey research have shown that more recently immigrant groups, such as Southeast Asians, have been unable to replicate such success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Paul|last2=Lai|first2=Chienping|last3=Nagasawa|first3=Richard|last4=Lin|first4=Tieming|date=1998|title=Asian Americans as a Model Minority: Self-Perceptions and Perceptions by Other Racial Groups|url=|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=41|issue=1|pages=95–118|doi=10.2307/1389355}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Census in 2000, the overall U.S. population for people 25 years and over with less than a high school education was 19.6% and Asian Americans were close at 19.4%; however, disparities exist when comparing South and East Asian Americans with Southeast Asian Americans. Only 12.5% of Chinese Americans, 8.6% of Japanese Americans, and 14.6% of South Asian Americans that are 25 years or over have less than a high school education.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In contrast, Southeast Asian Americans more than double South and East Asian American percentages with 52% of Cambodian Americans, 59% of Hmong Americans, 49% of Lao Americans, and 38% of Vietnamese Americans ages 25 and over have less than a high school education.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Looking at higher education, the 2000 U.S. Census showed that 42.7% of Asian Americans ages 25 and over held a bachelor's degree or higher, which is higher than the national percentage of 25.9% of Americans overall.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In contrast, individual Southeast Asian American groups ages 25 and over that held a bachelor's degree or higher consist of 9.1% of Cambodian Americans, 7.4% of Hmong Americans, 7.6% of Lao Americans, and 19.5% of Vietnamese Americans.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With the exception of Vietnamese Americans, these proportions are lower than other racial minorities including African Americans (14.2%) and Latino Americans (10.3%).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As cited in an empirical literature review,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tran|first=Nellie|last2=Birman|first2=Dina|title=Questioning the model minority: Studies of Asian American academic performance.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0019965|journal=[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=106–118|doi=10.1037/a0019965|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; research that lacks differentiation between the varying Asian ethnic groups can mask under-performing groups by the higher performing groups. Generally speaking, Southeast Asian American students are overlooked due to the overwhelming success of their East and South Asian American peers.

As cited in a case study,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2002|title=Ethnic Differences in Academic Achievement between Vietnamese and Cambodian Children: Cultural and Structural Explanations|url=|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|volume=43|issue=2|pages=213–235|doi=10.1525/tsq.2002.43.2.213}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of the deficits of Southeast Asian American students' academic achievement can be attributed to many structural barriers of living in an immigrant household. Many Southeast Asian American students are children of refugees from countries at war.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These refugees were forced to escape from their homes to avoid death and persecution; along the way, many witnessed the loss of family members and friends.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Those who survived often arrive in the U.S. with fragmented families and were faced with more barriers as they had to rely on government assistance and were placed in low-income communities near poorly funded schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As these families try to establish themselves in a new country with little to no understanding of the U.S. school system, Southeast Asian students are at a disadvantage having to quickly adjust to a new school system, while trying to keep up with native-born students.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Inside and outside the school systems, Southeast Asians were faced with discrimination.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These are examples of structural barriers that Southeast Asian American students are faced with.

However, not all is grim for Southeast Asian American students. Certain Southeast Asian ethnic groups have shown greater progress compared to others and resemble the success of other more established Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As cited a case study,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Vietnamese American students are beginning to show similar rates of academic success comparable to East Asian American students. Among Southeast Asian American students, Vietnamese American students are recognized as having the highest academic performance, whereas Cambodian American students have the poorest performance.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Among Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees, despite enduring similar immigration hardships, differences in academic success can be attributed to structural and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Taiwanese Americans ===
Taiwanese Americans from all social backgrounds have achieved significant advances in their educational levels, income, life expectancy and other social indicators as the financial and socioeconomic opportunities offered by the United States have lifted many Taiwanese Americans out of poverty into the ranks of America's [[Upper middle class in the United States|educated and upper middle class]]. Estimates indicate that a disproportionate percentage of Taiwanese students attend elite universities despite constituting less than 0.5% of the U.S. population. Taiwanese Americans have the highest education attainment level in the United States, surpassing any other ethnic group in the country, according to U.S Census Bureau data released in 2010. According to the 2010 Labor Statistics from U.S. Census Bureau, 73.6% of all Taiwanese Americans have attained a bachelor's or high degree (compared to 28.2% nationally and 49.9% for all [[Asian American]] groups). 80.0% of Taiwanese American men attained a bachelor's degree and 68.3% of Taiwanese American women attained a bachelor's degree. 39.1% of all Taiwanese in the United States possess a master's, doctorate or other professional degree, which is nearly four times the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table |title=United States - Selected Population Profile in the United States (Asian alone) |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="census1"&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table |title=United States - Selected Population Profile in the United States (Taiwanese alone) |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Model Minority Stereotype and Black Americans ===
Often overlooked is the direct contrast of Model Minorities with Black Americans. Model Minorities are used as a tool to discriminate against Black people with the mantra "If they can do it, why cant you?". This argument is often viewed as logical, because at the surface, there doesn't seem to be a clear cut explanation for why Jews, Asians, and Irish people are able to thrive after experiencing racism, but Blacks still seem to be disenfranchised.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What this argument often ignores, is the unique experience of Black people in America, namely, they are the only minority who had been enslaved on U.S. soil for centuries. Some scholars also explain the differing successes of Asian immigrants and Blacks on the specific types of racism they experience. Essentially racism in itself is not monolithic, and is perpetrated in different ways and different arenas of life, some arenas where anti-Black rhetoric exist prove to be more harmful to Black personhood than situations in which anti-Asian discrimination exists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Media portrayal===
Media coverage of the increasing success of Asian Americans as a group began in the 1960s, reporting high average test scores and marks in school, winning national [[spelling bee]]s, and high levels of university attendance.

In 1988, the writer Philip K. Chiu identified the prevalence of the model minority stereotype in American media reports on Chinese Americans, and noted the contrast between that stereotype and what he observed as the reality of the Chinese American population, which was much more varied than the model minority stereotype in the media typically presented.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Chiu, "ROSTRUM:  The myth of the model minority." U.S. News and World Report. May 16, 1988. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am fed up with being stereotyped as either a subhuman or superhuman creature. Certainly I am proud of the academic and economic successes of Chinese Americans ... But it's important for people to realize that there is another side. ... It is about time for the media to report on Chinese Americans the way they are. Some are superachievers, most are average citizens, and a few are criminals. They are only human—no more and no less.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Possible causes of model minority status===
{{further2|[[Stereotypes of East Asians#Model_Minority_myth|Stereotypes of intelligence of East Asians]] and [[Stereotypes of South Asians#Model Minority|South Asians]]}}

====Selective immigration====
One possible cause of the higher performance of Asian Americans as a group is that they represent a small population in America so those who are chosen to move to America often come from a [[Selection bias|selective group]] of Asians. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and [[brain drain|more highly educated]] out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.&lt;ref name="YananWang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Source of the 'Asian Advantage' Isn't Asian Values NBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/editorial-source-asian-advantage-isnt-asian-values-n443526|title=Editorial: The Source of the 'Asian Advantage' Isn't Asian Values|accessdate=February 21, 2016|first=Janelle|last=Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural differences====
Cultural factors are thought to be part of the reason why Asian Americans are successful in the United States. East Asian societies often place more resources and emphasis on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haibin|first=Li|last2=Martin|first2=Andrew|last3=Yeung|first3=Wei-Jun|date=Summer 2017|title=Academic Risk and Resilience for Children and Young People in Asia|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410.2017.1331973|journal=An International Journal of Experimental Educational Psychology|volume=379|pages=921–929|access-date=10 April 2018|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Confucian tenets and [[Chinese culture]] places great value on work ethic and the pursuit of knowledge. In traditional Chinese social stratification, scholars were ranked at the top&amp;mdash;well above businessmen and landowners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} This view of knowledge is evident in the modern lifestyle of many Asian American families, where the whole family puts emphasis on education and parents will make it their priority to push their children to study and achieve high marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/06/19/the-rise-of-asian-americans/|title=The Rise of Asian Americans|date=2012-06-19|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cultural tendencies and values are found in South Asian American families, whose children similarly face extra pressure by parents to succeed in school and to achieve high-ranked jobs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Although pressure is often perceived as a way to help Asian American descendants achieve greater success, it can be used as a way to provide better income and living status for families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sue |last2=Okazaki |first1=Stanley |first2=Sumie |title=Asian-American educational achievements: A phenomenon in search of an explanation |journal=American Psychologist|volume=45 | issue = 8 |pages=913–920 |via=PsycARTICLES |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.45.8.913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, much of the Asian American success in the United States can be due to the stereotypical yet favorable characteristics that their background holds.&lt;ref name="Goyette-Xie"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Goyette |last2=Xie |first1=Kimberly |first2=Yu |year=1999 |title=Educational Expectations of Asian American Youths: Determinants and Ethnic Differences |publisher=American Sociological Association |page=15 |jstor=2673184 |journal=Sociology of Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the top Asians including Japanese, Chinese, and Korean Americans hold a high position in terms of successful educational goals.&lt;ref name="Goyette-Xie"/&gt;

Others counter this notion of culture as a driving force, as it ignores immigration policies.&lt;ref name="The Source of the 'Asian Advantage' Isn't Asian Values NBC News"/&gt; In the mid 1800s in the United States, Asian immigrants were recruited as laborers for agriculture and to aid in the building of the first transcontinental railroad. Many worked for low wages in the harshest conditions. Confucian values were not seen as a key to success. It was only until the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] changed the way Asians were seen, as Asians with higher education backgrounds were selectively chosen from a larger pool of the Asian population.&lt;ref name="YananWang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Source of the 'Asian Advantage' Isn't Asian Values NBC News"/&gt;

Further, it has also been argued the myth of the Confucian emphasis on education is counterfactual. It also implies Asians are a monolithic group, and ignores the fact that the most educated group of Asian immigrants in the U.S. are Indians, for whom [[Confucius]] is non-existent in their upbringing.&lt;ref name="YananWang"/&gt; It has also been argued that self-selecting immigrants do not represent the actual Asian American population as a whole, nor the populations of their home countries. While 50 percent of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree, only 5 percent of the population does in their native China.&lt;ref name="YananWang"/&gt; Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in Spain, less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.&lt;ref name="YananWang"/&gt;

====Asian American status in affirmative action====
{{See also|Affirmative action}}

In the 1980s, one [[Ivy League]] school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students. Because of their high degree of success as a group and over-representation in many areas such as [[college admissions]], most Asian Americans are not granted preferential treatment by [[affirmative action]] policies as are other minority groups.&lt;ref name="Asian over-representation Washington Post"/&gt;

Some schools choose lower-scoring applicants from other [[Race (human classification)|racial]] groups over Asian Americans in an attempt to promote racial [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and to maintain some [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the society's racial [[Demographics of the United States|demographics]].&lt;ref name="Asian over-representation Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55160-2005Mar21.html|title=Learning to Stand Out Among the Standouts|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 22, 2005|accessdate=December 10, 2010|first=Jay|last=Mathews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asianstudies3"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ancheta|first=Angelo N.|authorlink=|title=Race, Rights, and the Asian American Experience|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2006|location=|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn= 0-8135-3902-1

In 2014, American business schools began a process to sort candidates based on their country of origin and region of the world they come from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stacyblackman.com/2014/11/14/separate-gmat-rankings-for-u-s-and-asian-applicants/|title=Separate GMAT Rankings for U.S. and Asian Applicants|website=Stacy Blackman Consulting - MBA Admissions Consulting|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause was a high disparity in scores on the quantitative portion of the GMAT: Asian Americans, specifically South Asians and East Asians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/10/asians-now-thumping-americans-so-badly-on-gmat-that-business-schools-segregate-scores/|title=Asians Now Thumping Americans So Badly On GMAT That Business Schools SEGREGATE Scores|website=The Daily Caller|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; scored 7 points higher than the worldwide average and 12 points higher than American applicants. Admissions officers now use score segregation to rank and compare similar students.

===Effects of the stereotype ===
According to Gordon H. Chang: The reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of family and elders present in their culture. The Model Minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a "threat" to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Asian Americans and Politics: Perspectives, Experiences, Prospects |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804742016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic [[racial hierarchy]].  Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called "positive" stereotypes, many{{who|date=June 2013}} assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having "gained" social and economic equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 - Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|url=http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112140608/http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 January 2012|format=PDF|publisher=Psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through [[microaggression]]. The stereotyping of Asian Americans as a model minority and perfidious foreigner influences people's perceptions and attitudes towards Asians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suzuki|first1=Bob|title=Revisiting the Model Minority Stereotype: Implications for Student Affairs Practice and Higher Education|journal=New Directions for Student Services|date=2002|volume=2002|issue=97|pages=21–32|doi=10.1002/ss.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also negatively affects students' academic outcomes, relationships with others, and psychological adjustments. For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students' lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kiang|first1=Lisa|title=Model Minority Stereotyping, Perceived Discrimination, and Adjustment Among Adolescents from Asian American Backgrounds.|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2016|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1366–1379|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0336-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and perpetual foreigner.

Furthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students' academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students' educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students' academic experience and social emotional development.

Asian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, higher and unreasonable expectations are often associated with Asian Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as "problem-free" and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Guofang|title=Other People's Success: Impact of the "Model Minority" Myth on Underachieving Asian Students in North America|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=69–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that "Asians are the new Whites"; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers' having a "blaming the victims" perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students' poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students' learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents' expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents' expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Some educators hold Asian students to a higher standard.&lt;ref name="asianamericanissues1"/&gt; This deprives those students with [[learning disabilities]] from being given attention that they need. The connotations of being a model minority mean Asian students are often labeled with the unpopular "[[nerd]]" or "geek" image.&lt;ref name="asianamericanissues1"/&gt;{{rp|223}} Asians have been the target of harassment, [[bullying]], and racism from other races due to the racially divisive model minority stereotype.&lt;ref name="asianstudies3"/&gt;{{rp|165}}

The higher expectations placed on East Asians as a result of the model minority stereotype carries over from academics to the workplace.&lt;ref name="asianamericanissues1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chen|first=Edith Wen-Chu|authorlink=|author2=Grace J. Yoo|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Issues Today, Volume 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=December 23, 2009|location=|pages=222–223|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-313-34749-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model minority stereotype is emotionally damaging to many Asian Americans, since there are unjustified expectations to live up to stereotypes of high achievement. The pressures from their families to achieve and live up to the model minority image have taken a tremendous mental and psychological toll on young Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Cohen |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/05/16/asian.suicides/ |title=Push to achieve tied to suicide in Asian-American women |publisher=CNN.com |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-9280.00277|title=When Positive Stereotypes Threaten Intellectual Performance|last=Cheryan|first=Sapna|last2=Bodenhausen|first2=Galen|date=|website=us.sagepub.com|access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model minority stereotype also influences Asian American students' psychological outcomes and academic experience. The model minority image can lead underachieving Asian American students to minimize their own difficulties and experience anxiety or psychological distress about their academic difficulties. Asian American students also have more negative attitudes toward seeking academic or psychological help&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Arpana|title=The 'model minority myth': Internalized racialism of positive stereotypes as correlates of psychological distress, and attitudes toward help-seeking|journal=[[Asian American Journal of Psychology]]|date=2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=101–114|doi=10.1037/a0024183}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to fear of shattering the high expectations of teachers, parents, and classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Joanne|title=The Role of the Model Minority Stereotype in Asian American Students' College Experiences|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/osu1366659329/inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the model minority stereotype has negative effects on underachieving Asian students in both their home and school settings. It is a threat to Asian American students' academic experience and can disguise students' educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help. Administrators can also improve school climate by monitoring incidents of racial harassment and discrimination. Additionally, to better address struggling students' educational and mental health needs, educators can regularly check in with students and engage in culturally responsive teaching, aimed to understand students' unique circumstances and educational needs.

===Invisible model minority: Africans ===
[[African immigration to the United States|African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants]] have been described as an "Invisible Model Minority" mainly due to their high degree of success in the United States, but due to misconceptions and stereotypes{{clarify|date=September 2015}} of them, their success has not been acknowledged by the greater American society and other Western societies and thus they are "invisible".&lt;ref name=BlackModelMinority3&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Immigrants, An Invisible 'Model Minority'|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/03/black_immigrants_an_invisible.html|publisher=Realclearpolitics.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackInvisibleModel4&gt;{{cite web|title=Black African Migration to the United States| url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/africanmigrationus.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invisibility of the success of Africans was touched upon by Dr. Kefa M. Otiso, an academic professor from [[Bowling Green State University]], who stated that "[B]ecause these immigrants come from a continent that is often cast in an unfavorable light in the U.S. media, there is a tendency for many Americans to miss the vital contribution of these immigrants to meeting critical U.S. domestic labor needs, enhancing American global economic and technological competitiveness".&lt;ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/&gt;

====Education====
In the 2000 U.S. census, it was revealed that African Immigrants were the most educated immigrant group in the United States even when compared to Asian immigrants.&lt;ref name=AfricanEducated1&gt;African Immigrants in the United States are the Nation's Most Highly Educated Group. ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'', No. 26 (Winter 1999-2000), pp. 60-61 {{doi|10.2307/2999156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2&gt;{{cite web|title=Black African Migration to the United States|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/africanmigrationus.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 48.9 percent of all African immigrants hold a college diploma.&lt;ref name=AfricanEducated1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Something You Should Know About African Immigrants in the US …. Pass It On| url=http://minneafrica.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/something-you-should-know-about-african-immigrants-in-the-us-pass-it-on/|publisher=Minneafrica.wordpress.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is more than double the rate of native-born white Americans, and nearly four times the rate of native-born African Americans. According to the 2000 Census, the rate of college diploma acquisition is highest among [[Egyptian Americans]] at 59.7 percent, followed closely by [[Nigerian Americans]] at 58.6 percent.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/stp-159/STP-159-nigeria.pdf |format=PDF |title=Table FBP-1 : Profile of Selected Demographic and Social Characteristics : People born in Nigeria : 2000 |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/stp-159/STP-159-egypt.pdf |format=PDF |title=Table FBP-1 : Profile of Selected Demographics and Social Characteristics : People born in Egypt : 2000 |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, 19.4 percent of all adult African immigrants in the United States held a graduate degree, compared to 8.1 percent of adult white Americans and 3.8 percent of adult black Americans in the United States.&lt;ref name=AfricanEducated1 /&gt; According to the 2000 Census, the percentage of Africans with a graduate degree is highest among Nigerian Americans at 28.3 percent, followed by Egyptian Americans at 23.8 percent.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Of the African-born population in the United States age 25 and older, 87.9% reported having a [[high school]] [[academic degree|degree]] or higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/immigrant-stats.shtml |title=Demographics and Statistics of Immigrants : Asian-Nation :: Asian American History, Demographics, &amp; Issues |publisher=Asian-Nation |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with 78.8% of [[Asian people|Asian]]-born [[immigrants]] and 76.8% of [[European ethnic groups|European]]-born [[immigrants]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Characteristics of the African Born in the United States. Migration Policy Institute. January, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This success comes in spite of facts such as that more than 75 percent of the African foreign born in the United States have only arrived since the 1990s and that African immigrants make up a disportionately small percentage of immigrants coming to the United States such as in 2007 alone African immigrants made up only 3.7 percent of all immigrants in coming to the United States and again in 2009 they made up only 3.9 percent of all immigrants making this group a fairly recent to the United States diversity.&lt;ref name=AfricanMigration5&gt;{{cite web|title=Migration African Immigrants|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/USfocus/display.cfm?ID=719|publisher=Migrationinformation.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AfricanMigrants6&gt;{{cite web|title=Migration Information African Immigrants|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=847|publisher=Migrationinformation.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 8 percent of the [[Ivy League]] Universities' such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]] population which are Black students at an overwhelming 50-66 percent was made up of Black African immigrants, Caribbean immigrants, and American born to those immigrants.&lt;ref name=BlackModelMinority3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackInvisibleModel4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more-blacks-but-which-ones.html|accessdate=26 Jun 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2004|title=Top Colleges Take More Blacks, but Which Ones?|first=Sara|last=Rimer|first2=Karen W.|last2=Arenson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many top universities report that a disproportionate of the black student population consists of recent immigrants, their children, or were mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Shades-of-gray-in-black-enrollment-Immigrants-2728709.php |title=Shades of gray in black enrollment: Immigrants' rising numbers a concern to some activists |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate= |date=February 22, 2005 |first=Jason B. |last=Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socioeconomics====
The overrepresentation of the highly skilled can be seen in the relatively high share of Black African immigrants with at least a four-year college degree. In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10 percent had a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated.&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/&gt; The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of
Africa's largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59 percent of Nigeria's highly skilled immigrants along with 47 percent of those from Ghana and 29 percent from Kenya.&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/&gt;

The average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71 percent of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64 percent of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.&lt;ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/&gt;

Outside of educational success specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society such as [[Ugandan American]]s. Recent statistics indicate that Ugandans have become one of the country's biggest contributors to the economy, their contribution, amounting to US$1 billion in annual remittances which are disproportionately large contributions despite a community and population of less than 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Olivia Miller|date=November 26, 2008|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Ugandan-Americans.html|title=Everyculture:A Countries and Their Cultures: Ugandan Americans|publisher= Everyculture: Countries and their cultures|accessdate= May 25, 2010 &lt;!--to 23:00--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported   2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African immigrants like many other immigrant groups are likely to establish and find success in small businesses. Many Africans that have seen the social and economic stability that comes from [[ethnic enclaves]] such as [[Chinatowns]] have recently been establishing ethnic enclaves of their own at much higher rates to reap the benefits of such communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African immigrants hope for a Chicago community of their own|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-14/news/ct-met-african-immigration-20130114_1_african-immigrants-immigrant-groups-alie-kabba|accessdate=14 July 2013 | work=Chicago Tribune|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographically African Immigrants and Americans born of African immigrants tend to typically congregate in [[urban area]]s, moving to [[suburban area]]s over the next few generations as they try to acquire economic and social stability. They are also one of America's least likely groups to live in [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mumford1.dyndns.org/cen2000/BlackWhite/BlackDiversityReport/black-diversity07.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002325/http://mumford1.dyndns.org/cen2000/BlackWhite/BlackDiversityReport/black-diversity07.htm|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Immigrants and Americans born of African immigrants have been reported as having some of the lowest crime rates in the United States and being one of the unlikeliest groups to go into or commit crime. African immigrants have even been reported to have lowered crime rates in neighborhoods in which they have moved into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration Reduces Crime Rates|url=http://www.livescience.com/4872-immigration-reduces-crime-rates.html|publisher=Livescience.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black immigrants from Black majority countries are revealed to be much healthier than Blacks from countries that are not majority Black and where they constitute a minority. Thus African immigrants are often much healthier than American-born Blacks and Black immigrants from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black immigrants from Africa arrive healthier than those from Europe, suggesting racial discrimination harms health|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7446|publisher=Universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate=15 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420000605/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7446|archivedate=20 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural factors====
Cultural factors have been proposed as an explanation for the success of African immigrants. For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former [[British colonies]], use English as a [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/&gt; Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70 percent of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% ''proficiency'' in English for other immigrant groups.

Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a "high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries," says Otiso.&lt;ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4&gt;{{cite web|title=Study Examines Success of African Immigrans|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news48744.html|publisher=Bgsu.edu|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selective immigration====
Another possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population here in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/&gt;

====Americans born to African immigrants====
Despite African immigrants being highly educated many often find it hard to become employed in high level occupations. Most instead have to work in labor jobs to subsist and maintain a decent life. {{citation needed | reason = This claim requires evidence. | date = May 2016 }} Often it is left to their children to take up these higher positions. This desire to succeed is then transferred onto second generation African immigrants. These Americans often report that their families pushed them very hard to strive for success and overachieve in many aspects of society, especially education. African immigrants put a premium on education because of the limited socioeconomic opportunities they experienced in their native countries. Consequently, they often allocate more resources towards it.

This pushing of second generation African immigrants by their parents has proven to be the key factor in their success, and a combination of family support and the emphasis of family unit has given these citizens social and psychological stability which makes them strive even further for success in many aspects of their daily life and society.&lt;ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7&gt;{{cite web|title=Africans highest achievers in U.S. universities |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfZXZWF_kO8|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these American groups have thus transplanted high cultural emphasis on education and work ethic into their cultures which can be seen in the cultures&lt;ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7/&gt; of [[Algerian Americans]], [[Kenyan Americans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Ha-La/Kenyan-Americans.html |title=Kenyan Americans - History, Modern era, Significant immigration waves, Acculturation and Assimilation |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sierra Leonean American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Francesca Hampton |year=2010 |url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Sierra-Leonean-Americans.html |title=Sierra Leonean Americans |website=Countries and Their Cultures }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghanaian Americans]], [[Malawian American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D.

==African immigrants outside the United States (U.K. Commonwealth)==
Other than in the United States, Africans have experienced success in numerous other countries especially [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, which have attracted many educated and highly skilled African immigrants with enough resources for them to start a new life in these countries.&lt;ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/&gt;

== Israel ==
In [[Israel]], [[Christian Arabs]] are one of the most educated groups. [[Maariv]] has described the Christian Arab sectors as "the most successful in education system",&lt;ref name="המגזר הערבי נוצרי הכי מצליח במערכת החינוך"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/319/566.html|title=חדשות - בארץ nrg - ...המגזר הערבי נוצרי הכי מצליח במערכת|date=2011-12-25|publisher=Nrg.co.il|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="Christians in Israel: Strong in education"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4323529,00.html|title=Christians in Israel: Strong in education - Israel News, Ynetnews|date=1995-06-20|publisher=Ynetnews.com|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have attained a [[bachelor's degree]] and [[academic degree]] more than the median Israeli population.&lt;ref name="Christians in Israel: Strong in education" /&gt;

According to the study "Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel" by Hanna David from the [[University of Tel Aviv]], one of the factors why [[Christianity in Israel|Israeli Arab Christians]] are the most educated segment of Israel's population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. [[Christian school]]s in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab]] university students come from [[Christian school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hcef.org/790796657-demonstration-of-christian-schools-in-jerusalem/ |title= Demonstration of Christian Schools in Jerusalem - Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation |website=Hcef.org |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 87% of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] in the [[high tech]] sector have been educated in Christian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/schools-starved-funds-christians-question-their-future-israel-1522645081 |title=With schools starved of funds, Christians question their future in Israel |website= Middleeasteye.net |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.676300 |title=Why Angry Christians in Israel Are Crying Discrimination - Features |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as "the most successful in the education system",&lt;ref name="המגזר הערבי נוצרי הכי מצליח במערכת החינוך"/&gt; an opinion supported by the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] and others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.&lt;ref name="Christians in Israel: Strong in education"/&gt;

==Canada==
In Canada, [[Asian Canadian]]s are somewhat viewed as a model minority, though the phenomenon is not as widespread as it is in the United States. Majority of this aimed toward the East Asian Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/41669710?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102649787763|title=Importing the Model minority discourse into Canada|author=Gordon Pon|work=Sociology|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KillModel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nova.edu/ssss/QR/kmms.pdf|title=Killing the Model Minority Stereotype: Asian American Counter - Stories and Complicity|work=Sociology|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==
{{see also|Lebanese immigration to Mexico|German immigration to Mexico}}

In Mexico, [[German Mexicans]] and [[Lebanese Mexicans]] are seen as model minorities.

===German Mexicans===
German Mexicans have been so deeply assimilated and ingrained into Mexican society that German cultural heritage and influences can be found throughout all parts of Mexico and Mexican society. German cultural events such as [[Oktoberfest]] can usually be seen in several major cities with significant Mexican-German communities throughout the country, including Mexico City, [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and [[Victoria de Durango]]. [[Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt (Mexico City)|Colegio Alemán Alexander von Humboldt]] in Mexico City is the largest German-based school outside of Germany itself. Major German roots and influences are particularly strong in [[Mexican music]], due to the large German immigration to Texas and northern Mexico around the 1830s.

Today, there are various styles of music that descended in part from German music and they are [[Tejano music|Tejano]], [[Conjunto]], [[Tex-Mex (disambiguation)|Tex-Mex]], Quebradita, [[Banda music|Banda]], [[Ranchera]], and [[Norteño (music)|Norteño]]. These musical styles are especially popular in northern Mexico and in places of the United States where there is a large Mexican immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spanish.about.com/cs/culture/f/germanmusicqa.htm |title=German Roots of Mexican Music |publisher=Spanish.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Mexicans were instrumental and played a crucial part in the development of the [[cheese]] and [[brewing]] industries in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/benson/border/arhoolie2/raices.html |title=The Roots of Tejano and Conjunto Music |publisher=Lib.utexas.edu |accessdate=2013-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040204/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/benson/border/arhoolie2/raices.html |archive-date=2013-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; German influence can be seen as having had a lasting impact on Mexican beers, with brands such as [[Negra Modelo]] and [[Dos Equis|Dos Equis Ambar]], both deriving from [[Vienna lager|Vienna-style lager]]. It was German brewing styles that helped cement brewing as a Mexican cultural trait and enterprise.

===Lebanese Mexicans===
Although Lebanese Mexicans made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |format=PDF |title=Los arabes de Mexico : Asimilacion y herencia cultural |publisher=Confines.mty.itesm.mx |accessdate=24 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124211/https://confines.mty.itesm.mx/articulos2/GarciaRE.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lebanese influence in Mexican culture can be seen most particularly in food, where they have introduced many foods and dishes and created their own recipes such as ''[[tacos Árabes]]''.

[[Carlos Slim]], formerly the richest man in the world (currently the second richest in the world),&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/carlos-slim-helu |title= Carlos Slim Helu &amp; family |work=Forbes |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of Lebanese Mexican success in Mexican society.

==France==
{{see also|Vietnamese people in France|Laotians in France}}

===French Vietnamese===
Vietnamese in France are the most well-established [[overseas Vietnamese]] community outside eastern Asia as well as [[Asian French|Asian ethnic group in France]]. While the level of integration among immigrants and their place in French society have become prominent issues in France in the past decade, French media and politicians generally view the Vietnamese community as a model minority.&lt;ref name=vietnamienne&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tinparis.net/fr_societe/diaspora_viet.html |title=La diaspora vietnamienne |publisher=Tinparis.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part because they are represented as having a high degree of integration within French society as well as their economic and academic success. A survey in 1988 asking French citizens which immigrant ethnic group they believe to be the most integrated in French society saw the Vietnamese being ranked fourth, only behind the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese communities.&lt;ref name=vietnamienne /&gt;

The educational attainment rate of the Vietnamese population in France is the highest among overseas Vietnamese populations, a legacy that dates back to the [[French Indochina|colonial era of Vietnam]], when privileged families and those with connections to the colonial government often sent their children to France to study.&lt;ref name=vietnamienne /&gt; In addition to high achievements in education, the Vietnamese population in France is also largely successful in economic terms. When the first major wave of Vietnamese migrants arrived in France during [[World War I]], a number already held professional occupations in their new country shortly after their arrival. More recently, refugees who arrived in France after the [[Fall of Saigon]] are often more financially stable than their counterparts who settled in North America, Australia and the rest of Europe, due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge of the host country, which allowed them to enter the education system and/or higher paying professions with little trouble.&lt;ref name=diaspora&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas |title=La Diaspora Vietnamienne En France Un Cas Particulier : La Region Parisienne — Eglises D'Asie |publisher=Eglasie.mepasie.org |date=1995-10-16 |accessdate=2015-02-24|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a single generation, median income for French-born Vietnamese has risen to above the French median income.&lt;ref name=diaspora /&gt;

===French Laotians===
Similarly to the Vietnamese, the Laotian community in France is among one of the most well integrated into the country and is the most established [[Laotian diaspora|overseas Laotian]] populace.&lt;ref name="jeunesse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sayasackp.free.fr/connaitrejeunesse.htm|title=Histoires &amp; Légendes du Laos|date=|publisher=Sayasackp.free.fr|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their counterparts in North America and Australia, Laotians in France have a high rate of educational success and are well-represented in the academic and professional sectors, especially among the generations of French-born Lao.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bouvier|Smith|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge of the host country, Laotian immigrants to France, who largely came as refugees after the end of the [[Laotian Civil War]], were able to have a high rate of assimilation.

==Germany==
{{see also|Vietnamese people in Germany|Koreans in Germany|Academic achievement among different groups in Germany}}

Another group in Germany that is extremely academically successful and is comparable to that of a model minority are [[Koreans in Germany|Korean Germans]] 70% of whom attended a Gymnasium (which is comparable to a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in American society) compared to [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese Germans]] with only 50% attending a Gymnasium.&lt;ref name="Vietnamese Miracle Zeit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="choi2006"&gt;Choi, Sun-Ju; Lee, You-Jae (January 2006) (in German) (PDF), Umgekehrte Entwicklungshilfe : Die koreanische Arbeitsmigration in Deutschland (Reverse Development Assistance : Korean labour migration in Germany), Seoul: Goethe Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Also Over 70% of second-generation Korean Germans hold at least an ''[[Abitur]]'' or higher educational qualification, more than twice the ratio of the rest of Germany.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Sun-Ju|first2=You-Jae|last2=Lee|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/kr/seo/pro/redigiert.pdf|format=PDF|language=German|title=Umgekehrte Entwicklungshilfe - Die koreanische Arbeitsmigration in Deutschland (Reverse Development Assistance - Korean labour migration in Germany)|publisher=Goethe Institute|location=Seoul|date=January 2006|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], [[Asian New Zealanders]] are viewed as a model minority due to attaining above average socio-economic indicators than the New Zealand average, though the phenomenon remains small, underground, and not as widespread compared with their American counterparts{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. In a study of a popular New Zealand [[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|newspaper]], articles "never portrayed the [[Chinese New Zealanders|Chinese]] as a model minority that silently achieves" and this was "not in line with overseas research, suggesting that this stereotype merits further analysis". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1302&amp;context=apme|title=From Yellow Peril to Model Minority?

===Background===
{{see also|Indos in the Dutch East Indies}}
At the end of the colonial era of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now: [[Indonesia]]), a community of about 300,000 Indo-Europeans (people of mixed Indonesian and European heritage) was registered as Dutch citizens. Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony. When in the second half of the 20th century the independent [[Republic of Indonesia]] was established, the majority of Europeans, including the Indo-Europeans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gouda, Frances |title='Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies 1900-1942.'|publisher=Equinox|date=2008|isbn=978-979-3780-62-7|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nN6G-lMk_DEC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; were expelled from the newly established country.

===Repatriation===
From 1945 to 1949 the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] turned the former Dutch East Indies into an increasingly hostile environment for Indo-Europeans. Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early [[Bersiap]] period (1945–1946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/bussemaker_bersiap.pdf |format=PDF |title=Geschiedenis : Dr. H. Th. Bussemaker |publisher=Tontong.nl |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo diaspora continued up to 1964 and resulted in the emigration of practically all Indo-Europeans from a turbulent young Indonesian nation. Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this  emigration was named ''repatriation''.

Notwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7028352.html |title=Spijtoptanten - NPO Geschiedenis |publisher=Geschiedenis24.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the [[Bersiap]] period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.&lt;ref name="vanstockum.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html |title=Van Pasar Malam tot I love Indo |publisher=Vanstockum.nl |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
In the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] in 2002 and film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120805075827/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440]&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person. A percentage that increased to 80% for the second generation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.imes.uva.nl/research/IMESsecondthirdgenerationsDutchEurasians.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817070552/http://www.imes.uva.nl/research/IMESsecondthirdgenerationsDutchEurasians.html|date=August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNo0ZYamYsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq='Indisch+is+een+gevoel'&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2PpWDDOQo4&amp;sig=SBvaqropvzfBt9UcH8wKGMXqIXw&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=H8zGS4KzFYyTOJq69MgM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwBg#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title='Indisch is een gevoel': de tweede en derde generatie Indische Nederlanders - Marlene de Vries - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and oldest Indo organisations that supported the integration of Indo repatriates into the Netherlands is the ''Pelita foundation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pelita.nl/cms/publish/content/showpage.asp?themeid=1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031234451/http://www.pelita.nl/cms/publish/content/showpage.asp?themeid=1|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Indo repatriates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/home/default.htm |title=CBS - Home |publisher=Cbs.nl |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; being born overseas, are officially registered as Dutch citizens of foreign descent, their Eurasian background puts them in the Western sub-class instead of the Non-Western (Asian) sub-class.

Two factors are usually attributed to the essence of their apparently seamless assimilation into Dutch society: Dutch citizenship and the amount of 'Dutch cultural capital', in the form of school attainments and familiarity with the Dutch language and culture, that Indos already possessed before migrating to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Amersfoort|first=Hans|year=2006|title=Immigration as a Colonial Inheritance: Post-Colonial Immigrants in the Netherlands, 1945-2002|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440~frm=abslink|publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies (IMES)|volume=32|pages=323–346|work=Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies|ISSN=1469-9451|number=3|doi=10.1080/13691830600555210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New generations===
Although third- and fourth-generation Indos&lt;ref&gt;Note: The academic definition in sociological studies often used to determine first-generation Indos: Indo repatriates that could consciousnessly make the decision to immigrate. As off age 12.&lt;/ref&gt; are part of a fairly large minority community in the Netherlands, the path of assimilation ventured by their parents and grandparents has left them with little knowledge of their actual roots and history, even to the point that they find it hard to recognise their own cultural features. Some Indos find it hard to grasp the concept of their Eurasian identity and either tend to disregard their Indonesian roots or on the contrary attempt to profile themselves as Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKHEO7um2nQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Culture, Structure and Beyond - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.my |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years however the reinvigorated search for roots and identity has also produced several academic studies.&lt;ref name="vanstockum.nl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2257628/Indovation |title=Indovation |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oaithesis.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/4233/Master%20Thesis%20Kirsten%20Vos%202007%20v%201.2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Indie Tabeh : Master Thesis |author=Kisten Vos |publisher=Oaithesis.eur.nl |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916030215/http://oaithesis.eur.nl/ir/repub/asset/4233/Master%20Thesis%20Kirsten%20Vos%202007%20v%201.2.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/specialseries/mixedcultures/080627-dutch-identity-mc-redirected]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:moherowe berety.jpg|250px|thumb|The "army of mohair berets", a photo published by [[Gazeta Wyborcza]]]]
"'''Mohair berets'''" ({{Lang-pl|moherowe berety}}) is a tongue-in-cheek expression that stands for people who support the views expressed by the Polish conservative [[Catholic]] movement, whose main representative is Father [[Tadeusz Rydzyk]]. This expression originated from the characteristic headgear worn by the stereotypical representatives of this circle.&lt;ref name=ns&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Marek|title=The mohair berets are on the march|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200512190006|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term “mohair berets” alludes to the colloquial name "[[Green beret]]s" for military units such as special forces (in Polish, "red and green berets").

== History ==
The expression “mohair berets” was used for the first time in 2004 and it referred to the people who were regularly attending masses in [[Gdańsk]] celebrated by [[Henryk Jankowski]], the parish priest. When he was dismissed from his post, the same parishioners staged demonstrations in his defence. A beret made of mohair or its imitation, and often a handmade one, is commonly associated with its typical wearers, mostly poor elderly ladies. That is the exact social environment of many of Jankowski’s followers who were shown on television.  Probably the first article which introduced the expression “mohair berets” to the Polish press was the one published in the daily ''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'' from 23 October 2004 titled “Labyrinths of the parish priest”. It reads as follows: “Old ladies have their eyes fixed on Father Jankowski and they hang on every his word. Rumour has it that the prelate has his own legion of mohair berets in Gdańsk.”{{cn|date=November 2012}}
The expression has spread over the journalism and discussions on Internet forums and started to be used when referring to broader social groups, mostly active listeners of the Catholic radio station [[Radio Maryja]]. The term “mohair berets” became commonly used after Robert Górecki, a photojournalist of ''Gazeta Wyborcza'', published the photograph on the Internet which depicted the 14th anniversary of Radio Maryja in December 2005. The picture showed numerous listeners of the radio with berets on their heads. Then the term entered the language of politics and became partly associated with the supporters of those parties which were given plenty of broadcast time on Radio Maryja during the election campaign in 2005, especially the electorate of the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) and [[Law and Justice]] (PiS).

== The mohair coalition ==
[[File:Underside of beret.jpg|thumb|right|A typical mohair beret]]
The phrase “mohair berets” gained a widespread popularity in colloquial language, particularly in some political skirmishes. The example of such a reference is the term “mohair coalition” used by [[Donald Tusk]] during the debate in Sejm on the inaugural address of a newly designated Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] on 10 November 2005. “Poland deserves more than what is currently known as a mohair coalition,” said Donald Tusk. The PO leader used such an expression to describe an unofficial parliamentary coalition of [[Law and Justice|PiS]], the [[League of Polish Families|LPR]] and [[Samoobrona|Self-Defence]]. He also suggested that the coalition existed even though PiS persisted in denying it. Donald Tusk officially apologised to the indignant pensioner Julita Kon for his statement when confronted with her in [[Olsztyn]] on 30 November 2005, the day when he was on his way to meet with the members of the housing cooperative Domator in Olsztyn who kept demanding to call the general meeting of the cooperative for almost two weeks.
The coalition described by Tusk was observed in many votes in Sejm and it was officially sealed later by so-called “stabilisation pact”(an agreement between PiS, the LPR and Self-Defence on their cooperation in the parliament ) followed by forming a coalition by those parties.  The term has not appeared in Polish media since 2005.

== Parodies ==
The mohair berets are a leitmotiv of the satirical song ''Mohair berets'' recorded by [[Big Cyc]] which was released in April 2006 on the album of the same title. The photographs promoting the album showed the band members wearing mohair berets.  As soon as in May of the same year [[Kabaret OT.TO]] presented the parody of the hip hop song titled ''Mohair neighbours''.  The phenomenon of mohair berets is also a key theme of skits (called Mohair programme) performed by cabaret Neo-Nówka from [[Wrocław]] as well as the song ''Moherowy ninja'' (''Mohair ninja'') from the album ''Gra?'' recorded by the alternative rock band L-Dópa.

== Statistics ==
The social group called “mohair berets”  came under close scrutiny conducted by one of the companies dealing with personal data processing. Its analyses showed that mohair berets accounts for 3.1 per cent of the overall Polish population, the typical representatives of the group analysed being mostly married couple over 50 years old, whose children have already left the nest. As much as 80 per cent of them have only elementary or elementary plus [[vocational education]], 36 per cent of the group are blue collar workers. According to the analyses those people avoid modern technologies (over 50 per cent have not opened a bank account and only one out of four people use mobile phones). The analysis proves that due to the low incomes the group members have to make sure that their bills do not exceed 100 PLN per month so they do their shopping in small shops or  cheap discount shops. They usually spend their free time on an allotment (gardening plots are widespread in Poland for dwellers of high-rise flats), solve crosswords and puzzles or go fishing. A minority of those surveyed never go on holidays, 73 per cent spend their time off at home.

Established in March 1998, [http://www.nps.org.au/ NPS MedicineWise] (known prior to 2009 as the '''National Prescribing Service''') is a [[not-for-profit]] organisation whose programs are funded by the [[Department of Health (Australia)]]. Since July 2012, the organisation has been officially known as NPS MedicineWise.

NPS MedicineWise provides practical tools (such as medicines lists), evidence-based information, and educational activities, with the intention of improving the way health technologies, including how [[medicines]] and [[medical tests]], are prescribed and used.

==Overview==
NPS MedicineWise was founded in 1998 as part of an [[Australian Government]] shift in health policy to address issues around [[Quality Use of Medicines]] (QUM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/about-us/our-history |title=Our history |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=NPS MedicineWise}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPS MedicineWise' initial mandate was to reduce cost of medicines to Australia's [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS) by providing clinically reviewed independent information about medicines to [[Physician|doctors]], [[pharmacists]] and other [[health professionals]]. Many of these materials relate to new drugs or more complex grey-areas in the prescription process.
&lt;!--
NPS MedicineWise goals are to:		
* look at challenges and problems with the ways medicines are used or not used
* help doctors with questions they may have about best practice
* help people understand how to take their medicines safely and effectively, if a medicine is needed
--&gt;

Since 2003, NPS MedicineWise has assumed a secondary mandate: promoting discussion of basic medicine-related issues in the community via consumer education programs and major award-winning campaigns, including ''Be Medicinewise Week'', launched in January 2011. The campaign was broadcast across a wide spectrum of media channels and addressed common health issues such as [[lower back pain]], [[antibiotics]] and the [[active ingredient]] of medicines.

Although NPS MedicineWise &lt;!--claims to have--&gt;has brought wide-ranging savings to the Australian health system,&lt;ref name="AustralianDoctor1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wallace, |first=Louise |date=4 March 2011 |journal=Australian Doctor |url=http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/articles/06/0c06f506.asp |title=NPS claims success in GPs prescribing less}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics have questioned the actual causes and ramifications of such savings.&lt;ref name="AustralianDoctorComments"&gt;"You're joking. Nearly all the reduction in prescribing is because of the threat of Medicare investigating us for not being below the 50th percentile. Nothing to do with balanced education and practical advice to GPs." Dr. I-M Suspicioustoo. http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/commentall.asp?artid=201782534&lt;/ref&gt; However the savings reported by the organisation are comprehensively evaluated and accepted by government, demonstrating a clear correlation between NPS MedicineWise programs and improved prescribing.&lt;ref name="Pharmacy News"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donoghue, |first=Nick |date=18 February 2014 |journal=Pharmacy News |url=http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/news/latest-news/improvements-in-prescribing-creates-savings-nps |title=Improvements in prescribing creates savings: NPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation came under fire in mid-2010 for its decision to replace its telephone-line switch-board staff with nurses,&lt;ref name="Croakey1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sweet |first=Melissa |url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/croakey/2010/07/09/what-do-nurses-know-about-medicines-anyway/ |title=What do nurses know about medicines anyway? - Croakey Health Blog |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which sparked controversy over what many claimed was a desertion of the pharmacists whose interests the NPS MedicineWise claimed to serve.&lt;ref name="Australian1"&gt;{{cite news |title=That's no job for a nurse: switchboard |author=Batagol, Ron |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/thats-no-job-for-a-nurse-switchboard/story-e6frg8y6-1225892369391 |newspaper=The Australian |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=18 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In actual fact the change in service model saw an in-house service established which was staffed by NPS pharmacists, with all calls triaged by ''healthdirect Australia'' which is where the confusion about nurses replacing pharmacists stemmed from. Prior to this the Mater Hospital in Brisbane was subcontracted to provide the phone line service but this was changed to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of the service.

==Historical success==
In the period between 1998 and 2004, 90% of all GPs were actively involved in one or more educational activities run by NPS MedicineWise, while approximately sixty per cent of GPs and pharmacists rated the NPS' printed educational materials as good or very good.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby J, Wutzke SE, Bowman J, Mackson JM, Weekes LM (2006). "Evaluation of a national QUM service in Australia: an evolving model." ''J Eval Clin Pract'', 12:202-17&lt;/ref&gt;

NPS MedicineWise activities have generated substantial financial savings to the PBS, with the organisation claiming that its information and education campaigns have reduced unnecessary prescriptions and improved prescribing decisions within the medical community.&lt;ref name="AustralianDoctor1" /&gt; Various health professionals argue that, despite potential conflicts between cost-saving and the organisation's Quality Use of Medicines mandate, the NPS will continue to improve on the current PBS system.&lt;ref&gt;Moulds R (2003). "Good prescribing: where to next?". ''MJA'', 178:196-7. Available at http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_05_030303/mou10839_fm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

NPS MedicineWise has also developed programs and resources to help consumers and health practitioners to discuss health issues&lt;ref&gt;Weekes LM, Mackson JM, Fitzgerald M, Phillips SR.

The {{Nihongo|'''National Police Reserve'''|警察予備隊|Keisatsu Yobitai}}, or '''NPR''', was a lightly armed national police force established in August 1950 during the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation of Japan]].{{sfn|Kuzuhara|2006|p=95}}. In October 1952 it was expanded to 110,000 men and renamed as the National Safety Force. On July 1, 1954 it was reorganized as the [[Japan Self Defense Forces]].

==History==
[[File:General Group Headquarters, National Police Reserve Japan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|General Group Headquarters of the NPR]]
On the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], many units of the [[United States Armed Forces]] stationed in Japan were transferred to [[South Korea]], and Japan was perceived as lacking defenses.{{sfn|佐道明廣|2017|p=36}}{{sfn|佐道明広|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Kuzuhara|2006|p=95}} Encouraged by the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] (GHQ), the Japanese government in 1950 authorized the establishment of NPR, consisting of 75,000 men equipped with light infantry weapons.{{sfn|Kuzuhara|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|佐道明広|2006|p=23}} Personnel affairs of the NPR was taken charge of by GHQ's Government Section (GS) under Brigadier General [[Courtney Whitney]]{{sfn|Maeda|1995|p=25}} while the efforts to establish and train the force was made by Civil Affairs Section Annex (CASA) under Major General Whitfield P. Shepard.{{sfn|华丹|2014|p=22}}{{sfn|Kuzuhara|2006|p=99}}

Given the legal status of police, the National Police Reserve was tasked with the duty to maintain [[public security]] under special conditions according to the National Police Reserve Order (Cabinet Order No. 260, 1950),{{refn|group=n|According to Article 3, National Police Reserve Order ({{lang|ja|警察予備隊令第三條}}), the NPR took action upon appointment by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] when it was particularly necessary to maintain public security.{{sfn|佐道明廣|2017|p=37}} (original text in Japanese: {{lang|ja|警察予備隊は、治安維持のため特別の必要がある場合において、内閣総理大臣の命を受け行動するものとする。}}){{sfn|松本昌悦|尾崎利生|箭川哲|1988|p=475}}}} while in terms of [[Military organization|unit formation]] and equipment, it was a [[de facto]] military force modeled after the [[United States Army]].{{sfn|佐道明廣|2017|p=37-38}}

In October 1952, the NPR was expanded to 110,000 men and renamed as the National Safety Force (NSF).{{sfn|佐道明広|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|华丹|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|赫赤|关南|姜孝若|1988|p=189}}

==History==

===Early history===

[[File:William Conant Church.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Conant Church]], one of the NRA's founders]]
A few months after the Civil War started in 1861, a national rifle association was proposed by Americans in England. In a letter that was sent to [[President Lincoln]] and appeared in the ''New York Times'', R.G. Moulton and R.B. Perry recommended forming an organization similar to the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|British National Rifle Association]], which had formed a year and a half earlier. They suggested making a shooting range, perhaps on the base on [[Staten Island]], and were offering [[Whitworth rifle]]s for prizes for the first shooting competition with those rifles. They suggested a provisional committee to start the Association which would include: President Lincoln, Secretary of War, officers, and other prominent New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/09/archives/a-national-rifle-association-patriotic-action-of-americans-residing.html|title=A National Rifle Association.; Patriotic Action of Americans Residing Abroad|date=1861-08-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/mal.1025500/?st=gallery|title=Abraham Lincoln papers: Series 1.

The National Rifle Association was first chartered in the [[State of New York]] on November 16, 1871&lt;ref name= incorporation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRABriefHist/&gt; by ''[[Army and Navy Journal]]'' editor [[William Conant Church]] and Captain [[George Wood Wingate]]. On November 25, 1871, the group voted to elect its first corporate officers. Union Army Civil War General [[Ambrose Burnside]], who had worked as a [[Rhode Island]] [[gunsmith]], was elected [[president (corporation)|president]].&lt;ref name= firstelection&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/93095681/ Meeting of the National Rifle Association Election of Officers]".

''The New York Times''. August 7, 1872. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Union Army]] records for the Civil War indicate that its troops fired about 1,000 rifle shots for each Confederate hit, causing General Burnside to lament his recruits: "Out of ten soldiers who are perfect in drill and the [[manual of arms]], only one knows the purpose of the [[Iron sight|sights]] on his gun or can hit the broad side of a barn."&lt;ref&gt;Bellini, Jason (December 20, 2012).

Recognizing a need for better training, Wingate sent emissaries to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany to observe militia and armies' marksmanship training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Excerpt: How Canadians helped create the NRA|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/12/20/how-canadians-helped-create-the-nra.html|first1=A.J. |last1=Somerset|date=December 20, 2015|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; With plans provided by Wingate, the New York Legislature funded the construction of a modern [[Shooting range|range]] at [[Creedmoor Rifle Range|Creedmoor]], [[Long Island]], for long-range shooting competitions. The range officially opened on June 21, 1873.&lt;ref name= grandopening&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/93350525/ America's Wimbledon: The Inauguration]". ''The New York Times''.

''The New York Times''. June 12, 1873. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- At the time, Queens was not yet part of New York City. --&gt;

After beating England and Scotland to win the [[Elcho Shield]] in 1873 at [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], &lt;!-- please check the linked article before changing. --&gt;then a village outside London, the Irish Rifle Team issued a challenge through the ''[[New York Herald]]'' to riflemen of the United States to raise a team for a long-range match to determine an Anglo-American championship. The NRA organized a team through a subsidiary amateur rifle club. [[Remington Arms]] and [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]] produced [[breech-loading weapon]]s for the team. Although [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s had long been considered more accurate, eight American riflemen won the match firing breech-loading rifles. Publicity of the event generated by the ''New York Herald'' helped to establish breech-loading firearms as suitable for military marksmanship training, and promoted the NRA to national prominence.&lt;ref name="craige"/&gt;

====Rifle clubs====
[[File:PresidentUSGrantVignette.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulysses S. Grant]] served as President of the NRA from 1883 (ten years after he left office) to 1884 ]]
The NRA organized rifle clubs in other states, and many state National Guard organizations sought NRA advice to improve members' marksmanship. Wingate's markmanship manual evolved into the United States Army marksmanship instruction program.&lt;ref name="craige"/&gt; Former President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] served as the NRA's eighth president and General [[Philip H.

A program of annual rifle and pistol competitions was authorized, and included a national match open to military and civilian shooters. In 1907, NRA headquarters moved to Washington, DC to facilitate the organization's advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name="craige"/&gt; [[Springfield Armory]] and [[Rock Island Arsenal]] began the manufacture of [[M1903 Springfield]] rifles for civilian members of the NRA in 1910.&lt;ref name=Canfield2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Bruce N. |date=September 2008 |magazine=[[American Rifleman]] |title= To promote marksmanship ...

===1934–present===
The NRA formed its Legislative Affairs Division to update members with facts and analysis of upcoming bills,&lt;ref name=LD-NRA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title=National Rifle Association |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/National+Rifle+Association |encyclopedia=TheFreeDictionary.com |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=April 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[National Firearms Act]] (NFA) of 1934 became the first federal gun-control law passed in the US.&lt;ref name=LD-NFA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=National Firearms Act of 1934 |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/National+Firearms+Act+of+1934 |encyclopedia=TheFreeDictionary.com |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=April 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Frederick]], NRA President in 1934, during congressional NFA hearings testified "I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons.

The NRA supported the NFA along with the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA), which together created a system to federally license gun dealers and established restrictions on particular [[Title II weapons|categories and classes]] of firearms.&lt;ref name=Lepore2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jill Lepore | authorlink = Jill Lepore |date=April 23, 2012 |title=Battleground America: One nation, under the gun |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/23/120423fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=Condé Nast }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization opposed a national firearms registry, an initiative favored by then-President [[Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref name=Gerhart /&gt;

Until the middle 1970s, the NRA mainly focused on sportsmen, hunters and target shooters, and downplayed [[gun control]] issues. However, passage of the GCA galvanized a growing number of NRA gun rights activists, including [[Harlon Carter]]. In 1975, it began to focus more on politics and established its lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), with Carter as director. The next year, its political action committee (PAC), the Political Victory Fund, was created in time for the 1976 elections.&lt;ref name=CPGCp158&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shaiko |first1=Ronald G. |last2=Wallace |first2=Marc A. |year=1998 |chapter=Going Hunting Where the Ducks Are: The National Rifle Association and the Grass Roots |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |editor1-last=Bruce |editor1-first=John M. |editor2-last=Wilcox |editor2-first=Clyde |title=The Changing Politics of Gun Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0847686159 |oclc=833118449 |accessdate=April 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} The 1977 annual [[convention (meeting)|convention]] was a defining moment for the organization and came to be known as "The Cincinnati Revolution".&lt;ref name=Knoxp299&gt;{{cite book |last=Knox |first=Neal |year=2009 |title=Neal Knox: The Gun Rights War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA3pGSYG2yIC&amp;pg=PA299 |editor-last=Knox |editor-first=Christopher |publisher=MacFarlane Press |pages=299–300|isbn=978-0976863304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership planned to relocate NRA headquarters to Colorado and to build a $30 million recreational facility in New Mexico, but activists within the organization whose central concern was Second Amendment rights defeated the incumbents and elected Carter as executive director and [[Neal Knox]] as head of the NRA-ILA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Achenbach |first1=Joel |last2=Higham |first2=Scott |last3=Horwitz |first3=Sari |date=January 12, 2013 |title=How NRA's true believers converted a marksmanship group into a mighty gun lobby |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-nras-true-believers-converted-a-marksmanship-group-into-a-mighty-gun-lobby/2013/01/12/51c62288-59b9-11e2-88d0-c4cf65c3ad15_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen H.

====Political expansion====
After 1977, the organization expanded its membership by focusing heavily on political issues and forming coalitions with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] politicians. Most of these are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref name="Glen H. Utter 2000 pp 99-100"&gt;Glen H. Utter, ''Encyclopedia of Gun Control and Gun Rights'' (2000) pp. 99–100, 162&lt;/ref&gt; With a goal to weaken the GCA, Knox's ILA successfully lobbied Congress to pass the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] (FOPA) of 1986 and worked to reduce the powers of the federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF). In 1982, Knox was ousted as director of the ILA, but began mobilizing outside the NRA framework and continued to promote opposition to gun control laws.&lt;ref name=Knoxp314&gt;{{cite book |last=Knox |first=Neal |year=2009 |title=Neal Knox: The Gun Rights War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA3pGSYG2yIC&amp;pg=PA314 |editor-last=Knox |editor-first=Christopher |publisher=MacFarlane Press |pages=314–20|isbn=978-0976863304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1991 national convention, Knox's supporters were elected to the board and named staff lobbyist [[Wayne LaPierre]] as the executive vice president. The NRA focused its attention on the gun control policies of the Clinton Administration.&lt;ref&gt;Glen H. Utter, ''Encyclopedia of Gun Control and Gun Rights'' (2000) pp. 62, 158, 162, 166–67&lt;/ref&gt; Knox again lost power in 1997, as he lost reelection to a coalition of moderate leaders who supported movie star [[Charlton Heston]], despite Heston's past support of gun control legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Spitzer, ''The Politics of Gun Control'' (2nd ed. 1998) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the NRA unsuccessfully opposed the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] (AWB), but successfully lobbied for the ban's 2004 expiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feldman |title=Ricochet: Confessions of a Gun Lobbyist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zi5yAwWxa50C&amp;pg=PT174 |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley |page=174|isbn=978-1118131008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston was elected president in 1998 and became a highly visible spokesman for the organization.

==Lobbying and political activity==
[[File:Chris Cox by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chris W. Cox]], the NRA's chief lobbyist and political strategist, in March 2016]]
When the National Rifle Association was officially incorporated on November 16, 1871,&lt;ref name = incorporation/&gt; its primary goal was to "promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis". The NRA's website says the organization is "America's longest-standing civil rights organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.nra.org/ |title=NRA Digital Network |publisher=National Rifle Association |quote=The National Rifle Association is America's longest-standing civil rights organization. |accessdate=May 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 1872, the NRA created a committee to [[lobbying in the United States|lobby]] for legislation in the interest of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/93266257/ The National Rifle Association]". ''The New York Times''.

Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.proquest.com/docview/93285877/ Important Meeting of the National Rifle Association]". ''The New York Times''. May 22, 1872. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the National Rifle Association created a Legislative Affairs Division and testified in front of Congress in support of the first substantial federal gun control legislation in the US, the [[National Firearms Act]].&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-nra-marksman-s-friend-that-took-aim-at-washington-8429536.html | title=The NRA - marksman's friend that took aim at Washington | work=[[The Independent]] | date=December 22, 2012 | accessdate=May 30, 2018 | last=Walker | first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), the lobbying branch of the NRA, was established in 1975. According to [[Political science|political scientists]] John M. Bruce and Clyde Wilcox, the NRA shifted its focus in the late 1970s to incorporate political advocacy, and started seeing its members as political resources rather than just as recipients of goods and services. Despite the impact on the volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and its PAC, the Political Victory Fund established in 1976, ranked as "one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections" as of 1998.&lt;ref name=BruceWilcox1998p158&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bruce |editor1-first=John M. |editor2-last=Wilcox |editor2-first=Clyde |year=1998 |title=The Changing Politics of Gun Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvNb5s8Z3b0C&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;vq=political%20victory%20fund&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |pages=158–59 |isbn=0847686140 |oclc=833118449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] magazine survey said that lawmakers and their staffers considered the NRA the most powerful lobbying organization three years in a row.&lt;ref name=FortuneSurvey1999/&gt; [[Chris W. Cox]] is the NRA's chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, a position he has held since 2002. In 2012, 88% of Republicans and 11% of Democrats in Congress had received an NRA PAC contribution at some point in their career. Of the members of the Congress that convened in 2013, 51% received funding from the NRA PAC within their political careers, and 47% received NRA money in their most recent race. According to Lee Drutman, political scientist and senior fellow at the [[Sunlight Foundation]], "It is important to note that these contributions are probably a better measure of allegiance than of influence."&lt;ref name=Drutman121218&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/18/nra-and-congress/ |title=NRA's allegiances reach deep into Congress |last=Drutman |first=Lee |date=December 18, 2012|publisher=Sunlight Foundation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, [[Aleksandr Torshin]], is suspected of illegally funneling money through the NRA to benefit Trump's 2016 campaign.  In May of 2018, Democrats on the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] released a report stating it had obtained "a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign" through Torshin and his assistant [[Maria Butina]], and that "The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to secretly fund Mr. Trump's campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article211265784.html |title= Senate Dems: Documents suggest Russia used NRA to aid Trump campaign |first1=Greg |last1=Gordon |first2= Peter |last2= Stone |date= May 16, 2018 |publisher= ''McClatchy DC BUreau'' |accessdate= May 16, 2018 |via=McClatchyDC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsSMH11&gt;Greg Gordon and Peter Stone, 17 May 2018, Sidney Morning Herald, [https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/russia-used-nra-to-aid-trump-campaign-documents-suggest-democrats-say-20180517-p4zfuk.html Russia used NRA to aid Trump campaign, documents suggest: Democrats], Retrieved May 25, 2018, "...

===The ATF and Senate confirmations===
The NRA has for decades sought to limit the ability of the ATF to regulate firearms by blocking nominees and lobbying against reforms that would ease the ability of the ATF to track gun crimes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/us/politics/trump-atf-nra.html|title=How the N.R.A.

The NRA supported the 1938 Federal Firearms Act (FFA) which established the [[Federal Firearms License]] (FFL) program. The FFA required all manufacturers and dealers of firearms who ship or receive firearms or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce to have a license, and forbade them from transferring any firearm or most ammunition to any person interstate unless certain conditions were met.&lt;ref name=SAF-Ascione1939&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Ascione1.html |title=The Federal Firearms Act|last=Ascione |first=Alfred M. |year=1939|publisher=[[Second Amendment Foundation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618110827/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Ascione1.html |archivedate=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=July 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRA supported and opposed parts of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which broadly regulated the firearms industry and firearms owners, primarily focusing on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers and importers. The law was supported by America's oldest manufacturers (Colt, S&amp;W, etc.) in an effort to forestall even greater restrictions which were feared in response to recent domestic violence. The NRA supported elements of the law, such as those forbidding the sale of firearms to convicted criminals and the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Knox1966&gt;{{cite book |last=Knox |first=Neal |chapter=The Dodd Bill Both Fact...and Fantasy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LSE2QfOCSoC&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;ots=2Hm1KrD_1O&amp;dq=The%20Dodd%20Bill%20Both%20Fact%20...%20and%20Fantasy&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Gun Rights War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LSE2QfOCSoC |publisher=MacFarlane |pages=50–65 |isbn=978-1565921979 }} Originally in ''[[Guns &amp; Ammo]] Magazine'', June 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenfeld130114&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenfeld |first=Steven |date=January 14, 2013 |title=The NRA once supported gun control |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/01/14/the_nra_once_supported_gun_control/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|publisher=Salon Media Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
In November 2005, the NRA and other gun advocates filed a lawsuit challenging [[San Francisco Proposition H (2005)|San Francisco Proposition H]], which banned the ownership and sales of firearms. The NRA argued that the proposition overstepped local government authority and intruded into an area regulated by the state.

In April 2006, [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, police began returning to citizens guns that had been [[New Orleans Police Department#Hurricane Katrina|confiscated after Hurricane Katrina]].

While the NRA filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus brief]] with the Supreme Court in the 2008 landmark gun rights case of [[District of Columbia v. Heller|''District of Columbia v Heller'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lawyers|title=HARVARD LAW Today|last=McArdle|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819041919/http://lawyers|archive-date=2013-08-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 5 to 4 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the District of Columbia's gun laws were unconstitutional, and for the first time held that an individual's right to a gun was unconnected to service in a militia.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Walden, Michael.

In 2009 the NRA again filed suit (''[[Guy Montag Doe v. San Francisco Housing Authority]]'') in the city of San Francisco challenging the city's ban of guns in public housing.

In 2010, the NRA sued the city of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] (''[[McDonald v.

In March 2013, the NRA joined a federal lawsuit with other gun rights groups challenging New York's gun control law (the [[NY SAFE Act]]), arguing that Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] "usurped the legislative and democratic process" in passing the law, which included restrictions on magazine capacity and expanding the state's assault weapons ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/22/nra-joins-lawsuit-challenging-new-york-gun-control-law/ |title=NRA joins lawsuit challenging New York's gun control law |publisher=FOX News |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, voters in [[Sunnyvale, California]], passed an ordinance banning certain ammunition magazines along with three other firearm-related restrictions. The ordinance was passed by 66 percent in favor.&lt;ref name=Chokshi /&gt; The ordinance requires city residents to "dispose, donate, or sell" any magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds within a proscribed period of time once the measure takes effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Carolyn|title=NRA vows to fight Sunnyvale's tough new gun law|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/NRA-vows-to-fight-Sunnyvale-s-tough-new-gun-law-4962573.php|accessdate=December 16, 2013 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the NRA joined local residents in suing the city on second amendment grounds.&lt;ref name=Chokshi&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/12/18/nra-sues-sunnyvale-over-its-new-ammunition-ban/ | title=NRA lawyer sues Sunnyvale, Calif., over its new ammunition ban | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=December 18, 2013 | accessdate=February 26, 2018 | last=Chokshi | first=Niraj}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge dismissed the suit three months later, upholding the Sunnyvale's ordinance.&lt;ref name=Wadsworth&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2014/03/06/judge-dismisses-nra-upholds-sunnyvale-gun-control-measure/ | title=Judge Dismisses NRA, Upholds Sunnyvale Gun Control Measure | website=San Jose Inside | date=March 6, 2014 | accessdate=February 26, 2018 | last=Wadsworth | first=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/03/07/sunnyvales-ammo-magazine-ban-is-in-effect-but-to-what-effect/ | title=Sunnyvale's ammo magazine ban is in effect — but to what effect? | newspaper=[[The Mercury News]] | date=March 7, 2014 | accessdate=February 26, 2018 | last=Richman | first=Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of San Francisco then passed similar ordinances a short time later. The San Francisco Veteran Police Officers Association (SFVPOA), represented by NRA attorneys, filed a lawsuit challenging San Francisco's ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines, seeking an injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Valerie|title=Veteran cops challenge San Francisco's gun limit laws|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/20/veteran-cops-challenge-san-franciscos-gun-limit-la/?page=all|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge denied the injunction in February 2014.&lt;ref name=Wadsworth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Egelko&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-wins-ruling-on-high-capacity-gun-magazines-5249792.php | title=S.F. wins ruling on high-capacity gun magazines | newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=February 20, 2014 | accessdate=February 26, 2018 | last=Egelko | first=Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the NRA lobbied for a bill in Pennsylvania which grants it and other advocacy groups [[legal standing]] to sue municipalities to overturn local firearm regulations passed in violation of a state law [[wikt:preemption|preempting]] such regulations, and which also allows the court to force cities to pay their legal fees. As soon as it became law, the NRA sued three cities: [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. In Philadelphia, seven regulations the NRA sued to overturn included a ban on gun possession by those found to be a risk for harming themselves or others, and a requirement to report stolen guns to the police within twenty-four hours after discovery of the loss or theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Brian|title=Here's the Lawsuit the NRA Just Filed Against Philadelphia Organization says city has "openly defied state law for decades."|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2015/01/14/heres-lawsuit-nra-just-filed-philadelphia/|accessdate=February 22, 2015|magazine=[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]] |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lancaster, a city of fewer than 60,000, mayor [[Rick Gray (Pennsylvania politician)|Rick Gray]], who has chaired the pro-gun control group [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]], was also named in the suit.

In 1994, following disagreements between the NRA and athletes over control of the program of Olympic [[shooting sports]], the [[US Olympic Committee]] recommended [[USA Shooting]] replace the NRA as the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for Olympic shooting.

====Board of directors====

The NRA is governed by a board of 76 elected directors, 75 of whom serve three-year terms and one who is elected to serve as a cross-over director. The directors choose a president and other officers from among the membership, as well as the executive director of the NRA General Operations and the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA).&lt;ref name=NRABylaws&gt;{{cite web |title=The National Rifle Association of America Bylaws |year=2012 |publisher= National Rifle Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 71 members were white and 65 were male.

===Membership===
According to Wayne La Pierre NRA membership exceeded 5 million as of May 2013, one-tenth of whom had joined in the prior six months.&lt;ref name=2013Membership/&gt; ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' has questioned the membership numbers published by the NRA. They say that in 2008, for example, the organization claimed both 3 million and 4.3 million members. Journalist [[Osha Gray Davidson]] suggested in 2000 that many deceased "life members" are kept on the books in order to inflate the membership rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/01/nra-membership-numbers|title=Does the NRA Really Have 4 Million Members?|magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 Pew Research Center Study found that more than 14 million Americans consider themselves NRA members, above the real membership number of 5 million. This may be attributed to the fact that the NRA has millions more of Americans who support them and will tell pollsters they are members, even when they are not. In other cases, it could be that their membership has lapsed and for others, they might consider a family member's membership part of their own.&lt;ref name="Nra Pew Members"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170707/remarkable-finding-from-pew-survey | title=Remarkable Finding from Pew Survey on NRA membership|publisher=National Rifle Association Institute of Legislative Action | accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/|title=America's Complex Relationship With Guns|website=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NRA Foundation====
The NRA Foundation is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization that raises and donates money to outdoors groups and others such as [[ROTC]] programs, [[4-H]] and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]]. In 2010, the NRA Foundation distributed $21.2 million in grants for gun-related training and education programs: $12.6 million to the NRA itself, and the rest to community programs for hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, and law enforcement, and to women and youth groups.&lt;ref name=FactCheck130115/&gt; The foundation has no staff and pays no salaries.&lt;ref name=FactCheck130115/&gt;

[[Friends of NRA]] is a program that raises money for the NRA Foundation. Since its inception in 1992, Friends of NRA has held over 17,600 events, reached over 3.2 million attendees and raised over $600 million for The NRA Foundation.&lt;ref name="Melzer2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Melzer |first=Scott|title=Gun Crusaders: The NRA's Culture War |year= 2012 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0814764503 |pages=66–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF)====
By 1976, as the NRA became more politically-oriented, the Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), a PAC, was established as a subsidiary to the NRA, to support NRA-friendly politicians.&lt;ref name=BruceWilcox1998p186/&gt; [[Chris W. Cox]], who is the NRA's chief lobbyist and principal political strategist, is also the NRA-PVF chairman. Through the NRA-PVF, the NRA began to rate political candidates on their positions on gun rights. An NRA "A+" candidate is one who has "not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment", whereas an NRA "F" candidate is deemed a "true enemy of gun owners' rights".&lt;ref name=Lowes140311/&gt;

In the 2008 elections, the PVF spent millions on "direct campaign donations" and "grassroots operation".&lt;ref name=NRAPVF2015&gt;{{cite web |year=2015 |title=About PVF |url=https://www.nrapvf.org/about-pvf/|publisher=National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund |access-date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, NRA-PVF income was $14.4 million and expenses were $16.1 million.&lt;ref name=CRP-PVF2012/&gt; By 2014, the NRA-PVF income rose to 21.9 million with expenses of 20.7 million.&lt;ref name=CRP-PVF2014/&gt;

Bush]] resigned his life membership to the organization after receiving a National Rifle Association Institute of Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) fund-raising letter, signed by executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, that referred to ATF agents as "jack-booted government thugs".&lt;ref name=Butterfield950508&gt;{{cite news |last=Butterfield |first=Fox |date=May 8, 1995 |title=Terror in Oklahoma: Echoes of the N.R.A.; Rifle Association Has Long Practice In Railing Against Federal Agents |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/08/us/terror-oklahoma-echoes-nra-rifle-association-has-long-practice-railing-against.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BushGHWLetter&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/11/us/letter-of-resignation-sent-by-bush-to-rifle-association.html |title=Letter of Resignation Sent By Bush to Rifle Association |last=Bush |first=George H.W. |date=May 11, 1995 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRA later apologized for the letter's language.&lt;ref name=Keil950518&gt;{{cite news |last=Keil |first=Richard |date=May 18, 1995 |title=NRA Apologizes for 'Jack Boot' Letter |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950518&amp;slug=2121718 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial board criticized the NRA's attacks, which it called false and misleading, on [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=NYTEd081201&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial board |date=December 1, 2008 |title=The Gun Lobby's Loss |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/opinion/02tue3.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Donald Trump]]'s election, the NRA closely aligned with Trump.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/nratv-nra-news-media-operation.html|title=Where the N.R.A.

A number of observers have argued that the NRA has become a partisan organization, focusing overwhelmingly on supporting the Republican Party. They argue that the NRA does not support Democratic candidates, even when the Democrat holds pro-gun views, and that the organization supports Republican causes even when they are unrelated to gun rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/24/politics/nra-partisan-bipartisan-republican/index.html|title=The NRA used to be much more bipartisan.

===Gun control===
In February 2013, ''[[USA Today]]'' editors criticized the NRA for [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopping]] on expansion of universal background checks to private and [[gun show]] sales, which NRA now opposes.&lt;ref name=USATodayEd130210&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial board |date=February 10, 2013 |title=Enact universal background checks: Our view |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/02/10/universal-background-checks-nra/1907439/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of NRA members found that the majority support certain gun control policies, such as a [[universal background check]]:

{{blockquote|For instance, 84% of gun owners and 74% of NRA members (vs. 90% of non-gun owners) supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales; 76% of gun owners and 62% of NRA members (vs. 83% of non-gun owners) supported prohibiting gun ownership for 10 years after a person has been convicted of violating a domestic-violence restraining order; and 71% of gun owners and 70% of NRA members (vs. 78% of non-gun owners) supported requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years in prison for a person convicted of selling a gun to someone who cannot legally have a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1300512|title= After Newtown – Public Opinion on Gun Policy and Mental Illness| first1= Colleen L.| last1= Barry| first2= Emma E. |last2= McGinty| first3= Jon S.| last3= Vernick| first4= Daniel W. |last4= Webster| journal= N Engl J Med |volume= 368| number= 368| pages= 1077–81| date= March 21, 2013| doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1300512|pmid= 23356490| access-date= January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mass shootings===
====Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting====
Following the high-profile 2012 shooting at the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary School]], the organization began to become the focus of intense criticism, due to its continued refusal to endorse any new restrictions on assault-style gun ownership, or to endorse any other types of new restrictions on gun ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alternet.org/news-amp-politics/8-preposterous-nra-defenses-ar-15 8 "Preposterous NRA Defenses of the AR-15"] Alternet.

While supporters say the organization advances their rights to buy and own guns according to the constitution's Second Amendment, some critics have described it as a "terrorist organization" for advocating policies that enable and permit the widespread distribution and sale of assault-style weapons, and for its opposition to any other types of restrictions on gun sales or use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/opinion/the-nras-complicity-in-terrorism.html The N.R.A.'s Complicity in Terrorism] ''New York Times'' Editorial Board.

The NRA has been criticized for their media strategy following [[mass shootings in the United States]].

====2017 Las Vegas shooting====

After the October 2017 shooting at a concert in Las Vegas, which left 58 people dead and 851 injured, the NRA was initially criticized for their silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cerullo|first1=Megan|title=NRA silent following Las Vegas shooting|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/nra-silent-las-vegas-shooting-article-1.3538901|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four days they issued a statement opposing additional gun control laws, which they said would not stop further attacks, and calling for a federal law allowing people who have a [[concealed carry]] permit in one state to carry concealed weapons in all other states. The organization also suggested additional regulations on so-called [[bump fire stock]]s, which allow a semi-automatic weapon to function like a machine gun; the Las Vegas shooter had used such a device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/05/republicans-guns-bump-stocks-las-vegas-shooting|title=NRA breaks silence after Vegas shooting to call for 'additional regulations' on bump stocks|date=October 5, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoneman Douglas High School shooting====
{{main|Stoneman Douglas High School shooting}}
In February 2018 a school shooting at a high school in Florida left 17 dead, and student survivors organized a movement called [[Never Again MSD]] to demand passage of certain gun control measures.

The NRA offers corporate discounts to its members at various businesses through its [[affiliate program|corporate affiliate programs]].

===Media campaigns===
In 2017, Zack Beauchamp of [[Vox Media|Vox]] and Mark Sumner of [[Daily Kos]] criticized a video advertisement from the NRA. In the video, Dana Loesch runs through a list of wrongs committed by an unspecified "they":

&lt;blockquote&gt;They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that the president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars, and singers, and comedy shows, and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march. Make them protest. Make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia. To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding. Until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this. The only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sumner alleged the NRA was trying to boost gun sales by "convincing half of America to declare war on the other half."

In May 2018 the NRA ran an advertisement which criticized the media for giving too much coverage to school shooters by showing their faces and revealing their names, in effect causing a "glorification of carnage in pursuit of ratings", and satirically suggested that Congress pass legislation to limit such coverage in order to make provocative point about gun control.  In response, critics suggested that this would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name=twsWPost489&gt;Eli Rosenberg, May 24, 2018, Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/05/24/nra-host-calls-for-legislation-to-limit-reporting-on-mass-shooters-then-he-said-he-didnt-mean-it/?wpisrc=nl_headlines&amp;wpmm=1 NRA host calls for legislation to limit reporting on mass shooters.

{{LGBT sidebar}}
[[Ayn Rand]], author and developer of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], held controversial views regarding [[homosexuality]] and [[gender role]]s. Although her personal view of homosexuality was unambiguously negative, considering it immoral and disgusting, Rand endorsed non-discrimination protection for homosexuals in the public sphere while opposing laws against discrimination in the private sector on the basis of economic freedom.

==Ayn Rand==
===Moral views===
In 1971, Rand published an essay called "The Age of Envy", which included criticism of the [[women's liberation movement]]. Rand's criticisms included denouncing "sex views" that she considered "hideous", including "proclaim[ing] spiritual sisterhood with [[lesbian]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ayn |last=Rand |chapter=The Age of Envy |title=[[The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution]] |publisher=New American Library |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year Rand published another essay that criticized women's liberation for forming a "common front with lesbians and prostitutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ayn |last=Rand |title=The Disfranchisement of the Right |work=The Ayn Rand Letter |date=December 20, 1971 |volume=1 |issue=6 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two passages were Rand's only published writings about homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John David |last1=Lewis |first2=Gregory |last2=Salmieri |chapter=A Philosopher on Her Times: Ayn Rand's Political and Cultural Commentary |editor1-first=Allan |editor1-last=Gotthelf |editor2-first=Gregory |editor2-last=Salmieri |title=A Companion to Ayn Rand |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-8684-1 |year=2015 |page=396n87 |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to questions from the audience at the two Ford Hall Forum lectures she gave at [[Northeastern University]], Rand explained her views in more detail. In her 1968 lecture, she said, "I do not approve of such practices or regard them as necessarily moral, but it is improper for the law to interfere with a relationship between consenting adults."&lt;ref&gt;''Ayn Rand Answers'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's heir [[Leonard Peikoff]] stated that there were people with whom Rand was "close, knowing full well that they were homosexual" and that "she certainly regarded some of them as Objectivists".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peikoff.com/2009/05/25/is-homosexuality-immoral/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Rand endorsed rights that protect homosexual people from discrimination by the government (such as opposition to [[sodomy laws]]), but rejected the right to be protected from discrimination in the [[private sector]] (such as [[employment discrimination]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlassociety.org/ayn-rand-100-will-businessmen-learn-her-lessons-about-politicians Atlassociety.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/ayn-rand/objectivism.asp Theobjectivestandard.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitalismmagazine.com/1998/05/anti-discrimination-laws-destroy-human-rights-and-institutionalize-bigotry/ Capitalismmagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2013}} The stated basis of this conclusion was that it was a product of her stand on property rights, not related to her feelings about homosexuality. Rand supported the right of a private property owner to discriminate, even on a basis that she condemned as immoral, such as racism, and that any act of the government to change this would be an intrusion on [[individual rights]].

===On sex roles===
Rand asserted that "the essence of femininity is hero worship – the desire to look up to man" and that "an ideal woman is a man-worshipper, and an ideal man is the highest symbol of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehr-freiheit.de/faq/femin.html Mehr Freiheit]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Rand felt that it was part of human nature for a psychologically healthy woman to want to be ruled in sexual matters by a man ''worthy'' of ruling her. In an authorized article in ''The Objectivist'', [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] [[Nathaniel Branden]], Rand's onetime extramarital lover and "intellectual heir," explains Rand's view as the idea that "man experiences the essence of his masculinity in the act of romantic dominance; woman experiences the essence of her femininity in the act of romantic surrender." This however, would be very different than any brutal form of rule.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Psychology of Self-Esteem]]'', Nathaniel Branden, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Rand's death==
After Rand's death in 1982, her heir, Leonard Peikoff, publicly disagreed with some of her views.  Peikoff argued that homosexuality itself is not open to moral judgment. Other contemporary Objectivists generally continue to support the view that, while government should not discriminate for or against homosexuals in any way, private individuals and private organizations should be free to do so.

In 1983, Branden wrote that Rand was "absolutely and totally ignorant” about homosexuality. Branden added that he saw her perspective "as calamitous, as wrong, as reckless, as irresponsible, and as cruel, and as one which I know has hurt too many people who&amp;nbsp;... looked up to her and assumed that if she would make that strong a statement she must have awfully good reasons."&lt;ref&gt;"Ayn Rand and Homosexuality" Paul Varnell, Chicago Free Press, [http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27018.html reprinted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927092001/http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27018.html |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an FAQ from The Atlas Society (formerly The Objectivist Center):
&lt;blockquote&gt;While many conservatives believe that homosexuality should be outlawed and many [[Liberalism|liberals]] believe that homosexuals should be given special rights, Objectivism holds that as long as no force is involved, people have the right to do as they please in sexual matters, whether or not their behavior is considered by others to be or is in fact moral. And since individual rights are grounded in the nature of human beings as human beings, homosexuals do not deserve any more or less rights than [[heterosexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=D. |last=Moskovitz |url=http://www.atlassociety.org/homosexuality-moral |title=Homosexuality |publisher=The Objectivist Center |date=January 5, 2002 |accessdate=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objectivist psychotherapist [[Michael J. Hurd]] supports [[gay marriage]] as falling under the rights of individuals to associate voluntarily. Unlike Rand, however, he does not view homosexuality as immoral, stating that "a gay marriage... though unconventional and highly controversial, can be a loving and highly satisfying union between two individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?id=3612 |title=Gay Marriage |first=Michael J. |last=Hurd |publisher=Capitalism Magazine |date=April 24, 2004 |accessdate=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrandbookstore2.com/prodinfo.asp?number=IX01M Romance: Bringing Love and Sex Together (CD)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist psychologists [[Ellen Kenner]] and [[Edwin Locke]] expressed opinions similar to those of Hurd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=16386&amp;allEpisodes= The Rational Basis of Homosexuality, Kenner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drkenner.com/romance.htm Dr. Kenner on Romance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered affiliates of the [[Objectivist Party]], a minor political party in the United States, have adopted platforms opposing government-sanctioned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, favoring legalization of same-sex marriage, and favoring elimination of the military's policy of "[[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objectivistparty.us/6506.html Affiliate Platforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42319">{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Online dispute resolution''' ('''ODR''') is a branch of [[dispute resolution]] which uses technology to facilitate the resolution of disputes between parties. It primarily involves [[negotiation]], [[mediation]] or [[arbitration]], or a combination of all three. In this respect it is often seen as being the online equivalent of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Monty Ahalt, [http://files.ali-aba.org/thumbs/datastorage/lacidoirep/articles/PLIT0903_Ahalt_thumb.pdf What You Should Know About Online Dispute Resolution].&lt;/ref&gt; However, ODR can also augment these traditional means of resolving disputes by applying innovative techniques and online technologies to the process.

ODR is a wide field, which may be applied to a range of disputes; from interpersonal disputes including consumer to consumer disputes (C2C) or marital separation; to court disputes and interstate conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;National Centre for Technology and Dispute Resolution, Standards of Practice. See &lt;www.odr.info&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that efficient mechanisms to resolve online disputes will impact in the development of e-commerce. While the application of ODR is not limited to disputes arising out of business to consumer (B2C) online transactions, it seems to be particularly apt for these disputes, since it is logical to use the same medium (the internet) for the resolution of e-commerce disputes when parties are frequently located far from one another.&lt;ref&gt;L. Bygrave, "Online Dispute Resolution- What it Means for Consumers". Paper presented at a conference entitled 'Domain Name Systems and Internet Governance' Grace Hotel, Sydney, (7 May 2002) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Dispute resolution techniques range from methods where parties have full control of the procedure, to methods where a third party is in control of both the process and the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;C. Rule, Online Dispute Resolution for Businesses. B2B, E-Commerce, Consumer, Employment, Insurance, and Other Commercial Conflicts (San Francisco, Jossey Bass, 2002) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; These primary methods of resolving disputes may be complemented with [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="Cortes_2009"&gt;P. Cortes, "A European Legal Perspective on Consumer Online Dispute Resolution" (2009) 15(4)''Computer Telecommunications Law Review'' pp. 90-100.&lt;/ref&gt; When the process is conducted mainly online it is referred to as ODR, i.e. to carry out most of the dispute resolution procedure online, including the initial filing, the neutral appointment, evidentiary processes, oral hearings if needed, online discussions, and even the rendering of binding settlements. Thus, ODR is a different medium to resolve disputes, from beginning to end, respecting due process principles.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. García Álvaro, "Online Dispute Resolution Uncharted Territory" (2003) 7 The Vindobona Journal of International Commercial Law and Arbitration P. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

ODR was born from the synergy between ADR and ICT, as a method for resolving disputes that were arising online, and for which traditional means of dispute resolution were inefficient or unavailable.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Rifkin"&gt;E. Katsh, and J. Rifkin, J. Online Dispute Resolution: Resolving Conflicts in Cyberspace (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The introduction of ICT in dispute resolution is currently growing to the extent that the difference between off-line dispute resolution and ODR is blurry. It has been observed that it is only possible to distinguish between proceedings that rely heavily on online technology and proceedings that do not.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hörnle, "Online Dispute Resolution: the Emperor's New Clothes" (2003) 17(1) International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 27. See Cf. J. Hörnle, Cross-Border Internet Dispute Resolution (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have defined ODR exclusively as the use of ADR assisted principally with ICT tools. Although part of the doctrine incorporates a broader approach including online litigation and other sui generis forms of dispute resolution when they are assisted largely by ICT tools designed ad hoc.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lodder, "The Third Party and Beyond. An Analysis of the Different Parties, in Particular The Fifth, Involved in Online Dispute Resolution" (2006) 15 (2) Information and Communications Technology Law p. 144. G. Kaufmann-Kohler and T. Schultz, Online Dispute Resolution: Challenges for Contemporary Justice (2004) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter definition seems more appropriate since it incorporates all methods used to resolve disputes that are conducted mainly through the use of ICT.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cortes, Online Dispute Resolution for Consumers in the European Union (Routledge, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this concept is more consistent with the fact that ODR was born from the distinction with off-line dispute resolution processes.&lt;ref&gt;T. Schultz, "An Essay on the Role of Government for ODR. Theoretical Considerations about the Future of ODR" (2003) August ADROnline Monthly p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ODR, the information management is not only carried out by physical persons but also by computers and software. The assistance of ICT has been named by Katsh and Rifkin as the 'fourth party' because ODR is seen as an independent input to the management of the dispute.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Rifkin"/&gt;{{rp|93–117}} In addition to the two (or more) disputants and the third neutral party, the labelling of technology as the fourth party is a clear metaphor which stresses how technology can be as powerful as to change the traditional three side model. The fourth party embodies a range of capabilities in the same manner that the third party does. While the fourth party may at times take the place of the third party, i.e. automated negotiation, it will frequently be used by the third party as a tool for assisting the process.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Wing"&gt;E. Katsh and Wing, "Ten Years of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR): Looking at the Past and Constructing the Future" 38 (2006) U. Tol. L. Rev. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Gaitenby, "The Fourth Party Rises: Evolving Environments of Online Dispute Resolution, 38 (2006) U. Tol. L. Rev. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Bol "An Analysis of the Role of Different Players in E-Mediation: The (Legal) Implications", IAAIL Workshop Series - Second International Workshop pp. 23-25, available at &lt;www.odrworkshoinfo/papers2005/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth party may do many things such as organize information, send automatic responses, shape writing communications in a more polite and constructive manner e.g. blocking foul language. In addition, it can monitor performance, schedule meetings, clarify interests and priorities, and so on.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Rifkin"/&gt;{{rp|129}} The assistance of the fourth party will increase the more technology advances, thus reducing the role of the third neutral party. It has been predicted that virtual "fourth party" avatars will be created to judge disputes and could become more skilled and intelligent over time.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Katsh, Bringing Online Dispute Resolution to Virtual Worlds: Creating Processes Through Code, 1 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 271, 286 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Katsh and Wing argue that ICT advance is occurring exponentially since ICT advance speeds up over the time.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Wing"/&gt;{{rp|27}} As a result, ODR processes are increasing in efficiency providing their disputants with greater advantages in terms of time saving and cost reductions.

=== Alternative definitions ===

In practice it is difficult to provide a self-contained definition of ODR, and given the pace of change it may not even be possible to do so. The use of technology usually involves the use of Internet-based communications technology at some stage, but ODR does not necessarily involve purely online processes – further, many could be replicated offline using pen and paper, or could be achieved using computers without Internet connections.

The range of terms and [[wiktionary:acronym|acronym]]s used to describe the field augments the confusion often felt by those unfamiliar with the new field of ODR. These terms include:

*Internet Dispute Resolution (iDR)
*Electronic Dispute Resolution (eDR)
*Electronic ADR (eADR)
*Online ADR (oADR)

ODR has emerged as the most used term in recent years.

It is uncertain whether these processes form a new ''discipline'' of ADR or a ''tool'' to aid existing methods of dispute resolution. The most appropriate view would be to view ODR as an [[wiktionary:interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] field of dispute resolution.

== Methods ==

=== Consensual ===

====Automated negotiation====

Automated negotiation relates to those methods in which the technology takes over (aspects of) a negotiation. Most of the ODR services in this area are so-called 'blind-bidding' services. This is a negotiation process designed to determine economic settlements for claims in which liability is not challenged. The blind bidding service may be thought of as a type of auction mechanism where some or all information about the players' bids is hidden. There are two forms of automated negotiation, double blind bidding, which is a method for single monetary issues between two parties, and Visual Blind Bidding, which can be applied to negotiations with any number of parties and issues.

* ''Double Blind Bidding''

Double blind bidding is a negotiation method for two parties where the offer and demand are kept hidden during the negotiation. It commences when one party invites the other to negotiate the amount of money in dispute. If the other party agrees, they start a blind bidding process whereby both parties make secret offers or bids, which will only be disclosed if both offers match certain standards. They can usually submit up to three offers and if the bids of both parties come within a predetermined range (usually range from 30% to 5%) or a given amount of money (e.g. €3,000), then the technology automatically settles the dispute in the midpoint of the two offers. Although, it is a simple method, it effectively encourages the parties to reveal their 'bottom line' offers and demands, splitting the difference when the amounts are close.

* ''Visual blind bidding''

The primary distinction of visual blind bidding is in what is kept hidden from the other parties. In traditional double blind bidding, the offers and demands are kept hidden, whereas with visual blind bidding what is kept hidden is what each party is willing to accept. This method can be effectively applied to the simplest single-value negotiations or the most complex negotiations between any number of parties and issues.&lt;ref&gt;E. Thiessen and P. Miniato, "Uncovering Hidden Value in a Clean Water Act Negotiation - Smartsettle Infinity Simulation", (Smartsettle, 2008), available at http://www.odrforum2008.org/program&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual blind bidding commences when all parties agree to negotiate with one another. They start the process by exchanging visible optimistic proposals, which define negotiating ranges. The system then generates suggestions that fall within the negotiating ranges. Parties may continue to exchange visible proposals or contribute their own suggestions to the mix. Suggestions contributed by the parties remain anonymous, thus avoiding the face saving problem of accepting a suggestion made by another party.&lt;ref&gt;E. Thiessen et al., "Rewarding Good Negotiating Behaviour with Smartsettle", (Smartsettle, 2008), available at http://www.odrforum2008.org/program&lt;/ref&gt;

A resolution is declared by the system at the end of a negotiating session if all parties have accepted one or more packages (of one or more proposed decision values) at the end of that session. Which of those packages becomes the agreement may be determined by an algorithm that rewards the party that moves soonest into the Zone of Agreement. This algorithm is thought to encourage concessions and quickly indicate that they are willing to accept a fair outcome. This is in contrast to the chilling effect that occurs with the more common split-the-difference algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;D. Larson, "Artificial Intelligence: Robots, Avatars, and the Demise of the Human Mediator", Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution [Vol. 25:1 2010], available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1461712&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated negotiation has proven to be particularly successful with insurance compensations and commercial activities. It is also a valuable tool for lawyers because they too can use it without revealing what they're willing to accept (unless an agreement is reached) and more importantly, without waiving their right to access the court, in the case that the negotiation is unsuccessful.

Thus, ODR is useful for resolving brick and mortar disputes that arise in businesses, insurance companies and municipalities, who are finding that ODR saves them money and time when dealing with B2C disputes.&lt;ref&gt;J. Krause "Settling it on the Web. New Technology, Lower Costs Enable Growth of Online Dispute Resolution" ''American Bar Association Journal'', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assisted negotiation====

In assisted negotiation the technology assists the negotiation process between the parties. The technology has a similar role as the mediator in a mediation. The role of the technology may be to provide a certain process and/or to provide the parties with specific (evaluative) advice.

Mediators use information management skills encouraging parties to reach an amicable agreement by enabling them to communicate more effectively through the rephrasing of their arguments. Conciliation is similar to mediation, but the conciliator can propose solutions for the parties to consider before an agreement is reached. Also, assisted negotiation procedures are designed to improve parties' communications through the assistance of a third party or software. In fact, it has been argued that assisted negotiation, conciliation, and even facilitation, are just different words for mediation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Jacobs "Mediation Now and Then" in M. P. Barbee, Newsletter, Mediation, International Bar Association Legal Practice Division, July 2007, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The major advantages of these processes, when used online, are their informality, simplicity and user friendliness.&lt;ref&gt;Motion P. "Article 17 ECD: Encouragement of Alternative Dispute Resolution. On-line Dispute Resolution: A View from Scotland" ''The New Legal Framework for E-Commerce in Europe'' (Oregon and Portland, Hart Publishing, 2005) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''SquareTrade''

The leading ODR provider for consumer mediation was until recently [[SquareTrade]]. It was contracted by a number of market places, the largest of which was [[eBay]]. However, due to changes in the eBay feedback system in May 2008, SquareTrade decided to stop resolving eBay feedback disputes from June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;SquareTrade "ODR Is No Longer Offered by SquareTrade" &lt;http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/odr-discontinued&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; SquareTrade continues providing services to eBay users, such as warranty services and the trustmark program. It appears that in the last year these services have been taken over by eBay and [[PayPal]] dispute resolution services, but results on these services are still scarce.

SquareTrade did not handle disputes between users and eBay, only between sellers and buyers on eBay. SquareTrade offered two levels of dispute resolution: assisted negotiation and mediation. SquareTrade was only used after eBay's own consumer satisfaction process. In the last few years, SquareTrade has resolved millions of disputes across 120 countries in 5 different languages.&lt;ref name="Abernethy"&gt;S. Abernethy "Building Large-Scale Online Dispute Resolution and Trustmark Systems" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003, Available at &lt;http://www.odr.info/unece2003&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also &lt;http://www.squaretrade.com&gt; (About us) (Last visited, April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of dealing with large number of disputes is that the same issues arise many times, thus it is possible to divide the disputes into different sections. The SquareTrade process started when a buyer or a seller filed a complaint. To do so, the claimant was asked to fill out a web-based standard claim form that identified the type of dispute and presented a list of common solutions, from which the claimant selected the ones that he agreed to. The other party was contacted by email where he was informed about the SquareTrade process, and asked whether he wished to participate. The parties were often keen on participating because this was the only manner by which the buyer could get redress and the seller positive feedback. The other party filed the response, selecting the resolutions. If both parties agreed on the same resolution, the dispute was resolved. When an agreement could not be reached, parties were put into a negotiation environment. A web interface was used to shape communications into a constructive and polite negotiation. This was achieved with software tools that limited the free text space, encouraged the proposition of agreements, set deadlines and even shaped the tone of exchanges.

This software was the key element of the process because it took over some of the expertise of the third party. This process could be defined as 'mediated negotiation'. According to Rabinovich-Einy, SquareTrade technology,

"intervenes in the negotiations between the parties and, by allowing parties to formulate and reformulate the problem and the solution, performs some of what would be associated with a mediator's role, moving the parties from a problem mode to a solution stance."&lt;ref&gt;O. Rabinovich-Einy "Technology's Impact: The Quest for a New Paradigm for Accountability in Mediation" (2006) 11 ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review'' 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most disputes (over 80 percent) were resolved during the first two stages, which was an impressive success rate given that in the majority of cases, the parties had already been involved in some type of failed direct negotiation before engaging with SquareTrade.&lt;ref&gt;85 percent of cases are settled through the use of facilitated negotiation. Cf. M. Conley Tyler and Di Bretherton, "Seventy-Six and Counting: An Analysis of ODR Sites" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rest of the cases a mediator could be requested for a nominal fee, acting as an expert evaluator or conciliator that made settlement proposals to the parties. This second stage involved the payment of a 29.95 USD fee. According to SquareTrade, "[a] sophisticated case management technology enables mediators to handle lower to medium-value consumer disputes in an efficient cost effective manner."&lt;ref name="Abernethy"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The appointed mediator proposed solutions, if required by the parties to do so. Agreements were always kept confidential by SquareTrade, and became binding as contracts.

SquareTrade has proven that processes such as online negotiation and online mediation can be efficient tools to resolve e-commerce disputes. One of the key issues for the success of SquareTrade was the simplicity and convenience of this service. In addition, SquareTrade services to eBay were concentrated on a reduced number of issues, such as delays, bad descriptions and negative feedback. This made possible the development of an efficient automatic process that enhanced online negotiation. The success of consensual and automated processes depends on the nature of the dispute, the accuracy of information provided, and the capability of the software or the third neutral party in assessing and evaluating the facts and evidence. SquareTrade was particularly effective because it introduced incentives that encourage parties' participation; i.e. both parties wished to resolve their dispute: sellers want to obtain positive feedback and buyers want redress.In general terms, widening the scope of clients' claims to the global market invites extra variables to play: cultural differences, such as high and low culture perceptions and the cross-cultural variations of what constitutes the customer satisfaction experience.&lt;ref&gt;Femenia, Nora, Paper presented at the Joint Conference of the OECD, HCOPIL, ICC, The Hague, the Netherlands, December 12, 2000: "ODR And The Global Management Of Customers' Complaints: How Can ODR Techniques Be Responsive To Different Social And Cultural Environments?"http://www.mediate.com//articles/femenia.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution====

Another form of alternative dispute resolution prioritizes expedience and dispenses with adjudication all together, in recognition of the litigants' desire to simply dispose of the matter as quickly as possible. By removing any hint of adjudication, services (e.g., One Day Decisions) "fast track" a version similar to blind bidding which is restricted privately to the two parties and an algorithm determines a fair value to be accepted by each party. Unlike other services, once accepted by both parties, the settlement amount is applied to the issuance of a Certificate of Final Resolution which both parties accept as irrevocable proof of resolution and final settlement. By avoiding adjudication, expedient non-adjudicative online resolution saves litigants time in court, time away from work and other fees and expenses, while protecting each from ancillary damage: The winning party generally collects more of his disputed amount and the losing party suffers no credit damage from having a judgment entered against him. Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution is generally utilized in cases that might otherwise be heard in small claims or limited civil matters.

====Crowdjustice====

As an alternative to private, professional settlement, the concept of crowdjustice has recently taken shape as a means to leverage social norms and the wisdom of crowds&lt;ref&gt;Surowiecki, James (2005). ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]''. Anchor Books. pp. xv. {{ISBN|0-385-72170-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the outcome of a dispute. This concept forms the basis for the ODR platform [http://www.ujuj.org Ujuj]. Ujuj (pronounced "you judge") is a patent pending online alternative to small claims court that allows parties to a small claims case to create their arguments on video and upload them to the Ujuj web site for the Internet public to vote on the outcome. Parties to a case, known as Claimant and Respondent, agree, through an electronically signed contract, to be bound by the final outcome determined by a jury consisting of the Internet public. Registered users select from all open cases, view the video arguments of the Claimant and Respondent, and then cast their vote on a sliding scale from 0% to 100%, which represents the amount that the user feels should be awarded based on the amount claimed by the Claimant. This vote is added to all other votes on the case and upon case expiration, an average vote is calculated from all votes received. This average is then multiplied by the amount claimed to determine the final award.

=== Adjudicative ===

====Online arbitration====

Arbitration is a process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) delivers a decision which is final, and binding on both parties. It can be defined as a quasi-judicial procedure because the award replaces a judicial decision. Arbitrators can be current or former trial judges, but that is not a requirement. However, in an arbitration procedure parties usually can choose the arbitrator and the basis on which the arbitrator makes the decision. Furthermore, it is less formal than litigation, though more than any other consensual process. It is often used to resolve businesses' disputes because this procedure is noted for being private and faster than litigation. Once the procedure is initiated parties cannot abandon it, unless they both agree to discontinuing it (e.g. when they reached a settlement - although usually the settlement will be communicated to the arbitral tribunal and an award rendered on this basis). Another feature of arbitration is that the award is enforceable almost everywhere due to the wide adoption of the 1958 [[New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Convention has currently more than 150 signatories. See &lt;http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration.html&gt; Cf. J. M. Matthews, "Consumer Arbitration: Is it Working Now and Will it Work in the Future?" 79 (2005) ''The Florida Bar Journal'' P. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, arbitral awards prove frequently easier to enforce than court decisions from overseas.

The majority of legal studies on online arbitration agree that, neither law, nor arbitral principles, prevent arbitration from taking place online.&lt;ref name="Katsh_Rifkin"/&gt;{{rp|138}}&lt;ref&gt;R. Hill, "On-line arbitration: issues and solutions" (1999) 15 ''Arbitration International '' p. 2; M. Wahab, "Globalisation and ODR: Dynamics of change in e-commerce dispute settlement" (2004) 12 IJLIT p. 123; Cf G. A. Vreeswijk, and A. Lodder, "Artificial Intelligence and Law" (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, "Online Alternative Dispute Resolution, Information Obligations in EC E-Commerce Law" in R. Nielsen, S. Sandfeld Jakobsen, and J. Trzaskowski, eds., ''EU Electronic Commerce Law'' (2004) 180.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there may be several aspects in online arbitration that need to be regulated. Although online arbitration seems admissible under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, this is arguably an assumption by most commentators, rather than a legal statement.&lt;ref&gt;R. Morek "The Regulatory Framework for Online Dispute Resolution: A Critical View" (2006) 38 Tol. L. Rev. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured. Currently, most arbitration providers allow parties to carry out online only part of the arbitration process, e.g. parties may download claim forms, the submission of documents through standard email or secure web interface, the use of telephone hearings, etc.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ponte and T. Cavenagh, ''Cyberjustice, Online Dispute Resolution for E-Commerce'' (New Jersey, Parson Prentice Hall, 2005) p. 84; European Commission, SANCO, The Study Centre for Consumer Law, Centre for European Economic Law Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, "An Analysis and Evaluation of Alternative Means of Consumer Redress other than Redress through Ordinary Judicial Proceedings" The United States National Report, Leuven, January 2007. p. 7 Currently the AAA provides Webfile and Neutrals' eCentre web-based platform to parties and neutrals for the management of the procedures. Cf. &lt;www.adr.org&gt;; See B. Davis "Symposium Enhancing Worldwide Understanding Through Online Dispute Resolution: Walking Along in the Mission" 38 (2006) U. Tol. L. Rev. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Other providers conduct their proceedings exclusively online, either by email or on a dedicated web platform.&lt;ref&gt;"How it works - Anywhere Arbitration"&lt;http://www.anywherearbitration.com/how-it-works.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A key element of arbitration is the right for a party to question the witnesses of the other parties and that can now be done at low cost with an online audio and video hearing process using newer technologies such as Skype Premium or [[Google Hangouts]]. Cross examination of remote witnesses regulated by the arbitrator can ensure the fairness and maintain a judicial quality for the online arbitration process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online-arbitration.com online-arbitration.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challenge for online arbitration is that if judicial enforcement is required then it partly defeats the purpose of having an online process. Alternatively, some processes have developed self-enforcement mechanisms such as technical enforcements, black lists and trustmarks.

====The Uniform Domain Names Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)====

Traditionally arbitration resolves disputes by delivering a decision that will be legally binding, i.e. enforceable by the courts in the same manner as a judgment. Non binding arbitration processes may also be effective when using ODR tools because they often encourage settlements by imparting a dose of reality and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;t. Stipanowich, "The Arbitration Penumbra: Arbitration Law and the Rapidly Changing Landscape of Dispute Resolution" ''Legal Studies Working Paper Series'', Paper Number 2008/1, 30 Nevada Law Journal, Forthcoming. Available at &lt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=1007490&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, self-enforcement measures may reinforce the efficacy of non binding processes. The most significant example is the [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) created by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). Some commentators have referred to the UDRP as an administrative process. In any case, the UDRP has developed a transparent global ODR process that allows trade mark owners to fight efficiently cybersquatting. The UDRP is used to resolve disputes between trade mark owners and those who have registered a domain name in bad faith for the purpose of reselling it for a profit, or taking advantage of the reputation of a trademark.

Trademark owners accessing the UDRP must prove to the panel three circumstances: 
#similarity of the domain name to the trade or service mark;
#lack of rights or legitimate interest in the registered domain name;
#bad faith in the registration and use of the domain name.

However, the UDRP presents its own problems that show the challenges that an online adversarial system applied to mainstream e-commerce disputes would have. The main worry is that the evaluation of the panel decisions often shows a lack of unanimous consensus in the interpretation of the UDRP.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions. This case study is based on the evaluation of 7,000 WIPO panel decisions published in February 2005. Available at &lt;http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to a number of reasons, such as the lack of an appellative review and panels composed by members from a multitude of jurisdictions and informed by different legal traditions.

On the other side, it is undeniable what ICANN with the UDRP has achieved in developing an effective ODR procedure based on contractual adherence that allows trade mark owners to transfer or cancel a domain that blatantly violates IP rights. The UDRP providers have dealt efficiently with over 30,000 domain name disputes. Their success derives from two aspects: First, the UDRP deals only with blatant disputes, which are abusive registrations made in bad faith in order to take advantage of the reputation of existing trademarks. Secondly, it has incorporated a self-enforcement mechanism, which transfers and cancels domain names without the need for judicial involvement. This is a positive accomplishment for the development of e-commerce because it favours consumers' confidence in the Internet by reducing the number of fraudulent registered domain names.

====Chargebacks====

One of the main focuses of e-commerce up until recently has been related to secure payments. [[Chargebacks]] is a remedy used to reverse transactions made with credit or debit cards when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. This method is very popular among online consumers since this is the main mechanism to transfer money online. In addition, consumers are not required to give evidence to cancel a payment. The vendor has the burden of proving that the merchandise or service was given according to the contract terms. Once this is proved the bank makes effective the payment to the vendor.

Chargebacks are largely used around the world by banks and the main credit card suppliers i.e. Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Yet, the coverage of debit and credit cards varies considerably amongst different countries.&lt;ref&gt;S. Andrews, OECD Workshop on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, Background Project, 19 April 2005, p.9 and OECD report on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, published 11 April 2006. p.12-16 Available at &lt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/61/36456184.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, debit cardholders have fewer protections than credit card holders, but it also varies depending on the jurisdiction.

It is then not surprising why credit cards are the major source of payments for consumers in e-commerce. They provide a remedy that reverses all transactions when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. However this method has limitations; it offers one single remedy (the return of the payment), and not all disputes imply a breach of contract or fraud.

Similarly, online payment providers, like PayPal.com, retain temporarily the money paid by a buyer when the latter makes a complaint within 45 days after the payment was made. PayPal.com holds the money until the dispute is settled, but only in those cases where the merchandise did not arrive, or the description of the product was significantly different from the product itself.&lt;ref&gt;See Seller Protection Policies in &lt;www.paypal.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances PayPal.com acts akin to an online arbitrator.&lt;ref&gt;I. Colón-Fung, "Protecting the New Face of Entrepreneurship: Online Appropriate Dispute Resolution and International Consumer-to-Consumer Online Transactions" 12 (2007) ''Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law'' p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in those circumstances where the seller takes away the money from his account before the buyer makes the claim, PayPal.com will not be responsible for the buyer's loss. Despite this, PayPal is in a very strong position since in most cases it is able to freeze the amount of money and resolve the dispute providing an instant and effective enforcement.

Overall, chargebacks intends to balance the inequality of power between consumers and businesses. It is regarded as a very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who would just have to notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing chargebacks and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers.&lt;ref&gt;L. Edwards, &amp; C. Wilson, 'Redress and Alternative Dispute Resolution in EU Cross-Border E-Commerce Transactions ', (2007) 21(3) ''International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology'', 315 – 333.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.

== In the European Union ==

=== The European Small Claims Procedure ===

Small claims procedures provide a middle ground between formal litigation and ADR, where disputes involving small value claims can be resolved in courts faster, cheaply, and less formally. The main limitation of small claims procedures is that they are restricted to particular jurisdictions. In order to overcome this limitation the European Commission has produced a regulation for a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP).&lt;ref&gt;Regulation 861/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure O. J. (L. 199) 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the ESCP is expected in all EC Member States by January 2009. The ESCP is predominantly a written procedure that deals with claims under €2,000 arising in cross-border disputes. Its main advantage is that it provides for the enforcement of decisions in any of the member states without the present need to go through the formal mutual recognition of judgements (exequatur).&lt;ref&gt;P. Cortés "Does the Proposed European Procedure Enhance the Resolution of Small Claims?" (2008)27(1) ''Civil Justice Quarterly'' 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Great expectations are put on the ESCP, which in order to deliver a cost effective process will have to rely on ICT. This will be a significant challenge, because unlike the UDRP, which is becoming a fully online process for dealing with specific complaints,&lt;ref&gt;See initiative launched by the Czech Arbitration Court for UDRP Complaints. Press Release at &lt;http://www.adr.eu/_inc/en/resource/press_release_pilot.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the ESCP will deal with a variety of civil and commercial disputes. The objective of the ESCP is the creation of a cost efficient procedure applicable to small value claims in cross-border disputes. This objective could only be achieved by using a written procedure, assisted by electronic forms such as emails and videoconferencing as foreseen by the ESCP.&lt;ref name="Cortes_2009"/&gt;{{rp|95}}

The Regulation allows the use of new technologies in transferring information and evidence between the courts of the different member states. But, it will be the EC Member States who will decide, through their own regulations, which specific means of communication are acceptable in their courts. Given that the ESCP is a regulation and not a directive, it is arguable whether it has left too many aspects to the discretion of member states, which could call into question the legal certainty expected from a European regulation.&lt;ref name="Cortes_2009"/&gt;{{rp|95}} Nevertheless, it can be expected that, in due time, electronic communications will reach every possible and reasonable aspect of the judicial procedure to assist in the resolution of online as well as off-line B2C disputes.

With the implementation of the ESCP an institutionalized ODR may emerge in Europe in 2009. Many disputes will be resolved by judges communicating with parties through the Internet. It is expected that the ESCP will contribute to mitigate the legitimacy problem which also hampers the emergence of ODR. Perhaps, within the EU, where we have concern for the fairness of private procedures (i.e. restrictions in consumer arbitration) the ESCP may contribute to increase trust in ODR processes.&lt;ref name="Cortes_2009"/&gt;{{rp|97}}

== In India ==

Online dispute resolution (ODR) in India is in its infancy stage and it is gaining prominence day by day. With the enactment of ''Information Technology Act, 2000'' in India, e-commerce and e-governance have been given a formal and legal recognition in India. Even the traditional arbitration law of India has been reformulated and now India has ''Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996'' in place that is satisfying the harmonised standards of UNCITRAL Model. The amendment made in the''Code of Civil Procedure, 1908'' by introducing section 89 was made to provide methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in India.

With a rapid growth of e-commerce in India, the number of disputes related to online transactions is on the rise. The existing dispute redressal mechanisms are falling short of the business growth and customer expectations. Conventional redressal systems require presence of the parties, and are not in synch with modern online platforms. The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India has taken note of this and has planned to roll out an Online Consumer Dispute Resolution platform that follows the best practices emerging in the global eCommerce arena. More information of this would be provided at the Online Consumer Mediation Centre [http://www.onlinemediationcenter.ac.in web-site]. There is another initiative called ODRways, started by students of NUJS, which is working towards promoting mediation in India, by integrating it with technology. They have developed an online mediation platform for small civil claim disputes.&lt;ref&gt;http://odrways.com/&lt;/ref&gt; They are also working towards building an online platform for mediators in India,&lt;ref&gt;http://odrways.com/domain/&lt;/ref&gt; which will make it easier for the general public to engage with mediators when they have disputes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17441">'''Participatory [[surveillance]]''' is community-based monitoring of other individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This term can be applied to both [[Media studies|digital media studies]] and ecological field studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the realm of media studies, it refers to how users surveil each other using the internet. Either through the use of [[social media]], [[Web search engine|search engines]], and other web-based methods of tracking, an individual has the power to find information both freely or non freely given by the individual being searched. Issues of privacy emerge within this sphere of participatory surveillance, predominantly focused on how much information is available on the web that an individual does not consent to. More so, [[Outbreak|disease outbreak]] researchers can study social-media based patterns to decrease the time it takes to detect an outbreak, an emerging field of study called [[infodemiology]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Velasco |first=Edward |date=2014 |title=Social Media and Internet-Based Data in Global Systems for Public Health   Surveillance: A Systematic Review |url= |journal=Milbank Quarterly |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Within the realm of ecological fieldwork, participatory surveillance is used as an overarching term for the method in which [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] and [[rural communities]] are used to gain greater accessibility to causes of disease outbreak. By using these communities, disease outbreak can be spotted earlier then through traditional means or healthcare institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wójcik |first=Octawia P. |date=2014 |title=Public Health for the People: Participatory Infectious Disease Surveillance in the Digital  Age |url= |journal=Emerging Themes in Epidemiology |volume= |pages=1–14 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Towards the beginning of the development of [[Web 2.0]], an increase in online socializing and interaction emerged, largely from the function of social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Albrechtslund |first=Anders |date=2008 |title=Online Social Networking as Participatory Surveillance |url= |journal=First Monday |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andrejevic |first=Mark |date=2002 |title=The Work of Watching One Another: Lateral Surveillance, Risk, and Governance |url= |journal=Surveillance &amp; Society |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social media platforms originally emerged within the context of the [[Information superhighway|online information highway]], where users can control what information is available to other users of the platform. Users can now digitally attach people to locations, without having to physically be within the location, a concept coined as [[geotagging]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With added awareness of the locations of users, an aspect of greater socialization and interconnectivity emerges within both the digital and tangible world. Since the online information highway collects and stores information more permanently than the physical world, many interactions amongst online users can last much longer than physical ones. Since users can control the information and locations in which they associate themselves, they can in part surveil themselves and others to an extent. This is participatory surveillance within a web-based paradigm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In contrast to this, participatory surveillance has begun to be referred to as a tool for ecological field research. Currently, it is extremely difficult to detect disease outbreaks in enough time to prepare people for the outcomes. Often, in hard to reach areas such as the Arctic, researchers cannot gain an intensive look into the subject of disease outbreak closely enough to gain accurate results. [[Indigenous peoples]] know the ecology of the land better and how to reach overlooked locations of research. Researchers can use these people as rural surveyors, capturing instances of disease outbreak much quicker and easier than the researchers themselves.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Iverson |first=Samuel A. et al. |date=2016 |title=Avian Cholera Emergence in Arctic-Nesting Northern Common Eiders: Using Community-Based, Participatory Surveillance to Delineate Disease Outbreak Patterns   and Predict Transmission Risk |url= |journal=Ecology and Society |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media ==

=== Counter-surveillance ===
Counter-surveillance refers to the personal monitoring of individuals through means of the [[Digital Highway|online information highway]]. Through government and corporate surveilling practices, the average person has begun to develop an interest in a type of profiling of friends and others through digital technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this enlightens the fact that the average person does not fully understand the surveilling practices used by larger collectivities. With more training in these capacities, it allows greater accountability and management of how surveillance is used and analyzed in everyday associations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting individuals.  Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason. Some researchers assert that by using these technologies of surveillance, the same ones used by companies to track consumer tendencies, the public is essentially feeding into practices of their own personal surveillance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Empowerment ===
One argument towards social media based participatory surveillance is participatory surveillance within social digital media schemas work to emphasize the power that comes from monitoring what is surveilled of themselves in the context of others rather than being constituted as an invasion of privacy, or disempowerment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Within the visual discourse of [[reality television]], the artistic narrative associated with presenting lives, creates a fake reality in which people can contextualize, therefore keeping the reality of some aspects of an individual or collectives lives&amp;nbsp;still privatized. This thinking can be transposed to other socially constructed media technologies. In contrast, [[ambient awareness]] is associated with [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] since they are almost always never turned off, through even the most menial of everyday tasks. This poses a greater security risk. [[Webcam|Surveillance webcams]] focus on the aspects of reality users want to show to the digital audience. It is privatized in the respect that users control what they allow others to see causing them to feel liberated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Infodemiology ===
An emerging term within social media based participatory surveillance, infodemiology refers to the use of digital based applications or surveys, to better track disease patterns.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=Gunther |date=2009 |title=Infodemiology and Infoveillance: Framework for an Emerging Set of Public Health Informatics Methods to Analyze Search, Communication and Publication Behavior on the Internet |url= |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Largely using information people search for related to health as well as what the public says on digital-based platforms makes up the fabric of this field of study. Coming about in 2002, infodemiology measures common social media platforms, disease and illness related websites, search engine information, and any other online user-related health data.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Twitter]], a user-generated platform for social media, can effectively help track users’ thoughts and opinions on diseases as well as help track disease at a greater rate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tang |first=Lu et al. |date=2018 |title=Social Media and Outbreaks of Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Systematic Review of Literature |url= |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume= |pages=962–72 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 virus (swine flu)]] outbreak in 2009 was analyzed through Twitter reactions and responses in order to investigate these areas of thought. After analyzing and comparing tweets through different severities of the H1NI outbreak, the researchers posited that tweets can be a reliable estimate in understanding disease patterns.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Signorini |first=Alessio et al. |date=2011 |title=The Use of Twitter to Track Levels of Disease Activity and Public Concern in the U.S. during the Influenza A   H1N1 Pandemic |url= |journal=PLOS One |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed at which social media reveals public thought and trends is about two weeks faster than that of standardized disease surveillance through the proper health-related institutions. An example of social media reactions related to the H1N1 virus include an increased lack of discussion around antiviral drugs at approximately the same time as the H1N1 virus became less prevalent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, due to the nature of social media as user-generated and unregulated, deciphering between what is relevant versus irrelevant material can blur generalizations and facts. Along with this, people are wavering and unreliable with when and what they post about on social media. With that, social media is an unstable variable which, in order to become standardized, would require great expense to create measures in which it would become feasible to make valid generalizations about.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To elaborate using the example of Twitter, information on sickness can change meaning in a connotative sense. For example, if a user tweets about popular pop artist Justin Bieber saying they have “Bieber Fever,” this is very apparently not a real sickness, but a faux sickness based on the popularity of an artist. This creates issues in organizing information, requiring complex algorithms that can analyze the contours of these social meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Social Media and Health Crisis Communication During Epidemics |last=Syed-Abdul |first=Shabbir et al. |publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press |year=2016 |isbn= |location=Amsterdam |pages=42–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, a recent study noted that studies focusing on the use of Youtube to detect outbreaks only had a twenty to thirty percent range of error, leading researchers' to continue looking into the prospect of social media as a force for change in disease outbreak.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Chikungunya virus ====
[[Chikungunya]] virus, associated with moderate to severe skin rashes and joint pain, spread to [[Italy]] at the beginning of 2007.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mahroum |first=Naim et al. |date=2018 |title=Public Reaction to Chikungunya Outbreaks in Italy—Insights from  an Extensive Novel Data Streams-Based Structural Equation Modeling Analysis |url= |journal=PLOS One |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outbreak caused great social concern, therefore causing a plethora of social media reactions to emerge. Using an infodemiological approach, the sites where the outbreak was recorded, specifically [[PubMed]], Twitter, [[Google Trends]] and [[Google News|News]], and [[Wikipedia]] views and edits all provided information into when the disease was received, the concerns associated with the outbreak, and popular opinion on the disease. Interestingly, most of the Twitter posts related to Chikungunya were highly guided by [[Web search query|search engine queries]] rather than empirical investigations, leading to non-usable data. Using mediation technology, Wikipedia proved to be ineffective in determining whether the site was helpful in understanding the outbreak. Moreover, users who gained opinions on the outbreak from news sources were similar to the Wikipedia edits and reactions. Similarly, the PubMed responses were consistent with that of the Wikipedia and Twitter responses. Overall, a significant amount of information was gathered from these sources, deeming these sites to be useful in documenting disease and public reaction.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Ecological Field Work ==

=== Cholera Outbreak ===
In hard to access regions such as the Arctic and rural regions in Canada, researching ecological processes and disease spread can be hard to access without constant monitoring. In these rural, less populated area, indigenous populations may become a key aspect in understanding the spread of disease, due to their proximity and connection to the land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, the use of [[Inuit]] indigenous peoples in helping to identify outbreak zones of avian cholera. Specifically, the [[Common eider|Common Eider]], a species of sea duck, was being analyzed in Canada. Using the help of the Inuit peoples, the researchers were able to detect the outbreak of cholera in thirteen locations from 2004 to 2016. The Inuit peoples were able to keep a closer eye on death rates of the Common Eider due to their daily routines throughout the land.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Privacy Concerns ==
As digital technology advances with many dangers associated to privacy, individuals are attempting to be more accountable when meeting others. Background check websites and search engine sources reveal just how many people attempt to find information on another person, whatever the reason.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many researchers altogether ignore the idea of privacy when analyzing methods of participatory surveillance. More so, from a social media perspective, some researchers claim that by openly sharing information with others, this cannot be deemed a breach of privacy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Koskela |first=Hille |date=2002 |title=Webcams, TV Shows and Mobile Phones: Empowering Exhibitionism |url= |journal=Surveillance and Society |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a few researchers on the topic mention breaches of privacy within the spheres of both digital media studies and infodemiology.

=== Infodemiology ===
Infodemiology relies on users' information to analyze health patterns and public health concerns.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Choi et al. |first=Jihye |date=2016 |title=Web-Based Infectious Disease Surveillance Systems and Public Health Perspectives: a Systematic Review |url= |journal=BMC Public Health |volume= |pages=1–10 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legality behind using other people's information without their consent can cause serious ethical privacy violations. However, limitations such as individual privacy concerns and unreliable information cause participatory digital information to sometimes be inaccurate and hard to differentiate from truth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Doxing ===
[[Doxing]] is a form of [[cyberbullying]], using the Internet to post private information about an individual or organization as a means of attack against the entity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacAllister |first=Julia M. |date=2017 |title=The Doxing Dilemma: Seeking a Remedy for the Malicious Publication of Personal Information |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol85/iss5/21/ |journal=Fordham Law Review |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common information that can be leaked can be anything from a past discretion, home address, or even social security number of the victim.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This information could be freely available on the Internet for the attacker to gain access to and make public. This differentiates it from other types of information leaks, since the information is simply being brought to the forefront of the public's viewing. In other words, the public information being leaked could be found freely by other parties even if it was not exposed in a more public light. The term "doxing" comes from the origins of document, first used in 2001 with the infamous hacker collective called [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; With today's current laws, most legislation pertaining to cyber threats and attacks are rooted in the 1990s, when the Internet was just developing. Due to information being stored online, doxing does not adhere to standard rights of privacy. Constitutionally, individuals should have the right to disclose or not disclose information, while at the same time being able to make decisions about privacy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protects the right to free speech, but doxing uniquely uses information available to the public, leading some 'doxers' to claim that they are simply exercising their Fourth Amendment rights.

The only exception to Fourth Amendment rights came about from ''[[Cohen v. California]],'' which established the "true threat" exception.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This exception established a breach of free speech rights whenever the content of the speech maliciously invades privacy interests. However, this exception may only work in some doxing situations, where the court measures the extent of the offense and the reactions from the attack.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[File:Détection de personne - exemple 3.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian detection]]
'''Pedestrian detection''' is an essential and significant task in any intelligent [[video surveillance]] system, as it provides the fundamental information for [[semantic]] understanding of the [[video]] footages. It has an obvious extension
to automotive applications due to the potential for improving safety systems. Many car manufacturers (e.g. Volvo, Ford, GM, Nissan) offer this as an [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|ADAS]] option in 2017.

==Challenges ==
* Various style of clothing in appearance
* Different possible articulations
* The presence of occluding accessories
* Frequent occlusion between pedestrians

==Existing approaches ==
Despite the challenges, pedestrian detection still remains an active research area in [[computer vision]] in recent years. Numerous approaches have been proposed.

===Holistic detection===
Detectors are trained to search for pedestrians in the video frame by scanning the whole frame. The detector would “fire” if the image features inside the local search window meet certain criteria. Some methods employ global features such as edge template
,&lt;ref&gt;C. Papageorgiou and T. Poggio, "A Trainable Pedestrian Detection system", ''International Journal of Computer Vision'' (IJCV), pages 1:15–33, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; others uses local features like [[histogram of oriented gradients]] &lt;ref&gt;N. Dalal, B. Triggs, “Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection”, ''IEEE Computer Society [[Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition]]'' (CVPR), pages 1:886–893, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; descriptors. The drawback of this approach is that the performance can be easily affected by background clutter and occlusions.

===Part-based detection===
Pedestrians are modeled as collections of parts. Part hypotheses are firstly generated by learning local features, which include edgelet&lt;ref&gt;Bo Wu and Ram Nevatia, "Detection of Multiple, Partially Occluded Humans in a Single Image by Bayesian Combination of Edgelet Part Detectors", ''IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision'' (ICCV), pages 1:90–97, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and orientation features.&lt;ref&gt;Mikolajczyk, K. and Schmid, C. and Zisserman, A. "Human detection based on a probabilistic assembly of robust part detectors", ''The European Conference on Computer Vision'' (ECCV), volume 3021/2004, pages 69–82, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; These part hypotheses are then joined to form the best assembly of existing pedestrian hypotheses. Though this approach is attractive, part detection itself is a difficult task. Implementation of this approach follows a standard procedure for processing the image data that consists of first creating a densely sampled image pyramid, computing features at each scale, performing classification at all possible locations, and finally performing non-maximal suppression to generate the final set of bounding boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Hyunggi Cho, Paul E. Rybski, Aharon Bar-Hillel and Wende Zhang "Real-time Pedestrian Detection with Deformable Part Models"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch-based detection===
Recently Leibe et al.&lt;ref&gt;B.Leibe, E. Seemann, and B. Schiele. "Pedestrian detection in crowded scenes" ''IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition''(CVPR), pages 1:878–885, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an approach combining both the detection and segmentation with the name Implicit Shape Model (ISM). A codebook of local appearance is learned during the training process. In the detecting process, extracted local features are used to match against the codebook entries, and each match casts one vote for the pedestrian hypotheses. Final detection results can be obtained by further refining those hypotheses. The advantage of this approach is only a small number of training images are required.

===Motion-based detection===
When the conditions permit (fixed camera, stationary lighting conditions, etc.), [[background subtraction]] can help to detect pedestrians. Background subtraction classifies the pixels of video streams as either background, where no motion is detected, or foreground, where motion is detected. This procedure highlights the silhouettes (the connected components in the foreground) of every moving element in the scene, including people. An algorithm has been developed,&lt;ref&gt;O. Barnich, S. Jodogne, and M. Van Droogenbroeck. "Robust analysis of silhouettes by morphological size distributions" ''Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems''(ACIVS), pages 734–745, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Piérard, A. Lejeune, and M. Van Droogenbroeck. "A probabilistic pixel-based approach to detect humans in video streams" ''IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing''(ICASSP), pages 921–924, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[university of Liège]], to analyze the shape of these silhouettes in order to detect the humans. Since the methods that consider the silhouette as a whole and perform a single classification are, in general, highly sensitive to shape defects, a part-based method splitting the silhouettes in a set of smaller regions has been proposed to decrease the influence of defects. To the contrary of other part-based approaches, these regions do not have any anatomical meaning. This algorithm has been extended to the detection of humans in 3D video streams.&lt;ref&gt;S. Piérard, A. Lejeune, and M. Van Droogenbroeck. "3D information is valuable for the detection of humans in video streams" ''Proceedings of 3D Stereo MEDIA'', pages 1–4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection using multiple cameras===
Fleuret et al.&lt;ref&gt;F. Fleuret, J. Berclaz, R. Lengagne and P. Fua, Multi-Camera People Tracking with a Probabilistic Occupancy Map, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 30, Nr. 2, pp. 267–282, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested a method for integrating multiple calibrated cameras for detecting multiple pedestrians. In this approach,  The ground plane is partitioned into uniform, non-overlapping grid cells, typically with size of 25 by 25 (cm). The detector produces a Probability Occupancy Map (POM), it provides an estimation of the probability of each grid cell to be occupied by a person. Given two to four synchronized video streams taken at eye level and from different angles, this method can effectively combine a generative model with dynamic programming to accurately follow up to six individuals across thousands of frames in spite of significant occlusions and lighting changes. It can also derive metrically accurate trajectories for each one of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78019">[[File:San Francisco graft prosecutors.jpg|thumb|The "Big Four" graft prosecutors (left to right) Francis J. Heney, William J. Burns, Fremont Older and Rudolph Spreckels.]]The '''San Francisco graft trials''' were a series of attempts from 1905 to 1908 to prosecute members of the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]], San Francisco Mayor [[Eugene Schmitz]], attorney [[Abe Ruef]], who were receiving bribes, and business owners who were paying the bribes. Political boss and attorney Ruef was at the center of the corruption, acting as attorney to Mayor [[Eugene Schmitz]]. He approved all contracts and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payment from business owners, keeping a portion for himself and distributing the remainder to the Mayor and members of the Board of Supervisors.

Former mayor James Phelan along with banker Rudolph Spreckels and editor [[Fremont Older]] of the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'' asked United States District Attorney [[Francis J. Heney|Francis Heney]], fresh from a successful stint as special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General's office in prosecuting the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]], to help put an end to the corruption. Heney charged Ruef and Schmitz with numerous counts of bribery and brought them to trial. Heney rejected a juror because he was an ex-con and publicly accused Ruef of trying to plant him on the jury. During the trial, the rejected juror shot Heney in the face, but Heney survived. The juror was found dead in jail the next morning, and many suspected Ruef and his allies of complicity in his death. Some members of the public thought that Sheriff William Biggy was negligent, and when he fell off a boat late one night and drowned, some thought it may have been suicide, but others thought he may have been murdered.

Ruef's trial was eventually brought to a successful close by Assistant District Attorney [[Hiram Johnson]] and after several appeals Ruef served four years in [[San Quentin Prison]]. While there he wrote a series of tell-all columns for Older's ''Bulletin'' newspaper implicating a number of companies, executives, and public officials. Mayor Schmitz was found guilty, jailed, and then released and retried, but did not serve any time. All of the business owners and supervisors implicated received immunity for their testimony about Ruef's and Schmitz's complicity and were not arrested or charged. When new District Attorney Fisker, a former athlete, was elected, he stopped the investigations and all further prosecutions.

== Background ==

During the first decade of the 20th Century in the United States, employers supported an [[open shop|open shop movement]] and were decidedly anti-union. They were able to obtain government support to prevent workers from organizing. California was a center of corruption at the time, indirectly influenced by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] which had exerted a large degree of control over California politics for many years. This is evidenced by the refusal of Stephen T. Gage, one of the directors of the Southern Pacific Railway, and Richard Chute, a salaried employee of the same company, to obey a summons from the 1891 Wallace Grand Jury until compelled by the California State Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the Causes of Municipal Corruption in San Francisco, as Disclosed by the Investigations of the Oliver Grand Jury, and the Prosecution of Certain Persons for Bribery and Other Offenses Against the State.|url=http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist5/graft1.html|publisher=Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco|date=January 5, 1910|accessdate=13 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030627105900/http://www.sfmuseum.net/hist5/graft1.html|archivedate=27 June 2003|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These companies and other well-funded interest groups and individuals used their economic power and influence to form trusts and monopolies that guaranteed them power. Many of these wealthy and powerful people lived in San Francisco, the largest port on the West Coast, and when necessary could reinforce their hold on power through corrupt politicians and city bosses.&lt;ref name=sfmuseum/&gt;

=== Powerful unions ===

[[File:SF Waterfront Workers 1901.jpg|thumb|Workers on the San Francisco waterfront in 1901.]]

In the spring of 1901, San Francisco employers made a decision to try to push back gains made by the trade unions during the previous two years. They formed a secret [[employers' association]].&lt;ref name=ladd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladd|first=Thomas|title=Arming Goons: Mayor Phelan Arms the Strikebreakers in the 1901 City Front Strike|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_XVI,_2007/ladd_t.pdf|work=Ex Post Facto|accessdate=4 June 2013|volume=XVI|number=2006-2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232128/http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_XVI,_2007/ladd_t.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its bylaws stipulated that no member could settle a strike by a union without permission from the executive committee.&lt;ref name=carlssonbloody/&gt;&lt;ref name=carlssonlabor&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlsson|first=Chris|title=1901 Labor War|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=1901_Labor_War|accessdate=4 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200920/http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=1901_Labor_War|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginning of strike ==

In January 1901, members of [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Local 6 went on strike, demanding an increase from $5.00 to $6.00 a day (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5|1901}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|6|1901}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). On April 1, laundry workers walked out, also seeking a wage increases and an eight-hour work day. Within the month, most San Francisco laundries accepted their demands, although laundries outside San Francisco continued to resist complying.&lt;ref name=carlssonbloody&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlsson|first=Chris|title=Bloody Tuesday|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Bloody_Tuesday|accessdate=6 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200051/http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Bloody_Tuesday|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 6,000 of the Cooks' and Waiters' Union walked out, demanding one day off per week, a ten-hour work day, and a union shop in all city restaurants. They were joined by the Carriage Makers union and journeymen butchers, and on May 20, the [[International Association of Machinists]] announced a nationwide strike.&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt;

To counter the success of the unions, the secret Employers' Association hired an attorney, M.F. Michael, who was initially their sole visible face. He announced in an interview published on May 10, 1901, that the employers were unalterably opposed to a [[closed shop]] and they would not negotiate that point. The Employers' Association received up to $500,000 in anonymous donations and used their financial muscle to threaten to cut off supplies to anyone who broke ranks.&lt;ref name=ratliff&gt;{{cite web|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|title=Employers' Association|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Employers%27_Association|publisher=San Francisco Virtual Museum|accessdate=7 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015011838/http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Employers%27_Association|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next two days, 500 women telephone operators and 1,500 streetcar operators also went on strike.&lt;ref name=carlssonbloody/&gt; On May 7, 1907, what would later be called "Bloody Tuesday", six streetcars carrying armed guards attempted to leave the [[San Francisco cable car system#Car barn, power house and museum|carbarn]]. An enraged mob threw rocks and bricks, gunfight erupts between guards and men shooting from nearby vacant lots. From inside carbarns, strikebreakers opened fire on crowd. Two dead, 20 wounded.&lt;ref name=carlssonbloody/&gt;

The contract for handling the baggage for attendees of a national convention of the [[Epworth League]] in San Francisco was given to a non-union company. During the prior year, a union company was hired during another convention in San Francisco to handle the baggage, but many attendees did not receive their luggage until they were ready to leave town. Tens of thousands of attendees were projected to attend, and the Drayman's Association was hoping to avoid a similarly embarrassing episode. However, the non-union company given the contract was unable to fulfill its obligations and sought the assistance of firm controlled by the newly organized [[Teamsters|Brotherhood of Teamsters]]. The union refused to work on a job with non-union men.&lt;ref name=bean&gt;{{cite book|last=Bean|first=Walton|title=Boss Ruef's San Francisco: the Story of the Union Labor Party, Big Business, and the Graft Prosecution|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520000940}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p15}} In response, the Draymen's Association, under pressure from the Employers' Association, [[lock out|locked out]] the city's unionized teamsters on July 21.&lt;ref name="foner"&gt;{{cite book|first=Philip S. |last= Foner |work=History of the Labor Movement in the United States |volume=3 |title=The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900–1905. |location= New York |publisher= International Publishers |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p287}} They were hoping to break the power of the teamsters' union.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Fearing that the teamsters' union would be crushed, the San Francisco Labor Council directed the City Front Federation, led by its President Andrew Furuseth,&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt; including the city's 14 [[sea|maritime]] unions, the Sailor's Union of the Pacific, the longshoremen's unions to [[sympathy strike|strike]] in support of the locked out teamsters.&lt;ref name="foner"/&gt;{{rp|p288}} A total of about 16,000 [[longshoreman|longshoremen]], clerks, packers, and warehouse workers on both sides of [[San Francisco Bay]] joined the work stoppage, further increasing the tense situation.&lt;ref name="foner" /&gt;{{rp|p288}} The lockout spread to the entire waterfront, which shut down much of the Bay Area's transportation and as a result most commerce.&lt;ref name="foner" /&gt;{{rp|p287}}

[[File:SF Teamster Scab Police Escort.jpg|thumb|A strikebreaking teamster is escorted by a San Francisco policeman during the strike of 1901. On the side of the wagon is the name of the company, McNab &amp; Smith.]]

=== Mayor arms strikebreakers ===
Both sides refused to compromise on their stance for a closed or an open shop.&lt;ref name=ladd /&gt; Both accused the other of conspiracy and aggressive tactics, further aggravating tensions and confusing the public.&lt;ref name=bean/&gt;{{rp|p16}} During July, regional produce was ready to be shipped, and the employers hired [[strikebreaker]]s. Democratic Mayor [[James D. Phelan]], who had served three consecutive terms, designated the employers' strikebreakers as "special deputies", allowing them to wear badges, bear arms, and carry clubs, and told the police to protect the strikebreakers. Farmers grew frustrated when their wheat stood on the docks and began to load and move their own crops. Former Army teamsters, returning from the [[Philippine–American War|war in the Philippines]], gladly filled the available strikebreaking jobs, and university students from the [[University of California]] took jobs.

The employers' strikebreakers were met by the unions with force and the employers called for police intervention. The strikers threw rocks at the strikebreakers and marbles under the feet of the horses pulling the carts.&lt;ref name=myrow&gt;{{cite web|last=Myrow|first=Rachel|title=Labor Day Special: The San Francisco Waterfront Strike of 1901|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2012/08/31/labor-day-special-the-san-francisco-waterfront-strike-of-1901/|accessdate=4 June 2013|date=August 31, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926211324/http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2012/08/31/labor-day-special-the-san-francisco-waterfront-strike-of-1901/|archivedate=26 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor's actions did nothing to stop the violence and inflamed the union leadership. They accused the strikebreakers of routine brutality and violence. Mayor Phelan had been elected in large measure due to the support of organized labor but now he sided with the employers. At a meeting in his office, he refused to withdraw the policemen from the waterfront. In anger, labor attendees falsely reported that Phelan told them, "If you don't want to be clubbed, get back to work."&lt;ref name=hichborn /&gt; His attitude further enraged the labor leadership.&lt;ref name=ladd /&gt;

=== Strike broken ===

On September 29, after four months of strikes and increased violence, a bloody riot and gun battle broke out on Kearny Street in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=carlssonlabor/&gt; The employers' strikebreakers attacked the union blockade. Picketing workers were clubbed, five workers were shot and killed, and 336 were injured. Hundreds more were arrested and the strike was broken.&lt;ref name="foner" /&gt;{{rp|p288}} On October 3, California Governor [[Henry T. Gage]] stepped in and threatened all parties with the imposition of [[martial law]]. He convened a meeting of the Drayman's Association and the Teamsters Union, eliminating the employers association. The terms of the settlement were never made public, but the result was that the employers were able to retain an open shop, though they could not exclude members of the union.&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt; The employers' association, flush with success, soon disbanded.&lt;ref name=bean/&gt;

== Union Labor Party formed ==

Anticipating defeat, on September 5, 1901, about 300 delegates representing 68 of San Francisco's unions met at a convention and established the [[Union Labor Party (California)|Union Labor Party]] of the City and County of San Francisco.&lt;ref name="foner"/&gt;{{rp|p290}} The convention approved a [[Party platform|platform]] including a call for the revision of the [[city charter]] to curb future intervention by the city administration in labor disputes, a demand for [[municipal ownership]] of all [[public utility|public utilities]], building more schools, promoting teachers based on merit, and ending the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]].&lt;ref name="foner" /&gt;{{rp|p290}} The platform also contained a [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] demand that called for restricting Asian immigration and creating [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] schools for Asian children.&lt;ref name="foner"/&gt;{{rp|p290}} Some organized labor, including the State Building Trades Council led by P.H. McCarthy, refused to join the new labor party.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

=== Ruef backs mayoral candidate ===

[[File:Abe Ruef 1907-08.jpg|thumb|Lawyer [[Abe Ruef]] was the political boss behind the graft at the center of the prosecution.]]

[[File:James D. Phelan - Mayor of SF 1910.jpg|thumb|S.F. Mayor [[James D. Phelan|James Phelan]] lost his fourth contest for the office to Musician's Union President Eugene Schmitz. ]]

[[Abe Ruef]] was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for a number of years when it was generally seen as the party of the Southern Pacific Railroad and its allies. Ruef patiently built a patronage empire over several years. He methodically sought out neighborhood associations, ethnic clubs, and other civic groups, supporting them with contributions and payments, and providing services like leniency from a local judge and quick approval of a business license.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; Ruef competed with Michael Casey, president of the Teamsters Union, for control of the union, but eventually ceded the contest, but not his influence, to Casey.&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt;

[[Eugene Schmitz]] played the violin, conducted the orchestra at the Columbia Theatre on Powell Street in San Francisco, and was president of the [[American Federation of Musicians|Musician's Union]]. He and Ruef had been friends for 15 years.&lt;ref name=waldorf&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldorf|first=Delores|title=S.F.

Once the strike was concluded, Mayor Phelan found he had no friends and was forced to drop out of the race. The Republicans nominated Asa R. Wells and the Democrats chose Joseph A. Tobin. The local citizens supported the Union Labor Party because they felt it was more sensitive to their needs even though the elected officials were enormously corrupt, and Schmitz was narrowly elected on November 7, 1901,&lt;ref name = Thomas&gt;{{Citation | last =Thomas | first = Gordon | last2 =Witts| first2 =Max Morgan| title = The San Francisco Earthquake | place= New York, London | publisher =Stein and Day, Souvenir Press, Dell | year =1971 | isbn=978-0-8128-1360-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|195}} winning 21,776 of the 52,168 votes cast; the Republicans and Democrats split the remainder, allowing Schmitz to take office.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt; Although the labor party only won three of the Board of Supervisors' seats,&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt; they managed to control many of the city commissions due to appointments made by the mayor.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p17}} With union control of the mayor's office, San Francisco became the first union-run city in the United States.&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt;

=== Ruef controls city contracts ===

Schmitz was less corrupt than the mayors who preceded him,&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt; but he had to deal with Ruef, who operated from his offices at California and Kearney Streets. He wrote most of the mayor's official papers and conducted an ongoing series of meetings with Mayor Schmitz, city commissioners, officials, seekers of favors or jobs, and others. Officially an unpaid attorney for the mayor's office, he was the power behind the mayor's chair.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt;

The first company to seek his advice was the Theodore Halsey, a confidential political agent for the [[Pacific Bell|Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company]]. He paid Ruef a [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] of $1,250 (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1250|1901|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) a month for "advice" on municipal issues. After the graft prosecutions, E.F. Pillsbury, General Counsel for the telephone company, revealed that he had never heard of Ruef's employment, and would have objected to Ruef receiving compensation greater than his own $1,000 per month.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

Many others followed suit, hiring him even when they had no need for his legal services. Company's payments to Ruef varied depending on the favor wanted, from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; If you wanted a city permit or contract, you had to go through one man, Ruef.&lt;ref name=myrow/&gt;

Ruef pocketed half and passed the balance to the Mayor and his ally on the Board of Supervisors, James L. Gallagher. Gallagher then divided the amount he received among their loyal Supervisors. When a decision needed to be made, Ruef would meet with the Supervisors privately beforehand and even suggest statements they might make to give the appearance of independent action.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; Schmitz ran for re-election in 1903 although the Union Labor Party still failed to win a majority of the Board of Supervisors.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

=== Supervisors seek payoffs ===

Among the cases of graft was the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company]], who had completed consolidating the gas, light and power companies in San Francisco and in all of central California into a single entity. Frank G. Drum, one of the new company's largest stockholders, paid Ruef a confidential retainer of $1,000 a month.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; The Board of Supervisors, all members of the Union Labor party, had before the election called for rolling the gas rate from $1.00 per 1000 cubic feet back to 75¢. On April 2, shortly before the Supervisors were to vote on the rate change, a fire destroyed a major electrical [[Electrical substation|substation]] at 22nd Ave. and Georgia St.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric Light and Power House Destroyed Last Night -- Five Firemen Injured, One at Least Fatally -- The Loss is Estimated at $2,500,000.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A_1eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T2INAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6087,2659060&amp;dq=san+francisco+ruef+trial+begins&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=Evening Tribune|date=Apr 3, 1907|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211150353/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A_1eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T2INAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6087,2659060&amp;dq=san+francisco+ruef+trial+begins&amp;hl=en|archivedate=11 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruef decided to seek an 85¢ rate, but several Supervisors wanted additional reasons to support the change. Ruef asked Drum for $20,000, which Drum delivered soon afterward in cash.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; The Supervisors approved an 85 cent gas rate, though some voted against the proposal.

Another instance was a group of investors led by [[William Henry Crocker|William H. Crocker]], son of [[Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|Big Four]] [[Charles Crocker]] and president of [[Crocker National Bank|The Crocker Bank]]. They organized the Parkside Realty Co. in July, 1905, and assembled a {{convert|400|acre}} parcel of land on the western edge of the city, five blocks across and 20 blocks long, stretching to within a block and a half of the Pacific Ocean. Before they could begin building homes, they needed approval for a streetcar franchise. They wanted to build a mile-long [[tram|streetcar]] line that connected to the existing United Railroad's line on the south side of [[Golden Gate Park]]. The extension would allow residents of the future subdivision to easily travel to the city center.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt;

The Parkside Realty Co. was unable to persuade the Supervisors to support their streetcar project. The Supervisors wanted their cut, and the company finally held a secret banquet, not publicly revealed until 1910, to seek the supervisors' support. Supervisor Dr. Charles Boxton asked, "How much money is in it for us?"  The investors agreed to pay Ruef $30,000 for two years. The Supervisors approved the requested trolley franchise, although Ruef never passed any funds to the supervisors. The remaining payment was later halted by the graft prosecution, and only $15,000 was ever handed over.&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt;

[[Image:Tirey_L._Ford_220.jpg|thumb|200px|Tirey L. Ford]]
By about 1900, half of the streetcar lines in San Francisco had been converted to overhead trolley routes, but a great many favored placing the power lines in underground conduits which was considerably more expensive. Eastern investors led by [[Patrick Calhoun]] took over the system, inheriting a number of lines built by a variety of competing companies over many years.&lt;ref name="cablecarmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cablecarmuseum.org/archive/8c/8c.htm |title=The Eight Original San Francisco Cable Car Companies |publisher=Cable Car Museum |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016184718/http://cablecarmuseum.org/archive/8c/8c.htm |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, the system had {{convert|234|mi}} of track, {{convert|56|mi}} of [[cable car (railway)|cable]], {{convert|166|mi}} of overhead trolley, {{convert|4|mi}} for horse cars, and {{convert|8|mi}} of ancient [[steam railroad]]. United Railroad was dead set against paying for underground conduit. 

In 1902, [[Tirey L. Ford]], who was the Attorney General of the State of California, began making regular, secret payments for United Railroads to Abe Ruef to act as their special consulting attorney. On September 15, 1902, Ford resigned as Attorney General and accepted the position of [[General Counsel]] to United Railroads.&lt;ref name=henderson&gt;{{cite web|title=Tirey Lafayette Ford, 1857–1928|url=http://www.hendersonfamilytree.com/Tirey_Ford.html|publisher=Henderson Family  Tree|accessdate=17 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112052032/http://www.hendersonfamilytree.com/Tirey_Ford.html|archivedate=12 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was found to be innocent by a San Francisco jury and by the District Court of Appeals Judge [[William P. Lawlor]].

== Leading citizens seek help ==

[[File:Francis j heney.png|thumb|U.S. District Attorney [[Francis J. Heney|Francis Heney]] was asked by leading businessmen to help end the corruption. ]]

The ongoing corruption began to affect the quality of public services, and citizens began to seek reform. A [[Grand Jury]] was convened, and began to take testimony about extent of the graft.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p18}} Former Mayor Phelan, in concert with Rudolph Spreckels, president of the San Francisco First National Bank, and Fremont Older, editor of the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'', decided to try to challenge the Labor Party's corrupt choke-hold on city politics and commerce.&lt;ref name=ladd/&gt;  Phelan and Spreckles were among the largest property-owners in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p38}}

They approached [[Francis J. Heney|Francis Heney]], who as Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General's office, had just concluded a successful prosecution of corrupt government officials in the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]]. Heney came to San Francisco and in one of his first public statements, made a speech on November 5, 1905, the day before the election. He said, "If I had control of the District Attorney's office, I would indict Abe Ruef for felony and send him to the penitentiary, where he belongs, for I have personal knowledge that he is corrupt."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p19}} Ruef didn't sit still for Heney's allegations, and responded in the newspaper two days later. "In making the statement that you personally know that I am corrupt you lied. You cannot personally know that which does not exist.... You show the same courage which put a bullet into the body of Dr. [[John C. Handy]] of Tucson, Ariz. in 1891, for whose killing you were indicted for murder, and upon trial were acquitted because you were the only witness to the deed."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p20}}

=== 1905 election ===

In 1905, the labor party was heavily opposed by the three local newspapers and a united Republican-Democrat combined ticket who had united to defeat the union party.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p17}} On November 7, Schmitz was re-elected and the union gained complete control of the [[Board of Supervisors]].&lt;ref name=carlsson/&gt; Of the 80,000 registered voters, only 68,878 voted for mayor and of those, 40,191 voted for Schmitz.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p20}} Members of the Board of Supervisors had no prior political experience. L.A. Rea had been in the decorating business; W.W. Sanderson had been a well-placed executive in the grocery business; Samuel Davis was a drummer; Edward Walsh a foreman in a shoe factory; C.J. Harrington and Patrick McCusshin had both been saloon-keepers; Jennings Phillips, a sprinter; F.P. Nicholas, a carpenter and former Carpenter's union president; James Kelley, a piano finisher and polisher; Max Manlock, an electrician; Thomas Longergan, a baker; Charles Dexter, a dentist; Michael Coffey, a [[Hackney carriage|hack]] driver; Daniel Coleman, a clerk with a wallpaper dealer; John J. Purri, a blacksmith; and Gallagher was a lawyer.&lt;ref name=bostont/&gt; Ruef had effective control over every branch and department in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p21}}

After the 1905 election, Ruef conducted a private, weekly caucus on Sunday, the night before the Board of Supervisors meetings, for members of the board, Mayor Schmitz, and the board's clerk and Ruef's protege and former law clerk, George B. Keane. Ruef ran the meetings and Keane took notes as they discussed matters to come before the board. Ruef assembled a list of members to serve on the various board committees which were implemented almost without changes. Ruef directed them to meet with him first before they held any other public meetings.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p25}} There was only one weak link in Ruef's complete domination of the city administration, and that was the new District Attorney William H. Langdon, who had been Superintendent of Schools for three years. During the election, Langdon repeatedly promised, "The laws are on the statute books. I pledge myself to the enforcement of those laws," but few paid much attention to his statements. Ruef thought Langdon would help reach the teachers and students.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p28}}

Older's newspaper, the ''Bulletin'', which had been Ruef's most vociferous opponent, suffered greatly after the election. Ruef had promised to break the newspaper with libel suits, but he resorted to more crude methods. The newspaper's manager was assaulted and beaten, as were carriers and agents. The newsboys were organized into a union who promptly went out on strike. Deliveries to stores were interrupted or followed by stones through the windows. The police did nothing.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p73}} Older met with Heney in Washington D.C., and persuaded him to come to San Francisco and meet with Spreckels and himself.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p76}}

In February 1906, Langdon astonished many in the labor party and city politics when he initiated a raid on gambling dens across the city. The underworld running the games expected to be raided and closed down before an election, not afterward, and the exact opposite had taken place in San Francisco. They felt they had paid protection money under false pretenses. Ruef was unable to persuade Langdon to desist.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p27}} A few honest citizens began to believe the Ruef's ironclad grip on city politics could be broken.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p28}}

During the meeting in March, 1906, Spreckles and Older each promised to give $5,000 to support his efforts, and to raise another $90,000 to finance his efforts.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p76}}  When Heney expressed interest, Older went to [[Washington, D. C.]] and persuaded [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] to loan special federal prosecutor Heney to the San Francisco District Attorneys office. Roosevelt agreed.  In that meeting Heney offered to accept as his fee whatever was left out of the initial $100,000 fund, stating "But I don't there will be anything left and I will put up my time against your money."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p76}} In the end, Heney didn't receive any compensation for his work, and in fact gave up lucrative legal work to stay with the prosecution.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p76}}

On March 10, the Board of Supervisors granted the Home Telegraph Company a 50-year exclusive franchise to provide phone dial service to San Francisco, an act that brought immediate condemnation from the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''. They reminded the board in an editorial that their election platform had included the city acquiring its own telephone system. The Examiner wrote that the board "should clear the record of the SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES&lt;!-- sic --&gt; that surround the vote on the matter."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p43}}

=== Railroad franchise bribery ===

By the time of the November, 1905 election, the United Railroad was embroiled in a bitter fight with Rudolph Spreckels and James Phelan who resisted overhead trolly lines along Sutter Street where they owned property.&lt;ref name=carlssonurr&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlsson|first=Carl|title=United Railroads|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=United_Railroads|accessdate=5 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014200035/http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=United_Railroads|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calhoun tried to buy their support by promising more parks and improvements along the Golden Gate Park Panhandle, where ex-Mayor Phelan owned a great deal of property, but both men continued to oppose the overhead trolley plan and insist on more expensive underground conduits.&lt;ref name=carlssonurr/&gt; They believed the overhead lines would be noisy, unsightly, and a fire hazard. He and others felt that San Francisco, like Washington D.C. and New York, merited an underground system.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p33}}

Ford, representing Calhoun and United Railroad, upped is monthly retainer to Ruef from $500 to $1000 (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500|1905|r=-3}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1905|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) after the 1905 election, and the two sides finally agreed on a deal that called for the company to pay for ornamental street poles and the electric lights along their trolley routes.

A majority of the local citizens and community improvement associations also preferred undergrounding the trolley car power lines, supported by Municipal engineers who had visited several east coast cities and concluded that an underground conduit was more favorable than overhead trolley lines.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p33}} The railroad resisted, publicly stating that the believed the conduits would fill with water. When Spreckels offered to pay for the cost of draining an underground conduit for a test period to prove it was feasible, Calhoun, President, and George P. Chapman, General Manager of the United Railroads, refused.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p39}} Calhoun even offered to pay what he estimated to be the cost difference the underground and overhead systems to the city for any purpose they desired.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p41}}

United Railroads was actually resistant to the upfront cost for undergrounding the power lines, more than twice that of the overhead system, which would take much longer to recover from operating income. Ford offered Ruef an additional $50,000 fee that Ruef turned down, insisting on a larger payment. They ultimately agreed on a $200,000 fee to be paid when work was complete, which meant that the supervisors approved their trolly route with overhead trolly lines. To bring further pressure on Calhoun, James Phelan, George Whittell, Rudolph Spreckels, his father [[Claus Spreckels]], and Charles S. Wheeler filed papers on April 17, 1906 to incorporate the Municipal Street Railways of San Francisco, in order to prove that underground conduits were economical and superior, and to bring pressure to bear on Calhoun to give up his resistance to undergrounding the electrical lines.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p17}} Their actions generated immediate public support. Calhoun finally proposed to submit the issue to a referendum vote by the people, but it turned out he meant the Board of Supervisors, whose vote Calhoun knew he could count on.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p44}} He wrote a letter saying that he would submit the matter "to the proper authorities of the city" was resented by the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', who condemned it as breathing "the spirit of insolence" and containing "ill-concealed menace."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p4}}

=== Earthquake slows prosecution ===
{{main|1906 San Francisco earthquake}}
[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|Damage from the San Francisco earthquake slowed the prosecution for a few months.]]
On April 18, 1906, the city was struck by a [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|massive earthquake]], and fires burned for four days, destroying 80 percent of the city. Mayor Schmitz formed an extra-legal [[Committee of Fifty (1906)|Committee of Fifty]] that was tasked with managing the city during the crisis that followed, which delayed the graft prosecution for a short time. Four days later, crews from the United Railroad began stringing temporary overhead trolley wires on Market St., but did not repair the cable traction system in the street.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p20}}

=== Committee of Fifty established ===

On the day of the earthquake, Wednesday, April 18, Mayor Schmitz invited a cross section of the city's most prominent businessmen, politicians, civic leaders, entrepreneurs, newspaper men and politicians, but none of the members of the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]] or Abraham Ruef, to form the [[Committee of Fifty (1906)|Committee of Fifty]] to help him manage the crisis.

Members of the Committee included individuals that would later be indicted for graft, including Abe Ruef and Tirey L. Ford.

The Committee was also referred to as Committee of Safety, Citizens' Committee of Fifty, or Relief and Restoration Committee of Law and Order. It first assembled the afternoon of the earthquake in the basement of the ruined Hall of Justice at 3 p.m. It was forced by the approaching fire to abandon the location and moved across [[Portsmouth Square]] to the Plaza Hotel. They had to abandon that location only two hours later. At 8 p.m. the Committee assembled at the [[The Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]]'s ballroom, sitting along the edge of the stage and on packing cases. At this point, they set up 19 subcommittees, and shortly after 11 p.m., they dispersed.

The Fairmont Hotel burned down that night, and on Thursday, April 19, the Committee met at 6 a.m.  at the North End police station. Once again, the spreading fires forced them to move, and the group reconvened at 2 p.m. at Franklin Hall, which became known as Temporary City Hall. [[Abe Ruef]] appeared At 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and although he had not been called as a member, he offered his services, which Mayor Schmitz accepted. Ruef became chairman of an additional sub-committee, trying unsuccessfully to relocate the Chinese to the margins of the city.

Until the earthquake struck, San Francisco was the most prominent and prosperous city in the state. Funds cleared through San Francisco banks increased 80 percent between 1900 and 1905. The city had grown from 342,782 in 1900 to an estimated 500,000 by 1906. San Francisco was one of the most promising places for investment in all of the United States. Many companies were vying for a piece of the money to be made. The Home Telephone Company financed by investors from Southern California and Ohio was trying to wrest the telephone franchise held exclusively by Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p31}} The Spring Valley Water Company, backed by Ruef, successfully blocked consideration of [[Hetch Hetchy]] as a source of water for the growing city. Ruef believed he and the city administrators stood to  receive as much as $1,000,000 from the Spring Valley deal.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p32}}

On May 14, 1906, Supervisors gave United Railroads permission to string overhead trolley wires on Market St. The next day the ''[[San Francisco Examiner|Examiner]]'' accused United Railroads of exploiting the disaster to push through its overhead trolley franchise. Mayor Schmitz said the approval was only temporary, but that did not prove to be true.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p20}} Supervisor Gallagher later testified during Ruef's trial that he told Ruef that board members would accept $4,000 as payment to approve the overhead trolley lines.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p50}} United Railroads proceeded to install overhead power on all of its lines, even those cable car lines that were still operational after the earthquake and fire, without paying anything to the city for its franchise.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p58}} The Home Telephone Company contributed $75,000 to a relief fund for the city, but asked that it be held until their franchise was approved.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p51}}

Graft extended to the ordinary police officer on the beat. On April 24, 1907, the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' published a tally of fees illegal operations were expected to pay. Brothels paid officers on the street $5 per week, sergeants $15, captains $25, and the Police Chief $75 to $100 each week. This schedule also extended to gambling houses and saloons that offered prostitutes.

[[William J. Burns]], a former [[Secret Service Agent]]&lt;ref name=nytimes1113/&gt; who had assisted Heney during the prosecution of the Oregon land graft scandal, was hired to assist Heney. He quietly began gathering evidence in June, 1906.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p78}}

=== Heney initiates prosecution ===

Spreckels was so eager to remove Schmitz from office, that on May 10, 1906, he told Heney he would obtain the funds necessary to underwrite the costs of prosecuting members of the Schmitz Administration for graft. He and Older encouraged San Francisco [[District Attorney]] William H. Langdon to support their efforts to end the corruption. While the union thought that Langdon would support their cause, he held firm to his principles. On October 21, 1906, he published a statement saying he intended to convene a [[Grand Jury]] to investigate the rise in crime and the widely reported instances of corruption.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p71}}

On October 24, 1906, Langdon appointed Heney as an assistant district attorney. The grand jury was scheduled to convene on October 26.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p87}} Mayor Schmitz was traveling in Europe, so the next day James L. Gallagher, chairman of the board of supervisors and acting mayor, acting at the behest of [[Abe Ruef]], suspended Langdon for alleged "neglect of office". His motion at the board of supervisors meeting was read and adopted without debate or opposition.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p88}} As requested by Ruef, the primary targets of the investigation, Gallagher appointed him as acting district attorney. Ruef then attempted to fire Heney, writing him a curt note, "You are hereby removed from the position of Assistant District Attorney of the City and County of San Francisco." Heney rebuffed Ruef's action, saying he did not recognize Ruef as district attorney.

Heney filed a temporary restraining motion before Superior Court Judge Seawell to bar Ruef from acting as district attorney, who granted it at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the next morning.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p89}} The judge ordered a police officer and two deputy sheriffs installed in the District Attorney's office to prevent Ruef from occupying it. All three city newspapers soundly condemned Ruef's transparent attempt to scuttle the investigation and prosecution. The ''Examiner'' called their actions "the last stand of criminals hunted and driven to bay." The ''Bulletin'' headline read, "Ruef's Illegal Action is Confession of Guilt."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p91}} In early November, Judge Seawell ruled that the injunction prohibiting Ruef from replacing Langdon as district attorney would stand.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p91}}
[[File:Tirey-L-Ford.jpg|thumb|[[Tirey L. Ford]] was California State Attorney General when he began making secret payments to Abe Ruef on behalf of United Railroads.]]
On October 28, Tirey Ford, the general counsel for United Railroads, told the ''San Francisco Examiner'', "Of course there was no bribery nor offer to bribe, nor was there anything done except upon clean and legitimate lines."&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p109}} Ironically, Ford had been appointed to the State Board of Prison Directors in 1905, a position he maintained throughout the time charges were pending against him.&lt;ref name=bean2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bean|first=Walton|title=Boss Ruef's San Francisco : the story of the Union Labor Party, big business, and the graft prosecution|year=1974|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520000940|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grand jury convenes ==

The grand jury was impaneled at the temporary court set up in Temple Israel, at 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 26, 1906, as Langdon had promised, and with Langdon still officially in office. Hundreds of people tried to attend the proceedings, and the police packed the courtroom with Ruef supporters, allowing only a few supporters of the prosecution. Outside, the largest percentage of those present cheered the arrival of Langdon, Heney, and Spreckels. Ruef appeared guarded by two police officers.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p08}}

The grand jury heard testimony about "French Restaurants" in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco that supplied both food and "private supper bedrooms" for their patrons and prostitutes.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p65}} When the police commission acted in January 1905 to close down all such establishments, they were advised to call on Ruef. Ruef was a nightly patron of one of the establishments, known as the "Pup," owned by Jean Loupy. The several restaurants paid Ruef a "retainer" of $8,000 (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|8000|1905|r=-3}}}} today), half of which he gave to Mayor Schmitz, who had advised the police commissioner to close them down in the first place. Ruef appeared before the Police Commission and proposed a method for regulating the French  Restaurants, none of which affected the way they had already been operating, and his regulations were approved.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p116}}

After only two weeks of testimony, the grand jury returned indictments on November 15 against Schmitz and Ruef on five counts each of extortion. Ruef initially refused to stand when the indictments were read, and when required to stand, insolently stood with his back to the judge.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p122}} Ruef publicly denounced the indictments, insisting that he had merely accepted fees in return for services. "I was simply acting in the relation of attorney to a client." Schmitz, who had been vacationing in Europe, turned around and headed home for San Francisco.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p120}} Both men were arraigned on December 6, and it became apparent that their strategy would start with a fight to evade or postpone trial by attacking the validity of the grand jury.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p123}}

=== Court convenes ===

For three days the defense attorneys challenged members of the grand jury, but Judge Dunne finally swept aside all of their technical objections. The defense then tried to convince the judge that Spreckels had personal motives in paying the costs of Heney's prosecution, and then they attacked Langdon's motives for hiring Heney. This lasted until January 22, when Dunne once again set aside all of the defense's motions.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p125}} The defense then tried to get the case moved from Dunne's court, without success. Congressman [[Julius Kahn (congressman)|Julius Kahn]], a supporter of Schmitz, then requested that Schmitz come to Washington, D.C. immediately to discuss the issue of whether Japanese should be allowed to attend San Francisco Schools. Schmitz didn't return until March 6, delaying the trial further.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p131}}

While Schmitz was away, Ruef was finally forced to enter a plea of not guilty, and his trial was set for March 5.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p132}} But the day before the trial was to begin, Ruef's attorney's succeeded in raising an issue in Judge Hebbard's court that required intervention of the federal courts. That appearance was set for May 2 in Washington before the Supreme Court. Then Ruef disappeared and failed to show up in Dunne's court the next Monday. Dunne ruled that the trial in his court would proceed, regardless of what was transpiring in Judge Hebbard's court, which he felt was a fraud. He ordered Ruef's bonds forfeited and Ruef's arrest. Ruef's attorneys then tried to appeal to the State Appellate Court, who denied the writ, unsigned by the absent defendant.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p135}} County Sheriff O'Neil was unable to find Ruef, and Judge Denne replaced him with the County Coroner, W.J. Walsh, as [[wikt:elisor|elisor]], and charged him to bring Ruef into court. The coroner also failed to find Ruef, and Dunne then appointed Sheriff [[William J. Biggy]] as elisor and instructed him to arrest the fugitive. Biggy located Ruef within two hours at a roadhouse on the outskirts of San Francisco and arrested him.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p135}} But Biggy didn't know where to place Ruef, for both the police and sheriff's office had were under suspicion of graft, so he placed Ruef under arrest in a room in the temporary "little" [[Westin St. Francis|Saint Francis Hotel]] built in the ruins of [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] and later in a house at 2849 Fillmore Street, This arrangement lasted more than a year.

=== Supervisors implicated ===

As the investigation proceeded, other indictments were forthcoming. Supervisor Fred Nicholas was charged with accepting a bribe for $26,100 for furniture purchased for the city. Witnesses were indicted for [[perjury]]. Then, on March 7, 1907, while Ruef was still in hiding, Detective Burns set up a sting and witnessed Supervisor Thomas Lonergan accept a bribe from Golden M. Roy, owner of a well-known cafe with interests in several other businesses, including a skating rink. The city was considering an ordinance regulating skating rinks and Roy purportedly wanted Lonergan's help defeating the measure. Burns repeated the deception with two more supervisors, Edward Walsh and Dr. Charles Boxton. Gallagher suspected a trap and contacted Ruef, and they both encouraged Lonergan to return the bribe, but instead Lonergan accepted another $500. Burns and two other witnesses were concealed in an adjacent room on each occasion.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p141-143}}

Burns summoned Heney and Langdon, who after five hours coerced Lonergan and Walsh to confess about the graft operations at City Hall, exposing payoffs from Home Telephone (10 supervisors $3,500 each and seven supervisors $6,000 each (or about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3500|1906}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|6000|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}); Bay Cities Water; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric ($750 each); Pacific States Telephone Co. (10 supervisors $5,000  (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2000|1905}}}} today))); United Railroads ($40,000 to each supervisor and $400,000 to Ruef); the Parkside Realty companies; and boxing interests ($750 to each supervisor, Ruef and Schmitz $10,000 each).&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt;{{Rp|254}} But neither of the two men implicated Gallagher or Ruef, and the prosecution badly wanted information that would allow them to bring more charges against the two masterminds and the corporate executives who had supplied the money.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p144-148}} Gallagher was induced to meet with Spreckels during which a deal was worked our for Gallegher's testimony implicating Ruef and Schmitz, in exchange for immunity for himself and all of the Supervisors.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p150}}&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt;{{rp|254}} Gallagher then met with all of the supervisors in a final secret caucus and offered them the immunity deal, which 16 of them  accepted.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p155}}

On March 19, Lonergan testified in front of the grand jury&lt;ref name=bostont320&gt;{{cite news|title=Delay in Graft Case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19070320&amp;id=S64-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8VkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3129,3218383|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=Boston Evening Transcript|date=Mar 20, 1907|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19070320&amp;id=S64-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8VkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3129,3218383|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to having received $169,350 from Ruef that was transferred to the Supervisors. He and the now-immunized Supervisors detailed the source of the more than $200,000 received by the board members,&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p157-174}} naming the more than 20 board members of the several corporations who had contributed bribery funds,&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p169}} who were then in turn compelled to testify. Calhoun of United Railroads was one of the few holdouts: he refused to testify and exercised his right against [[self-incrimination]].

On March 14, Tirey L. Ford told ''The San Francisco Call'' that the grand jury's graft investigation wasn't legal and he refused to Testify.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

On March, 20, Ruef was charged with 65 more counts of graft. The grand jury also charged Theodore V. Halsey, the former confidential political for Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, with 14 counts of graft for the bribes paid to Supervisors to deny a competitive bid for telephone service in San Francisco. The judge set bail at $10,000 per count, or $650,000 for Ruef and $100,000 for Halsey.&lt;ref name=bostont&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco Looted|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19070321&amp;id=TK4-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8VkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1522,3406276|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=Boston Evening Transcript|date=Mar 21, 1907|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19070321&amp;id=TK4-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8VkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1522,3406276|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 23, the grand jury revealed an indictment against A.K. Detwiller, a capitalist from Toledo, Ohio and investor in the Home Telephone Company, and nine counts against Louis Glass, formerly a vice-president of Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Co., for bribing supervisors. The grand jury learned that 9 of the 16 supervisors paid by PT&amp;T through Ruef and Gallagher to oppose the Home Telephone Company's bid for a franchise had also accepted payments from the Home Telephone Company to support its bid.&lt;ref name=bostont/&gt;

=== Ruef confesses ===

Heney and Spreckels meanwhile met with officers of the major companies implicated in the bribery scheme and encouraged them to come forward and implicate Ruef and Schmitz. But the executives pretended that any rumors about bribery were baseless and denied any knowledge of the payoffs.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p153}} The prosecution's only hope to convict the executives of bribery was to prove a conspiracy, that they gave money to Ruef, a non-public official, with the intent that he pass it on to the Supervisors, who were. The Supervisors' testimony, while important, was only circumstantial. They needed Ruef's testimony to implicate the other men.&lt;ref name=bean2/&gt;{{rp|p254}}

Heney tried to persuade Ruef to offer evidence implicating Calhoun, Ford, and of United Railroads, but Ruef demanded complete immunity for himself and Schmitz in exchange for a confession, which Heney refused.&lt;ref name=bostont320/&gt; California Governor [[James Gillett]] considered removing Schmitz from office but found that the City Charter didn't contain a provision allowing removal of a sitting mayor.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=A Great Civic Drama|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/timeline.html|accessdate=8 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604065317/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist/timeline.html|archivedate=4 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During jury selection for the second trial, Heney found that one of the individuals impaneled, Morris Haas, had been convicted for embezzlement, although he was later pardoned. Detectives learned that Haas had boasted to his mistress that he would sell his vote for Ruef's acquittal.&lt;ref name=graft4/&gt; Believing Ruef was trying to plant the man on the jury, Heney publicly exposed Haas's forgery conviction while Haas was seated in the jury box and declared he was ineligible to serve.&lt;ref name=sundaytrib&gt;{{cite news|title=San Francisco Graft Prosecutor Shot in Court Room|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6CFjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qGINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2284,1335326&amp;dq=san+francisco+graft&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The Sunday Tribune|date=Nov 14, 1908|location=Providence, Rhode Island|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6CFjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qGINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2284,1335326&amp;dq=san+francisco+graft&amp;hl=en|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution reached an agreement with Ruef requiring Ruef to confess and in return he would receive immunity from most of the charges against him. On May 15, 1907, Ruef changed his plea to guilty and the next day in testimony before the grand jury he incriminated Schmitz.

On top of Ruef's confession, his trial continued for another 18 months, until December 10, 1908, on the remaining counts that he had not confessed to. The jury found him guilty and sentenced him to the maximum sentence for bribery, 14 years in [[San Quentin State Prison]]." He spent the next year at the county jail awaiting his appeal. In December 1909, he was released on bond of $600,000.&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt;{{rp|256}}

=== Ford indicted ===

The case against Tirey Ford went ahead and he was indicted in May 1907, charged with bribing Supervisor Thomas F. Lonergan. The ''San Francisco Bulletin'' described Ford as "a man whose error was caused by a mistaken loyalty to a corrupt corporation and in whose fall many will sorrow and none will rejoice."&lt;ref name=bean2/&gt;{{rp|p243}} Ruef admitted that he had received a $200,000 "attorney's fee" from Ford that he had used to make payments to the Supervisors. But Ruef would not admit that his dealings with Ford were anything other legal fees to Ruef to compensate him for his legal services to United Railroad. He said the same was true of his dealings with Calhoun, that they entirely professional. All three men were experienced lawyers, and if they engaged in a conspiracy, it may have been entirely implicit. Despite encouragement from Burns and Heney, Ruef would not testify that the men intended to bribe the Supervisors.

Calhoun spared no expense in defending himself and Ford. He hired an array of detectives to help with the investigation and a battery of attorneys to defend him. The attorneys included [[Earl Rogers]] of Los Angeles, and Alexander King, Calhoun's partner in New York, who gained admittance to California Bar just for Ford's case.&lt;ref name=bean2/&gt;{{rp|p243}}  In presenting Calhoun and Tirey's defense, Rogers argued that the prosecution had failed to make a case against the defendants, and didn't call a single witness or introduce any evidence.

Ford's first trial began on September 23, 1907. The prosecution secured testimony from Frank Leach, Superintendent of the [[San Francisco Mint|Mint]], who produced records that showed on May 22, 1906, Calhoun sent $200,000 from the east by telegraph that was deposited to the Mint. The records also showed that Ford drew $50,000 in small bills against the deposit on May 25, $50,000 on July 31, and the remainder on August 31. The dates corresponded approximately to two dates in early August and at the end of August that the Supervisors testified to having received payments from Gallagher.

The sensational case was submitted to the jury.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt; When the jury failed to reach a verdict, a mistrial was declared, and a second jury was convened. Ford was charged with bribing Supervisor Jennings Phillips and a second trial began on November 26, 1907 which also failed to reach a verdict, and a third trial began on April 4, 1908. He was charged with bribing Supervisor Daniel G. Coleman to help United Railroads secure a franchise to erect an overhead trolley system. On May 3, 1908, the jury found him not guilty.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

On June 20, 1909, the Calhoun jury was deadlocked, with the final jury vote at ten for acquittal and two for conviction.  He was not retried.

=== Schmitz indicted ===

On May 20, 1907, Mayor Schmitz was charged on the same indictment as Ruef for extorting money from the Tenderloin district French Restaurants.&lt;ref name=lewiston&gt;{{cite news|title=Schmitz Trial Begins Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5XZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gC8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=san%20francisco%20ruef%20trial%20begins&amp;pg=6560%2C5368513|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|date=May 20, 1907|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5XZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gC8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=san%20francisco%20ruef%20trial%20begins&amp;pg=6560%2C5368513|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmitz was convicted and forced out of office on June 13, 1907. But Schmitz's conviction was voided when a higher court ruled that there was a flaw in the indictment that failed to use Schmitz official title as mayor of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=spokesman06/&gt;

On January 10, 1908, the California Appellate Court reversed Schmitz's conviction and nullified the indictments still pending against Ruef.&lt;ref name=spokesman&gt;{{cite news|title=Schmtiz, Ruef, and Men "Higher Up" Can't Elude Heneyt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qLNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IMADAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=san%20francisco%20ruef%20graft&amp;pg=5156%2C1111755|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=January 11, 1908|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qLNVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IMADAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=san%20francisco%20ruef%20graft&amp;pg=5156%2C1111755|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ruef trial begins ===

On April 3, 1908, the prosecution began interviewing prospective jurors and had nearly completed their selection of 12 men when Ruef began begging Heney through others to consider a deal that would allow Ruef full immunity in exchange for his testimony. Heney refused to consider full immunity, insisting that Ruef take his chances on the indictment for graft. Ruef finally accepted these terms and on May 17, 1908, told the court he was ready to change his plea to guilty and make a full confession. The prosecution had scant evidence against Schmitz and without Ruef's testimony had little chance of obtaining a conviction against him.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p206}}

It took more than 70 days to examining prospective jurors and find 12 qualified jurors. On November 7, 1908, a jury was impaneled and sworn in for Ruef's third trial.

== Bomb destroys Gallagher's home ==

On April 29, 1908, a powerful explosion wrecked a portion of the Gallaghers' home in Alameda, including the room upstairs in which Gallagher and his wife were located, but both escaped unhurt. Their two daughters, a son, along with guests Mr. and Mrs. Schenck, and a gentlemen calling on the ladies, were also in the home. Because their dinner was late, they were kept in a portion of the house that was not seriously damaged, and they also escaped injury.&lt;ref name=graft3&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the Causes of Municipal Corruption in San Francisco, as Disclosed by the Investigations of the Oliver Grand Jury, and the Prosecution of Certain Persons for Bribery and Other Offenses Against the State|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist5/graft3.html|publisher=Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco|accessdate=8 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604082326/http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist5/graft3.html|archivedate=4 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the newspaper editors supporting Ghallager's  prosecution insinuated that Gallagher had arranged to blow up his own house to gain public sympathy. However John and Peter Claudianes were arrested and confessed to placing the dynamite bomb under Gallagher's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man Wanted for Complicity in Bomb Outages Has Been Caught|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aggyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=991%2C1491899|publisher=The Evening News|accessdate=13 June 2013|location=San Jose, California|date=August 11, 1908|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aggyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=991%2C1491899|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter said he had been paid to kill Gallagher by Felix Paudivaris, a United Railroads employee and a political friend of Ruef's.  Paudivaris disappeared shortly after the explosion but Claudianes and his brother were convicted and  sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref name=graft3/&gt;

=== Heney shot in court ===

Morris Haas, the ex-convict that Heney had exposed during jury selection, deeply resented Heney's action and brooded over it for many weeks. Haas attended the trial and during its eleventh week, a temporary recess was called in the late afternoon of November 13, 1908. While Heney was talking with another attorney, Haas walked up to Heney and shot him at point-blank range in the head. The wound, a half-inch in front of his right ear and just below the temple, was initially pronounced fatal.&lt;ref name=sundaytrib/&gt; Heney was hospitalized, and on the operating table said, "I will live to prosecute Haas and Ruef."&lt;ref name=nytimes1113&gt;{{cite news|title=Talk of Vigilante Law|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/11/14/104768928.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 13, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That night Haas was placed in a prison cell with a policeman to guard him, but despite these precautions was found dead with a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead the following morning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haas Commits Suicicde|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-uFZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kUoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1338,3739924&amp;dq=san+francisco+ruef+graft&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The Champaign Democrat|date=Nov 19, 1908|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-uFZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kUoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1338,3739924&amp;dq=san+francisco+ruef+graft&amp;hl=en|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a derringer beside him. The 1910 Oliver Grand Jury reported that two detectives had searched Haas after he shot Heney. It couldn't be determined whether Haas committed suicide, and if so, how he obtained the pistol, or whether he was murdered to prevent his testimony. Some believed that the same individuals who paid Claudianes to bomb the Gallagher residence was responsible for Haas's death. Others thought that Ruef, who they believed had hired Haas to murder Heney, had made sure Haas was silenced.&lt;ref name=graft4/&gt;

Heney did not die from his gunshot wound, as he had been expected to, and the trial resumed on November 18 after Judge [[William P. Lawlor]] dismissed several defense motions.&lt;ref name=pittsburghpress&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe Ruef Motions Denied|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zQobAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0UgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1424|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=Nov 18, 1908|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313232008/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zQobAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0UgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1424|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor's role was assumed by [[Hiram Johnson]], a bright young assistant to Heney.

Detective Burns had given Johnson the names of four jurors who, Burns said, had been bribed, and in his summation Johnson called each of them by name, pointed a forefinger at him, and shouted: "You – you dare not acquit this man!" Nevertheless, when the jury retired for its deliberations everyone expected that it would let Ruef go, or would disagree, as had happened in almost every other case growing out of the graft prosecution.

== Ruef convicted ==

While the jury was out Heney telephoned  [[Fremont Older|Older]] to say that he was much recovered, and proposed to come down and pay his respects to the judge. Older, with his usual flair for the dramatic, told Heney not to come until the editor gave the signal. While most of the community was by now against the prosecution, there was a minority on the side of honesty, which had organized a League of Justice pledged to help at a moment's notice. Older now hastily sent word to dozens of these men, who came and crowded into the courtroom, which was directly under the chamber in which the jury was deliberating.

[[Evelyn Wells]], in her biography of Older, tells what happened when Heney entered the courtroom on Older's arm:&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

{{quote|The 'minutemen' raised a shout of welcome. Older himself trumpeted like a bull elephant. The rest of the crowd joined in... It was a cheer of welcome, but to the scared jury on the floor above it sounded like a bellowed demand for lynching. A few minutes later twelve men good and true filed hurriedly into the courtroom. They had hastily made up their minds. All were deathly white. Some trembled. A few were weeping.}}

The jury's found Ruef guilty and he was sentenced to 14 years in prison.  In November 1910, his conviction and sentence were finally upheld, and on March 1, 1911, he entered prison.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

=== Schmitz convicted, released ===

[[File:Abe Ruef to San Quentin.jpg|thumb|Political boss Abe Ruef of San Francisco on his way to San Quentin State Prison after he was convicted in the San Francisco Graft Trial of 1907–1908.]]

On June 13, 1907, Mayor E.E. Schmitz was found guilty of [[extortion]] and the office of mayor was declared vacant. He was sent to jail to await sentence. Shortly thereafter he was sentenced to five years at [[San Quentin State Prison]], the maximum sentence the law allowed. He immediately appealed. While awaiting the outcome of the appeal, Schmitz was kept in a cell in [[San Francisco County Jails|San Francisco County Jail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor Schmitz Found Guilty|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/06/14/101726325.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 June 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Edward R. Taylor, Dean of [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law|Hastings College of the Law]], agreed to step in as interim mayor and was given power to appoint new supervisors to replace those who had resigned.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;

On January 9, 1908, the District Court of Appeals nullified his conviction. Two months later, the [[California Supreme Court]] upheld the Court of Appeal's ruling, and Schmitz was released on bail, pending resolution of the outstanding bribery indictments.

He was brought to trial once more in 1912, on charges of bribery. Ruef was brought from San Quentin to testify, but refused to give evidence. The other key witness, Chief Supervisor Gallagher, had disappeared without leave to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and did not return. Schmitz was acquitted.

Schmitz ran for mayor again in 1915 and 1919, but was soundly defeated due to his past reputation. Elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1921, he remained until 1925. He was married and had two daughters.

=== Police Chief dies ===

[[File:William J Biggy.jpg|thumb|left|Police Chief William Biggy may have committed suicide.]]

Heney and others publicly criticized Chief of Police [[William J. Biggy]] for the negligence and lax security that allowed Haas to kill himself with a hidden [[derringer]], and Biggy was deeply hurt by Heney's allegations. Biggy had a falling out with those supporting the graft prosecution and was placed under surveillance by detectives employed by Burns.

Biggy discussed his resignation with police commissioner Hugo Keil on December 1, 1908. While returning from that meeting during a nighttime crossing of San Francisco Bay from [[Belvedere, California|Belvedere]] to [[San Francisco]] aboard a police launch, Biggy went missing, a possible suicide. His body was found two weeks later floating in the [[San Francisco Bay|bay]]. Biggy was a devout [[Catholicsm|Catholic]] and the public thought it unlikely that he would commit suicide, but the [[inquest|Coroner's Jury]] returned a verdict of [[accident|accidental death]].

== Aftermath ==

Of all the sentences meted out to leading figures in the whole course of the prosecution, Ruef was the only individual who served prison time. When another municipal election approached in 1909, District Attorney Langdon refused to run again. Langdon was tired and discouraged at the lack of success in prosecuting the officials who had paid the bribes. Supervisor James Ghallager, a key witness, had fled the country for [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.

[[File:C.M. Fickert 4545367611 14a985d2b2 o.jpg|thumb|Attorney Charles Fickert, supported by the labor ticket, beat Heney for the District Attorney's office in 1909.]] In desperation, Heney ran for district attorney, but was defeated by a Union Labor loyalist, lawyer, and former football hero from [[Stanford University]], [[Charles Fickert]], whose liaison with the crooked politicians was well known.

Fickert promptly and contemptuously refused to proceed with any of the pending cases against the businessmen who had paid the bribes. He pretended he didn't know where Supervisor Gallagher had fled, although his location in Vancouver was common knowledge. (Fickert later gained a notorious reputation when he mishandled the 1916 [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] case and was defeated for District Attorney in 1919.)

[[William P. Lawlor]], the honest judge who had presided in several of the cases, excoriated Fickert and ordered the others to trial, but he was overruled by the court of appeals, which decided that all of the large number of remaining indictments should be quashed. The graft prosecution was over, having ended in almost total failure, with only Ruef in prison."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Bliven: ''The Boodling Boss and the Musical Mayor'' in ''American Heritage Magazine'', January 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 1911, Judge Lawlor dismissed all remaining indictments in the trolley bribery cases against Tirey L. Ford and other     officials of the United Railroads.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

On November 1, 1912, Louis Glass, formerly the Vice President at Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, was in court for a hearing. He had been accused of offering a bribe to a Supervisor to support the company's bid for the telephone franchise. Glass was the last to be prosecuted for graft, and he insisted that his [[Speedy Trial Clause|rights to a speedy trial]] had been violated. Ludge Lawlor reluctantly agreed and dismissed the charges pending against Glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=San Francisco Graft Cases End|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cYg-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SVoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=san%20francisco%20graft&amp;pg=3097%2C225075|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=Boston Evening Transcript|date=Nov 1, 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ruef serves four years===

In 1912, Older began to have second thoughts about Ruef's conviction. He asked Ruef to write his memoirs, which were published in the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'' in installments almost daily over months, finishing at the point where the [[Political corruption|graft]] investigation began. On August 23, 1915, having served a little more than four and a half of his fourteen-year sentence, he was released. He was the only person in the entire investigation who went to prison. He was not allowed to return to his legal practice. "Before he went to prison he had been worth over a million dollars, when he died he was bankrupt."&lt;ref name = Thomas/&gt;{{rp|257}}

'''Sekolah Berasrama Penuh (SBP)''' or '''Fully Residential School''' is a school system established in [[Malaysia]] to nurture outstanding students to excel in academics and extracurricular activities. Since 2008, SBPs are directly administered by Fully Residential and Excellent Schools Management Division, [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moe.gov.my/index.php/my/korporat/jabatan-dan-bahagian/bahagian-pengurusan-sekolah-berasrama-penuh-dan-sekolah-kecemerlangan|title=Bahagian Pengurusan Sekolah Berasrama Penuh dan Sekolah Kecemerlangan|last=|first=|date=|website=Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia|language=Malay|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SBP began in 1890, with [[Richard Olaf Winstedt]] as deputy (he later became Director of Education in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]). "The Selangor Raja School" was established as a starting step to produce the Malay elite from among the palaces and princes, states, through the English medium education. In 1894, the school was closed for renovation and was reborn in a new form in 1905 at [[Kuala Kangsar]], which to this day known as the [[Malay College Kuala Kangsar]] ([[MCKK]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sistemguruonline.my/2018/01/sekolah-berasrama-penuh.html|title=Sekolah Berasrama Penuh|last=Rifke|first=Mohd. Aried|date=2018-01-15|work=Sistem Guru Online|access-date=2018-09-03|language=ms-my}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sultan of Perak|Sultan]] [[Idris Shah I of Perak|Idris Shah I]] of [[Perak]], in the [[Conference of Rulers]] (Durbar) in 1903 which criticised the policy of British administration, especially in the education of the Malays, saying it was merely "''to produce better Malay farmers or fishermen only''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Laporan_Khas/20130216/lk_02/Seabad-merakam-sejarah|title=Seabad merakam sejarah|last=|first=|date=16 February 2013|work=Utusan Malaysia|access-date=3 September 2018|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan of Perak himself has offered on-site locations for [[MCKK]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, with the purpose "''for the education of the Malays of good family and for the training of Malay boys for admission to certain branches of the government service''". In 1947, "Malay Girl College" was established in [[Kuala Lumpur]], later moved to [[Seremban]], Negeri Sembilan, known as [[Tunku Kurshiah College]] until now, named after the first [[Raja Permaisuri Agong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tkc.edu.my/newtkc/index.php/history|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Tunku Kurshiah College|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1955, an Education Committee was established which led to the conception of the [[Razak Report]] in 1956. Razak Report approved and produced the Education Ordinance 1957. The [[Razak Report]] recommended the formation of six units of Sekolah Berasrama Penuh (SBP), namely [[Sekolah Datuk Abdul Razak|Sekolah Dato 'Abdul Razak]] (1956), [[Sekolah Tun Fatimah]] (1956), [[Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman]] (1957), [[Sekolah Menengah Sultan Abdul Halim]] (1963), [[Sekolah Sultan Alam Shah]] (1963) and [[Sekolah Seri Puteri]] (1968).

In 1955, [[Kolej Islam Malaya]] was embodied in the former palace on the site, which was donated by [[Hisamuddin of Selangor|Sultan Hisamuddin]] in [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]], [[Selangor]]. In 1966, the college was moved to Jalan Universiti in [[Petaling Jaya]], Selangor. In 1967, after the customisation work was completed, the college relocated to [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]] and was named [[Sultan Alam Shah Islamic College|Kolej Islam Klang]]. In 1972, the college administration was taken over entirely by the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] and the name was changed to [[Sultan Alam Shah Islamic College|Kolej Islam Sultan Alam Shah]].

Between 1973 to 1975, 10 SBPs were built. The projects that needed to be implemented in the [[Second Malaysia Plan]] were stated as "important projects in the plan is the establishment of ten pilot residential science secondary schools added to provide educational opportunities for pupils from rural areas to pursue their education in science subjects."

To date, Malaysia has 69 SBPs: 11 premier schools, 43 science secondary schools, 12 integrated SBPs and 3 federal Islamic secondary school. 6 of SBPs are all-boys and another 6 are all-girls. The latest SBP opened in Malaysia was Gua Musang Science Secondary School. The 69th SBP in Malaysia was opened in 2014. A number of SBPs are currently either under planning or ongoing construction under [[Eleventh Malaysia Plan]].

==Traditions==
The history of SBP is a rich one, and certain fields are considered the hallmark of SBP schools. These include:
* Fully Residential School Excellence Day (''Hari Kecemerlangan SBP, HKSBP'')
* Prime Minister's Trophy Debate Championship (''Pertandingan Bahas ala Parlimen Piala Perdana Menteri, PPM'')
* SBP Wind Orchestra Competition
* SBP 10's Rugby Annual Championship
* Islamic Leadership Conference (''Nadwah Kepimpinan Islam, NKI'')
* Malaysia International Young Inventors Olympiad (MIYIO)
* Fully Residential Schools' International Symposium (FRSIS)
* Malay Gamelan and Caklempong Competition

== List of fully residential schools in Malaysia ==
As in 2018, Malaysia has 69 fully residential schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moe.gov.my/index.php/my/statistik-kpm/bilangan-sekolah-berasrama-penuh|title=Bilangan Sekolah Berasrama Penuh|last=|first=|date=|website=Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia|language=Malay|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are later divided into five zones, namely Northern Zone, Central Zone, Southern Zone, Eastern Zone and SQL Zone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Shareholder primacy''' is a theory in [[corporate governance]] holding that [[shareholder]] interests should be assigned first priority relative to all other corporate stakeholders. A shareholder primacy approach often gives shareholders power to intercede directly and frequently in corporate decision-making, through such means as unilateral shareholder power to amend [[corporate charter]]s, [[shareholder referenda]] on business decisions and regular [[corporate board]] election contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Professor Bebchuk's Brave New World: A Reply to "The Myth of the Shareholder Franchise"|author=John F. Olson|publisher=Virginia Law Review|volume=93|number=3|date=May 2007|pages=773–787|jstor=25050360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shareholder primacy norm was first used by courts to resolve disputes among majority and minority shareholders, and, over time, this use of the shareholder primacy norm evolved into the modern doctrine of minority [[shareholder oppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Smith, D. Gordon|title=The Shareholder Primacy Norm|publisher=Journal of Corporation Law|volume=23|number=2|date=Winter 1998|ssrn=10571|doi=10.2139/ssrn.10571}}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Kee writes, "If private property were truly respected, shareholder interest would be the primary, or even better, the sole purpose, of the corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=May 1995|volume=13|number=5|title=The Ethical Corporation?|author=James Kee|url=http://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=247|publisher=The Free Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of shareholder primacy is criticized for being at odds with [[corporate social responsibility]] and other legal obligations because it focuses solely on maximizing shareholder profits .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The truth about shareholder primacy|date=25 May 2012|author=Gordon Pearson|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/short-termism-shareholder-long-term-leadership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sportsman's Association''' is a [[Firearms policy in the United Kingdom|pro-shooting]] organisation in the UK.

==History==
The Sportsman's Association was formed in 1996 to campaign for the right of sports shooters to own [[handguns]]. This was limited following the [[Dunblane Massacre]] when [[Thomas Hamilton (spree killer)|Thomas Hamilton]] killed 16 children and their teacher using legally-held [[pistols]].

Varying membership figures have been given over the past two years, but are now thought to be around 2700(May 2008 AGM) with 4000 being full members, 40 trade members &amp; 2000other members.

The association tried to organise a boycott of the 2012 Olympics, urging people not to volunteer as staff and judges. They asserted that chosen venue, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]], was less suitable than the ranges at [[Bisley, Surrey]]. However the Olympic governing body wanted the shooting to take place in London, we were out voted

==Policy==
The Sportsman's Association exists to fight for the restoration of target pistol shooting as a legitimate sport and for fair and effective firearms legislation. It believes that the way to help to keep the sport alive is by supporting the government's decision to issue section 5 authority for selected competitors, to train in the UK on the run up to the 2012 Olympics.

Lobbying MPs, The Home Office &amp; Parliament on behalf of our members.&lt;br&gt;
Free advice on licensing matters to members of SAGBNI. &lt;br&gt;
Free advice on game &amp; deer stalking. &lt;br&gt;
Running pistol shooting holidays in the South of France&lt;br&gt;
Postal competitions for both members &amp; non-members.&lt;br&gt;
Public liability insurance for members of SAGBNI. &lt;br&gt;
Advice on firearms &amp; ammunition. &lt;br&gt;
Trade members offering discount to SAGBNI members.

'''Structural vulnerability''' is a distinct likelihood of encountering major difficulties within the family atmosphere or the threat to the family itself because of such deficient capital resources as money, education, access to health care, or important/vital information. 

Structural vulnerability is a threat to any low-income individual that must caretake for a family. [[Social workers]] described these individuals as people that "In the largest richest country in the world, they work full time year around and some work multiple jobs as well, but they still do not earn enough to support their families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural vulnerability is cited as a reason that [[migrant workers]] in the United States are more vulnerable to violence and public health risks such as [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=QuesadaSVHealth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quesada|first=James|author2=Hart, Laurie Kain |author3=Bourgois, Philippe |title=Structural Vulnerability and Health: Latino Migrant Laborers in the United States|journal=Medical Anthropology|date=1 July 2011|volume=30|issue=4|pages=339–362|doi=10.1080/01459740.2011.576725|pmid=21777121|pmc=3146033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Issues==
When Structural Vulnerability strikes the household poor children are more likely than their affluent peers to encounter a lengthy list of health problems. Potential health Issues include inadequate prenatal care, Low birth weight, iron deficiency, and a high risk exposure to toxic metals like lead. 

Hunger and Malnutrition can lead to more health issues concerning low income families. Issues could include elevated heart rates, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, asthma, and dental problems. Low income families are less likely to have health insurance, with little or no health insurance lower income families are subject to prolong illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''two-party system''' is a party system where two [[major party|major]] [[political parties]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: in the politics of Australia, technically there are not two political parties but rather "two major political groupings"; for further information, see [[Coalition (Australia)]]&lt;/ref&gt; dominate the  government. One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the ''majority'' or ''governing party'' while the other is the ''minority'' or ''opposition party''. Around the world, the term has different senses. For example, in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]], [[Politics of Jamaica|Jamaica]], and [[Politics of Malta|Malta]], the sense of ''two party system'' describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties, and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature. In such arrangements, two-party systems are thought to result from various factors like [[First-past-the-post voting|winner takes all]] election rules.&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong Chin Huat, fz.com, Jul 29, 2013, [http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/guest-columnists/58472-when-winner-takes-all When winner takes all] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801054909/http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/guest-columnists/58472-when-winner-takes-all |date=2013-08-01 }}, Accessed Aug 12, 2013, “...This "winner-takes-all" characteristic of political contestation then forces political groups to consolidate into two blocs, hence, the two-party system...”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Regis&gt;Regis Publishing, [http://academic.regis.edu/jriley/215%20Winner%20Take%20all.htm The US System: Winner Takes All], Accessed Aug. 12, 2013, “...Winner-take-all rules trigger a cycle that leads to and strengthens a system of few (two in the US) political parties...”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boundless&gt;The Two Party System, Boundless Publishing, [https://www.boundless.com/political-science/interest-groups/the-two-party-system/the-two-party-system/  Two-party systems are prominent in various countries, such as the U.S., and contain both advantages and disadvantages], Accessed August 12, 2013 “...There are two main reasons winner–takes–all systems lead to a two-party system...”,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EricBlack&gt;Eric Black, Minnpost, October 8, 2012, [http://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2012/10/why-same-two-parties-dominate-our-two-party-system Why the same two parties dominate our two-party system], Accessed Aug. 12, 2013, “...SMDP (single-member districts, plurality) voting system. ...

Explanations for why a country with free elections may evolve into a two-party system have been debated. A leading theory, referred to as [[Duverger's law]], states that two parties are a natural result of a [[plurality voting system|winner-take-all]] voting system.

==Examples==
===Commonwealth countries===
In countries such as [[Politics of the United Kingdom|Britain]], two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates, but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence, and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature. In political systems based on the [[Westminster system]], which is a particular style of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries, a majority party will form the [[government]] and the minority party will form the [[opposition (politics)|opposition]], and coalitions of lesser parties are possible; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority, a [[hung parliament]] arises. Sometimes these systems are described as ''two-party systems'' but they are usually referred to as ''multi-party'' systems. There is not always a sharp boundary between a two-party system and a multi-party system.

Generally, a two-party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly [[right wing politics|right-wing]] and [[left wing politics|left-wing]] party: the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] vs. the [[Malta Labour Party|Labour Party]] in [[Malta]], [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] vs. [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]  in Australia, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] vs. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in the United States and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] vs. the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the United Kingdom.

Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to [[Local government|local]] or [[Administrative division|subnational]] office, however. Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cm5a9X0hpyUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=two+party+system#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Tyranny of the Two-Party System - Lisa Jane Disch - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29|isbn=9780231110358 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some governments, certain chambers may resemble a two-party system and others a [[multi-party system]]. For example, the [[politics of Australia]] are largely two-party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] is often considered a single party at a national level due to their long-standing alliance in forming government and additionally rarely compete for the same seat) for the [[Australian House of Representatives]], which is elected by [[instant-runoff voting]], known within Australia as preferential voting. However, third parties are more common in the [[Australian Senate]], which uses a [[Proportional representation|proportional voting system]] more amenable to minor parties.

In the [[politics of Canada]], while having a multiparty system federally and in the largest provinces of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[Manitoba]] as well as the smaller [[Newfoundland And Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Yukon Territory]] many of the provinces have effectively become two-party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected. Examples include [[British Columbia]] (where the battles are between the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberals]]), [[Alberta]] (between the [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] and [[United Conservative Party]]), [[Saskatchewan]] (between the [[Saskatchewan Party]] and [[Saskatchewan New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]]), [[New Brunswick]] (between the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberals]] and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservatives]]) and [[Prince Edward Island]] (between [[Prince Edward Island Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island|Progressive Conservatives]]).

The English speaking countries of the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from [[Great Britain]] have become two party systems. The [[politics of Jamaica]] are between the [[People's National Party]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]]. The [[politics of Guyana]] are between the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] and [[A Partnership for National Unity|APNU]] which is actually a coalition of smaller parties. The [[politics of Trinidad and Tobago]] are between the [[People's National Movement]] and the [[People's Partnership]] which is also a coalition. The [[Politics of Belize]] are between the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] and the [[People's United Party]]. The [[Politics of the Bahamas]] are between the [[Progressive Liberal Party]] and the [[Free National Movement]]. The [[politics of Barbados]] are between the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] and the [[Barbados Labour Party]].

The [[politics of Zimbabwe]] are effectively a two party system between the [[Robert Mugabe]] founded [[Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front]] and the opposition coalition [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]].

===India===
[[Politics of India|India]] has a multi-party system but also shows characteristics of a two party system with the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA)&lt;ref name="United Progressive Alliance (UPA)"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Progressive Alliance (UPA)|url=http://electionaffairs.com/parties/UPA.html|publisher=electionaffairs.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205005205/http://electionaffairs.com/parties/UPA.html|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA)&lt;ref name="National Democratic Alliance (NDA)"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Democratic Alliance (NDA)|url=http://electionaffairs.com/parties/NDA.html|publisher=electionaffairs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the two main players. It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties. Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist,&lt;ref name="Political Parties in India"&gt;{{cite web|title = Political Parties in India|url = http://electionaffairs.com/parties/parties.html|publisher = electionaffairs.com|accessdate = 7 August 2012|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707215933/http://electionaffairs.com/parties/parties.html|archivedate = 7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overall command about 20% of the [[Indian general elections, 2009#Results by pre-poll alliance|2009 seats]] in the Lok Sabha and had further increased to 28% in [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general elections]]
===Latin America===
Most Latin American countries also have [[presidential systems]] very similar to the US often with [[Winner-Take-All Politics|winner takes all]] systems. Due to the common accumulation of power in the Presidential office both the official party and the main opposition became important political protagonists causing historically two-party systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppedge|first1=Michael|title=The Dynamic Diversity of Latin American Party Systems|journal=Kellogg Institute, Hesburgh Center|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first manifestations of this particularity was with the [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|liberals and conservatives]] that often fought for power in all Latin America causing the first two-party systems in most Latin American countries which often lead to civil wars in places like [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Central American Republic]] and [[Peru]], with fights focusing specially on opposing/defending the privileges of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Creole peoples|creole]] [[aristocracy]]. Other examples of primitive two-party systems included the [[Pelucones]] vs [[Pipiolos]] in [[Chile]], [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Federalists]] vs [[Unitarian Party|Unitarians]] in [[Argentina]], [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorados]] vs [[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|Liberals]] in [[Paraguay]] and [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]] vs [[National Party (Uruguay)|Nationals]] in [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="Constanza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreira|first1=Constanza|title=Party systems, political alternation and ideology in the south cone (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay)|date=2006|url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0797-97892006000200001|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as in other regions, the original rivalry between liberals and conservatives was overtaken by a rivalry between [[center-left]] (often [[social-democratic]]) parties vs [[center-right]] [[liberal conservative]] parties, focusing more in economic differences than in cultural and religious differences as it was common during the liberal vs conservative period. Examples of this include [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] vs [[Social Christian Unity Party]] in [[Costa Rica]], the [[peronista]] [[Justicialist Party]] vs [[Radical Civic Union]] in [[Argentina]], [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] vs [[COPEI]] in [[Venezuela]], the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] (despite the name, a [[democratic socialist]] party) vs the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] in Colombia, [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] vs [[Panameñista Party]] in [[Panama]] and [[Liberal Party of Honduras|Liberal Party]] vs [[National Party of Honduras|National Party]] in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="Angell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angell|first1=Alan|title=PARTY SYSTEMS IN LATIN AMERICA|journal=Political Quartely|date=July 1966|doi=10.1111/j.1467-923X.1966.tb00224.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-923X.1966.tb00224.x/full|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the democratization of Central America following the end of the [[Central American crisis]] in the 90s former [[far-left]] [[guerrillas]] and former [[right-wing]] authoritarian parties, now in peace, make some similar two-party systems in countries like [[Nicaragua]] between the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] and the [[Liberalism in Nicaragua|Liberals]] and in [[El Salvador]] between the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] and the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]].

The traditional two-party dynamic started to broke after a while, especially in early 2000s; alternative parties won elections breaking the traditional two-party systems including [[Rafael Caldera]]'s ([[National Convergence (Venezuela)|National Convergence]]) [[Venezuelan general election, 1993|victory]] in [[Venezuela]] in 1993, [[Álvaro Uribe]] ([[Colombia First]]) [[Colombian presidential election, 2002|victory]] in 2002, [[Tabaré Vázquez]] ([[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]]) [[Uruguayan general election, 2004|victory]] in [[Uruguay]] in 2004, [[Ricardo Martinelli]] ([[Democratic Change (Panama)|Democratic Change]]) [[Panamanian general election, 2009|victory]] in 2009 in [[Panama]], [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] ([[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] ) [[Costa Rican general election, 2014|victory]] in 2014 in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Mauricio Macri]] ([[Republican Proposal]]) [[Argentine general election, 2015|victory]] in 2015 in [[Argentina]], all of them from non-traditional [[third party (politics)|third parties]] in their respective countries.&lt;ref name="Angell" /&gt; In some countries like Chile and Venezuela the political system is now split in two large multy-party alliances or blocs, one on the left and one on the right of the spectrum&lt;ref name="Constanza" /&gt; ([[Concertación]]/[[New Majority (Chile)|New Majority]] vs [[Alliance (Chile)|Alliance]] in Chile, [[Democratic Unity Roundtable]] vs [[Great Patriotic Pole]] in Venezuela).

===Malta===
[[Politics of Malta|Malta]] is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is [[single transferable vote]] (STV), traditionally associated with proportional representation, minor parties have not earned much success. Politics is dominated between the centre-left [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] and the centre-right [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]], with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between [[Maltese general election, 1962|1962]] and [[Maltese general election, 2017|2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borg|first1=Bertrand|title=Marlene Farrugia's election met with counting hall taunts|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170606/local/marlene-farrugia-elected-on-10th-district.650090|accessdate=9 June 2017|work=Times of Malta|date=6 June 2017|quote=Malta's next legislature will feature an elected third party representative for the first time in more than 50 years, with Democratic Party leader Marlene Farrugia having made it into parliament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
There is general agreement that the [[Politics of the United States|United States]] has a two-party system; historically, there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election. In the [[First Party System]], only Alexander Hamilton's [[Federalist Party]] and Thomas Jefferson's [[Democratic-Republican Party]] were significant political parties. Toward the end of the First Party System, the Republicans dominated a one-party system (primarily under the Presidency of [[James Monroe]]). Under the [[Second Party System]], the Democratic-Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams' Men and Jackson's Men. In [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]], the modern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] formed in support of [[Andrew Jackson]]. The [[National Republicans]] were formed in support of [[John Quincy Adams]]. After the National Republicans collapsed, the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and the [[Free Soil Party]] quickly formed and collapsed. In 1854, the modern [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs, Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists. [[Abraham Lincoln]] became the first Republican president in 1860.

During the [[Third Party System]], the Republican Party was the dominant political faction, but the Democrats held a strong, loyal coalition in the [[Solid South]]. During the [[Fourth Party System]], the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party, although Democrats [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] were both elected to two terms. In [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]], at the onset of the [[Fifth Party System]], Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in four consecutive elections. Other than the two terms of Republican [[Dwight Eisenhower]] from 1953 to 1961, Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid-1960s. Since the mid-1960s, despite a number of landslides (such as [[Richard Nixon]] carrying 49 states and 61% of the popular vote over [[George McGovern]] in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]]; [[Ronald Reagan]] carrying 49 states and 58% of the popular vote over [[Walter Mondale]] in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]]), Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms, except for the elections from 1932 through 1948 when FDR won 4 elections and Truman one, both as Democrats. In the election of [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], only 4% separated the popular vote between [[Barack Obama]] (51%) and [[Mitt Romney]] (47%), although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide (332–206).

Throughout every American party system, no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress. Despite that, third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support. In the election of [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]] won 27% of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential election]], [[Ross Perot]] won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent.

Furthermore, [[Parliament of Lebanon|the Lebanese Parliament]] is mainly made up of two [[bipartisan]] alliances.

Historically, [[Brazil]] had a two-party system for most of [[Brazilian military government|its military dictatorship]] (1964–1985): the military junta banned all existing parties when it took power and created a pro-government party, the [[National Renewal Alliance]] and an official opposition party, the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]]. The two parties were dissolved in 1979, when the regime allowed other parties to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Brazil/Political-parties |title=Brazil - Political parties |last= Martins|first=Luciano|last2=Schneider |first2=Ronald Milton|author-link2=Ronald Schneider (historian) |website=[[britannica.com]] |access-date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other party systems==
Two-party systems can be contrasted with:
* [[Multi-party system]]s. In these, the [[effective number of parties]] is greater than two but usually fewer than five; in a two-party system, the effective number of parties is two (according to one analysis, the actual average number of parties varies between 1.7 and 2.1.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hsz3ML3hgUUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22two+party+system%22+effective+number+of+parties#v=onepage&amp;q=%22two%20party%20system%22%20effective%20number%20of%20parties&amp;f=false |title=Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-Seven Democracies ... - Arend Lijphart - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29|isbn=9780198273479 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties in a multi-party system can control government separately or as a coalition; in a two-party system, however, coalition governments rarely form. Examples of nations with multi-party systems include [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].
* [[One-party state|One-party systems]] or [[dominant-party system]]s happen in nations where no more than one party is codified in law and/or officially recognized, or where alternate parties are restricted by the dominant party which wields power. Examples include rule by the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[People's Action Party]] of [[Singapore]].

==Causes==
There are several reasons why, in some systems, two major parties dominate the political landscape. There has been speculation that a two-party system arose in the [[United States]] from early political battling between the federalists and anti-federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], according to several views.&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsNovGi11&gt;{{cite news

Sachs]] agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties. Sachs explained how the [[first-past-the-post]] voting arrangement tended to promote a two-party system:

{{Quote|The main reason for America's majoritarian character is the electoral system for Congress. Members of Congress are elected in single-member districts according to the "first-past-the-post" (FPTP) principle, meaning that the candidate with the plurality of votes is the winner of the congressional seat. The losing party or parties win no representation at all. The first-past-the-post election tends to produce a small number of major parties, perhaps just two, a principle known in political science as [[Duverger's Law]]. Smaller parties are trampled in first-past-the-post elections.|Sachs, ''The Price of Civilization'', 2011&lt;ref name=twsM18xxuy&gt;{{cite book

Consider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties. Suppose further that if a party gets 15% of votes, then that party will win 15% of the seats in the legislature. This is termed ''proportional representation'' or more accurately as ''party-proportional representation''. Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi-party systems, since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature:

{{quote|Because even a minor party may still obtain at least a few seats in the legislature, smaller parties have a greater incentive to organize under such electoral systems than they do in the United States.|Schmidt, Shelley, Bardes (2008)&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt;}}

In contrast, a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a [[plurality voting system]] or [[single-winner voting system]] and is usually described under the heading of a ''winner-takes-all'' arrangement. Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district, but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat, although variants, such as requiring a majority, are sometimes used. What happens is that in a general election, a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions. This arrangement strongly favors large and well–organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats, and discourages smaller or regional parties. Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to run under the auspices of the two dominant parties.&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''winner-takes-all'' principle applies in presidential elections, since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state, ''all'' of the [[electoral votes]] from that state are awarded. In all but two states, [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]], the presidential candidate winning a plurality of votes wins all of the electoral votes, a practice called the '''unit rule'''.&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt;

Duverger concluded that "plurality election single-ballot procedures are likely to produce two-party systems, whereas proportional representation and runoff designs encourage multipartyism."&lt;ref name=GeorgeEdwards/&gt; He suggested there were two reasons why ''winner-takes-all'' systems leads to a two-party system. First, the weaker parties are pressured to form an alliance, sometimes called a ''fusion'', to try to become big enough to challenge a large dominant party and, in so doing, gain political clout in the legislature. Second, voters learn, over time, not to vote for candidates outside of one of the two large parties since their votes for third party candidates are usually ineffectual.&lt;ref name=SchmidtTextbook/&gt; As a result, weaker parties are eliminated by voters over time. Duverger pointed to statistics and tactics to suggest that voters tended to gravitate towards one of the two main parties, a phenomenon which he called ''polarization'', and tend to shun third parties.&lt;ref name=EricBlack/&gt; For example, some analysts suggest that the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] system in the [[United States]], by favoring a system of winner-takes-all in presidential elections, is a structural choice favoring only two major parties.&lt;ref name=twsNovGf2&gt;{{cite news

Gary Cox suggested that America's two-party system was highly related with economic prosperity in the country:

{{Quote|The bounty of the American economy, the fluidity of American society, the remarkable unity of the American people, and, most important, the success of the American experiment have all mitigated against the emergence of large dissenting groups that would seek satisfaction of their special needs through the formation of political parties.|Cox, according to George Edwards&lt;ref name=GeorgeEdwards/&gt;}}

A so-called ''third party'' in the [[United Kingdom]] are the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 election]], the Liberal Democrats received 23% of the votes but only 9% of the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. While electoral results do not necessarily translate into legislative seats, the Liberal Democrats can exert influence if there is a situation such as a [[hung parliament]]. In this instance, neither of the two main parties (at present, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]) have sufficient authority to run the government. Accordingly, the Liberal Democrats can in theory exert tremendous influence in such a situation since they can ally with one of the two main parties to form a coalition. This happened in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government of 2010]].  Yet in that more than 13% of the seats in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] are held in 2011 by representatives of political parties other than the two leading political parties of that nation, contemporary Britain is considered by some to be a [[multi-party system]], and not a two-party system.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Kingdom general election, 2010#Results]], The detailed "Results" section of the Wikipedia article "United Kingdom General Election, 2010".&lt;/ref&gt; The two party system in the United Kingdom allows for other parties to exist, although the main two parties tend to dominate politics; in this arrangement, other parties are not excluded and can win seats in Parliament. In contrast, the two party system in the United States has been described as a duopoly or an enforced two-party system, such that politics is almost entirely dominated by either the [[Republican party of the United States|Republicans]] or [[Democratic party of the United States|Democrats]], and third parties rarely win seats in [[United States Congress|Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, J. D. (2012). Challengers to Duopoly: Why Third Parties Matter in American Two-party Politics. University of South Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Patrick Allitt]] of the [[Teaching Company]] suggested that it is difficult to overestimate the long term economic benefits of political stability.

===Beginnings of parties in Britain===

The two-party system, in the sense of the looser definition, where two parties dominate politics but in which third parties can elect members and gain some representation in the legislature, can be traced to the development of political parties in the [[United Kingdom]]. There was a division in [[England|English]] politics at the time of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Glorious Revolution]] in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Jones, ''The First Whigs. The Politics of the Exclusion Crisis. 1678–1683'' (Oxford University Press, 1961), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] supported [[Protestant]] [[constitutional monarchy]] against [[Absolute Monarchy|absolute rule]] and the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]], originating in the [[Royalist]] (or "[[Cavalier]]") faction of the [[English Civil War]], were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the [[Republicanism|republican]] tendencies of [[Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim ''Restoration:Charles II and His Kingdoms 1660–1685'' Allen Lane (2005) p241&lt;/ref&gt; In the following century, the Whig party's support base widened to include emerging industrial interests and wealthy merchants.

The basic matters of principle that defined the struggle between the two factions, were concerning the nature of [[constitutional monarchy]], the desirability of a Catholic king,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title= The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications]], [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |id= |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |page= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2013}} the extension of [[religious toleration]] to [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] Protestants, and other issues that had been put on the liberal agenda through the political concepts propounded by [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ashcraft and M. M. Goldsmith, "Locke, Revolution Principles, and the Formation of Whig Ideology," ''Historical Journal,'' Dec 1983, Vol. 26 Issue 4, p 773-800&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algernon Sidney]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Melinda S. Zook, "The Restoration Remembered: The First Whigs  and the Making of their History," ''Seventeenth Century,'' Autumn 2002, Vol. 17 Issue 2, pp 213–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Vigorous struggle between the two factions characterised the period from the [[Glorious Revolution]] to the 1715 [[Hanoverian succession]], over the legacy of the overthrow of the [[Stuart dynasty]] and the nature of the new constitutional state. This proto two-party system fell into relative abeyance after the accession to the throne of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and the consequent period of [[Whig supremacy]] under [[Robert Walpole]], during which the Tories were systematically purged from high positions in government. However, although the Tories were dismissed from office for half a century, they still retained a measure of party cohesion under [[Sir William Wyndham, 3rd Baronet|William Wyndham]] and acted as a united, though unavailing, opposition to Whig corruption and scandals. At times they cooperated with the "Opposition Whigs", Whigs who were in opposition to the Whig government; however, the ideological gap between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs prevented them from coalescing as a single party.

===Emergence of the two-party system in Britain===
The old Whig leadership dissolved in the 1760s into a decade of factional chaos with distinct "[[Grenvillite]]", "[[Bedfordite]]", "[[Rockingham Whigs|Rockinghamite]]", and "[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Chathamite]]" factions successively in power, and all referring to themselves as "Whigs". Out of this chaos, the first distinctive parties emerged. The first such party was the [[Rockingham Whigs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UH0HNqRBsmMC|title=The Transatlantic Persuasion: The Liberal-Democratic Mind in the Age of Gladstone|author=Robert Lloyd Kelley|year=1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=83|isbn=9781412840293}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Charles Watson-Wentworth]] and the intellectual guidance of the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Edmund Burke]]. Burke laid out a philosophy that described the basic framework of the political party as "a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed". As opposed to the instability of the earlier factions, which were often tied to a particular leader and could disintegrate if removed from power, the two party system was centred on a set of core principles held by both sides and that allowed the party out of power to remain as the [[Loyal Opposition]] to the governing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jessenorman.com/2013/09/conhome-op-ed-the-usa-radical-conservatism-and-edmund-burke.html|title=ConHome op-ed: the USA, Radical Conservatism and Edmund Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If place "the north" no caps, if person please link or explain who it is}}. George III is the blockhead in the center.]]
A genuine two-party system began to emerge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0841958270|title=The Emergence of the British Two-Party System, 1760 - 1832|author=Frank O'Gorman|year=1982|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the accession to power of [[William Pitt the Younger]] in 1783 leading the new Tories, against a reconstituted "Whig" party led by the [[radicalism (politics)|radical politician]] [[Charles James Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0809/minho/gangster1.html|title=The History of Political Parties in England (1678-1914)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary History, xxiv, 213, 222, cited in Foord, ''His Majesty's Opposition'', 1714–1830, P 441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Wilson and Peter Reill, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2004) p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The two party system matured in the early 19th century [[1832 Reform Act|era of political reform]], when the franchise was widened and politics entered into the basic divide between conservatism and liberalism that has fundamentally endured up to the present. The modern [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was created out of the [[British Tory Party#Pittites|"Pittite" Tories]] by [[Robert Peel]], who issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in 1834 which set out the basic principles of [[Conservatism]]; - the necessity in specific cases of reform in order to survive, but an opposition to unnecessary change, that could lead to "a perpetual vortex of agitation". Meanwhile, the Whigs, along with [[free trade]] Tory followers of [[Robert Peel]], and independent [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]], formed the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] in 1859, and transformed into a party of the growing urban middle-class, under the long leadership of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. The two party system had come of age at the time of Gladstone and his Conservative rival [[Benjamin Disraeli]] after the [[1867 Reform Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UiNAZmRaYrcC|title=Gladstone and Disraeli|author=Stephen J. Lee|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=146|isbn=9781134349272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of American political parties===
Although the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}&lt;/ref&gt; early political controversies in the 1790s saw the emergence of a two-party political system, the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], centred on the differing views on federal government powers of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780-1840'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a consensus reached on these issues ended party politics in 1816 for a decade, a period commonly known as the [[Era of Good Feelings]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Minicucci, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=275165&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0898588X04000094 Internal Improvements and the Union, 1790–1860], Studies in American Political Development (2004), 18: p.160-185, (2004), Cambridge University Press, {{doi|10.1017/S0898588X04000094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partisan politics revived in 1829 with the split of the Democratic-Republican Party into the [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]] led by [[Andrew Jackson]], and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]]. The former evolved into the modern [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the latter was replaced with the [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] as one of the two main parties in the 1850s.

The '''War in Donbass''' is an armed conflict in the [[Donbass]] region of [[Ukraine]]. From the beginning of March 2014, protests by [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] and anti-government groups took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] oblasts of Ukraine, commonly collectively called the "Donbass", in the aftermath of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] and the [[Euromaidan]] movement. These demonstrations, which followed the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] (February to March 2014), and which were part of a wider group of [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|concurrent pro-Russian protests]] across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an [[War|armed conflict]] between the [[Separatism|separatist]] forces of the self-declared [[Donetsk People's Republic|Donetsk]] and [[Luhansk People's Republic|Luhansk]] People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140412131249/http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/armed-pro-russian-insurgents-in-luhansk-say-they-are-ready-for-police-raid-343167.html|archivedate=12 April 2014|title=Armed pro-Russian insurgents in Luhansk say they are ready for police raid|work=Kyiv Post|date=12 April 2014|last=Grytsenko|first= Oksana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Donetsk People's Republic]], from May 2014 until a change of the top [[leadership]] in August 2014,&lt;ref name="jamestown-20140815"&gt;[https://jamestown.org/program/strelkovgirkin-demoted-transnistrian-siloviki-strengthened-in-donetsk-peoples-republic/#.U-8Yxdr3-yw Strelkov/Girkin Demoted, Transnistrian Siloviki Strengthened in 'Donetsk People's Republic'], [[Vladimir Socor]], [[Jamestown Foundation]], 15 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; some of the top leaders were Russian citizens.&lt;ref name="REUeuada"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/27/us-ukraine-crisis-rebels-insight-idUSKBN0FW07020140727|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728013327/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/27/us-ukraine-crisis-rebels-insight-idUSKBN0FW07020140727|archivedate=28 July 2014|title=Pushing locals aside, Russians take top rebel posts in east Ukraine|agency=Reuters|date=27 July 2014|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ukrainian government, at the height of the conflict in mid-2014, Russian paramilitaries were reported to make up between 15% to 80% of the combatants.&lt;ref name="REUeuada"/&gt;

Between 22 and 25 August 2014, Russian artillery, personnel, and what Russia called a "humanitarian convoy" crossed the border into Ukrainian territory without the permission of the Ukrainian government. Crossings occurred both in areas under the control of pro-Russian forces and in areas that were not under their control, such as the south-eastern part of [[Donetsk Oblast]], near [[Novoazovsk]]. These events followed the reported shelling of Ukrainian positions from the Russian side of the border over the course of the preceding month.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/world/europe/russia-moves-artillery-units-into-ukraine-nato-says.html |title= Russia Moves Artillery Units into Ukraine, NATO Says |author= Michael R.

As a result of the August 2014 events, DPR and LPR insurgents regained much of the territory they had lost during the Ukrainian government's preceding military offensive. Ukraine, Russia, the DPR and the LPR signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire, called the [[Minsk Protocol]], on 5 September 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC2908" /&gt; Violations of the ceasefire on both sides became common. Amidst the solidification of the line between insurgent and government-controlled territory during the ceasefire, [[warlord]]s took control of swaths of land on the insurgent side, leading to further destabilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Vasilyeva |first= Nataliya |url= https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-rebels-disunited-front-run-warlords-124041693.html?ref=gs |title= Ukraine rebels: a disunited front run by warlords |agency= Associated Press |date= 10 November 2014 |accessdate= 9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceasefire completely collapsed in January 2015, with renewed heavy fighting across the conflict zone, including at [[Donetsk International Airport]] and at [[Debaltseve]]. Involved parties agreed to a new ceasefire, called [[Minsk II]], on 12 February 2015. Immediately following the signing of the agreement, separatist forces launched an [[Battle of Debaltseve#After Minsk II|offensive on Debaltseve]] and forced Ukrainian forces to withdraw from it.

Attempts to seize the Donetsk Regional State Administration (RSA) building began since [[2014 pro-Russian protests in Ukraine|pro-Russian protests]] erupted in the [[Eastern Ukraine|eastern]] and [[Southern Ukraine|southern]] regions of Ukraine, in the wake of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]]. Pro-Russian protesters occupied the Donetsk RSA from 1–6 March, before being removed by the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU).&lt;ref name="march6cbs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukrainian-city-of-donetsk-epitomizes-countrys-crisis/ |title=Ukrainian city of Donetsk epitomizes country's crisis |publisher=CBS News |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April, 1,000–2,000 people gathered at a rally in Donetsk to demand a status [[referendum]] similar to the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|one held in Crimea]] in March.&lt;ref name="BBC100a6414"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26910210 |title=Ukraine: Pro-Russians storm offices in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrators stormed the RSA building, and took control of its first two floors. They said that if an extraordinary legislative session was not held by regional officials to implement a status referendum, they would take control of the regional government with a "people's mandate", and dismiss all elected regional councillors and members of parliament.&lt;ref name="UPravda1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/6/7021524/|script-title=uk:Донецькі сепаратисти готуються сформувати "народну облраду" та приєднатися до РФ |language=Ukrainian |work=[[Ukrayinska Pravda]] |date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these demands were not met, the activists held a meeting in the RSA building, and voted in favour of independence from Ukraine.

===Luhansk Oblast===
Unrest in Luhansk Oblast began on 6 April, when approximately 1,000 activists seized and occupied the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]] building in the city of [[Luhansk]], following similar occupations in the cities of [[Donetsk]] and [[Kharkiv]].&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140416/ukraines-eastern-hot-spots |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421235710/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140416/ukraines-eastern-hot-spots |archivedate=2014-04-21 |title=Ukraine's eastern hot spots |publisher=GlobalPost |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters barricaded the building, and demanded that all arrested separatist leaders be released.&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"/&gt; Police were able to retake control of the building, but the demonstrators regathered for a 'people's assembly' outside the building and called for a 'people's government', demanding either federalisation or incorporation into the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alan Yuhas and Tom McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/16/crisis-east-ukraine-city-by-city-guide-map |title=Crisis in east Ukraine: a city-by-city guide to the spreading conflict |work=The Guardian |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this assembly, they elected [[Valery Bolotov]] to the position of "People's Governor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vesti-ukr.com/donbass/48519-v-lugansve-vybrali-narodnogo-gubernatora |title=В Луганске выбрали "народного губернатора" &amp;#124; Донбасс &amp;#124; Вести |publisher=Vesti.ua |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two referendums were announced, one on 11 May to determine whether the region should seek some form of autonomy, and a second scheduled for 18 May to determine whether the region should join the Russian Federation, or declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/21/7023176/ |title=У Луганську сепаратисти вирішили провести два референдуми &amp;#124; Українська правда |work=Ukrayinska Pravda |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Battle of Kramatorsk}}
In [[Kramatorsk]], a city in northern Donetsk Oblast, separatists attacked a police station on 13 April, resulting in a shootout.&lt;ref name="pravdaapr12"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=uk:На Донбасі сепаратисти і міліція влаштували перестрілку|trans-title=Separatists and police engaged in a gunfight in Kramatorsk |language=uk |url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/04/12/7022218/ |newspaper=Ukrainian Pravda |date=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighters, members of the [[Donbass People's Militia]], later captured the police station. They removed the police station's sign and raised the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic over the building.&lt;ref name=militaproof /&gt; They then issued an ultimatum that stated that if the city's mayor and administration did not swear allegiance to the Republic by the following Monday, they would remove them from office.&lt;ref name=militaproof /&gt; Concurrently, a crowd of demonstrators surrounded the city administration building, captured it, and raised the Donetsk People's Republic flag over it. A representative of the Republic addressed locals outside the occupied police station, but was received negatively and booed.&lt;ref name=militaproof /&gt;

After a government counter-offensive as part of the "anti-terror" operation in Donetsk Oblast on 2–3 May, the insurgents were routed from Kramatorsk's occupied SBU building.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unian.net/politics/914397-ukrainskie-voyska-vyishli-iz-kramatorska-smi.html|script-title=ru:Украинские войска вышли из Краматорска|trans-title=Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Kramatorsk |language=ru |agency=Unian |date=4 May 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Ukrainian troops quickly withdrew from the city for unknown reasons, and the separatists quickly regained control. Sporadic fighting continued until 5 July, when the insurgents withdrew from Kramatorsk.&lt;ref name="BBCkramawith"/&gt;

====Horlivka====

Militants attempted to seize the police headquarters in [[Horlivka]] on 12 April, but were halted.

Skirmishes between the troops and local demonstrators caused the city administration building to be set on fire. Government forces, however, were unsuccessful in forcing out the pro-Russians, and only further inflamed tensions in Mariupol.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt; On 16 May, however, [[Metinvest]] steelworkers, along with local police and security forces, routed the insurgents from the city administration and other occupied government buildings in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-pro-russian-insurgents-retreat-from-buildings-in-mariupol-1.2644943 |title=Ukraine: Pro-Russian insurgents retreat from buildings in Mariupol |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most insurgents left the city, and those few remaining were said to be unarmed.

===Government counter-offensive===
[[File:2014-04-15. Протесты в Донецке 001.jpg|thumb|left|The barricade outside the Donetsk RSA, with banners displaying anti-western slogans]]

[[Arsen Avakov]], the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on 9 April that the separatist problem would be resolved within forty-eight hours, through either negotiations or the use of force. "There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict – a political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach. We are ready for both," he said, according to the [[Ukrinform]] state news agency. At the time, President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] had already signed a decree which called for the Donetsk Regional State Administration building, which had been occupied by separatists, to be taken "under state protection".&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ukrainska Pravda"/&gt; He offered amnesty to any separatists who laid down their arms and surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novosti.dn.ua/details/222329/ Novosti Donetsk], ''Турчинов готов освободить сепаратистов без криминала, если они сложат оружие [Turchynov ready to release the separatists without charges, if they lay down their weapons]'', 10 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 April, the Prime Minister, [[Arseniy Yatsenyuk]], said that he was against the use of "law enforcement" at the time, but that "there was a limit" to how much the Ukrainian government would tolerate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novosti.dn.ua/details/222442/ Novosti Donetsk], ''"Я против силовых сценариев, но всему есть предел", – Яценюк ["I am against law enforcement scenarios, but there is a limit" – Yatsenyuk]'', 11 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the spread of separatist control throughout Donetsk Oblast, and the refusal of the separatists to lay down their arms, Turchynov vowed to launch a military counter-offensive operation against insurgents in the region on 15 April.&lt;ref name="news.biharprabha.com"/&gt; As part of the counter-offensive, Ukrainian troops re-took the airfield in [[Kramatorsk]] after a skirmish with members of the [[Donbass People's Militia]].

After the Armed Forces of Ukraine re-took the airfield, the commanding general of the unit that had retaken it, [[Vasyliy Krutov]], was surrounded by hostile protesters who demanded to know why the Ukrainian troops had fired upon local residents.&lt;ref name="krutovguardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/troops-fire-mob-ukraine-oleksandr-turchynov-general-vasily-krutov |title=Troops fire as locals in Kramatorsk confront Ukraine general Vasily Krutov |work=The Guardian |date=15 April 2014 |accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krutov was then dragged back to the airbase along with his unit.

Ukrainian officials said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo-Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June.

He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way.

While Russia denies its troops are currently operating in Ukraine, OSCE observers have witnessed Russian troops operating in Ukraine identifying themselves as Russian servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/175736 |title=Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received as of 19:30 (Kyiv time), 2 August 2015 |publisher=OSCE |date=3 August 2015 |accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper released by the [[Royal United Services Institute]] estimated that 9,000–12,000 Russian troops had been deployed to parts of eastern Ukraine in early 2015, with 42,000 troops having been involved in the combined service rotation.&lt;ref name="GD11MA2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RUSIma2015"/&gt; On 17 December 2015 President Vladimir Putin stated in a response to a question about the detained Russian GRU agents held in Ukraine that Russia had "people (in Ukraine) who work on resolving various issues there, including in the military sphere." However, he went on to state "that doesn't mean there are regular Russian troops there." This was generally taken as an admission by Russia that its special forces were involved in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/putin-denies-regular-russian-troops-ukraine-170221107.html?ref=gs |publisher=AFP |title=Putin denies Russian troops are in Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Borodai]], 50,000 Russian citizens have fought for separatist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Igor |last=Slv |url=http://euromaidanpress.com/2016/07/30/96047/ |title=50,000 Russian citizens fought in Donbass war: separatist ex-leader |publisher=[[Euromaidan Press]] |date=30 July 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2018 the number of separatist forces were estimated at around 31,000 out of which 80% (25,000) were Donbass residents, 15% (~5,000) were military contractors from Russia and other countries and 3% (900–1,000) were regular Russian armed forces personnel. This proportion has significantly changed from earlier years, with "Russian command gradually filling up the military of the 'republics' with locals"; the primary driver being that salaries are no longer attractive for contractors from Russia, but highly attractive as stable source of income in economically impaired separatist territories. Regular soldiers in Donbass are offered anything from 15,000 and officers 25,000 RUB, while in Russian army these respective earnings are 20,000 and 68,000 RUB. Russian forces still occupy most command positions as well as operate advanced weapons, such as [[Electronic warfare|electronic warfare units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/209802|title=The Ukrainian Week|website=ukrainianweek.com|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSCE monitors periodically record Russian military convoys crossing through the defunct border, usually overnight. On a number of occasions, OSCE monitoring drones were downed with electronic warfare units. OSCE statements and spot reports caused significant anger in Ukraine as it vaguely reports military "convoys leaving and entering Ukraine on dirt roads in the middle of the night, in areas where there is no official crossing" without explicitly mentioning Russian armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1540757123|title=OSCE drone downed after it spotted Russian military movement by night in Ukraine - Human Rights in Ukraine|work=Human Rights in Ukraine|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's forces at Sloviansk included some professional soldiers amongst their ranks, as well as retired veterans, civilians, and volunteers, while those in Donetsk have been confirmed to include former [[Berkut (special police force)|Berkut]] special police officers.&lt;ref name="teleapr12"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oliphant |first=Roland |title=Fears of full-scale Russian invasion as eastern Ukraine cities toppled |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10763008/Fears-of-full-scale-Russian-invasion-as-eastern-Ukraine-cities-toppled.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 April 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by ''The Sunday Telegraph'' where their weapons had come from, one veteran of the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] nodded at the Russian flag flying from the police station and said: "Look at that flag.

Former Soviet military veteran [[Vyacheslav Ponomarev (separatist)|Vyacheslav Ponomarev]], who declared himself mayor of Sloviansk, said that he appealed to old military friends to take part in the militia: "When I called on my friends, practically all of whom are ex military, they came to our rescue, not only from Russia but also from [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Moldova]]."&lt;ref name="CNNbkr"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ukraine: Photos show undercover Russian troops |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/21/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former separatist militant corroborated these stories in an interview with [[Radio Free Europe]]. He said that fighters, including some Cossack units, arrived from Russia to support the separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Claire Bigg |title=Pro-Russian Militias Are Torturing People in Eastern Ukraine |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pro-russian-militias-are-torturing-people-in-ukraine-2014-5?IR=T |newspaper=Business Insider |date=17 May 2014 |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another interview with an insurgent from [[Saint Petersburg]] was published in ''Gazeta''.

====Russian Orthodox Army====
The '''Russian Orthodox Army''' ({{lang-ru|Русская православная армия}}, ''Russkaya pravoslavnaya armiya''), a [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] [[Insurgency|insurgent]] group in [[Ukraine]], originated in May 2014 as part of the insurgency.&lt;ref name="inforr"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inforesist.org/u-samoprovozglashennoj-doneckoj-respubliki-poyavilas-novaya-armiya-russkaya-pravoslavnaya/ |title=У самопровозглашенной Донецкой республики появилась новая армия – Русская православная (In the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, a new army – Russian Orthodox) |work=InfoResist |date=10 May 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reportedly had 100 members at the time of its founding, including locals and Russian volunteers.

The '''Vostok Battalion''' ({{lang-ru|Батальон Восток}}, {{lang-uk|Батальйон Схід}}; lit. "East Battalion") was formed in early May 2014.

Khodakovsky said that the "overwhelming majority" of his men came from eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Vostok"/&gt; According to [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], Vostok reportedly includes former members of the original [[Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad|Vostok Battalion]], a special forces unit of the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (Russia)|Russian intelligence directorate]] (GRU) that participated in the [[Second Chechen War|Second Chechen]] and [[Russo-Georgian War|Russo-Georgian]] Wars.

====Armed Forces of Ukraine====
The [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]] are the primary military force of Ukraine, and have taken a leading role in countering DPR and LPR forces. The Armed Forces have been widely criticised for their poor equipment and inept leadership, forcing Internal Affairs Ministry forces like the [[National Guard of Ukraine|National Guard]] and the [[Territorial defence battalion (Ukraine)|territorial defence battalions]] to take on the brunt of the fighting.&lt;ref name="KP23215"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NR9MAY"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/117710/ukraines-army-small-sovietized-underfunded-and-poorly-trained |title=Why is Ukraine's Army So Appallingly Bad? |work=The New Republic |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|independence from the Soviet Union in 1991]], Ukraine inherited all Soviet military equipment and formations that had been stationed on its territory. Over the years preceding the start of hostilities in Donbass, the Armed Forces were systematically downsized, and became largely dilapidated.&lt;ref name=krarmyJuly14/&gt; Soviet weaponry was not replaced or upgraded, leaving the Armed Forces with outdated and poorly maintained equipment.&lt;ref name=krarmyJuly14/&gt; As an example, the Soviet military units never utilised ballistic vests, and hence, when the war in Donbass started, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had none.

To counter equipment shortages, a powerful [[civil volunteer movement helping Ukrainian forces in the war in Donbass|civil volunteer movement]] appeared.

{{Flag|NATO|size=23px}}&amp;nbsp;– NATO published a statement on the war in Donbass and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimean Crisis]] in August 2014.&lt;ref name="natodad"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_111767.htm |title=Russia's accusations – setting the record straight |publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |date=2 August 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attempted to debunk the Russian government's accusations against the Ukrainian government, and also other statements made by Russia to justify its presence in Ukraine. According to the statement, Russia attempted to "divert attention away from its actions" and "levelled a series of accusations against NATO which are based on misrepresentations of the facts". It also said that Russia "made baseless attacks on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and has used force to seize part of Ukraine's territory".&lt;ref name=natodad/&gt; In response to the unauthorised entry of the Russian humanitarian convoy on 22 August, NATO Secretary General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] stated that this incident could "only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel. The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists".&lt;ref name="NATO112089"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_112089.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826122304/http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_112089.htm |archivedate=26 August 2014 |title=NATO Secretary General condemns entry of Russian convoy into Ukraine |publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in August, NATO generals met and revised their assessment of the military situation in Donbass.

[[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] considers the conflict a war with Russian [[Irregular troops|irregulars]],&lt;ref name="defencedad"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=122576 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713152755/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=122576 |archivedate=13 July 2014 |title=Russian Actions Bring Europe to Decisive Point |publisher=American Forces Press Service |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others consider it to be a war between Russian proxies and Ukraine.&lt;ref name="FTintal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3192c7a0-0cd2-11e4-bf1e-00144feabdc0.html|title=Nato must focus on the 'hybrid wars' being waged on the west|work=Financial Times|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=19 July 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] described the events in the Donbass region as a "non-international armed conflict".&lt;ref name="reuterswar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Tom|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-warcrimes-idUSKBN0FR0V920140722|title=Ukraine war crimes trials a step closer after Red Cross assessment|agency=Reuters|location=Geneva|date=22 July 2014|accessdate=22 July 2014|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123081443/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-warcrimes-idUSKBN0FR0V920140722|archivedate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IClaw"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2014/07-23-ukraine-kiev-call-respect-ihl-repatriate-bodies-malaysian-airlines.htm |title=Ukraine: ICRC calls on all sides to respect international humanitarian law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=23 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some news agencies, such as the [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]] and [[Reuters]], interpreted this statement as meaning that Ukraine was in a state of "[[civil war]]".&lt;ref name="ITcw"&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Cross admits Ukraine is in a state of civil war |url=http://tass.ru/en/world/742051 |agency=Information Telegraph Agency of Russia |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From early September 2014, [[Amnesty International]] said that it considered the war to be "international", as opposed to "non-international".&lt;ref name="AI7SEPT" /&gt; Secretary General of Amnesty International [[Salil Shetty]] said that "satellite images, coupled with reports of Russian troops captured inside Ukraine and eyewitness accounts of Russian troops and military vehicles rolling across the border leave no doubt that this is now an international armed conflict".&lt;ref name="AI7SEPT"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2014/09/ukraine-mounting-evidence-war-crimes-and-russian-involvement/ |title=Mounting evidence of war crimes and Russian involvement |publisher=Amnesty International |date=7 September 2014 |accessdate=7 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704120250/http://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2014/09/ukraine-mounting-evidence-war-crimes-and-russian-involvement/ |archivedate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict has also been classified as a "[[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]]" waged by Russia against Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ponarseurasia.org/article/defense-conspirology-rejoinder-serhiy-kudelias-anti-political-analysis-hybrid-war-eastern |title=In Defense of Conspirology: A Rejoinder to Serhiy Kudelia's Anti-Political Analysis of the Hybrid War in Eastern Ukraine |publisher=PONARS Eurasia |date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]] [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] said that he considered the conflict a direct war with [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="IBua"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lb.ua/news/2014/06/27/271204_aleksandr_turchinov_pri_vtorzhenii.html |title=Александр Турчинов: "При вторжении со стороны Чернигова, русские танки уже через пару часов могли быть в Киеве" (Alexander Turchinov: "With the invasion by the Chernigov, Russian tanks in a couple of hours could be in Kiev") |publisher=LB.ua |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=19 July 2014 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]], the war will be known in history of Ukraine as the "Patriotic War".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2014/08/24/7035656/ Poroshenko: this war will enter the history as Patriotic]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 24 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[VTSIOM]] survey taken in August 2014, 59% of the Russian citizens polled viewed the war in Donbass as a civil war.&lt;ref name="RTukcivpoll"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rt.com/politics/182860-russia-ukraine-civil-poll/ |title=Most Russians see Ukrainian turmoil as civil war – poll |publisher=RT |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those polled said that direct war with Ukraine was either "absolutely impossible" or "extremely unlikely". 28% said that such a conflict could happen in the future.&lt;ref name="RTukcivpoll" /&gt;

Until early 2015, the [[European Union]] tended to label the participants of the conflict as "foreign armed formations" or Russia-supported separatists. After the delivery of an IntCen classified report by the end of January 2015, the official EU documents started labelling them openly as "Russian troops in Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/foreign/127667 |title=EU breaks taboo on 'Russian forces in Ukraine' |publisher=EUObserver |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worldwide Atrocities Dataset''' is a dataset collected by the [[Computational Event Data System]] at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and sponsored by the [[Political Instability Task Force]] (PITF) that is, in turn, funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=main&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/atrocities.html|title = Political Instability Task Force Worldwide Atrocities Dataset|date = June 5, 2014|accessdate = June 21, 2014|publisher = [[Computational Event Data System]] maintained by Parus Analytical Systems for [[Pennsylvania State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==

Unlike other datasets such as the [[Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone]] (GDELT), [[Integrated Conflict Early Warning System]] (ICEWS), data for the Worldwide Atrocities Dataset is entered and coded manually.&lt;ref name=main/&gt; Data is available for download in two files:&lt;ref name=main/&gt;

* Data from January 1995 to December 2012, covering 7775 events. This is 3.5 MB compressed, and 12 MB uncompressed.
* Data from January 1, 2013 to the present, with a four-month embargo period (so the four most recent months are unavailable). Data is updated monthly.

In addition to the datasets, a coding manual is available for download.&lt;ref name=manual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/Atrocities.codebook.1.0B2.pdf|title = Coding manual for Worldwide Atrocities Dataset|accessdate = June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception in blogs===

Political scientist and forecasting expert [[Jay Ulfelder]] called the Worldwide Atrocities Dataset a "useful data set on political violence that almost no one is using."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/a-useful-data-set-on-political-violence-that-almost-no-one-is-using/|title = A Useful Data Set on Political Violence that Almost No One Is Using|last = Ulfelder|first = Jay|authorlink = Jay Ulfelder|date = June 10, 2014|accessdate = June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also referenced by Patrick Meier while reviewing a paper that used the dataset.&lt;ref name=irevolution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irevolution.net/2009/02/24/neogeography-and-crisis-mapping-analytics/|title = NeoGeography and Crisis Mapping Analytics|last = Meier|first = Patrick|date = February 24, 2009|accessdate = June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18735">'''Yemeni unification''' took place on May 22, 1990, when the area of the [[South Yemen|People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (also known as South Yemen) was united with the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] (also known as [[North Yemen]]), forming the [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] (known as simply Yemen).

==Background==
[[File:Divided Yemen.svg|thumb|400px|right|North Yemen (in orange) and South Yemen (in blue) before 1990.]]
North Yemen became a state after the [[Fall of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in November 1918. [[Aden]], in South Yemen,  was administered as part of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India#minor provinces#aden|British India]], and in 1937 became a [[Colony of Aden|British colony]] in its own right.  The larger part of South Yemen was a British [[Aden Protectorate|protectorate]], effectively under colonial control. In one of the many [[proxy conflicts]] of the [[Cold War (1962–79)|Cold War]], a [[Aden Emergency|South Yemeni insurgency]] (with the support and backing of the [[Soviet Union]]) led by two nationalist parties revolted, causing the [[United Kingdom]] to first unify the area and in 1967 to withdraw from its former colony.

Following the [[North Yemen Civil War]], the north established a republican government that included tribal representatives. It enjoyed modest oil revenues and remittances from its citizens working in the oil-rich [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. Its population in the 1980s was estimated at 12 million as opposed to 3 million in South Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Gabriel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S4df_k4WM6gC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=yemen+unification&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xKuMTbD9F4ji0gH66YG-Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=yemen%20unification&amp;f=false Towards Korean reconciliation: socio-cultural exchanges and cooperation], Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, pages 38-48&lt;/ref&gt; 

South Yemen developed as a communist, mostly secular&lt;ref&gt;Laessing, Ulf, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/22/us-yemen-women-idUSTRE60L2ZD20100122 Women of southern Yemen port remember better times] Reuters, January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; society ruled first by the [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]], which later morphed into the ruling [[Yemen Socialist Party]]. The only avowedly communist nation in the Middle East, South Yemen received significant foreign aid and other assistance from the [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Gart, Murray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956703,00.html South Yemen New Thinking in a Marxist Land], Time, January 09, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1972, fighting erupted between north and south; North Yemen was supplied by Saudi Arabia while South Yemen was supplied by the USSR. Fighting was short-lived and the conflict led to the October 28, 1972 Cairo Agreement, which set forth a plan to unify the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/51196986/CIA-Study-on-Yemeni-Unification CIA Study on Yemeni Unification]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gause, Gregory, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0yUzV-g2X2QC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22arab+league%22+yemen+1972&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KOGMTZC3HaaB0QH-3ry2Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22arab%20league%22%20yemen%201972&amp;f=false Saudi-Yemeni relations: domestic structures and foreign influence], Columbia University Press, 1990, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighting broke out again in February and March 1979, with South Yemen allegedly supplying aid to rebels in the north through the [[National Democratic Front (Yemen)|National Democratic Front]] and crossing the border.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Richard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fvx_mozejjgC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=yemen+1979&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DeOMTYijCcaw0QHzg7C8Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=yemen&amp;f=false Perceptions and behavior in Soviet foreign policy], University of Pittsburgh Pre, 1985, page 152&lt;/ref&gt; Southern forces made it as far as the city of [[Taizz]] before withdrawing.&lt;ref&gt;Hoagland, Edward, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vd97al2M3o4C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=taizz+1979&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ze-MTcOdBaiQ0QHknuCrCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Balancing Acts], Globe Pequot, 1999, page 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3011111?seq=1 Interview with ''Al-Hamdani''] Middle East Research and Information Reports, February 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Again, North Yemen was supported by [[anti-Communist]] [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Taiwan]] ([[:zh:大漠計畫|per request by KSA and secretly in the name of Royal Saudi Air Force from 1979 to 1990]]). This conflict was also short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Burrowes, Robert, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x3CtaL2yEnkC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=yemen+unification&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CJ-MTZ7uM8Ga0QHMlvTCCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=yemen%20unification&amp;f=false Middle East dilemma: the politics and economics of Arab integration], Columbia University Press, 1999, pages 187 to 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, oil exploration near the border between the two nations, [[Ma'rib]] in North Yemen and the [[Shabwah Governorate]] in the South, spurred interest in developing agreements to exploit resources there and lift both nations' economies.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Brian, [http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/birthofmodernyemen/bmy2.htm The Birth of Modern Yemen] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123133107/http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/birthofmodernyemen/bmy2.htm |date=2011-01-23 }}, e-book available at Al-Bab, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1988, the two governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions, including agreements to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, now called the Joint Investment Area, by the [[Hunt Oil Company]] and [[Exxon]].&lt;ref&gt;CIA, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, they formed the Yemeni Company for Investment in Mineral and Oil Resources (YCIMOR).&lt;ref&gt;Ismael, Sharif, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~metheses/Ismail%20Thesis.pdf Unification in Yemen: Dynamics of Political Integration], Thesis paper written for Wadhamn College, 2001, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1989, [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of North Yemen and [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]] of South Yemen jointly accepted a draft unity constitution originally drawn up in 1981, which included a demilitarized border and border passage by Yemenis on the sole basis of a national identification card, as well as a capital city in [[Sana'a]].

==Unification==
The [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] was declared on 22 May 1990. [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of the north became [[President of Yemen|Head of State]], and [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]] of the south became [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Head of Government]]. A 30-month transitional period for completing the unification of the two political and economic systems was set. A presidential council was jointly elected by the 26-member Yemen Arab Republic advisory council and the 17-member People's Democratic Republic of Yemen presidium. The presidential council appointed a Prime Minister, who formed a Cabinet. There was also a 301-seat provisional unified parliament, consisting of 159 members from the north, 111 members from the south, and 31 independent members appointed by the chairman of the council.

A unity constitution was agreed upon in May 1990 and [[Yemeni constitutional referendum, 1991|ratified by the populace]] in May 1991. It affirmed Yemen's commitment to free elections, a multiparty political system, the right to own private property, equality under the law, and respect of basic human rights. [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 1993|Parliamentary elections]] were held on April 27, 1993. International groups assisted in the organization of the elections and observed actual balloting. The resulting Parliament included 143 [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]], 69 [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] (YSP), 63 [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Islah]] (the nation's largest Islamist party), 6 [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Yemen Region|Ba'athists]], 3 [[Nasserist Unionist People's Organisation]], 2 Al Haq, and 15 independents. The new parliament represented the North strongly. The YSP, though it had won the most seats in voting in the less-populated south, was considered a minor part of the new coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;Enders, Klaus-Stefan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D_ukUE9SiZ0C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22democratic+republic+of+yemen%22+1994&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W9yZTZGYKIq2tweZ8YGyBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22democratic%20republic%20of%20yemen%22%201994&amp;f=false Republic of Yemen: selected issues], International Monetary Fund Report, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The head of Islaah, [[Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar]], became the speaker of Parliament. Islaah was invited into the ruling coalition, and the presidential council was altered to include one Islaah member.

As a new oil field was brought online in the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]] in the south, southerners began to feel that their land, home to the majority of the country's oil reserves, was illegally appropriated as part of a planned conspiracy by the rulers of North Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Enders, 2001, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://armiesofliberation.com/archives/2009/06/01/al-beidh-speech-52109-official-translation/ May 2009 speech by former South Yemen President [[Ali Salim al-Beidh]]] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712201620/http://armiesofliberation.com/archives/2009/06/01/al-beidh-speech-52109-official-translation/ |date=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enders, Klaus-Stefan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e3pkp6sAxdQC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;dq=yemen,+1994,+elections,+ysp&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KCOaTbrJAoHJgQfjwdXRCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yemen%2C%201994%2C%20elections%2C%20ysp&amp;f=false Yemen in the 1990s: from unification to economic reform], International Monetary Fund, 2002, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the newly unified nation faced political crisis when an estimated 800,000 Yemeni nationals and overseas workers were sent home by Saudi Arabia following Yemen's decision not to support [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition forces]] in the [[Gulf War]]. Remittances from these workers, an important part of the economy, were slashed and many Yemenis were placed in refugee camps while the government decided where to house them and how to re-integrate them into the workforce. The repatriation of these Yemenis immediately increased the nation's population by 7%.&lt;ref&gt;Foad, Hisham, [http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~hfoad/GulfMigration_v1.pdf The Effect of the Gulf War on Migration and Remittances] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315085524/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~hfoad/GulfMigration_v1.pdf |date=2012-03-15 }}, Department of Economics paper, San Diego State University, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Brian, [http://www.al-bab.com/yemen/artic/gdn8.htm Pawns of War live in forgotten Yemen camps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119130948/http://al-bab.com/yemen/artic/gdn8.htm |date=2010-11-19 }}, The Guardian, repreinted in Al-Bab, 7 January 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}
{{main|1994 civil war in Yemen}}
Conflicts within the coalition resulted in the self-imposed exile of Vice President Ali Salim Al-Beidh to Aden beginning in August 1993 and a deterioration in the general security situation as political rivals settled scores and tribal elements took advantage of the unsettled situation. [[Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas]], the former Southern Prime Minister continued to serve as the Yemen's [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]], but his government was ineffective due to political infighting. Continuous negotiations between northern and southern leaders resulted in the signing of the document of pledge and accord in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] on February 20, 1994. Despite this, clashes intensified until civil war broke out in early May 1994. Significantly, one of the institutions that had not yet unified was the military arms of both nations.

Southern leaders seceded and established the [[Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (DRY) on 21 May 1994, but the new state was not recognized by the international community. [[Ali Nasir Muhammad]], the exiled South Yemen leader, assisted military operations against the secessionists.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Chris, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/16/world/in-yemen-s-civil-war-south-fights-on-gloomily.html?src=pm In Yemen's Civil War, South Fights On, Gloomily], New York Times, May 16, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Aden was captured on 7 July 1994. Other resistance quickly collapsed and thousands of southern leaders and military went into exile. 

In the aftermath of the civil war, [[Yemeni Socialist Party]] leaders within Yemen reorganized the party and elected a new [[politburo]] in July 1994. However, the party remained disheartened and without its former influence. Islaah held a party convention in September 1994. The [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] did the same in June 1995.

In 1994, [[constitutional amendment|amendments]] to the unity constitution eliminated the presidential council. President Ali Abdallah Saleh was elected by Parliament on 1 October 1994 to a 5-year term. The constitution provided that henceforth the President is to be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates selected by the legislature.

==Aftermath==
Adopting a Western style governmental system, Yemen held its first direct [[Yemeni presidential election, 1999|presidential elections]] in September 1999, electing President Ali Abdullah Saleh to a 5-year term in what were generally considered free and fair elections{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Yemen held its second multiparty [[Yemeni parliamentary election, 1997|parliamentary elections]] in April 1997. Constitutional amendments adopted in the summer of 2000 extended the presidential term by 2 years, thus moving the next presidential elections to 2006. The amendments also extended the parliamentary term of office to a 6-year term, thus moving elections for these seats to 2003. On 20 February 2001, a new constitutional amendment created a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] consisting of a Shura Council (111 seats; members appointed by the president) and a House of Representatives (301 seats; members elected by popular vote). Yemen is now a [[dominant-party system]] with the [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] in power. 

Friction and troubles continued, elements in the south perceive unfair treatment by the north.&lt;ref&gt;Haley Edwards, "In south of Yemen, talk of rebellion is rife" in ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 18, 2010) at page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This has given birth to a popular movement called the [[South Yemen Movement]] which calls for the return of an independent southern state.&lt;ref name="time2011"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2081756,00.html | work=Time | title=Is South Yemen Preparing to Declare Independence? | date=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, this time as a pawn in the proxy war between [[Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|Saudi Arabia and Iran]], Yemen again was engulfed in [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|civil war]], which continues to this day.

==Integration==
* The [[North Yemeni rial]] and the [[South Yemeni dinar]] remained legal tender during a transitional period. In 1991, the dinar was withdrawn from circulation, with 26 rial exchanged for one dinar. In 1993, the first coins were issued for the Republic of Yemen called [[Yemeni rial]]s.
* The capital of the Republic of Yemen is North's old capital, [[Sana'a]].
* The South's "[[National anthem of Yemen|United Republic]]" became the country's national anthem.
* September 26 and October 14 are both celebrated as Revolution Day, with the former celebrating the North's revolution against the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|imams]] and the latter celebrating the South's revolution against the [[British Empire]].
