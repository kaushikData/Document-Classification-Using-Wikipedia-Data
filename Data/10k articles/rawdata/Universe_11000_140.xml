'''ABB''' (ASEA Brown Boveri) ({{SWX|ABBN}}, {{NYSE|ABB}}, {{OMX|SSE3966|ABB}}) is a Swiss-Swedish [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], operating mainly in [[robotics]], [[motive power|power]], heavy electrical equipment and [[automation]] technology areas. It is ranked 341st in the [[Fortune Global 500]] list of 2018 and has been a global [[Fortune Global 500|Fortune 500]] company for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fortune 500 - ABB |url=http://fortune.com/global500/abb/ |publisher=Fortune.com |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABB is traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]] in Zürich, [[Stockholm Stock Exchange|Nasdaq Stockholm]] and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.abb.com/investorrelations/share-information/share-listing|title=Share - Listing information|website=new.abb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie}}
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ''[[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget]]'' (General Swedish Electrical Limited Company, ASEA)  was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm&lt;ref name="Ludvig Fredholm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludvig Fredholm|url=http://new.abb.com/about/abb-in-brief/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Västerås]] as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]] and [[Walter Boveri]]&lt;ref name="Walter Boveri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Boveri|url=http://new.abb.com/news/detail/639/electrifying-founders}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.
[[File:ABB world map.svg|thumbnail|ABB around the world.{{vague|date=February 2014}}]]

ABB was created as the result of the [[merger]] of ASEA and BBC in 1988. The latter had acquired ''Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon'' in 1967. The former CEO of ASEA, [[Percy Barnevik]], became CEO of ABB, until his resignation in 1996.
[[File:ABB Transformer in Iowa.jpg|thumb|ABB Transformer in [[Iowa]] being transported by the [[Iowa Interstate Railroad]].]]

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased [[Combustion Engineering]] (C-E), headquartered in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional [[fossil fuel]] power and [[nuclear power]] supply systems to break into the North American market. [[Klaus Agthe]] was [[CEO]] of the US operation at the time.  Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Elsag Bailey reference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsag Bailey was acquired by ABB Group|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=328241|website=1999, Elsag Bailey Process Automation N.V. was acquired by ABB Group|publisher=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann &amp; Braun, and Fischer &amp; Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.

ABB bought [[International Combustion]] Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bygonederbyshire.co.uk/articles/International_Combustion_Ltd_from_American_roots_to_Sinfin_Lane |title=International Combustion Ltd from American roots to Sinfin Lane |publisher=Bygonederbyshire.co.uk |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Rolls-Royce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/roe13056.htm |title=UK Business Park |publisher=UK Business Park |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125001917/http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/roe13056.htm |archivedate=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1997.

[[Alstom]] acquired ABB's boiler and fossil fuel operations  in 2000 while its nuclear business was purchased by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two [[North Korea]]n nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] (KEDO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/C1256C290031524B4125686C00433604.aspx|title=Press release: ABB to deliver systems, equipment to North Korean nuclear plants|publisher=ABB|date=20 January 2000|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/korea/article/0,2763,952289,00.html |title=The two faces of Rumsfeld |author=Randeep Ramesh |date=2003-05-09 |publisher=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to [[Alstom|Alstom Power]]. ABB's nuclear business was sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/c1256c290031524b41256856003dc16c.aspx|title=Press release: ABB to sell nuclear business to BNFL|publisher=ABB|date=29 December 1999|accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[BNFL]] and merged into [[Westinghouse Electric Company]].

In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the [[Dow Jones]] corporate [[sustainability|sustainability index]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sustainability-index.com/default.html |title=Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427174749/http://www.sustainability-index.com/default.html |archivedate=27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the third year in a row.

In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edith M. Lederer |url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=1928 |title=UN: Swedish Businessman Loses Job |publisher=CorpWatch |date=2002-03-01 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to [[Capvis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/524f1adffdce18cec1256e40001e74f9.aspx |title=ABB sells Swiss Building Systems business |publisher=Abb.com |date=2004-02-20 |accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, [[building automation]] as well as power distribution and management.

Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB recovered financially by settling [[asbestos]] issues brought by its U.S. subsidiaries, [[Combustion Engineering]] and Lummus Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/09/01/abb_says_lummus_asbestos_claims_resolved|title=ABB asbestos claims resolved |author=Uncredited |date=September 1, 2006 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to [[CB&amp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSWEN068720070827 |title=CB&amp;I to buy Lummus Global from ABB |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2007-08-27|accessdate=2010-12-12 |first=Lewis |last=Krauskopf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries.

In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions . As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.

In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/0a5309e735867cc1c125771a00252346.aspx |title=ABB acquires Ventyx to strengthen its network management business |publisher=abb.com |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based [[Mincom Limited]] from private equity firm [[Francisco Partners]]  for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www02.abb.com/global/seitp/seitp202.nsf/0/3b101a75e361906fc125788b00159f6a/$file/11_34_mincom.pdf |title=ABB Press Release: ABB acquires Mincom to expand enterprise software business |publisher=abb.com |date=2011-05-09 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www02.abb.com/global/seitp/seitp202.nsf/0/5532aa7595747a9dc12578dc00215694/$file/11_49_mincom.pdf |title=ABB Press Release: ABB completes acquisition of Mincom |publisher=abb.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.

In 2011 ABB acquired [[Baldor Electric Company|Baldor Electric USA]] for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired [[Thomas &amp; Betts]] in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnb.com/shared/docs/TNB_4Q11.pdf |title=Thomas &amp; Betts Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter 2011 Net Earnings |publisher=www.tnb.com |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2012, it  completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos. In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/bf86c5972758ad3ec1257bb300773351.aspx]. On June 30, 2018, ABB completed its acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, [[General Electric]]'s global electrification business. The transaction was announced on September 25, 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://new.abb.com/news/detail/5475/abb-completes-acquisition-of-ge-industrial-solutions|title=ABB completes acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aerodynamic heating''' is the heating of a solid body produced by its high-speed passage through air (or by the passage of air past a test object in a [[wind tunnel]]), whereby its kinetic energy [[heat transfer|is converted to heat]] by [[Friction#Skin friction|skin friction]] on the surface of the object at a rate that depends on the [[viscosity]] and speed of the air. In science and engineering, it is most frequently a concern regarding [[meteors]], [[Atmospheric entry|reentry vehicles]], and  the design of high-speed [[aircraft]].

==Physics==
At high speeds through the air, the object's [[kinetic energy]] is converted to heat through compression and friction. At lower speed, the object will lose heat to the air through which it is passing, if the air is cooler. The combined temperature effect of heat from the air and from passage through it is called the [[stagnation temperature]]; the actual temperature is called the recovery temperature.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These viscous dissipative effects to neighboring sub-layers make the [[boundary layer]] slow down via a non-[[isentropic]] process.  Heat then conducts into the surface material from the higher temperature air. The result is an increase in the temperature of the material and a loss of energy from the flow. The forced convection ensures that other material replenishes the gases that have cooled to continue the process.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

The stagnation and the recovery temperature of a flow increases with the speed of the flow and are greater at high speeds. The total [[thermal loading]] of the object is a function of both the recovery temperature and the mass flow rate of the flow. Aerodynamic heating is greatest at high speed and in the lower atmosphere where the density is greater.  In addition to the convective process described above, there is also [[Thermal radiation]] from the flow to the body and vice versa with the net direction set by the relative temperature of each.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

Aerodynamic heating increases with the speed of the vehicle. Its effects are minimal at [[Speed of sound|subsonic speed]]s but at [[supersonic speed]]s beyond about M2.2 it dictates the design/materials of the vehicle structure and internal systems. The heating effects are greatest at [[leading edge]]s but the whole vehicle heats up to a stabilized temperature if it remains at speed. Aerodynamic heating is dealt with by the use of high temperature alloys for metals, the addition of insulation of the exterior of the vehicle, or the use of [[ablative material]].

==Aircraft==
Aerodynamic heating is a concern for [[supersonic aircraft|supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aircraft.

One of the main concerns caused by aerodynamic heating arises in the design of the wing. When the structure of an aircraft wing is designed, there are two main considerations that must be accounted for when this aircraft is to fly at subsonic speeds: minimizing weight and maximizing strength. Aerodynamic heating, which occurs at supersonic and hypersonic aircraft speeds, adds an additional consideration in wing structure analysis. In an idealized wing structure, a wing is made up of spars, stringers, and skin segments. In a wing that normally experiences subsonic speeds, there must be a sufficient number of stringers to withstand the axial and bending stresses induced by the lift force acting on the wing. In addition, the distance between the stringers must be small enough that the skin panels do not buckle, and the panels must be thick enough to withstand the shear stress and shear flow present in the panels due to the lifting force on the wing. However, the weight of the wing must be made as small as possible, so the choice of material for the stringers and the skin is an important factor.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

At supersonic airspeeds, aerodynamic heating adds another element to this structural analysis. At normal speeds, spars and stringers experience a load called Delta P, which is a function of the lift force, first and second moments of inertia, and length of the spar. When there are more spars and stringers, the Delta P in each member is reduced, and the area of the stringer can be reduced to meet critical stress requirements. However, the increase in temperature caused by energy flowing from the air (heated by skin friction at these high speeds) adds another load factor, called a thermal load, to the spars. This thermal load increases the net force felt by the stringers, and thus the area of the stringers must be increased in order for the critical stress requirement to be met.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

Another issue that aerodynamic heating causes for aircraft design is the effect of high temperatures on common material properties. Common materials used in aircraft wing design, such as aluminum and steel, experience a decrease in strength as temperatures get extremely high. The Young’s Modulus of the material, defined as the ratio between stress and strain experienced by the material, decreases as the temperature increases. Young’s Modulus is critical in the selection of materials for wing, as a higher value lets the material resist the yield and shear stress caused by the lift and thermal loads. This is because Young's Modulus is an important factor in the equations for calculating the critical buckling load for axial members and the critical buckling shear stress for skin panels. If the Young’s Modulus of the material decreases at high temperatures caused by aerodynamic heating, then the wing design will call for larger spars and thicker skin segments in order to account for this decrease in strength as the aircraft goes supersonic. There are some materials that retain their strength at the high temperatures that aerodynamic heating induces. For example, Inconel X was used for the wing skins of the X-15, a North American aircraft that flew at hypersonic speeds in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisshaar |first=Dr. Terry A.|title=Aerospace Structures- an Introduction to Fundamental Problems |year=2011 |publisher=Purdue University |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titanium is another high-strength material, even at high temperatures, and is often used for wing frames of supersonic aircraft. The [[SR-71]] used titanium skin panels painted black to reduce the temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rich |first1=Ben R. |last2=Janos |first2=Leo |title=Skunk works: a personal memoir of my years at Lockheed |year=1994 |publisher=Warner Books |isbn=0751515035 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and corrugated to accommodate expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Clarence L. |last2=Smith |first2=Maggie |title=Kelly: more than my share of it all |year=1985 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0874744911|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important design concept for early supersonic aircraft wings was using a small [[thickness-to-chord ratio]], so that the speed of the flow over the airfoil does not increase too much from the free stream speed. As the flow is already supersonic, increasing the speed even more would not be beneficial for the wing structure. Reducing the thickness of the wing brings the top and bottom stringers closer together, reducing the total moment of inertia of the structure. This increases is axial load in the stringers, and thus the area, and weight, of the stringers must be increased. Some designs for hypersonic missiles have used liquid cooling of the [[leading edge]]s (usually the fuel en route to the engine). The [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint missile]]'s heat shield needed several design iterations for Mach 10 temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Bell Labs 1974, 9-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reentry vehicles ==
Heating caused by the very high reentry speeds (greater than [[Mach number|Mach]] 20) is sufficient to destroy the vehicle unless special techniques are used. The early space capsules such as used on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] were given blunt shapes to produce a stand-off bow shock, allowing most of the heat to dissipate into the surrounding air. Additionally, these vehicles had ablative material that [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]]s into a gas at high temperature. The act of sublimation absorbs the thermal energy from the aerodynamic heating and erodes the material away as opposed to heating the capsule. The surface of the heat shield for the Mercury spacecraft had a coating of aluminum with glassfiber in many layers. As the temperature rose to {{convert|1100|C|K|sigfig=2}} the layers would evaporate and take the heat with it. The spacecraft would become hot but not harmfully so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Project Mercury Worked |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/project-mercury2.htm |website=How Stuff Works |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle]] used insulating [[tile]]s on its lower surface to absorb and radiate heat while preventing conduction to the aluminum [[airframe]].  The damage to the heat shield during liftoff of [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' contributed to its [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction]] upon reentry.

'''Aircraft-specific energy''' is a form of [[specific energy]] applied to aircraft and missile [[trajectory]] analysis. It represents the combined [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and potential energy of the vehicle at any given time. It is the total energy of the vehicle (relative to the Earth's surface) per unit weight of the vehicle and being independent of the mass of the vehicle provides a powerful tool for the design of optimal trajectories. Aircraft-specific energy is very similar to [[specific orbital energy]] except that it is expressed as a positive quantity.  A zero value of aircraft-specific energy represents an aircraft at rest on the Earth's surface, and increases as speed and altitude increases. Orbital specific energy is zero at infinite altitude and decreases as one approaches the surface of the earth.  As with other forms of specific energy, aircraft-specific energy is an [[intensive property]] and is represented in units of length since it is independent of the mass of the vehicle.

==Applications==
The field of [[trajectory optimization]] has made use of the concept since the 1950s in the form of energy analysis.  In this approach, the specific energy is defined as one of the dynamic states of the problem and is the slowest varying state. All other states such as altitude and flight path angle are approximated as infinitely fast compared to the specific energy dynamics. This assumption allow the solution of optimal trajectories in a relatively simple form.

The specific energy is computed by the total energy (as defined above relative the Earth's surface) divided by the mass of the vehicle. It is a key element in performance of aircraft and rockets. For a rocket flying vertically (in a vacuum), it is the [[apogee]] that the rocket would obtain. It is used extensively in [[Energy–maneuverability theory]] that is used to determine the optimal paths for aircraft in [[dogfight]]s.

The '''Amorgos [[oil spill]]''' began on 14 January 2001 near [[Kenting National Park]], off the southern [[coast]] of [[Taiwan]]. 
[[File:"Taiwanese residents collecting oil after the 'Amorgos' oil spill.jpeg".jpeg|thumbnail|Local Taiwanese residents manually collect fuel oil after the "Amorgos" oil spill incident]]

==Cause==

On 14 January 2001, the Greek [[merchant vessel]] ''Amorgos,'' lost power while en route from [[India]] to [[North China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santer|first1=Richard|title=AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident, Lungpan, Taiwan, 14th January 2001|url=http://www.itopf.com/news-and-events/archive/2001.html#AMORGOS|accessdate=10 January 2014|author2=Karen Purnell, Chantal Guénette|pages=3|date=February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier was transporting approximately 60,000 tons of [[iron ore]] and an estimated 1,000 to 1,150&lt;ref name="LexisNexis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chung|first=Lawrence|title=Taiwan races to avert an ecological disaster|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?oc=00240&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hgn=t&amp;lni=42BG-X7N0-0058-X1MJ&amp;hns=t&amp;perma=true&amp;hv=t&amp;hl=t&amp;csi=144965&amp;secondRedirectIndicator=true|accessdate=13 January 2014|newspaper=The Straits Times (Singapore)|date=10 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  tons of [[fuel oil]] when the ship suffered engine failure near [[Kenting National Park]], off the southernmost tip of [[Taiwan]].  The crew subsequently abandoned the ship, and all 25 crew members were rescued by the [[Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan)|Coast Guard Administration]] (CGA) of Taiwan.  Due to deteriorating weather and sea conditions, the hull of the ''Amorgos'' split, and oil began to leak from the vessel beginning 18 January 2010.&lt;ref name="Chiau 2005 1041–1047"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiau|first=Wen-Yen|title=Changes in the marine pollution management system in response to the Amorgos oil spill in Taiwan|journal=Maritime Pollution Bulletin|year=2005|volume=51|issue=8-12|pages=1041–1047|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X05001116|accessdate=10 January 2014|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.02.048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spillage and ecological effects==

Approximately 1,300 tons of fuel oil leaked from the ''Amorgos'' into the sea surrounding [[Kenting National Park]], causing major damage to the [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] and local [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Chiau 2005 1041–1047"/&gt;

[[Kenting National Park]] is an ecological attraction that draws millions of tourists each year due to its warm climate and its many natural phenomena, including [[limestone]] caves, [[monsoon]] forests and coastal [[rainforests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose |url=http://www.ktnp.gov.tw/eng/Purpose.aspx |accessdate=10 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115015858/http://www.ktnp.gov.tw/eng/Purpose.aspx |archivedate=15 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 4 to 5 kilometers of the [[Kenting National Park]] shoreline was oiled by the spillage, creating a hazardous environment for the 200 bird species and estimated 2,200 plant species within the park.&lt;ref name="AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Santer|first1=Richard|title=AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident, Lungpan, Taiwan, 14th January 2001|url=http://www.itopf.com/news-and-events/archive/documents/amorgos.pdf |author2=Karen Purnell, Chantal Guénette|pages=3|date=March 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Park officials reported that contaminated [[coral]] and dead fish, crabs, shrimp, and clams have washed ashore.&lt;ref name="LexisNexis"/&gt;

==Delayed response==

There were many factors that contributed to the delayed response and subsequent clean-up efforts concerning the ''Amorgos'' incident.

The spill took place about two months after the [[Marine Pollution Control Act]] (MPCA) of Taiwan was publicized.&lt;ref name="Chiau 2005 1041–1047"/&gt;   As a result, the spill occurred during a transitional period in which the [[Ministry of Transportation and Communications (Republic of China)|Ministry of Transportation and Communications]] (MOTC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the MOTC|url=http://www.motc.gov.tw/en/home.jsp?id=246&amp;parentpath=0,150|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Salvage Council for Maritime Disasters was delegating its authority to the [[Environmental Protection Administration (Republic of China)|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="Chiau 2005 1041–1047"/&gt;  The jurisdiction among the MOTC, CGA, and the EPA was unclear; therefore, it took longer for the EPA to open an investigation into the spill, allowing more time for the oil to cover a larger area and lay waste to maritime and coastal species.

The second factor was the observance of the [[Lunar New Year]] holidays, making it difficult for companies to hire local residents to clean up the mess. After the 5-day holiday, 40 local workers were hired in addition to 8000 soldiers commissioned to take part in the clean-up operations.&lt;ref name="Chiau 2005 1041–1047"/&gt;

The third factor was the severe weather conditions that hampered efforts to clean up the oil.&lt;ref name="AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident"/&gt; As a result, clean-up was restricted to manual retrieval of oil using buckets, hand nets, and [[scoop (tool)|scoop]]s.

==Clean-up timeline==

Of the 1,300 tons of [[fuel oil]] that was spilt, some has been lost due to natural [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] and [[evaporation]] by means of severe weather and rough seas. The [[oil]] was later [[emulsified]] due to the [[wave]] patterns which subsequently increased the area and volume of the spill.&lt;ref name="AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident"/&gt; Despite these occurrences, most of the [[oil]] reached the [[Lungkeng Ecological Preservation Area]] within the [[Kenting National Park]].&lt;ref name="LexisNexis"/&gt;

The affected [[shoreline]] consists of [[fossilized coral]] and various [[channel (geography)|channel]]s, making access to the oiled areas difficult.&lt;ref name="AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident"/&gt; As a result, manual collection of [[oil]] was the only feasible option.  [[Shoreline]] clean-up began on 25 January 2010, and lasted until about 14 February 2010, in which an estimated total of 300 tons of [[oil]] had been collected.&lt;ref name="AMORGOS, Oil Pollution Incident"/&gt;

==Lawsuit and settlement==

The [[EPA]] later sued [[Assuranceforeningen Gard]]—the Norwegian insurer of the ''Amorgos'' as a result of the damage caused by the [[oil spill]].  Instead, the [[EPA]] settled with [[Assuranceforeningen Gard]] in March 2006, resulting in the ship's owner agreeing to pay a total of [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]34 million ({{US$|1.05 million}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shan|first=Shelley|title=EPA settles oil spill suit with "Amorgos" insurer|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/08/13/2003322975|accessdate=11 January 2014|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=13 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, [[evergreen]] leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] within their range, from [[rainforest]]s to [[desert]]s.

Palms are among the best known and most extensively [[Horticulture|cultivated]] plant families. They have been important to humans throughout much of history. Many common products and foods are derived from palms. In contemporary times, palms are also widely used in landscaping, making them one of the most economically important plants. In many historical cultures, because of their importance as food, palms were [[Palm branch (symbol)|symbols]] for such ideas as victory, peace, and fertility.

Whether as shrubs, trees, or vines, palms have two methods of growth: solitary or clustered. The common representation is that of a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This [[monopodial]] character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include ''[[Washingtonia]]'' and ''[[Roystonea]]''. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively [[sympodial]] genera include many of the [[rattan]]s, ''[[Guihaia]]'', and ''[[Rhapis]]''. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters and vice versa. These aberrations suggest the habit operates on a single gene.&lt;ref name=uhl&gt;Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) ''Genera Palmarum – A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E.

Palms have large, evergreen leaves that are either palmately ('fan-leaved') or pinnately ('feather-leaved') compound and spirally arranged at the top of the stem. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side at maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/arec.htm Arecaceae – University of Hawaii Botany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424052701/http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/carr/arec.htm |date=2006-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[inflorescence]] is a [[spadix (botany)|spadix]] or [[spike (botany)|spike]] surrounded by one or more [[bract]]s or [[spathe]]s that become woody at maturity.

Most palms are native to tropical and subtropical climates. Palms thrive in moist and hot climates but can be found in a variety of different habitats. Their diversity is highest in wet, lowland forests. South America, the Caribbean, and areas of the south Pacific and southern Asia are regions of concentration. Colombia may have the highest number of palm species in one country. There are some palms that are also native to desert areas such as the Arabian peninsula and parts of northwestern Mexico. Only about 130 palm species naturally grow entirely beyond the tropics, mostly in humid lowland subtropical climates, in highlands in southern Asia, and along the rim lands of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The northernmost native palm is ''[[Chamaerops|Chamaerops humilis]]'', which reaches 44°N latitude in along the coast of southern [[France]].&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/X0451E/X0451e03.htm Tropical Palms by Food and Agriculture Organization]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506005013/http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=%2Fdocrep%2FX0451E%2FX0451e03.htm |date=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern hemisphere, the southernmost palm is the ''[[nikau|Rhopalostylis sapida]]'', which reaches 44°S on the [[Chatham Islands]] where an [[oceanic climate]] prevails.&lt;ref name = "FAO"/&gt; Cultivation of palms is possible north of subtropical climates, and some higher latitude locals such as [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[England]], and the [[Pacific Northwest]] feature a few palms in protected locations.

Palms inhabit a variety of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and shorter ones form part of the [[understory]].&lt;ref name = "VPEintro"/&gt; Some species form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding, including ''Raphia hookeri'' which is common in coastal freshwater swamps in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above 1000&amp;nbsp;m, such as those in the genus ''[[Ceroxylon]]'' native to the [[Andes]]. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert [[oasis|oases]] such as the [[date palm]]. A few palms are adapted to extremely [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[lime (mineral)|lime]] soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme [[Potassium deficiency (plants)|potassium deficiency]] and toxicity of heavy metals in [[serpentine soil]]s.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

Palms are a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group of plants, meaning the group consists of a common ancestor and all its descendants.&lt;ref name = "VPEintro"/&gt; Extensive taxonomic research on palms began with botanist H.E. Moore, who organized palms into 15 major groups based mostly on general morphological characteristics. The following classification, proposed by N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield in 1987, is a revision of Moore's classification that organizes palms into six subfamilies.&lt;ref&gt;N. W. Uhl, J. Dransfield (1987). ''Genera palmarum: a classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore, Jr.'' (Allen Press, Lawrence, Kansas).&lt;/ref&gt;

* Coryphoideae
* Calamoideae
* Nypoideae
* Ceroxyloideae
* Arecoideae
* Phytelephantoideae

A few general traits of each subfamily are listed below.

The '''Coryphoideae''' are the most diverse subfamily, and are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group, meaning all members of the group share a common ancestor, but the group does not include all the ancestor's descendants. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four [[carpel]]s. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.

Subfamily '''Calamoideae''' includes the climbing palms, such as rattans. The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters ([[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, an extension of the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.

Subfamily '''Nypoideae''' contains only one species, ''Nypa fruticans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Palms: Biogeography, Ecology and Systematics|author=John Leslie Dowe|url=https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Nypoideae&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GLh89V2U04&amp;sig=-rXN3kSbWv1-bOs8xgcDThEfC84&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ekWRT4iCJ4TeigfavvSJBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nypoideae&amp;f=false|page=83|accessdate=April 20, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202163500/http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=Fk5ud3uuLW8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=Nypoideae&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GLh89V2U04&amp;sig=-rXN3kSbWv1-bOs8xgcDThEfC84&amp;hl=vi&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ekWRT4iCJ4TeigfavvSJBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Nypoideae&amp;f=false|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has large, pinnate leaves. The fruit is unusual in that it floats, and the stem is dichotomously branched, also unusual in palms.

Subfamily '''Ceroxyloideae''' has small to medium-sized flowers, spirally arranged, with a [[gynoecium]] of three joined carpels.

The '''Arecoideae''' are the largest subfamily, with six diverse tribes ([[Areceae]], [[Caryoteae]], [[Cocoseae]], [[Geonomeae]], [[Iriarteeae]], and [[Podococceae]]) containing over 100 genera. All tribes have pinnate or bipinnate leaves and flowers arranged in groups of three, with a central pistillate and two staminate flowers.

The '''Phytelephantoideae''' are a [[monoecious]] subfamily. Members of this group have distinct monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts.&lt;ref name = "UA"/&gt;

Currently, few extensive phylogenetic studies of the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker'' et al.'' explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast [[DNA]] from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested the lack of a fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, [[homoplasy]] in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard [[DNA marker]]s, and character polarization.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, W.J. (2002). ''A Molecular Phylogenetic Study of the Palmae (Arecaceae) Based on atpB, rbcL, and 18S nrDNA Sequences (Systematic Botany 51(1): 92–112).&lt;/ref&gt; However, hybridization has been observed among ''Orbignya'' and ''Phoenix'' species, and using chloroplast DNA in cladistic studies may produce inaccurate results due to maternal inheritance of the chloroplast DNA. Chemical and molecular data from non-organelle DNA, for example, could be more effective for studying palm phylogeny.&lt;ref name="UA"&gt;[http://arboretum.arizona.edu/palms.htm Palms on the University of Arizona Campus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621003136/http://arboretum.arizona.edu/palms.htm |date=June 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The Arecaceae are the first modern family of monocots appearing in the fossil record around 80&amp;nbsp;million years ago (Mya), during the late [[Cretaceous]] period. The first modern species, such as ''Nypa fruticans'' and ''[[Acrocomia|Acrocomia aculeata]]'', appeared 94&amp;nbsp;Mya, confirmed by fossil ''Nypa'' pollen dated to 94&amp;nbsp;Mya. Palms appear to have undergone an early period of [[adaptive radiation]]. By 60&amp;nbsp;Mya, many of the modern, specialized genera of palms appeared and became widespread and common, much more widespread than their range today. Because palms separated from the monocots earlier than other families, they developed more intrafamilial specialization and diversity. By tracing back these diverse characteristics of palms to the basic structures of monocots, palms may be valuable in studying monocot evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/evolution/vpe_evolution.htm Virtual Palm Encyclopedia – Evolution and the fossil record] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418044328/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/evolution/vpe_evolution.htm |date=2006-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several species of palms have been identified from flowers preserved in amber, including ''[[Palaeoraphe|Palaeoraphe dominicana]]'' and ''[[Roystonea palaea]]''.&lt;ref name="Poinar2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poinar |first1=G. |year=2002 |title= Fossil palm flowers in Dominican and Baltic amber|journal= Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=139 |issue = 4 |pages=361–367 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8339.2002.00052.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence can also be found in samples of [[petrified palmwood]].

*[[Carnauba]] wax is harvested from the leaves of a Brazilian palm (''Copernicia'').
*[[Rattan]]s, whose stems are used extensively in [[furniture]] and [[basket]]s, are in the genus ''Calamus''.
*[[Palm oil]] is an edible vegetable oil produced by the [[oil palm]]s in the genus ''[[Elaeis]]''.
*Several species are harvested for [[heart of palm]], a vegetable eaten in salads.
*Sap of the nipa palm ''Nypa''  is used to make vinegar.
*Palm [[Sap (plant)|sap]] is sometimes [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to produce [[palm wine]] or toddy, an [[alcoholic beverage]] common in parts of Africa, India, and the [[Philippines]]. It is also drunk, fresh, as ''neera'', and is a refreshing drink that is consumed until sundown, after which it starts to ferment.
*Palmyra and date palm sap is harvested in Bengal, India, to process into ''gur'' and ''jaggery''.
*[[Dragon's blood]], a red resin used traditionally in [[medicine]], [[varnish]], and [[dye]]s, may be obtained from the fruit of ''[[Daemonorops]]'' species.
*[[Coconut]] is the partially edible seed of the fruit of the coconut palm (''Cocos nucifera'').
*[[Coir]] is a coarse, water-resistant fiber extracted from the outer shell of coconuts, used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes. In India, beekeepers use coir in their bee smokers.
*Some indigenous groups living in palm-rich areas use palms to make many of their necessary items and food. [[Sago]], for example, a [[starch]] made from the pith of the trunk of the sago palm ''[[Metroxylon sagu]]'', is a major [[staple food]] for lowland peoples of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Moluccas]]. This is not the same plant commonly used as a house plant and called "sago palm".
*Palm wine is made from ''[[Jubaea]]'' also called Chilean wine palm, or coquito palm
*Recently, the fruit of the açaí palm ''[[Açaí Palm|Euterpe]]''  has been used for its reputed health benefits.
*Saw palmetto (''Serenoa repens'') is under investigation as a drug for treating enlarged prostates.
*Palm leaves are also valuable to some peoples as a material for thatching, basketry, clothing, and in religious ceremonies (see "Symbolism" below).&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

*Ornamental uses: Today, palms are valuable as [[ornamental plant]]s and are often grown along streets in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] cities. Farther north, palms are a common feature in [[botanical gardens]] or as indoor plants. Few palms tolerate severe cold and the majority of the species are tropical or subtropical. The three most [[hardy palms|cold-tolerant species]] are ''[[Trachycarpus fortunei]]'', native to eastern Asia, and ''[[Rhapidophyllum hystrix]]'' and ''[[Sabal minor]]'', both native to the southeastern United States.
*The southeastern U.S. state of [[South Carolina]] is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the [[sabal palmetto]] (cabbage palmetto), logs from which were used to build the fort at [[Fort Moultrie National Monument|Fort Moultrie]]. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], they were invaluable to those defending the fort, because their spongy wood absorbed or deflected the British cannonballs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/fomo/2_History/FOMO%20RevWar%20Exhibit%20Text.pdf Revolutionary War Exhibit Text – November 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110143616/http://www.nps.gov/fomo/2_History/FOMO%20RevWar%20Exhibit%20Text.pdf |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[Image:Pritchardia affinis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|right|''[[Pritchardia affinis]]'', a critically endangered species endemic to the [[Hawaiian Islands]]]]
Like many other plants, palms have been threatened by [[human impact on the environment|human intervention]] and [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]]. The greatest risk to palms is [[habitat destruction|destruction of habitat]], especially in the [[tropical forest]]s, due to [[urbanization]], [[wood-chipping]], [[mining]], and [[conversion to farmland]]. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it is derived from the palm's [[apical meristem]], a vital part of the palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of [[peach palm]]).&lt;ref name="KaheleHeartsHanaHou"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=591&amp;MagazineID=38 |title= Big Island Hearts |author= Rose Kahele |work= [[Hana Hou!]] Vol. 10, No. 4 |date= August–September 2007 |accessdate= 2016-08-14 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160826100500/http://www.hanahou.com/pages/Magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&amp;ArticleID=591&amp;MagazineID=38 |archivedate= 2016-08-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[rattan palm]]s in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Palms: Their Conservation and Sustained Utilization | year = 1996 | editor = Dennis Johnson | publisher = International Union for Conservation of Nature | isbn = 2-8317-0352-2 | url = http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Act_Plans/Executive_Summary_Palms_Action_Plan_EN.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114055220/http://intranet.iucn.org/webfiles/doc/SSC/SSCwebsite/Act_Plans/Executive_Summary_Palms_Action_Plan_EN.pdf | archivedate = 2009-01-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.&lt;ref name = "VPEintro"/&gt;

However, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo. Using botanical gardens for conservation also presents problems, since they can only house a few plants of any species or truly imitate the natural setting.&lt;ref name = "VPEconserv"/&gt; Also, the risk of cross-pollination can lead to hybrid species.

The Palm Specialist Group of the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) began in 1984, and has performed a series of three studies to find basic information on the status of palms in the wild, use of wild palms, and palms under cultivation. Two projects on palm conservation and use supported by the [[WWF (conservation organization)|World Wildlife Fund]] took place from 1985 to 1990 and 1986–1991, in the American tropics and southeast Asia, respectively. Both studies produced copious new data and publications on palms. Preparation of a global action plan for palm conservation began in 1991, supported by the IUCN, and was published in 1996.&lt;ref name="VPEconserv"&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/Vpe/conservation/vpe_conservation2.htm Palm Conservation: Its Atecedents, Status, and Needs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815153142/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/conservation/vpe_conservation2.htm |date=2006-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarest palm known is ''[[Hyophorbe amaricaulis]]''. The only living individual remains at the Botanic Gardens of Curepipe in [[Mauritius]].

==Arthropod pests==

==Symbolism==
{{Main article|Palm branch (symbol)}}

The palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in pre-Christian times. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] rewarded champions of the games and celebrated military successes with palm branches. Early [[Christian]]s used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the [[Palm Sunday]] festival celebrating the triumphal entry of [[Jesus]] into [[Jerusalem]]. In [[Judaism]], the palm represents peace and plenty, and is one of the [[Lulav|Four Species]] of [[Sukkot]]; the palm may also symbolize the [[Tree of Life]] in [[Kabbalah]].

Panaiveriyamman was an ancient Tamil [[tree deity]] related to [[fertility]].  Named after ''panai'', the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] name for the [[Palmyra palm]], she was also known as Taalavaasini, a name that further related her to all types of palms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm Symbolism of trees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123204004/http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm |date=2016-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the palm, especially the coconut palm, remains a symbol of the tropical island [[paradise]].&lt;ref name="VPEintro"&gt;[http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/introduction/vpe_introduction.htm Virtual Palm Encyclopedia – Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719185520/http://www.plantapalm.com/vpe/introduction/vpe_introduction.htm |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Palms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of [[Coat of arms of Haiti|Haiti]], [[Coat of arms of Guam|Guam]], [[Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Seal of Florida|Florida]], and [[Flag of South Carolina|South Carolina]].

==Other plants==
Some species commonly called palms, though they are not true palms, include:
*''[[Cordyline australis]]''&lt;ref name="FAO Tropical Palms" /&gt; (Torbay palm, ti palm,&lt;ref name="FAO Tropical Palms" /&gt; palm lily&lt;ref name="FAO Tropical Palms" /&gt;) (family [[Asparagaceae]]) and other representatives in the genus ''[[Cordyline]]'' and perhaps also in ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' with which ''Cordyline'' may be confused.

The '''Australian Coal Association''' ('''ACA''') is the major [[Australian coal]] mining industry [[lobby group]]. It represents the [[black coal]] producers of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]] and consists of a number of relatively small coal mining companies or subsidiaries of larger corporations in those two states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newgencoal.com.au NewGenCoal website]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is the world's largest coal exporter, and black coal is Australia's second largest commodity export, worth more than A$24 billion in  the financial year ending June 2008, and $46 billion, or nearly double this amount, for the corresponding calendar year ending December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abareconomics.com/publications_html/ams/ams_09/ams_jun09.pdf Australian Mineral Statistics – March Quarter 2009, Australian Bureau of Resource and Agricultural Economics (ABARE) PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  Black coal provides around 57 per cent of Australia's grid-connected electricity ([[Lignite|brown coal]] around 24%) and is vital for major industries such as steel making and cement manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esaa.com.au/the_energy_industry:_facts_in_brief.html/ "The Energy Industry: Facts in Brief” – Energy Supply Association of Australia (ESAA)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302070223/http://www.esaa.com.au/the_energy_industry%3A_facts_in_brief.html/ |date=2 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2013, the Australian Coal Association released a statement that it will be subsumed into the Minerals Council of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiancoal.com.au/latest-news-feed/227-23-august-2013-integration-of-national-mining-representative-groups.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104215837/http://www.australiancoal.com.au/latest-news-feed/227-23-august-2013-integration-of-national-mining-representative-groups.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Coal Association and the environment==
The Australian Coal Association acknowledges that 34 per cent of [[contribution to global warming by Australia|Australia's greenhouse gas emissions]] come from burning black and brown coal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2008/s2575402.htm/ Transcript: Australian Coal Association's executive director, Ralph Hillman on Lateline, 19 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for the generation of electricity, but also for steel-making and cement manufacture. In 2003, the coal industry established the COAL21 initiative, bringing together the coal and electric power industries, unions, federal and state governments, and research organisations. Supported through a voluntary company levy, the $1 billion+ commitment will support research, development and demonstration of low-emissions coal technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newgencoal.com.au Coal21 fund]&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is at the forefront of the development of these technologies. To date, the COAL21 Fund has made commitments of more than $500 million to a number of active and in-development [[carbon capture and storage]] research projects. However, critics of the ACA have argued that “no other economy is as dependent on coal exports as ours, so why would anyone else feel the same imperative to lead?” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24677698-5017909,00.html/ Bury the idea of clean coal: Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemical ecology''' examines the role of chemical interactions between living organisms and their environment, and the consequences of those interactions on the ethology and evolution of the organisms involved. It is thus a vast and highly interdisciplinary field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncbs.res.in/ChemicalEcology/WhatIsChemicalEcology |title=What is Chemical Ecology? {{!}} CHEMICAL ECOLOGY |publisher=NCBS |access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Lee A.|last2=Philbin|first2=Casey S.|last3=Ochsenrider|first3=Kaitlin M.|last4=Richards|first4=Lora A.|last5=Massad|first5=Tara J.|last6=Smilanich|first6=Angela M.|last7=Forister|first7=Matthew L.|last8=Parchman|first8=Thomas L.|last9=Galland|first9=Lanie M.|date=2018-05-25|title=Modern approaches to study plant–insect interactions in chemical ecology|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry|volume=2|issue=6|pages=50–64|doi=10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|issn=2397-3358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chemical ecology studies focus on the biochemistry of ecology and the specific [[molecule]]s or groups of molecules that function as signals to initiate, modulate, or terminate a variety of biological processes such as metabolism. Molecules that serve in such roles typically are readily [[diffusion|diffusible]] organic [[organic chemical|substances]] of low [[molecular weight|molecular mass]] that derive from [[secondary metabolism|secondary metabolic pathway]]s, but also include [[peptides]]. Chemical ecological processes mediated by semiochemicals may be intraspecific (occurring within a species) or [[Interspecies communication|interspecific]] (occurring between species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Law, JH; Regnier, FE | year=1971 | title=Pheromones |journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume=40 | pages=533–548 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.40.070171.002533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical Ecology of Plants ==
Chemical ecology in plants is the study that integrates the chemistry and biological properties of the plants and their interaction with the environment (i.e. microorganisms, phytophagous insects) and their antagonists. Chemical ecology in plants mainly focuses on how plants fight against herbivory by producing various [[Phytochemical|phytochemical compounds]]. This results from the chemistry of the plants and also various chemical relationships that plants with other subgroups such as fungi and bacteria through various [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Lee A.|last2=Philbin|first2=Casey S.|last3=Ochsenrider|first3=Kaitlin M.|last4=Richards|first4=Lora A.|last5=Massad|first5=Tara J.|last6=Smilanich|first6=Angela M.|last7=Forister|first7=Matthew L.|last8=Parchman|first8=Thomas L.|last9=Galland|first9=Lanie M.|date=2018-05-25|title=Modern approaches to study plant–insect interactions in chemical ecology|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-018-0009-7.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry|language=En|volume=2|issue=6|pages=50–64|doi=10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|issn=2397-3358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the primary aerial parts of terrestrial plants is covered by a thin waxy structure known as the [[cuticle]], which has the crucial [[Autecology|autecological]] functions and also plays an important role as an interface in trophic interactions. The cuticle is composed of the cuticular layer and the cuticle proper, which is covered by [[Epicuticular wax|epicuticular waxes]]. Whereas the [[cutin]] fraction is a polyester-type [[biopolymer]] composed of hydroxyl and hydroxy epoxy fatty acids, the cuticular waxes are a complex mixture of long-chain [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] and cyclic compounds. These highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] compounds determine the [[Hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic]] quality of the plant surface and together with the microstructure of the waxes, vary in a species-specific manner. The physiochemical characteristics contribute to certain optical features, limit transpiration and influence adhesion of particles and organisms, and as a result prevents it from undergoing [[wilting]]. Apart from that the cuticle acts like a skin for plants which prevents any mechanical damage to them from the external sources which either living organisms or any other abiotic component.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Caroline|last2=Riederer|first2=Markus|title=Plant Surface Properties in Chemical Ecology|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10886-005-7617-7.pdf|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=11|doi=10.1007/s10886-005-7617-7.pdf|issn=0098-0331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various ways in which chemical ecology can be evidenced in plants, such as the relationship between [[Fungus|fungi]] and plants is called [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizae]]. Fungi produces a chemical which [[Decomposition|decomposes]] organic matter to which enable the plant roots to increase its surface area to obtain to those nutrients through the help of the [[Root hair|root hairs]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs-rsc-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/en/content/articlepdf/2015/np/c4np00166d|title=Memorial University Libraries - Proxy Login|website=pubs-rsc-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactions with Microorganisms ===
The most important thing that makes it possible for [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] to interact with the plants is their ability to establish themselves on the plants surface. In order for the living organisms to establish onto the surface of the plants they need to break the hydrophobic layer of the plant. To do this, the microorganisms secrete special fluids which break down the fats from the cuticle. As a result they are able to establish themselves over the surface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Growth in Plants ===
Most of the [[Hormone|hormones]] in plants are concentrated on their tips. The [[Auxin|auxin hormones]] are responsible for growth of plants and are stimulated by certain stimulus such as light. This phenomenon is called [[phototropism]]. This growth enables the plant to obtain essentials such as sunlight which is very necessary for the [[photosynthesis]].  Therefore, the cuticle is one of the fundamental parts of the plant due to its physical and chemical properties such as waxy and thin like structure that enables it to be adapted to various mechanism such as [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], interactions with microorganisms and growth of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GsAJUo2BsTMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=chemical+ecology+plants&amp;ots=zzhqQ3bDBB&amp;sig=m9pFUkXLX9fFPTtEhqCpaEWV1l0#v=onepage&amp;q=chemical%20ecology%20plants&amp;f=false|title=Chemical Ecology|last=Sondheimer|first=Ernest|date=2012-12-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323154666|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Chlaenius Plate 10 Eisner et al 1963.png|thumb|Series from a study by [[Thomas Eisner|Eisner]] and colleagues investigating [[Chemical defense|defensive]] spray in [[Bombardier beetle|bombardier beetles]].

=== Plant-Insect Interaction ===
The chemical ecology of plant-insect interaction is a significant subfield of chemical ecology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mithfer|first=Axel|title=Chemical Ecology of Plant–Insect Interactions|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781444301441.ch9|work=Molecular Aspects of Plant Disease Resistance|pages=261–291|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444301441.ch9|isbn=9781444301441|access-date=2018-08-21|last2=Boland|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Maffei|first3=Massimo E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Lee A.|last2=Philbin|first2=Casey S.|last3=Ochsenrider|first3=Kaitlin M.|last4=Richards|first4=Lora A.|last5=Massad|first5=Tara J.|last6=Smilanich|first6=Angela M.|last7=Forister|first7=Matthew L.|last8=Parchman|first8=Thomas L.|last9=Galland|first9=Lanie M.|date=2018-05-25|title=Modern approaches to study plant–insect interactions in chemical ecology|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-018-0009-7|journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry|language=En|volume=2|issue=6|pages=50–64|doi=10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|issn=2397-3358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, plants and insects are often involved in a chemical [[evolutionary arms race]]. As plants develop chemical defences to herbivory, insects which feed on them evolve immunity to these poisons, and in some cases, re-purpose these poisons for their own [[Chemical defense|chemical defence]] against predators. One of the more well-known examples of this is the [[monarch butterfly]], the caterpillars of which feed on the [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant. Milkweeds contain [[cardenolide]] toxins, but monarch butterfly caterpillars have [[Evolutionary arms race|evolved]] to remain unaffected by the toxin. Instead, they sequester the toxins during their larval stage and the poison remains in the adult, making it unpalatable to predators. Many other such examples of this exist, including ''[[Manduca sexta]]'' (hawkmoth) caterpillars which actively sequester [[nicotine]] found in the [[Nicotiana|tobacco plant]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[Utetheisa ornatrix|Bella moth]], which secrets a [[quinone]]-containing froth from its head when disturbed by a potential predator obtained from feeding on ''[[Crotalaria]]'' species as a caterpillar.

== Marine Chemical Ecology ==
Marine Chemical Ecology is how organic life in the marine environment use chemicals to eat, interact, reproduce and survive, ranging from microscopic phytoplankton to the many species of crustaceans, sponges, coral and fish.

=== Defence ===
The use of chemicals are often used a means of survival for marine organisms. Some [[Crustacean|crustaceans]] and [[Mesograzer|mesograzers]] use particular [[algae]] and seaweeds as a means of deterrence by covering their bodies in the these plants. These plants produce [[Alcohol|alcohols]] such as pachydictyol-A and dictyol-E, which prevent the [[predation]] of the crustacean. When this seaweed is absent, or another seaweed without these alcohols are worn, the rate that these crustaceans are eaten is much higher. Other crustaceans use their natural defences in conjuncture with produced chemicals to defend themselves. Chemicals within their urine help coordinate them into groups. This combined with their spikes make them a much harder target for predators&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hay|first=Mark E.|date=2009|title=Marine Chemical Ecology: Chemical Signals and Cues Structure Marine Populations, Communities, and Ecosystems|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380104/|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=1|pages=193–212|issn=1941-1405|pmc=3380104|pmid=21141035}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others secrete [[mucus]] or [[Toxin|toxins]] that make it difficult for predators to eat them, such as the [[Pardachirus marmoratus]] that use a toxin capable of paralyzing the jaws of a would-be predator. Simply being a certain colour can serve as a defence mechanism, such as some [[Zoantharia|zoanthids]] displaying a wide range of colours. This suggests that they may be toxic to eat, whether they are or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakus|first=Gerald J.|last2=Targett|first2=Nancy M.|last3=Schulte|first3=Bruce|title=Chemical ecology of marine organisms: An overview|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01638991.pdf|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|doi=10.1007/bf01638991.pdf|issn=0098-0331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
The release of chemicals are very important to coordinate marine organisms to reproduce. Some processes are relatively simple, such as attracting one individual to another. Male [[Lamprey|lampreys]] attract ovulating females by emitting a bile that can be detected many metres downstream. Other processes can be more complex, such as the mating habits of crabs. Due to the fact that mating can only be done shortly after the female [[Moulting|moults]] from her shell, [[Pheromone|pheromones]] are produced before and after the moulting process. Male crabs will find and defend the potential mate until the shell has moulted. However due to the cabalistic tendencies of crabs, an additional pheromone is produced to suppresses this urge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dominance ===
Determining dominance among crustaceans are very closely tied to chemical cues. When crustaceans fight to determine dominance they release urine, which helps to determine the victor. After a fight as concluded both individuals will recognize each other in the future through urine, remembering who is the dominant of the two and thereby avoiding a fight. This can also have an impact on future fights. When an individual is exposed to the urine of a dominant crustacean they will act more submissive, and the opposite effect when they are exposed to the urine of a subdominant individual. When individuals are unable to communicate through urine fights can be more unpredictable, resulting in longer fights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Image:Topo.jpg|thumb|350px|The thickness of [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]] (km)]]

'''Continental crust''' is the layer of [[Igneous rock|igneous]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]], and [[metamorphic rocks]] that forms the [[continent]]s and the areas of shallow seabed close to their shores, known as [[Continental shelf|continental shelves]]. This layer is sometimes called ''[[sial]]'' because its bulk composition is richer in silicates and aluminium minerals and has a lower density compared to the [[oceanic crust]], called ''[[Sima (geology)|sima]]'' which is richer in magnesium silicate minerals and is denser. Changes in [[seismic wave]] velocities have shown that at a certain depth (the [[Conrad discontinuity]]), there is a reasonably sharp contrast between the more [[felsic]] upper continental crust and the lower continental crust, which is more [[mafic]] in character.

The continental crust consists of various layers, with a bulk composition that is [[Intermediate composition|intermediate]] to felsic. The average density of continental crust is about 2.7&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, less [[density|dense]] than the ultramafic material that makes up the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], which has a density of around 3.3&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Continental crust is also less dense than oceanic crust, whose density is about 2.9&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. At 25 to 70&amp;nbsp;km, continental crust is considerably thicker than oceanic crust, which has an average thickness of around 7–10&amp;nbsp;km. About 40% of Earth's surface is currently occupied by continental crust.&lt;ref name="Cogley-1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Cogley|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It makes up about 70% of the volume of [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawkesworth|Dhuime|Pietranik|Cawood|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Because the surface of continental crust mainly lies above sea level, its existence allowed land life to evolve from marine life. Its existence also provides broad expanses of shallow water known as [[epeiric seas]] and [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] where complex [[metazoa]]n life could become established during early [[Paleozoic]] time, in what is now called the [[Cambrian explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cambrian Period|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cambrian/cambrian.php|work=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=30 November 2013|author=Ben Waggoner|author2=Allen Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
All continental crust ultimately derives from the [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional differentiation]] of oceanic crust over many millions of years.&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;Hart, P. J., ''Earth's Crust and Upper Mantle,'' American Geophysical Union, 1969, pp. 13-15 {{ISBN|978-0-87590-013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has occurred, and continues to occur today, primarily as a result of the volcanism associated with [[subduction]].

There is little evidence of continental crust prior to 3.5 Ga.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; About 20% of the continental crust's current volume was formed by 3.0 Ga.&lt;ref name="McCann2008"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Geology of Central Europe: Volume 1: Precambrian and Palaeozoic | publisher=[[The Geological Society]] | author=McCann, T. (editor) | year=2008 | location=London | page=22 | isbn=978-1-86239-245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was relatively rapid development on [[Shield (geology)|shield]] areas consisting of continental crust between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt; During this time interval, about 60% of the continental crust's current volume was formed.&lt;ref name="McCann2008"/&gt; The remaining 20% has formed during the last 2.5 Ga.

==Forces at work==
In contrast to the persistence of continental crust, the size, shape, and number of continents are constantly changing through geologic time. Different tracts rift apart, collide and recoalesce as part of a grand [[supercontinent cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Condie|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are currently about 7 billion cubic kilometers of continental crust, but this quantity varies because of the nature of the forces involved. The relative permanence of continental crust contrasts with the short life of oceanic crust. Because continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust, when active margins of the two meet in [[subduction zone]]s, the oceanic crust is typically subducted back into the mantle. Continental crust is rarely subducted (this may occur where continental crustal blocks collide and overthicken, causing deep melting under mountain belts such as the [[Himalayas]] or the [[Alps]]). For this reason the oldest rocks on Earth are within the [[craton]]s or cores of the continents, rather than in repeatedly [[Crustal recycling|recycled oceanic crust]]; the oldest intact crustal fragment is the [[Acasta Gneiss]] at 4.01 [[Gigaannus|Ga]], whereas the oldest oceanic crust (located on the [[Pacific Plate]] offshore of [[Kamchatka]]) is from the [[Jurassic]] (~180 [[Year|Ma]]). Continental crust and the rock layers that lie on and within it are thus the best archive of Earth's history.&lt;ref name="Cogley-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowring|Williams|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of mountain ranges is usually related to the thickness of crust. This results from the [[isostasy]] associated with [[orogeny]] (mountain formation). The crust is thickened by the compressive forces related to subduction or continental collision. The buoyancy of the crust forces it upwards, the forces of the collisional stress balanced by gravity and erosion. This forms a keel or mountain root beneath the mountain range, which is where the thickest crust is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saal|Rudnick|Ravizza|Hart|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thinnest continental crust is found in [[rift]] zones, where the crust is thinned by [[detachment fault]]ing and eventually severed, replaced by oceanic crust. The edges of continental fragments formed this way (both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], for example) are termed [[passive margin]]s.

The high temperatures and pressures at depth, often combined with a long history of complex distortion, cause much of the lower continental crust to be metamorphic - the main exception to this being recent igneous [[intrusion]]s. Igneous rock may also be "underplated" to the underside of the crust, i.e. adding to the crust by forming a layer immediately beneath it.

Continental crust is produced and (far less often) destroyed mostly by [[plate tectonic]] processes, especially at [[convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]]. Additionally, continental crustal material is transferred to oceanic crust by sedimentation. New material can be added to the continents by the partial melting of oceanic crust at subduction zones, causing the lighter material to rise as magma, forming volcanoes. Also, material can be accreted horizontally when volcanic [[island arcs]], [[seamount]]s or similar structures collide with the side of the continent as a result of plate tectonic movements. Continental crust is also lost through erosion and sediment subduction, tectonic erosion of forearcs, delamination, and deep subduction of continental crust in collision zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clift|Vannuchi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many theories of crustal growth are controversial, including rates of crustal growth and recycling, whether the lower crust is recycled differently from the upper crust, and over how much of Earth history plate tectonics has operated and so could be the dominant mode of continental crust formation and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a matter of debate whether the amount of continental crust has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over geological time. One model indicates that at prior to 3.7 Ga ago continental crust constituted less than 10% of the present amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Huene|Scholl|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 3.0 Ga ago the amount was about 25%, and following a period of rapid crustal evolution it was about 60% of the current amount by 2.6 Ga ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|McLennan|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of continental crust appears to have occurred in ''spurts'' of increased activity corresponding to five episodes of increased production through geologic time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2011| loc=See graphic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Fraser McTaggart''' (June 24, 1932 – March 23, 2001) was a Canadian-born [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] who played a central part in the foundation of [[Greenpeace International]].

An excellent all-around athlete, as a young man he won three consecutive [[Canadian National Badminton Championships]] in men's singles (1956–1958) and represented that country in badminton's [[Thomas Cup]] (men's world team championship) competition. Prior to his involvement in Greenpeace he had prospered as a builder and developer.

In 1972, responding to an ad in the newspapers, he used his personal boat to [[protest]] the testing of [[nuclear weapons]] in the [[Pacific]] by the [[French government]]. After getting his boat damaged and being physically hurt by the French Military, his protest succeeded in 1974 when the French announced the end of their atmospheric [[nuclear testing]] program.  McTaggart spent the next several years pursuing legal action against the French government and assisting in the formation of Greenpeace affiliates across Western Europe. In 1979 he brokered an agreement that led to the formation of Greenpeace International, ending the leadership of the original founding group based in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;ref name="zelko-2013"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He became [[chairman]] and chief spokesman for Greenpeace in 1979, retiring in 1991 to live on an olive farm in [[Paciano]], [[Umbria]], Italy.&lt;ref name="lewis-2001"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
McTaggart continued to participate in Greenpeace forums after retirement for the rest of his life. He and singer [[Bryan Adams]] did a massive postcard campaign to help create the Southern Antarctic Whale Sanctuary. For nearly two years they toured the world asking thousands of concert goers to write to countries involved with whaling to support the sanctuary.&lt;ref name="brown-1994"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] was established by the IWC in 1994 with 23 countries supporting the agreement and Japan opposing it.

[[Te Vaka]] dedicated its song "Sei Ma Le Losa" to McTaggart, who was killed in a car accident on March 23, 2001, near his home in Italy.

In 1987 McTaggart founded the [http://www.3mf.org Third Millennium Foundation], a US 501(c)(3) dedicated to continuing his work for disarmament, peace, and a sustainable future. The foundation, headquartered in his former home in Paciano, Italy, continues today promoting local and global projects in his memory.

'''''Dioscorea oppositifolia'''''  is a type of [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] (''[[Dioscorea]]'') native to [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]) and to the [[Indian Subcontinent]] ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]]).&lt;ref name="klasdkf"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=240599|title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|website=apps.kew.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, N., Koyama, T. &amp; Murata, J.

The plant previously called ''D. opposita'' is now considered to be the same species as ''D. oppositifolia''.&lt;ref name=WCSPsyn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/synonomy.do?name_id=240599 |title=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, entry for ''Dioscorea oppositifolia'' |accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However ''[[Dioscorea polystachya]]'' is often incorrectly called ''Dioscorea opposita'' as well. Botanical works that point out that error may list, e.g., ''Dioscorea opposita'' auct. non Thunb. as a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''D. polystachya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | ''Dioscorea polystachya'' | 14241 | accessdate = 12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Paraguay]]''' is one of the few countries in [[Latin America]] that has maintained an integrated [[Public utility|public monopoly]] on [[electricity]]. [[Hydropower]] comprises nearly 100 percent of [[Electricity generation|electricity]] in Paraguay; 90 percent of generated energy is exported, with neighboring [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] receiving the majority. Paraguay is one of the world’s largest electricity net exporters.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Paraguay_Uruguay/Electricity.html Energy Information Administration (EIA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the dominance of [[hydroelectricity]], [[tariff]]s (mostly residential) are remarkably below the averages for the region. However, despite the abundance of resources, the Paraguayan electricity system faces difficulty due to the lack of [[investment]] in transmission and distribution networks. In addition, distribution losses are among the highest in the region.

== Electricity supply and demand ==

=== Installed capacity and generation ===
Paraguay is the only country in Latin America with almost 100 percent hydroelectric generation capacity (8,116 [[Watt|MW]])  in 2005.&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/aws/eedrb/index.html] [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraguay operates two binational hydroelectric dams. [[Itaipu dam]], by far the largest power station in the country, is operated with 
[[Electricity sector in Brazil|Brazil]] and has an installed capacity of 7000 MW (86 percent of Paraguay's generation capacity). [[Yacyretá Dam|Yacyretá]], the second largest hydroelectric facility, has an installed capacity of 900 MW (11 percent), and is operated with [[Electricity sector in Argentina|Argentina]]. A third plant, Acaray has an installed capacity of 210 MW (3 percent). Thermal plants contribute less than 0.1 percent.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"&gt;ESMAP 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Paraguay's electricity for domestic consumption comes from a single facility, the binational 14 GW Itaipu hydroelectric dam.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

While total generation amounted to 51.17 [[Kilowatt hour|TWh]] in 2005, consumption was only 5.01 TWh, with exports as high as 43.8 TWh.&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/index.asp International Energy Agency (IEA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand ===
In 2005, total electricity consumed in Paraguay was 5.01 TWh, which corresponds to 849 kWh per capita.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; Electricity generated by Itaipu and Acaray, located in the East of the country, is transported to the West (to the [[Asunción]] area), where over 60% of the total national consumption is located.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"&gt;ESMAP 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity consumption by consumer group is divided as follows:&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"&gt;ESMAP 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

* Residential: 41%
* Commercial: 18.3%
* Industrial: 26%
* Others: 14.2%

In 2004, the country consumed only 16% of its 50% share of Itaipu’s production, exporting the rest to Brazil. As for [[Yacyreta]], Paraguay consumes less than 1% of its share, exporting the rest to Argentina.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

The electricity interconnections that allow power exchanges with Brazil and Argentina are:

== Access to electricity ==

In 2005, almost 90% of the population in Paraguay had access to electricity, which is just slightly below than the 94.6% average for [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] &lt;ref name="Benchmarking"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm Benchmarking data of the electricity distribution sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region 1995-2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902081216/http://info.worldbank.org/etools/lacelectricity/home.htm |date=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 Census revealed that 87% of the households without electricity were located in rural areas, where access was about 77%. Rural coverage varies considerably among the different regions of the country. It is lowest in the remote and sparsely populated [[Chaco Department|Chaco]], or Western region.&lt;ref name="Pulfer"&gt;Pulfer 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows rural coverage by Department for 2002:

Since 2004, the National Electricity Administration (ANDE) has been carrying out a Program to Recover Distribution Works under the Self-Help System (''Sistema de Autoayuda''), which aims at the regularization of all the low and medium voltage distribution networks. This program, with a 10-year time-horizon, is implemented according to priorities defined by the conservation status of the networks involved. Under this program, installations that do not comply with current ANDE's rules are replaced.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Interruption frequency and duration ===

In 2005, the average number of interruptions per subscriber was 16.4, while duration of interruptions per subscriber was 7.58 hours. While the number of interruptions is just slightly above than the [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] for [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]], 13 interruptions, the duration is well below the [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] of 14 hours.&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;

==== Blackouts ====
Despite consuming less than 6 TWh per year and exporting close to 45 TWh per year, Paraguay faces blackouts as well as a serious risk of suffering an energy crisis. This is the result of the limitations of both the transmission and distribution systems. The ceiling of the system is placed by ANDE’s at 1,700 MW, with demand above 1,500 MW in 2008.&lt;ref name="Casco Carreras 2008"&gt;Casco Carreras 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission capacity is urgently needed to avoid a supply crisis &lt;ref name="Casco Carreras 2008"&gt;Casco Carreras 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in a system in which quality and an adequate technical service is practically nonexistent.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

Different authors believe that the price received for the electricity sold to Brazil (from Paraguay’s share in Itaipu) and also to Argentina to some extent (from its share in Yacyreta) is currently too low. The “fair price” established by the Itaipu Treaty was conceived on the basis of a “compensation for concession of energy” and not on the basis of a commercial exchange. This price has remained very low (about US$2.81 per MWh). It is argued that, if this price was more in line with actual electricity prices in the Brazilian market, Paraguay would have enough resources to strengthen its electricity transmission capacity.&lt;ref name="Casco Carreras 2008"&gt;Casco Carreras 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution and transmission losses ===
In 2005, distribution losses in Paraguay were has high as 31%, well above the 13.5% [[Weighted mean|weighted average]] for [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] &lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt; and up from about 22% in 2001 &lt;ref name="ANDE"&gt;[http://www.ande.gov.py/ National Electricity Administration (ANDE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

System losses have become a serious problem in the last few years, having followed a continuous upward trend. The highest percentage of losses occurs in the National Interconnected System (SIN), while the remaining corresponds to the bi-national enterprises. In the SIN, distribution losses represented 23% of the total in 2003, while transmission losses, according to ANDE, were 7.3%. ANDE has established a 23% target for electricity losses for the year 2010.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

== Responsibilities in the electricity sector ==
Responsibilities in the Paraguayan electricity sector are concentrated in a single, vertically integrated public monopoly, the National Electricity Administration (''Administración Nacional de Electricidad'', ANDE).

=== Policy and regulation ===
Law 167/93 indicates that the Vice ministry of Mines and Energy (under the Ministry of Public Works and Communication) is responsible for establishing and guiding energy policy, as well as for the study of the technical, economic, financial and legal aspects that promote energy use. However, the Vice ministry does not have the adequate resources to effectively perform its functions.&lt;ref name="Casco Carreras 2008"/&gt;

In practice, all the energy responsibilities are concentrated in ANDE, which is the ''de facto'' electricity regulator and provider. ANDE also elaborates the tariff structure, which is then analyzed and approved by the Economic Council of the Executive Power. The Council usually sets lower tariffs to the ones proposed by ANDE, which leads to a lack of resources for the necessary investment for adequate performance of the electricity system.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

=== Generation, transmission and distribution ===
ANDE controls the country’s entire electricity market, including generation, transmission and distribution. ANDE operates only one hydroelectric dam, Acaray, and six thermal power plants, with total installed capacity of 220 MW. It is also responsible for Paraguay’s share of Itaipú and [[Yacyretá]], the two bi-national hydroelectric facilities (See [[Electricity sector in Paraguay#Demand versus supply, electricity exports|bi-national facilities]] above).

ANDE operates 2,100 miles of transmission lines in the Interconnected National System, divided in 6 subsystems, and 670 miles of distribution lines.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; It is also responsible for all of the distribution, with two exceptions: CLYFSA (''Compañía de Luz y Fuerza, S.A.''), which has a concession to distribute and commercialize electricity in [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]], and the ''Empresas Distribuidoras Menonitas del Chaco Central''.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

== History of the electricity sector ==

=== Hydroelectric plants ===

==== Itaipu dam ====
In April 1973, the governments of Paraguay and Brazil signed the Itaipu Treaty, by which it was decided to create a binational entity to hydroelectric use of the [[Paraná River]]. This entity was constituted by ANDE (Paraguay) and ELECTROBRAS (Brazil). US$100 million were contributed in equal parts by both companies.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

==== Yacyretá Dam ====
[[File:Central vista externa en gris.jpg|thumb|right|View of the [[Yacyretá dam]] from up-river]]

In December 1973, the governments of Argentina and Paraguay signed the Yacyreta Treaty, by which ANDE and ''Agua y Energía'' constituted the Binational Entity, whose aim is the hydroelectric use of the Paraná river. US$100 million was contributed in equal parts by each company.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

==== Corpus Christi ====
In 1971, Paraguay and Argentina created the River Parana Joint Commission (''Comisión Mixta del Río Paraná'', COMIP), which started to carry out different studies (pre-feasibility, environmental, etc.) for the Corpus project, to be located upstream of the Paraná river, close to the towns of Corpus (in the Argentina [[Misiones Province]] and Puerto Bella Vista in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez Montorfano 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil signed a tripartite agreement that established the operating height of the project, which would allow to bring into line the operation of Corpus with those of Yacyreta and Itaipu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comip.org.ar/organismo.htm ''Comisión Mixta del Río Paraná'', COMIP]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The different alternatives for this project are still under study. As a large hydroelectric project, with installed capacity of about 3,000 MW and annual generation of about 19,000 GWh,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssme.gov.py/VMME/VMME.htm Viceministry of Energy and Mines]&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus is a controversial project that is opposed both at the regional and social levels. In April 1996, in a plebiscite in the [[Misiones Province]], the construction of the dam was opposed by almost 89% of the voters.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez Montorfano 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tariffs and subsidies ==

=== Tariffs ===
In 2006, the average national tariff in Paraguay was US$0.080 per kWh &lt;ref name="ANDE"/&gt; Tariffs for the different consumer groups were:&lt;ref name="ANDE"/&gt;

* Residential: US$0.091/kWh ([[weighted mean|weighted average]] for [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] in 2005: 0.105&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;
* Commercial: US$0.090/kWh
* Industrial: US$0.056/kWh ([[weighted mean|weighted average]] for [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] in 2005: 0.1075&lt;ref name="Benchmarking"/&gt;)
* General: US$0.075/kWh
* Others: US$0.094/kWh

=== Subsidies ===
In November 2004, the Paraguayan Government approved Law 2,501, which broadened the electricity social tariff applied by ANDE. The social tariff is applied to residential users below 150kWh of monthly consumption. Currently, about 37% of total customers benefit from this tariff. ANDE estimates that this share will gradually increase to 56% of the total.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

== Investment and financing ==
Investments for maintenance and expansion of the necessary assets to provide electricity service have been executed with the support of multilateral credit institutions.&lt;ref name="ESMAP06"/&gt;

== Summary of private participation in the electricity sector ==
The National Electricity Administration (''Administración Nacional de Electricidad'', ANDE), Paraguay’s state-owned utility, controls the country’s entire electricity market, including generation, transmission and distribution.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

Two small companies buy electricity from ANDE and have concessions to distribute and sell it: CLYFSA (Compañía de Luz y Fuerza, S.A.) in [[Villarrica, Paraguay|Villarrica]], and the ''Empresas Distribuidoras Menonitas del Chaco Central''.

== Electricity and the environment ==

=== Responsibility for the environment ===
The Environmental Directorate (''Secretaría del Ambiente'', SEAM) is the institution in charge of environmental issues in Paraguay, focusing on natural resources management and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seam.gov.py/ Environmental Directorate]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===
Paraguay emitted 3.85 million tons of CO2 in 2005, which corresponds to just 0.61 tCO2 per capita annually, the lowest rate in the [[Latin America and the Caribbean|LAC]] region after Haiti’s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/environment.html Energy Information Administration, International Emissions Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CDM projects in electricity ===
Currently (August 2008), there are no registered [[Clean Development Mechanism|CDM]] projects in any sector in Paraguay.&lt;ref name="UNFCCC"&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC]&lt;/ref&gt; The low emission factor of a fully hydroelectric system is most likely the reason for the absence of this type of projects in the electricity sector.

== External assistance ==

=== Inter-American Development Bank ===
Currently, the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) is contributing funds and assistance to one project in the electricity sector in Paraguay:

* Phase I of a  [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PR-L1010&amp;Language=English Multi-Phase Power Transmission Program] supported through a US$69.5 million credit. The objective of this project, which was approved in December 2006 but has not disbursed any funds as of August 2008, is to strengthen transmission networks in already served areas as well as to extend them to areas still not being served.

The IDB is also providing technical assistance under two activities:
* [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PR-T1045&amp;Language=English Support for Paraguay's Electrical Sector Modernization]. The objective of this support is to "execute studies that will formulate the fundamental and integrated actions, to increase the total loss management capacity of the ANDE in these categories: i) management of loss, ii) prospection of losses, iii) regularization of systems and facilities, iv) collection of the recovered revenue, and v) loss prevention."
* Development of a [http://www.iadb.org/projects/Project.cfm?project=PR-T1039&amp;Language=English National Rural Electrification Program] that will explore grid extension, renewable energy and natural gas solutions.

==Overview==
'''Exciton-polaritons''' are a type of [[polariton]]s, hybrid [[light]] and [[matter]] [[quasiparticles]] arising from the strong coupling of the electromagnetic dipolar oscillations of [[excitons]] (either in bulk or [[quantum well]]s) and [[photons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author=S.I. Pekar  |title=Theory of electromagnetic waves in a crystal with excitons  |journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids  |volume=5  |issue=1–2  |pages=11–22  |year=1958  |doi=10.1016/0022-3697(58)90127-6|bibcode=1958JPCS....5...11P  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The coupling of the two oscillators, [[photons]] modes in the semiconductor [[optical microcavity]] and [[excitons]] of the [[quantum well]]s, results in the energy [[Avoided crossing|anticrossing]] of the bare oscillators, giving rise to the two new [[normal mode]]s for the system, known as the upper and lower polariton resonances (or branches). The energy shift is proportional to the coupling strength (dependent, e.g., on the field and polarization overlaps). The higher energy or upper mode (UPB, upper polariton branch) is characterized by the photonic and exciton fields oscillating in-phase, while the LPB (lower polariton branch) mode is characterized by them oscillating with phase-opposition. Microcavity exciton-polaritons inherit some properties from both of their roots, such as a light effective mass (from the photons) and a capacity to interact with each other (from the strong exciton nonlinearities) and with the environment (including the internal [[phonons]], which provide thermalization, and the outcoupling by radiative losses). In most cases the interactions are repulsive, at least between polariton quasi-particles of the same spin type (intra-spin interactions) and the nonlinearity term is positive (increase of total energy, or blueshift, upon increasing density).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |title=Polariton-polariton interaction constants in microcavities |journal=Physical Review B |volume=82 |issue=7 |pages=075301  |year=2010 |last1=Vladimirova  |first1=M  |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.82.075301 |bibcode=2010PhRvB..82g5301V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other features==
Polaritons are also characterized by non-parabolic [[energy]]-[[momentum]] [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion relations]], which limit the validity of the parabolic [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective-mass]] approximation to a small range of momenta
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=|title=Effects of the non-parabolic kinetic energy on non-equilibrium polariton condensates |author1=Pinsker, F.  |author2=Ruan, X.  |author3=Alexander, T.  |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1891 |pages=1891 |year=2017 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01113-8 |pmid=28507290 |pmc=5432531 |arxiv=1606.02130  |bibcode=2017NatSR...7.1891P}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
They also have a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] degree-of-freedom, making them [[spinorial]] fluids able to sustain different [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] textures.

'''Fermionic systems''' that have a Fermi surface (FS) belong to a [[universality class]] in [[quantum field theory]]. &lt;cite&gt;Any collection of fermions with weak repulsive interactions belongs to this class.&lt;/cite&gt; At the fermi point, the break of symmetry can be explained by assuming a vortex or singularity will appear as a result of the spin of a '''fermi''' particle ([[quasiparticle]], [[Fermion]]) in one dimension of the three-dimensional momentum space.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"/&gt;

The Fermi point is one particular electron state. The Fermi point refers to an event [[Chirality (physics)|chirality]] of electrons is involved and the [[diameter]] of a [[carbon nanotube]] for which the nanotube becomes [[metal]]lic. As the structure of a carbon nanotube determines the [[energy level]]s that the [[carbon]]'s [[electron]]s may occupy, the structure affects macroscopic properties of the nanotube structure, most notably [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sundaram, Vivek.

Flat [[graphite]] is a [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] except when rolled up into small cylinders. This circular structure inhibits the internal flow of electrons and the graphite becomes a [[semiconductor]]; a transition point forms between the [[valence band]] and [[conduction band]].

If the diameter of the carbon nanotube is sufficiently great, the necessary transition phase disappears and the nanotube may be considered a conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Michael. chembytes e-zine.

== Chirality ==
For a given (''n'',''m'') nanotube, if ''n'' - ''m''=3''q'' (where ''q'' is an integer), then the nanotube is [[metal]]lic, otherwise the nanotube is a [[semiconductor]]. Thus all [[armchair nanotube]]s (''n''=''m'') are metallic, and nanotubes (5,0), (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.

'''Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant''' was a [[nuclear power plant]] located at [[Sessa Aurunca]] ([[Campania]]), in southern [[Italy]]. It was named after the river [[Garigliano]].

Consisting of one 150MWe [[BWR]] from [[General Electric]], it operated from 1964 until 1982. First criticality was on 5 June 1963, with grid connection 1 January 1964 and full commercial operation from 1 June in that year. Final shutdown was 1 March 1982.

Garigliano was in 1964 the fourth BWR ever worldwide commercial operated, and had the second highest MW-capacity after [[Dresden Nuclear Power Plant]] unit 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12297">'''Giant oscillator strength''' is inherent in [[exciton]]s that are weakly bound to impurities or defects in crystals.

The spectrum of fundamental absorption of [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct-gap]] [[semiconductor]]s such as [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and [[cadmium sulfide]] (CdS) is continuous and corresponds to band-to-band transitions. It begins with transitions at the center of the [[Brillouin zone]], &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{k}=0&lt;/math&gt;. In a perfect crystal, this spectrum is preceded by a hydrogen-like series of the transitions to ''s''-states of Wannier-Mott excitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = R. J. | year = 1957 | title = Intensity of optical absorption by excitons | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. | volume = 108 | issue = 6| pages = 1384–1389 | doi=10.1103/physrev.108.1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the exciton lines, there are surprisingly strong additional absorption lines in the same spectral region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broude | first1 = V. L. | last2 = Eremenko | first2 = V. V. | last3 = Rashba | first3 = É. I. | year = 1957 | title = The Absorption of Light by CdS Crystals | url = | journal = Soviet Physics Doklady | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to excitons weakly bound to impurities and defects and are termed 'impurity excitons'. Anomalously high intensity of the impurity-exciton lines indicate their giant [[oscillator strength]] of about &lt;math&gt;f_i\sim10&lt;/math&gt; per impurity center while the [[oscillator strength]] of free excitons is only of about &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm ex}\sim10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; per unit cell. Shallow impurity-exciton states are working as antennas borrowing their giant oscillator strength from vast areas of the crystal around them. They were predicted by [[Emmanuel Rashba]] first for molecular excitons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashba | first1 = E. I. | year = 1957 | title = Theory of the impurity absorption of light in molecular crystals | url = | journal = Opt. Spektrosk | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 568–577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards for excitons in semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashba | first1 = E. I. | last2 = Gurgenishvili | first2 = G. E. | year = 1962 | title = To the theory of the edge absorption in semiconductors | url = | journal = Sov. Phys. - Solid State | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 759–760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giant oscillator strengths of impurity excitons endow them with ultra-short radiational life-times &lt;math&gt;\tau_i\sim1&lt;/math&gt; ns.

==Bound excitons in semiconductors: Theory==

Interband optical transitions happen at the scale of the lattice constant which is small compared to the exciton radius. Therefore, for large excitons in direct-gap crystals the oscillator strength &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; of exciton absorption is proportional to &lt;math&gt;|\Phi_{\rm ex}(0)|^2&lt;/math&gt; which is the value of the square of the wave function of the internal motion inside the exciton &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\rm ex}(\boldsymbol{r}_e-\boldsymbol{r}_h)&lt;/math&gt; at coinciding values of the electron &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}_e&lt;/math&gt; and hole &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}_h&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. For large excitons &lt;math&gt;|\Phi_{\rm ex}(0)|^2\approx 1/a^3_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; is the exciton radius, hence, &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm ex}\approx v/a^3_{\rm ex}\ll1&lt;/math&gt;, here &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the unit cell volume. The oscillator strength &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; for producing a bound exciton can be expressed through its wave function &lt;math&gt;\Psi_i(\boldsymbol{r}_e,\boldsymbol{r}_h)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;f_i=\frac{1}{v}\frac{(\int d\boldsymbol{r}_e\Psi_i(\boldsymbol{r}_e,\boldsymbol{r}_e))^2}{|\Phi_{\rm ex}(0)|^2}f_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; .

Coinciding coordinates in the numerator, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}_e=\boldsymbol{r}_h&lt;/math&gt;, reflect the fact the exciton is created at a spatial scale small compared with its radius. The integral in the numerator can only be performed for specific models of impurity excitons.  However, if the exciton is weakly bound to impurity, hence, the radius of the bound exciton &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; ≥ &lt;math&gt;a_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; and its wave function of the internal motion &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\rm ex}(\boldsymbol{r}_e-\boldsymbol{r}_h)&lt;/math&gt; is only slightly distorted, then the integral in the numerator can be evaluated as &lt;math&gt;(a_i/a_{\rm ex})^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;. This immediately results in an estimate for &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_i\approx\frac{a_i^3}{v}f_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; .

This simple result reflects physics of the phenomenon of '''giant oscillator strength''': coherent oscillation of electron polarization in the volume of about &lt;math&gt;a_i^3 &gt;&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;.

If the exciton is bound to a defect by a weak short-range potential, a more accurate estimate holds

&lt;math&gt;f_i=8\left(\frac{\mu}{m}\frac{E_{\rm ex}}{E_i}\right)^{3/2}\frac{\pi a^3_{\rm ex}}{v}f_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;m=m_e+m_h&lt;/math&gt; is the exciton effective mass, &lt;math&gt;\mu=(m_e^{-1}+m_h^{-1})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is its reduced mass, &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm ex}&lt;/math&gt; is the exciton ionization energy, &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the binding energy of the exciton to impurity, and &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt; are the electron and hole effective masses.

Giant oscillator strength for shallow trapped excitons results in their short radiative lifetimes

&lt;math&gt;\tau_i\approx\frac{3m_0c^3}{2e^2n\omega_i^2f_i} .&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the electron mass in vacuum, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the refraction index, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of emitted light. Typical values of &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; are about nanoseconds, and these '''short radiative lifetimes''' favor the radiative recombination of excitons over the non-radiative one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rashba | first1 = E. I. | year = 1975 | title = Giant Oscillator Strengths Associated with Exciton Complexes | url = | journal = Sov. Phys. Semicond | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 807–816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[quantum yield]] of radiative emission is high, the process can be considered as [[resonance fluorescence]].

Similar effects exist for optical transitions between exciton and biexciton states.

An alternative description of the same phenomenon is in terms of [[polaritons]]: '''giant cross-sections''' of the resonance scattering of electronic polaritons on impurities and lattice defects.

==Bound excitons in semiconductors: Experiment==

While specific values of &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; are not universal and change within collections of specimens, typical values confirm the above regularities. In CdS, with &lt;math&gt;E_i\approx6&lt;/math&gt; meV, were observed impurity-exciton oscillator strengths &lt;math&gt;f_i\approx 10&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timofeev | first1 = V. B. | last2 = Yalovets | first2 = T. N. | year = 1972 | title = Anomalous Intensity of Exciton-Impurity Absorption in CdS Crystals | url = | journal = Fiz. Tverd. Tela | volume = 14 | issue = | page = 481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The value &lt;math&gt;f_i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; per a single impurity center should not be surprising because the transition is a collective process including many electrons in the region of the volume of about &lt;math&gt;a_i^3&gt;&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. High oscillator strength results in low-power optical saturation and radiative life times &lt;math&gt;\tau_i\approx 500&lt;/math&gt; ps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dagenais | first1 = M. | year = 1983 | title = Low-power optical saturation of bound excitons with giant oscillator strength | doi = 10.1063/1.94481 | journal = Appl. Phys. Lett. | volume = 43 | issue = 8| page = 742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Henry and K. Nassau, Lifetimes of Bound Excitons in CdS, Phys. Rev. B '''1''', 1628 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, radiative life times of about 1&amp;nbsp;ns were reported for impurity excitons in GaAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Finkman | first1 = E. | last2 = Sturge | first2 = M.D. | last3 = Bhat | first3 = R. | year = 1986 | title = Oscillator strength, lifetime and degeneracy of resonantly excited bound excitons in GaAs | url = | journal = Journal of Luminescence | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 235–238 | doi=10.1016/0022-2313(86)90015-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same mechanism is responsible for short radiative times down to 100 ps for excitons confined in CuCl microcrystallites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nakamura | first1 = A. | last2 = Yamada | first2 = H. | last3 = Tokizaki | first3 = T. | year = 1989 | title = Size-dependent radiative decay of excitons in CuCl semiconducting quantum spheres embedded in glasses | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. B | volume = 40 | issue = 12| pages = 8585–8588 | doi=10.1103/physrevb.40.8585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bound molecular excitons==

Similarly, spectra of weakly trapped molecular excitons are also strongly influenced by adjacent exciton bands. It is an important property of typical molecular crystals with two or more symmetrically-equivalent molecules in the elementary cell, such as benzine and naphthalene, that their exciton absorption spectra consist of doublets (or multiplets) of bands strongly polarized along the crystal axes as was demonstrated by [[Antonina Prikhot'ko]]. This splitting of strongly polarized absorption bands that originated from the same molecular level and is known as the 'Davydov splitting' is the primary manifestation of molecular excitons. If the low-frequency component of the exciton multiplet is situated at the bottom of the exciton energy spectrum, then the absorption band of an impurity exciton approaching the bottom from below is enhanced in this component of the spectrum and reduced in two other components; in the spectroscopy of molecular excitons this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the 'Rashba effect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Philpott | first1 = M. R. | year = 1970 | title = Theory of the Vibronic Transitions of Substitutional Impurities in Molecular Crystals | url = | journal = The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume = 53 | issue = | page = 136 | doi=10.1063/1.1673757}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = K. | last2 = Kopelman | first2 = R. | year = 1971 | title = Exciton Superexchange, Resonance Pairs, and Complete Exciton Band Structure of &lt;math&gt;{^1}B_{2u}&lt;/math&gt; Naphthalene | doi = 10.1063/1.1676140 | journal = J.

Fiz. | volume = 89 | issue = | page = 2133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the polarization ratio of an impurity exciton band depends on its spectral position and becomes indicative of the energy spectrum of free excitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broude | first1 = V.

Phys. - Doklady | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In large organic molecules the energy of impurity excitons can be shifted gradually by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Building on this option, [[Vladimir Broude]] developed a method of studying the energy spectrum of excitons in the host crystal by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules.&lt;ref&gt;V. L. Broude, E. I. Rashba, and E. F. Sheka, Spectroscopy of molecular excitons (Springer, NY) 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging the host and the guest allows studying energy spectrum of excitons from the top. The isotopic technique has been more recently applied to study the energy transport in biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paul | first1 = C. | last2 = Wang | first2 = J. | last3 = Wimley | first3 = W.

'''Heptadecanoic acid''', or '''margaric acid''', is a saturated [[fatty acid]].  Its molecular formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. It occurs as a trace component of the fat and milkfat of [[ruminant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nature | volume = 179 | issue = 98 | year = 1957 | doi = 10.1038/179098a0 | title = Occurrence in Butterfat of n-Heptadecanoic Acid (Margaric Acid) | author =R. P. Hansen, F. B. Shorland and N.

Most likely, these were cases of misidentifying a [[eutectic mixture]] of palmitic and stearic acids.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=vW0IAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Чёт или нечет?

The '''Hibernia Gravity Base Structure''' is the world's largest offshore [[oil platform]], on the [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia oilfield]] south east of St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada. 

A 600 kilotonne [[gravity base structure]] (GBS) built after the ''[[Ocean Ranger]]'' disaster, it sits in {{convert|80|m|fathom}} of water directly on the floor of the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] {{convert|315|km|mi}} off [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] at  {{coord|46|45|1.57|N|48|46|58.54|W|display=inline,title}} .

This GBS is designed to resist iceberg forces, and supported a [[topsides]] weighing 39000 [[tonnes]] at towout, increasing to 58000 tonnes in operation. There were significant challenges faced by the engineering firms Doris Development Canada, [[Morrison Hershfield]] and [[Mobil]] Technology, in developing a structural solution with adequate strength which was also constructible. In addition, unusual design situations resulted from the construction methods and the structural components used.

==Construction==
The majority of the construction was performed at a site in Bull Arm, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador. A new community housing 3,500 workers was constructed, with its own cafeteria, gym and entertainment facilities.&lt;ref name="Hibernia exploration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hibernia.ca/exploration.html|title=Hibernia Construction|publisher=Hibernia Management and Development Company Ltd.|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the topsides modules were constructed locally, with some sourced internationally. The 550,000-ton slipform concrete GBS was built inside a drydock and mated with the topsides in the nearby deepwater construction site. Kiewit performed outfitting of equipment inside utility shafts, and provided construction management services for the gravity base structure. &lt;ref name="Hibernia GBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-8398-MS&amp;soc=OTC|title=Structural design of the iceberg resistant Hibernia |publisher=Offshore Technology Conference, 5 May-8 May 1997, Houston, Texas |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assembled GBS was towed out on May 23, 1997 and installed in position on June 5. First oil was produced on November 17, 1997, four weeks ahead of schedule.

An '''isocyanide''' (also called '''isonitrile''' or '''carbylamine''') is an [[organic compound]] with the [[functional group]] -N≡C. It is the [[isomer]] of the related [[cyanide]] (-C≡N), hence the prefix ''iso''.&lt;ref name=isocyanides&gt;IUPAC Goldbook [http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03270.html ''isocyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt; The organic fragment is connected to the isocyanide group via the [[nitrogen]] atom, not via the [[carbon]]. They are used as building blocks for the synthesis of other compounds.

==Properties==

===Structure and bonding===
The C-N distance in isocyanides is very short, 1.158 Å in [[methyl isocyanide]].  The C-N-C angles are near 180°.&lt;ref name="Kessler1950"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kessler | first = M. |author2=Ring, H. |author3=Trambarulo, R. |author4=Gordy, W. | title =  Microwave Spectra and Molecular Structures of Methyl Cyanide and Methyl Isocyanide| journal = Physical Review | year = 1950 | volume = 79 | pages = 54–56 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.79.54|bibcode=1950PhRv...79...54K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[carbon monoxide]], isocyanides are described by two [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance structures]], one with a [[triple bond]] between the nitrogen and the carbon and one with a [[double bond]] between. The π lone pair of the nitrogen, responsible for the [[zwitterion|zwitterionic structure]], stabilizes the structure and is responsible of the linearity of isocyanides, although the reactivity of isocyanides reflects some carbene character, at least in a formal sense.  Thus, both resonance structures are useful representations.&lt;ref name="Ramozzi2012"/&gt; They are susceptible to [[polymerization]].&lt;ref name="Ramozzi2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramozzi | first = R. |author2=Chéron, N. |author3=Braïda, B. |author4=Hiberty, P. C. |author5=Fleurat-Lessard, P. | title = A Valence Bond View of Isocyanides' Electronic Structure | journal = New Journal of Chemistry | year = 2012 | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 1137–1340 | doi = 10.1039/C2NJ40050B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectroscopy===
Isocyanides exhibit a strong absorption in their IR spectra in the range: 2165–2110&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephany1974"/&gt;

The electronic symmetry about the isocyanide &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nucleus results in a slow quadrupolar [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] so that &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclear spin [[Proton NMR#Spin-spin couplings|coupling]] can be observed, with coupling constants of ''ca.'' 5&amp;nbsp;Hz for the isocyanide &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nucleus and 5–14&amp;nbsp;Hz for the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nucleus which the isocyanide group is attached to.&lt;ref name="Stephany1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stephany | first = R. W. |author2=de Bie, M. J. A. |author3=Drenth, W. | title = A &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR and IR study of isocyanides and some of their complexes | journal = Organic Magnetic Resonance | year = 1974 | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–47 | doi = 10.1002/mrc.1270060112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Odour===
Their disagreeable odour is legendary. To quote from Lieke, "''Es besitzt einen penetranten, höchst unangenehmen Geruch; das Oeffnen eines Gefässes mit Cyanallyl reicht hin, die Luft eines Zimmers mehrere Tage lang zu verpesten, ...''"  (It has a penetrating, extremely unpleasant odour;  the opening of a flask of allyl [iso]cyanide is enough to foul up the air in a room for several days).  Note that in Lieke's day, the difference between isocyanide and nitrile was not fully appreciated.

[[Ivar Karl Ugi]] states that "''The development of the chemistry of isocyanides has probably suffered only little delay through the characteristic odor of volatile isonitriles, which has been described by Hofmann and Gautier as 'highly specific, almost overpowering', 'horrible', and 'extremely distressing'. It is true that many potential workers in this field have been turned away by the odour, but this is heavily outweighed by the fact that isonitriles can be detected even in traces, and that most of the routes leading to the formation of isonitriles were discovered through the odor of these compounds."''&lt;ref name="Ugi1965"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ugi | first = I. |author2=Fetzer, U. |author3=Eholzer, U. |author4=Knupfer, H. |author5=Offermann, K. | title = Isonitrile Syntheses | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | year = 1965 | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 472–484 | doi = 10.1002/anie.196504721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isocyanides have been investigated as potential [[non-lethal weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pirrung | first = M. C. |author2=Ghorai, S. |author3=Ibarra-Rivera, T. R. | title = Multicomponent Reactions of Convertible Isonitriles | journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry | year = 2009 | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 4110–4117 | doi = 10.1021/jo900414n | pmid = 19408909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some isocyanides convey less offensive odours such as malt, natural rubber, creosote, mild cherry or old wood.&lt;ref name="pirrung2006" /&gt; Non-volatile derivatives such as [[tosylmethyl isocyanide]] do not have objectionable odors.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Hoogenboom, O. H. Oldenziel, and A. M. van Leusen "Toluenesulfonylmethyl isocyanide" Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.987 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxicity===
While some isocyanides (''e.g.,'' cyclohexyl isocyanide) are toxic, others "exhibit no appreciable toxicity for mammals".  Referring to ethyl isocyanide, toxicological studies in the 1960s at Bayer showed that "oral and subcutaneous doses of 500-5000 mg/kg can be tolerated by mice".&lt;ref name="Ugi1965"/&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Silver cyanide route===
The first isocyanide, [[allyl]] isocyanide, was reported in 1859 by the chemist Lieke from the reaction of [[allyl]] iodide and [[silver cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Lieke, W. | title = Über das Cyanallyl | journal = [[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] | year = 1859 | volume = 112 | issue =  3 | pages = 316–321 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18591120307 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NYs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA319&amp;dq=Cyanallyl++%22Es+besitzt+einen+penetranten%22 | publisher = C.F. Winter'sche }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally the [[alkylation]] of an alkali metal cyanide gives a nitrile, but the silver ion protects the carbon end of the cyanide.

===From formamides===
Commonly,  isocyanides are synthesized by [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formamide]]s.  The formamide can be dehydrated with [[toluenesulfonyl chloride]], [[phosphorus oxychloride]], [[phosgene]], [[diphosgene]], or the [[Burgess reagent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schuster, R. E. |author2=Scott, J. E. | title = [[Methyl isocyanide]] | year = 1966 | volume = 46 | pages = 75 | doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.046.0075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 =  Ugi, I. | authorlink1 = Ivar Karl Ugi | author2 = Meyr, R. | title = Neue Darstellungsmethode für Isonitrile | journal = [[Angewandte Chemie]] | year = 1958 | volume = 70 | issue = 22–23 | pages = 702–703 | doi = 10.1002/ange.19580702213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 =  Creedon, Siobhan | author2 = Crowley, H. Kevin | author3 = McCarthy, Daniel G. | title = Dehydration of formamides using the Burgess Reagent: a new route to isocyanides  | journal = [[J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1,]] | year = 1998 | issue = 6 | pages = 1015-1018 | doi = 10.1039/a708081f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:RNHC(O)H  + RSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  →  RNC  +  RSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  HCl

===From dichlorocarbene===
In the [[carbylamine reaction]] (also known as the Hofmann isocyanide synthesis) [[potassium hydroxide]] reacts with [[chloroform]] to produce [[dichlorocarbene]]. This then converts primary [[amine]]s to isocyanides. As it is only effective for primary amines it is used as a [[chemical test]] for their presence.

:[[Image:Carbylamine.png|500px|The carbylamine reaction with ethyl amine]]

===Other methods===
Another route to isocyanides is by reaction of [[organolithium compound]]s with [[oxazole]]s and [[benzoxazole]]s:&lt;ref name="pirrung2006"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Pirrung, M. C. |author2=Ghorai, S. | title = Versatile, Fragrant, Convertible Isonitriles | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year = 2006 | volume = 128 | issue = 36 | pages = 11772–11773 | doi = 10.1021/ja0644374 | pmid =  16953613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IsonitrileOxazoleSynthesis.png|center|400px|Isonitrile Oxazole Synthesis]]

The [[benzoxazole]] deprotonates at the 2-position by [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]]. The resulting organolithium compound exists in [[chemical equilibrium]] with the ''2-isocyanophenolate'', which can be captured by an [[electrophile]] such as an [[acid chloride]]. Being an [[ester]] the formed isocyanate in the example above behaves uncharacteristically with reportedly a mild [[cherry]] smell.

==Reactions==
Isocyanides are stable to strong base (they are often made under strongly basic conditions), but they are sensitive to acid.  In the presence of aqueous acid, isocyanides hydrolyse to the corresponding [[formamides]]:
:RNC  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   RN(H)C(O)H
This reaction is used to destroy odorous isocyanide mixtures.  Some isocyanides can polymerize in the presence of Lewis and Bronsted acids.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, T. J.; Novak, B. M. "Mechanistic Studies on the Nickel Catalyzed Polymerization of Isocyanides"  J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 9101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isocyanides participate in many [[multicomponent reaction]]s of interest in [[organic synthesis]], two of which are: the [[Ugi reaction]] and the [[Passerini reaction]].

Isocyanides also participate in [[cycloaddition]] reactions, such as the [4+1] cycloaddition with tetrazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Imming | first = P. |author2=Mohr, R. |author3=Müller, E. |author4=Overheu, W. |author5=Seitz, G. | title = [4 + 1]Cycloaddition of Isocyanides to 1,2,4,5-Tetrazines: A Novel Synthesis of Pyrazole | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | year = 1982 | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 284 | doi = 10.1002/anie.198202841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the degree of substitution of the isocyanide, this reaction converts isocyanides into [[carbonyl]]s or gives stable cycloadducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stöckmann | first = H. |author2=Neves, A. |author3=Stairs, S. |author4=Brindle, K. |author5=Leeper, F. | title = Exploring Isonitrile-Based Click Chemistry for Ligation with Biomolecules | journal = Organic &amp; Biomolecular Chemistry | year = 2011 | volume = 9 | issue = 21 | pages = 7303–7305 | doi = 10.1039/C1OB06424J }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also undergo insertion into the C–Cl bonds of acyl chlorides in the [[Nef isocyanide reaction]], a process that is believed to be concerted and illustrates their carbene character.

Isocyanides have also been shown to be a useful reagent in palladium catalysed reactions with a wide variety of compounds being formed using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lang, S. | title = Unravelling the labyrinth of palladium catalysed reactions involving isocyanides | journal = [[Chemical Society Reviews]] | year = 2013 | volume = 42 | issue = 12 | pages = 4867–4880 | doi = 10.1039/C3CS60022J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ligands in coordination chemistry===
[[Image:Tc CNCH2CMe2(OMe) 6Cation.png|thumb|left|220px|[[Technetium sestamibi]] is a commercial isocyanide complex that is used in medicine for imaging.]]
Isocyanides form [[coordination complex]]es with most transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Singleton, Hester E. Oosthuizen "Metal Isocyanide Complexes"Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 1983, Volume 22, Pages 209–310. {{DOI|10.1016/S0065-3055(08)60404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They behave as electron-rich analogues of carbon monoxide. For example [[tert-Butyl isocyanide]] forms Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(tBuNC)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, which is analogous to Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, J.M.; Barker, G.K.; Green, M.; Howard, J.A.; Stone, G.A.; Wolsey, W.C. "Chemistry of low-valent metal isocyanide complexes" ''J.C.S. Dalton'', 1981, 219-227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although structurally similar, the analogous carbonyls differ in several ways, mainly because t-BuNC is a better donor ligand than CO.  Thus, Fe(tBuNC)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is easily protonated, whereas its counterpart Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett, J.-M.; Farrugia, L. J.; [[F.G.A. Stone|Stone, F. G. A.]] "Protonation of pentakis(t-butyl isocyanide)iron" ''J.C.S. Dalton'', 1980, 1789-1790. {{DOI|10.1039/DT9800001789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naturally occurring isocyanides==
Only few naturally occurring compounds exhibit the isocyanide functionality. The first was discovered in 1957 in an extract of the mold ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' Westling. The compound [[xanthocillin]] later was used as an [[antibiotic]]. Since then numerous other isocyanides have been isolated. Most of the marine isocyanides are terpenoid, while some of the terrestrial isocyanides originate from α-aminoacids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scheuer, P. J. | title = Isocyanides and Cyanides as Natural Products | journal = [[Accounts of Chemical Research]] | year = 1992 | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 433–439 | doi = 10.1021/ar00022a001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[File:Xantocillin.svg|thumb|220px|[[Xanthocillin]] is a rare [[natural product]] that contains an isocyanide group (two in fact).]]

== Nomenclature ==
Whereas in [[IUPAC nomenclature]] in most cases the [[suffix]] "nitrile" or "carbonitrile" is used for organic [[cyanide]]s (R-C≡N),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_557.htm  IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
names for isocyanides have the [[prefix]] "isocyano". IUPAC names become [[isocyanomethane]], isocyanoethane, isocyanopropane, etc.

The suffix "isonitrile" can be ambiguous, since the carbon counting is different from "nitrile". For example, ''[[acetonitrile|ethanenitrile]]'' ( CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) and ''[[Ethyl isocyanide|ethaneisonitrile]]'' (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NC) are not isomers, as the prefix "iso" in the suffix might suggest. In contrast, "isocyanide" does not have this ambiguity: ''[[ethyl cyanide]]'' (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CN) and ''[[ethyl isocyanide]]'' (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NC) are indeed isomers.

The sometimes used term "carbylamine" conflicts with systematic nomenclature. An [[amine]] always has three single bonds,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_510.htm IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas an isocyanide has only one single and one multiple bond.

An '''isolation transformer''' is a [[transformer]] used to transfer [[electrical power]] from a source of [[alternating current]] (AC) power to some equipment or device while isolating the powered device from the power source, usually for safety reasons. Isolation transformers provide [[galvanic isolation]] and are used to protect against [[electric shock]], to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. A transformer sold for isolation is often built with special insulation between primary and secondary, and is specified to withstand a high voltage between windings.
 
Isolation transformers block transmission of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allow AC components in signals to pass.  Transformers that have a ratio of 1 to 1 between the primary and secondary windings are often used to protect secondary circuits and individuals from electrical shocks between energized conductors and earth ground. 
Suitably designed isolation transformers block interference caused by [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]]s. Isolation transformers with electrostatic shields are used for power supplies for sensitive equipment such as computers, medical devices,  or laboratory instruments.
 
==Terminology==
Sometimes the term is used to emphasize that a device is not an [[autotransformer]] whose primary and secondary circuits are connected.&lt;ref name=distrib&gt;[http://uk.farnell.com/ Website of typical electronics distributor]&lt;/ref&gt; Power transformers with specified insulation between primary and secondary are not usually described only as "isolation transformers" unless this is their primary function. Only transformers whose ''primary'' purpose is to isolate circuits are routinely described as isolation transformers.

==Operation==
Isolation transformers are designed with attention to [[capacitive coupling]] between the two windings.  The capacitance between primary and secondary windings would also couple AC current from the primary to the secondary. A grounded [[Faraday shield]] between the primary and the secondary greatly reduces the coupling of common-mode noise. This may be another winding or a metal strip surrounding a winding. 
Differential noise can magnetically couple from the primary to the secondary of an isolation transformer, and must be [[Electronic filter|filtered out]] if a problem occurs.

==Applications==
[[Image:Isolation Transformer Simple with Dielectric Barrier and Electrostatic Shield.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Cross section diagram through a small transformer showing inner winding, dielectric barrier, shield, and outer winding|A simple 1:1 isolation transformer with an extra dielectric barrier and an electrostatic shield between primary and secondary. The grounded shield prevents capacitive coupling between primary and secondary windings.]]

===Pulse transformers===
Some small transformers are used for isolation in [[pulse]] circuits.&lt;ref name=distrib/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murata-ps.com/data/magnetics/kmp_1600.pdf Specification of a typical line of high-frequency electrically isolating pulse transformers in 16-pin DIL package] The manufacturer describes them as "data-bus isolators", but some distributors describe them as isolation transformers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics Testing===
In electronics testing and servicing, an isolation transformer is a 1:1 (under load) power transformer used for safety.  Without it, exposed live metal in a [[device under test]] is at a hazardous voltage relative to grounded objects such as a heating radiator or oscilloscope ground lead (a particular hazard with some [[AC/DC receiver design#Applicability to early radio and TV|old vacuum-tube equipment with live chassis]]). With the transformer, as there is no conductive connection between transformer secondary and earth, there is no danger in touching a live part of the circuit while another part of the body is earthed{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}.

Electrical isolation is considered to be particularly important on medical equipment, and special standards apply. Often the system must additionally be designed so that fault conditions do not interrupt power, but generate a warning.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Nash et. al, (ed), ''IEEE Recommended Practice for Electric Systems in Health Care Facilities, IEEE Standard 602-1996'', {{ISBN|1-55937-772-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supply of equipment at elevated potentials===
Isolation transformers are also used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the [[Austin transformer]] for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle warning lamps on [[mast radiator|radio antenna masts]]. Without the isolation transformer, the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.

'''Lady Urmia''' ({{lang-fa|بانوی ارومیه}}) is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[documentary film]] by Mohammad Ehsani.&lt;ref name="realp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelport.com/index.php?id=300&amp;L=de%2525252525252525252525252527&amp;movie_id=53861&amp;last_page=catalogue.results.all|title=Details - Banooye Urmia|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in 2012 in [[Iran]], distributed by EhsaniPictures.&lt;ref name=realp /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film is a [[poetic]] documentary about [[Lake Urmia]], in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]], which is drying up completely. The environmental catastrophe will not only affect Iran, but also neighbors such as [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]]. The film is narrated in the voice of the Lake itself, asking for help and trying to gain international reaction.

The '''Land grant to Munnabittu kudurru''' is an elongated egg-shaped black limestone ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n '''''narû''''' or entitlement stele ('''[[kudurru]]'''), 46.5&amp;nbsp;cm high and 20.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide, which details the reconfirmation of a gift of 30 &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; of land (around 750 acres) by [[Kassites|Kassite]] king [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] to his servant Munnabittu (a name meaning "fugitive, refugee"&lt;ref&gt;''munnabtu'', CAD m2, p. 203b&lt;/ref&gt;), son of Ṭābu-melû (probably a [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] name&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Personal Names from Cuneiform Inscriptions of the Cassite Period | author = A. T. Clay | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1912 | page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It is significant because, in addition to portraying eighteen divine icons around its top, it lists forty-seven gods in its inscription, more than any other similar object.

==The stele==

Recovered from [[Susa]] during the French excavations under [[Jacques de Morgan]] at the turn of the twentieth century, excavation reference Sb 26, it is currently located in the [[Musée du Louvre]]. The text covers around three quarters of the surface of the sides with the top part engraved with a relief of religious iconography.&lt;ref name=seidl&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Babylonischen Kudurru-Reliefs: Symbole Mesopotamischer Gottheiten | author = Ursula Seidl | publisher = Academic Press Fribourg | year = 1989 | pages = 38–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It records the granting of a tract of land in the limits of the town of Šaknanâ, on the banks of the Mēdandan canal, district of Ḫudādu (Baghdad?&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Materials and Studies for Kassite History (MSKH 1) | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Oriental Institute | year = 1976 | page = 248 }} H.2.4&lt;/ref&gt;), originally by [[Meli-Shipak II|Meli-Šipak]]. The failure to issue a record of this deed resulted in its contention by Munnabbittu’s neighbor, Aḫūnea (probably the [[hypocoristic]] form of his name), son of Dayyān-Marduk, who laid claim to a three &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; and twenty ''qa'' portion of the field, claiming that "it is the 'gate' of my field".&lt;ref name=slanski&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Babylonian Entitlement narûs (kudurrus): A study in their form and function | author = Kathryn E.

Ṣir-šum-iddina and the scribe Bēl-ippašra were dispatched to resurvey the property and confirmed its size.&lt;ref name=hinke&gt;{{ cite book | title = A New Boundary Stone of Nebuchadrezzar I from Nippur (BE IV) | author = W.

===Divine names and symbols===
The [[kudurru]]'s significance lies in its extensive [[list of Mesopotamian deities]] used in the curse section, the longest by far to appear on any similar object, where around a dozen usually suffice. The elaborate endorsements, however, provided no protection to the monument as within around fifteen years it was taken back to [[Elam]] as war-booty by the invading army of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte|Šutruk-Naḫḫunte]].  The following gives the names of the gods and goddesses in the order in which they appear in the text, with the cuneiform synonym in parentheses when the name is not written phonetically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7877">A '''material's property''' (or '''material property''') is an [[Intensive properties|intensive property]] of some [[chemical change|material]], i.e. a [[physical property]] that does not depend on the amount of the material. These quantitative properties may be used as a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] by which the benefits of one material versus another can be compared, thereby aiding in [[materials selection]].

A property may be a [[physical constant|constant]] or may be a function of one or more [[independent variable]]s, such as temperature. Materials properties often vary to some degree according to the direction in the material in which they are measured, a condition referred to as [[anisotropy]]. Materials properties that relate to different physical phenomena often behave [[linearly]] (or approximately so) in a given [[operating range]]{{Explain|reason=Please define operating range|date=May 2018}}. Modeling them as linear can significantly simplify the [[differential equations|differential]] [[constitutive equation]]s that the property describes.

Some materials are used in relevant equations to predict the attributes of a system [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]. 

The properties are measured by standardized [[test method]]s. Many such methods have been documented by their respective user communities and published through the Internet; see [[ASTM International]].

'''Okra''' or '''okro'''  ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|oʊ|k|r|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɒ|k|r|ə}}), known in many English-speaking countries as '''ladies' fingers''' or '''ochro''', is a [[flowering plant]] in the [[Malvaceae|mallow family]]. It is valued for its [[Pod vegetable|edible green seed pods]]. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of [[West Africa]]n, [[Ethiopia]]n, and [[South Asia]]n origins. The plant is cultivated in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions around the world.&lt;ref name="Lost Crops"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council|title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763|accessdate=2008-07-15|series=Lost Crops of Africa|volume=2|date=2006-10-27|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-10333-6|chapter=Okra|chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vernacular names in English-speaking nations ==
&lt;!-- Include only names for the plant used in English-speaking countries in English language conversations, and perhaps some context for those names.--&gt;
The name ''okra'' is most often used in the UK, [[United States]] and the Philippines, with a variant pronunciation in [[Caribbean English]] and Nigeria of ''okro''. The word ''okra'' is from the [[Igbo language|Igbo]] {{lang|ig|ọ́kụ̀rụ̀}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|okra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=czFufZI4Zx4C&amp;pg=PA77 |title=The Missing Spanish Creoles: Recovering the Birth of Plantation Contact Languages |last=McWhorter |first=John H. |publisher=University of California Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-520-21999-1 |page=77 |access-date=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant and its seed pods are also known as "lady's fingers".&lt;ref name="websters"&gt;[http://www.curing-colds.com/articles/alternative-cold-remedies/ladys-finger.phpin Yoruba " ila" "Alternative Cold Remedies: Lady's Fingers Plant"], curing-colds.com (accessed 3 June 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513125230/http://www.curing-colds.com/articles/alternative-cold-remedies/ladys-finger.php |date=May 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In various [[Bantu languages]], okra is called ''(ki)ngombo'' or a variant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|gumbo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is possibly the origin of the name "[[gumbo]]", used in parts of the United States and the English-speaking Caribbean (via Portuguese ''quingombo'').&lt;ref name=tamu /&gt; In India, it is known by the names ''vendakkai'' (alternatively ''bendakkai'') and ''bhindi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/a-strange-correlation-between-maths-and-a-vegetable/article19940238.ece |title=A strange correlation between maths and a vegetable |last=Srikrishna |first=Chitra |date=29 October 2017 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/beyond-business/-food-was-my-saviour-112082500034_1.html |title='Food was my saviour' |last=Sharma |first=Priyanka |date=25 August 2012 |work=[[Business Standard]] |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and distribution ==
[[File:Okra(Abelmoschus esculentus).JPG|thumb|left|Whole plant with blossom and immature pod]]
Okra is an [[allopolyploid]] of uncertain parentage (proposed parents include ''[[Abelmoschus ficulneus]]'', ''[[Abelmoschus tuberculatus|A.&amp;nbsp;tuberculatus]]'' and a reported "diploid" form of okra). Truly wild (as opposed to naturalised) populations are not known with certainty and the species may be a [[cultigen]]. The geographical origin of okra is disputed, with supporters of South Asian, Ethiopian and West African origins. Supporters of a South Asian origin point to the presence of its proposed parents in that region. Supporters of a West African origin point to the greater diversity of okra in that region.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The [[Egyptians]] and [[Moors]] of the 12th and 13th centuries used the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for the plant, ''bamya'', suggesting it had come into Egypt from Arabia, but earlier it was probably taken from [[Ethiopia]] to [[Arabia]]. The plant may have entered southwest Asia across the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] straight to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], rather than north across the [[Sahara]], or from India. One of the earliest accounts is by a Spanish Moor who visited Egypt in 1216 and described the plant under cultivation by the locals who ate the tender, young pods with [[flour|meal]].&lt;ref name=tamu&gt;[http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/publications/vegetabletravelers/okra.html "Okra, or 'Gumbo,' from Africa], tamu.edu&lt;/ref&gt; From Arabia, the plant spread around the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and eastward. The plant was introduced to the [[Americas]] by ships plying the [[Atlantic slave trade]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23877&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html " Okra gumbo and rice"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028115752/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D23877%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=2005-10-28 }} by Sheila S. Walker, ''[[The News Courier]]'', unknown date&lt;/ref&gt; by 1658, when its presence was recorded in [[Brazil]]. It was further documented in [[Suriname]] in 1686. Okra may have been introduced to southeastern [[North America]] from Africa in the early 18th century. By 1748, it was being grown as far north as [[Philadelphia]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] noted it was well established in [[Virginia]] by 1781. It was commonplace throughout the [[Southern United States]] by 1800, and the first mention of different [[cultivar]]s was in 1806.&lt;ref name=tamu /&gt;

== Botany and cultivation ==
[[File:Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) cross-section - 20080613.png|thumb|left|Latitudinal cross-section of the okra pod]]
The species is a [[perennial plant|perennial]], often cultivated as an [[annual plant|annual]] in temperate climates, and often grows to around {{convert|2|m|ft}} tall. It is related to such species as [[cotton]], [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], and [[hibiscus]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|10–20|cm|in}} long and broad, palmately lobed with 5–7 lobes. The [[flower]]s are {{convert|4–8|cm|in}} in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The [[fruit]] is a capsule up to {{convert|18|cm|in}} long with [[pentagon]]al cross-section, containing numerous [[seed]]s.

''Abelmoschus esculentus'' is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. It is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world and will tolerate [[soil]]s with heavy [[clay]] and intermittent moisture, but frost can damage the pods. In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of {{convert|1–2|cm|in}}. [[Germination]] occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. Seedlings require ample water. The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a [[vegetable]], must be harvested when immature, usually within a week after [[pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cals.arizona.edu/fps/sites/cals.arizona.edu.fps/files/cotw/Okra_Seed.pdf|title=Okra Seed|accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okra is available in two varieties, green and red. Red okra carries the same flavor as the more popular green okra and differs only in color. When cooked, the red okra pods turn green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/Red_Okra_864.php|title=Red Okra Information, Recipes and Facts|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is [[verticillium wilt]], often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other diseases include [[powdery mildew]] in dry tropical regions, [[leaf spot]]s, and [[root-knot nematode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/horticulture/5197.html |title=Growing okra |date=19 September 2007 |publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611011649/http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/horticulture/5197.html |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the plant are [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]], resulting in the characteristic "goo" or [[Biofilm|slime]] when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains [[soluble fiber]].&lt;ref name="fsn"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27004112|pmc=4779480|year=2015|author1=Gemede|first1=H.

Okra may be used in [[developing countries]] to mitigate [[malnutrition]] and alleviate [[food insecurity]].&lt;ref name=fsn /&gt;

=== Nutrition ===
Raw okra is 90% water, 2% [[protein]], 7% [[carbohydrates]] and negligible in [[fat]]. In a 100 gram amount, raw okra is rich (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) in [[dietary fiber]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin K]], with moderate contents of [[thiamin]], [[folate]] and [[magnesium]] (table).

=== Leaves and seeds ===
Okra leaves may be cooked in a similar way to the greens of [[beet]]s or [[dandelion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_2718,00.html?rsrc=search network.com: Okra Greens and Corn Saute{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015114924/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_2718,00.html?rsrc=search |date=2007-10-15 }}, M.S. Milliken &amp; S. Feniger, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves are also eaten raw in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for [[coffee]].&lt;ref name=tamu /&gt; When importation of coffee was disrupted by the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the ''Austin State Gazette'' said, "An acre of okra will produce seed enough to furnish a [[Plantation#Plantations in the antebellum American South|plantation]] with coffee in every way equal to that imported from [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]."&lt;ref&gt;Austin State Gazette [TEX.], November 9, 1861, p. 4, c. 2, copied in [http://www.uttyler.edu/vbetts/coffee.htm ''Confederate Coffee Substitutes: Articles from Civil War Newspapers''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062031/http://www.uttyler.edu/vbetts/coffee.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}, [[University of Texas at Tyler]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenish-yellow edible okra [[vegetable oils|oil]] is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in [[unsaturated fat]]s such as [[oleic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Okra, Potential Multiple-Purpose Crop for the Temperate Zones and Tropics|author= Martin, Franklin W.|volume=36|year=1982|pages=340–345|journal=Economic Botany|doi=10.1007/BF02858558|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794&amp;nbsp;kg/ha, the yield was exceeded only by that of [[sunflower oil]] in one trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mays, D.A., W. Buchanan, B.N. Bradford, and P.M. Giordano|year=1990|title=Fuel production potential of several agricultural crops|pages=260–263|journal=Advances in New Crops}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1920 study found that a sample contained 15% oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01446a023|title=Okra Seed Oil.1|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=42|page=166|year=1920|last1=Jamieson|first1=George S.|last2=Baughman|first2=Walter F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found okra oil suitable for use as a [[biofuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farooq|first=Anwar|author2=Umer Rashid |author3=Muhammad Ashraf |author4=Muhammad Nadeem |date=March 2010|title=Okra (Hibiscus esculentus) seed oil for biodiesel production|journal=Applied Energy|volume=87|issue=3|pages=779–785|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261909004127|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial uses ===
[[Bast fibre]] from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|reinforcement of polymer composites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=De Rosa, I.M. |author2=Kenny, J.M. |author3=Puglia, D. |author4=Santulli, C. |author5=Sarasini, F. |year=2010 |title=Morphological, thermal and mechanical characterization of okra (''Abelmoschus esculentus'') fibres as potential reinforcement in polymer composites |journal=Composites Science and Technology |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=116–122 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266353809003480 |doi=10.1016/j.compscitech.2009.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mucilage produced by the okra plant can be used for the removal of [[turbidity]] from waste water by virtue of its [[Flocculation|flocculent]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Flocculation behavior of mallow and okra mucilage in treating wastewater |author=Konstantinos Anastasakis, Dimitrios Kalderis, and Evan Diamadopoulos |journal=Desalination |year=2009 |volume=249 |issue=2 |pages=786–791 |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2008.09.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Study on Flocculation Efficiency of Okra Gum in Sewage Waste Water |author=Monika Agarwal, Rajani Srinivasan, and Anuradha Mishra |journal=Macromolecular Materials and Engineering |year=2001 |volume=286 |issue=9 |pages=560–563 |doi=10.1002/1439-2054(20010901)286:9&lt;560::AID-MAME560&gt;3.0.CO;2-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Rowland Wolfe''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] is one of the pioneers of the British renewable energy sector.

He first became involved in the 1970s, leading various photovoltaics companies until the turn of the century. As Director-General of the [[Renewable Energy Association]] he led the campaign for [[Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom|Feed-in Tariffs]] and the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]].

He has written many publications and is responsible for a number of innovations and initiatives.

He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2016 New Year Honours]] for services to renewable energy and the energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61450|supp=y|page=N26|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy policy==
The campaign for the introduction of the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] and [[Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom]] was led by [[Friends of the Earth]] and the [[Renewable Energy Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feed-in tariffs receive boost in Energy Bill amendment|url=http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/feedin-tariffs-receive-boost-in-energy-bill-amendment.aspx|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=GreenWise|date=18 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130420203652/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/feedin-tariffs-receive-boost-in-energy-bill-amendment.aspx|archivedate=20 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Philip Wolfe was Director General, between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New appointments at the UK's largest renewables trade body|url=http://www.r-e-a.net/news/new-appointments-at-the-uks-largest-renewables-trade-body|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=Renewable Energy Association|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited the first blueprint for these measures to assist early government drafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Debenham|first=Cathy|title=Blueprint for feed-in tariffs proposed by industry|url=http://www.yougen.co.uk/blog-entry/1216/Blueprint+for+feed-in+tariffs+proposed+by+industry/|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=YouGen|date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first proposed the [[Energy hierarchy]],&lt;ref name=EnergyHierarchy&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=A proposed Energy Hierarchy|url=http://www.wolfeware.com/library/publications/EnergyHierarchy.pdf|publisher=WolfeWare|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initiated the consumer assurance REAL Code (since renamed Renewable Energy Consumer Code) for microgeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consumer Code for household micro generation clears first OFT hurdle|url=http://www.realassurance.org.uk/news/consumer-code-for-household-micro-generation-clears-first-oft-hurdle|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=Renewable Energy Assurance|date=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy industry==
As general manager of Lucas Industries' solar power subsidiary in the early 1970s, Philip Wolfe negotiated the joint venture with [[BP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BP and Lucas form solar company|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=05185626|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=Electronics and Power|date=March 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create what became [[BP Solar]] and was its first Chief Executive.

He was a founding director of the European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA, since renamed Solar Power Europe) and its third President from 1987 to 1989. He was a founding director of the [[Renewable Energy Association]] and its Director General from 2002 to 2009.

He is an expert on solar parks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Joshua|title=Giant Solar Farm Capacity Doubling Inside 12 Months, Breaking 12 GW|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/22/giant-solar-farms-capacity-doubling-inside-12-months-breaking-12-gw/|accessdate=25 June 2013|newspaper=CleanTechnica|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has pioneered their introduction in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dicks|first=K S|title=The Race to UK Solar Parks|url=http://news.pv-insider.com/thin-film-pv/race-uk-solar-parks|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=PV Insider|date=11 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411163333/http://news.pv-insider.com/thin-film-pv/race-uk-solar-parks|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Julia|title=Westmill Solar Park becomes world's largest co-operatively owned solar farm|url=http://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/news/westmill_solar_park_becomes_worlds_largest_co_operatively_owned_solar_farm|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=Solar Power Portal|date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Energy==
His background in utility-scale solar power led to Wolfe's involvement in the community sector when he was appointed as chairman of [[Westmill Solar Co-operative]] and led the public offering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westmill Solar Co-operative Limited share offer document|url=http://images.westmillsolar.coop/images/WestmillSolarOfferDocument.pdf|website=westmillsolar.coop|publisher=Westmill Solar Co-operative Limited|accessdate=5 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103850/http://images.westmillsolar.coop/images/WestmillSolarOfferDocument.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acquisition of the world's largest community-owned solar power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darling|first1=Millie|title=Pension funds are quitting fossil fuels. Could they invest in community energy instead?|url=http://www.1010uk.org/articles/could-pensions-divest-fossil-fuels-invest-community-energy|website=1010uk.org/|publisher=10:10|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently involved in the creation of Community Energy England, to represent the community energy sector in the United Kingdom, and was its first elected chairman in 2014. He was a member of the British government's Shared Ownership Taskforce, and appointed its vice-chair in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government response to the Shared Ownership Taskforce|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-response-to-the-shared-ownership-taskforce|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Department of Energy and Climate Change|date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
Amongst Philip Wolfe's innovations were the UK's first: grid-connected solar power station at Marchwood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=R D W|title=Marchwood Project – 30 Kilowatts Marchwood Power Station Site|journal=Photovoltaic Power Generation|year=1984|volume=4|series=Solar Energy R&amp;D in the European Community|pages=277–292|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-6342-9_17|isbn=978-94-009-6344-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; building-integrated renewables at Energy World in Milton Keynes (opened by then Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Energy Park|url=http://www.idoxplc.com/idox/athens/ntr/ntr/cd2/html/txt/r8790506.htm|publisher=Milton Keynes Development Corporation|accessdate=February 16, 2013|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411025854/http://www.idoxplc.com/idox/athens/ntr/ntr/cd2/html/txt/r8790506.htm|archive-date=11 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and solar roofing slate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photovoltaic building elements|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20060042682|work=Patent application|publisher=UD Patent Office|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar for slate roofs|url=http://www.green-energy-news.com/arch/nrgs2003/20030014.html|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=Green Energy News|date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental results suggest that operating at a saturated regime helps to reduce photodarkening.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;N. Li; S. Yoo; X. Yu; D. Jain; J. K.

==Definition==
One could expect the term '''photodarkening''' to refer to any process when any object becomes non-transparent (dark) due to illumination with light. Formally, the darkening of the photo-emulsion also could be considered as photodarkening. However, recent papers use this term meaning reversible creation of absorbing color centers in optical fibers. One may expect that the effect is not specific for fibers; therefore,  the definition should cover wide class of phenomena, excluding, perhaps, non-reversible darkening of photographic emulsions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
 
According to the Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology,&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rp-photonics.com/photodarkening.html| title = Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - photodarkening, photochromic damage, photo-induced loss, ultraviolet, gray tracking, color centers}}&lt;/ref&gt; photodarkening  is the effect that the optical losses in a medium can grow when the medium is irradiated with light at certain wavelengths. We may also define photodarkening as reversible creation of absorption centers in optical media at the illumination with
light.

==Photodarkening rate==
The inverse of the timescale at which photodarkening occurs can be interpreted as photodarkening rate &lt;ref name="liekki"/&gt;

==Color centers==
Usually, photodarkening is attributed to creation of [[F-Center|color centers]] due to resonant interaction of electromagnetic field with an active medium &lt;ref name="cour07"&gt;{{cite journal

== Possible mechanisms of photodarkening ==
The phenomenon, similar to photodarkening in fibers, was recently observed in chunks of Yb-doped ceramics and [[crystal]]s. At the high concentration of excitations, the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] jumps up, causing the [[avalanche]] of the broadband [[luminescence]].&lt;ref name="t"&gt;{{cite journal| author=  J.-F.Bisson | title=Switching of emissivity and photoconductivity in highly doped Yb3+:Y2O3 and Lu2O3 ceramics | journal=Applied Physics Letters | doi=10.1063/1.2739318 | volume=90| pages=066101| year=2007| last2=  Kouznetsov| first2=  Dmitrii| last3=  Ueda| first3=  Ken-Ichi| last4=  Fredrich-Thornton| first4=  Susanne T.| last5=  Petermann| first5=  Klaus| last6=  Huber| first6=  Guenter| issue=  20 | bibcode=2007ApPhL..90t1901B|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Increase of absorption can be caused by formation of [[color center]]s by [[electron]]s in the [[conduction band]], created by several neighboring excited ions. (The energy of one or two excitations is not sufficient to pop an [[electron]] into the [[conduction band]]). This explains, why the rate of darkening is strong function of the intensity of the exciting beam (as in the case with optical fibers discussed above). In the experiments,&lt;ref name="t" /&gt; the
thermal effects are important; therefore only the initial stage of the [[avalanche]]
can be interpreted as photodarkening, and such interpretation is not yet confirmed. Recent work&lt;ref name="thulium"&gt;{{cite journal| author=  R. Peretti |author2=A-M. Jurdyc |author3=B. Jacquier |author4=Cédric Gonnet |author5=Alain Pastouret |author6=Ekaterina Burov |author7=Olivier Cavani

'''Project Hot Seat''' is a campaign started by [[Greenpeace]]. Its goal is to apply intense pressure on members of The [[United States Congress]] in order to implement policies that will curb and cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and what [[Phil Radford]], [[Greenpeace]] Executive Director said was the "kind of organizing that is going to be key to making the environmental movement into a viable political force in Congress and around the country.".&lt;ref name="[[Grist.org]]"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Grist.org]] |url= http://grist.org/article/2009-04-14-greenpeaces-new-leader-talks/ |title= Greenpeace’s new leader talks up need for a green grassroots | author=Kate Sheppard| date=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

Some of Project Hot Seats aims include reaching a national cap and trade system that makes real reductions within a decade, a national renewable energy standard of at least 20% by 2020, and an increase in average fuel economy to 40 mpg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.greenpeace.org/hotseat/National/default/about_us/ Greenpeace: Greenpeace - Project Hotseat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305160115/http://members.greenpeace.org/hotseat/National/default/about_us/ |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project members work to raise awareness of [[global warming]] by organizing events such as The International Day of Action. This was a project in which volunteers throughout the world held rallies and outreach events to raise concern for global warming. The most recent was held on December 8, 2007.

The grain of '''quality protein maize''' (QPM) varieties contains nearly twice as much [[lysine]] and [[tryptophan]], amino acids that are essential for humans and [[monogastric]] animals. QPM is a product of conventional plant breeding (i.e., it is not genetically modified) and an example of [[biofortification]].

QPM was developed by [[Surinder Vasal]] and [[Evangelina Villegas]] at the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center|International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)]] in the late 1990s. For their achievement, they won the 2000 [[World Food Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Systems for Improved Human Nutrition: linking agriculture, nutrition, and productivity |author1=Palit K. Kataki |author2=Suresh Chandra Babu |year=2003|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=1-56022-103-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OylK4k0SEXgC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;ots=6IgrfIjUHh&amp;dq=%22Quality+Protein+Maize%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=KR2YzO8566Craq9fE7y-1FBF9Lo| page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for quality protein maize==
In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]], several hundred million people rely on maize as their principal daily food, for weaning babies, and for feeding livestock. Unfortunately maize (corn) has two significant flaws; it lacks the full range of [[amino acids]], namely [[lysine]] and [[tryptophan]], needed to produce [[protein]]s, and has its niacin (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) bound in an indigestible complex. The Mayans and Aztecs used to boil maize in the alkaline limewater which broke down the complex so that the Niacin became available. However, in the main this practice did not transfer to the Old World or settlers in the "New World" which resulted in epidemics of Pellagra from the 16th century onwards. In addition diets high in corn produce a condition known as wet-malnutrition{{snd}} a person is receiving sufficient [[calories]], but her or his body malfunctions due to a lack of protein. A chronic lack of protein in the diet leads to [[kwashiorkor]].

Thus, conventional maize is a poor-quality food staple; unless consumed as part of a varied diet{{snd}} which is beyond the means of most people in the developing world.

QPM produces 70–100% more of lysine and tryptophan than the most modern varieties of tropical maize. These two amino acids allow the body to manufacture complete proteins, thereby eliminating wet-malnutrition. In addition tryptophan can be converted in the body to Niacin, which theoretically reduces the incidence of [[Pellagra]].

==Development==
Modified maize with higher protein content dated back to the 1920s, and the "opaque-2" variety had been developed in 1963.  While its lysine and tryptophan levels were better than those of conventional maize, opaque-2 had lower yields and a soft, chalky kernel, which made it more susceptible to ear rot and insect damage. Moreover, the taste and kernel appearance dissatisfied consumers, who ultimately rejected the enhanced-protein varieties in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enhancing the Contribution of Maize to Food Security in Ethiopia  |author1=Mandefro Nigussie |author2=D. Tanner |author3=S. Twumasi-Afriyie |year=2001|publisher=Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization, and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center |url=http://repository.cimmyt.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10883/772/75695.pdf?sequence=1 | page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasal-Villegas team===
[[Surinder Vasal]] and [[Evangelina Villegas]] began their collaborative research in Mexico in the early 1970s while they were working at CIMMYT. Dr. Villegas was in charge of the lab investigating protein quality and Dr. Vasal was a plant breeder newly assigned to work on developing QPM varieties that would gain widespread acceptance.

Integrating cereal chemistry and plant breeding techniques, Drs. Vasal and Villegas collaborated to combine the existing opaque-2 maize with genetic modifiers. Through the 1970s, they produced and analyzed germplasms at an astonishing rate, sometimes processing up to 25,000 samples a year. By the mid-1980s, they had produced a QPM germplasm with hard kernel characteristics and good taste similar to the traditional grain and with much higher quality levels of lysine and tryptophan.

However, their discovery remained unexploited for years because many nutritionists felt that protein could be added to the diets of the most poor in other ways. In the early 1990s, CIMMYT gained the international support and funding to begin promoting QPM in [[Ghana]] and several other African countries. Since then, QPM has also yielded very positive results in [[China]], [[Mexico]], and parts of [[Central America]].

==Impact==
Babies and adults consuming QPM are healthier and at lower risk for malnutrition disorders such as [[marasmus]] and kwashiorkor, and data from Latin America and Africa show the grain’s role in reversing the effects of malnutrition in those already affected.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} QPM offers 90% the nutritional value of skim milk, the standard for adequate nutrition value. At a time when [[UNICEF]] reports that 1,000,000 infants and small children are starving each month, the inclusion of QPM in daily rations improves health and saves lives. Additionally, pigs fed QPM experience rapid weight gain and are ready for market sooner or can provide an additional quality protein source for small farm families.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

QPM hybrids have been developed and tested for varying climatic and growing conditions; QPM varieties are grown on roughly 9 million acres (36,000&amp;nbsp;km²) worldwide. Meanwhile, QPM research and development have spread from Mexico to throughout Latin America and to Africa, Europe, and Asia. In Guizhou, the poorest province in China, QPM hybrid yields are 10% higher than those of other hybrids, and the crop has enabled new pig production enterprises, bringing increased food security and disposable income. In total, the QPM germplasm has grown to contribute over US$1 billion annually to the economies of developing countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
In India Centre of Excellence on Processing &amp; Value Addition of Maize has been established at Udaipur city of Rajasthan under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna to ensure better utilization of quality Protein maize in commercial food products and Industry. This centre has developed several bakery products like Biscuit, cake muffins, extruded products puffcorns and pasta using QPM flour.

{{crystallization}}
&lt;!-- is a recrystallization product? [[Image:Insulincrystals.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Insulin]] crystals]] --&gt;
In [[chemistry]], '''recrystallization''' is a technique used to purify chemicals. By dissolving both impurities and a compound in an appropriate solvent, either the desired compound or impurities can be removed from the solution, leaving the other behind. It is named for the [[crystals]] often formed when the compound precipitates out. Alternatively, ''recrystallization'' can refer to the natural growth of larger [[ice]] crystals at the expense of smaller ones.

==Chemistry==
In [[chemistry]], recrystallization&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book
|authors = Laurence M. Harwood, Christopher J. Moody
|title = Experimental organic chemistry: Principles and Practice
|pages = 127–132
|isbn = 0-632-02017-2

|location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a procedure for purifying [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The most typical situation is that a desired "compound A" is contaminated by a small amount of "impurity B". There are various methods of purification that may be attempted (see [[Separation process]]), recrystallization being one of them. There are also different recrystallization techniques that can be used such as:

=== Single-solvent recrystallization ===
Typically, the mixture of "compound A" and "impurity B" is dissolved in the smallest amount of hot solvent to fully dissolve the mixture, thus making a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[solution]]. The solution is then allowed to cool. As the solution cools the [[solubility]] of compounds in solution drops. This results in the  desired compound dropping (recrystallizing) from solution. The slower the rate of cooling, the bigger the crystals form.

[[Image:1 solvent recrystallisation.png|frame|right| → Solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) → Solvent heated to give saturated compound solution (orange) → Saturated compound solution (orange) allowed to cool over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated solution (pale-orange).]]
[[Image:Crystallization Ibuprofen Salt.JPG|thumb|right|Crystallization of Ibuprofen in HCl(aq)]]

In an ideal situation the [[solubility product]] of the impurity, B, is not exceeded at any temperature. In that case the solid crystals will consist of pure A and all the impurity will remain in solution. The solid crystals are collected by [[filtration]] and the [[filtrate]] is discarded. If the solubility product of the impurity is exceeded, some of the impurity will co-precipitate. However, because of the relatively low concentration of the impurity, its concentration in the precipitated crystals will be less than its concentration in the original solid. Repeated recrystallization will result in an even purer crystalline precipitate. The purity is checked after each recrystallization by measuring the melting point, since impurities [[melting point depression|lower the melting point]]. [[NMR spectroscopy]] can also be used to check the level of impurity. Repeated recrystallization results in some loss of material because of the non-zero solubility of compound A.

The crystallization process requires an initiation step, such as the addition of a "seed" crystal. In the laboratory a minuscule fragment of glass, produced by scratching the side of the glass recrystallization vessel, may provide the nucleus on which crystals may grow. 
Successful recrystallization depends on finding the right solvent. This is usually a combination of prediction/experience and trial/error. The compounds must be more soluble at the higher temperature than at the lower temperatures. Any insoluble impurity is removed by the technique of [[Funnels (laboratory)|hot filtration]].

=== Multi-solvent recrystallization ===
This method is the same as the above but where two (or more) solvents are used. This relies on both "compound A" and "impurity B" being soluble in a first solvent. A second solvent is slowly added. Either "compound A" or "impurity B" will be insoluble in this solvent and precipitate, whilst the other of "compound A"/"impurity B" will remain in solution. Thus the proportion of first and second solvents is critical. Typically the second solvent is added slowly until one of the compounds begins to crystallize from solution and then the solution is cooled. Heating is not required for this technique but can be used.

[[Image:2 solvent recrystallisation.png|frame|center| → Solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) → Solvent heated to give saturated compound solution (orange) 
→ Second solvent (blue) added to compound solution (orange) to give mixed solvent system (green)
→ Mixed solvent system (green) allowed to cool over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated mixed solvent system  (green-blue).]]

The reverse of this method can be used where a mixture of solvent dissolves both A and B. One of the solvents is then removed by distillation or by an applied vacuum. This results in a change in the proportions of solvent causing either "compound A" or "impurity B" to precipitate.

[[Image:2 solvent recrystallisation with evaporation.png|frame|center| → First solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) → Solvent heated to give saturated compound solution (orange) 
→ Second solvent (blue) added to compound solution (orange) to give first mixed solvent system (green)
→ Volatile first solvent (clear) is removed (e.g. evaporation) from first mixed solvent system (green) to give a second mixed solvent system (dark-green)
→ Second mixed solvent system (dark-green) allowed to cool over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated second mixed solvent system (green-blue).]]

=== Hot filtration-recrystallization ===
Hot filtration&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP74&gt;{{cite book
|authors = Laurence M. Harwood, Christopher J. Moody
|title = Experimental organic chemistry: Principles and Practice
|pages = 74
|isbn = 0-632-02017-2
|year = 1989
|publisher = Blackwell Scientific Publications
|location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to separate "compound A" from both "impurity B" and some "insoluble matter C". This technique normally uses a single-solvent system as described above. When both "compound A" and "impurity B" are dissolved in the minimum amount of hot solvent, the solution is filtered to remove "insoluble matter C". This matter may be anything from a third impurity compound to fragments of broken glass. For a successful procedure, one must ensure that the filtration apparatus is hot in order to stop the dissolved compounds crystallizing from solution during filtration, thus forming crystals on the filter paper or funnel.

One way to achieve this is to heat a conical flask containing a small amount of clean solvent on a hot plate. A filter funnel is rested on the mouth, and hot solvent vapors keep the stem warm. Jacketed filter funnels may also be used. The filter paper is preferably fluted, rather than folded into a quarter; this allows quicker filtration, thus less opportunity for the desired compound to cool and crystallize from the solution.

Often it is simpler to do the filtration and recrystallization as two independent and separate steps. That is dissolve "compound A" and "impurity B" in a suitable solvent at room temperature, filter (to remove insoluble compound/glass), remove the solvent and then recrystallize using any of the methods listed above.

[[Image:Hot-filtration 1 solvent recrystallisation.png|frame|center| → Solvent added (clear) to a mixture of compound (orange) + insoluble substance (purple) → Solvent heated to give saturated compound solution (orange) + insoluble substance (purple)
→ Saturated compound solution (orange) filtered to remove insoluble substance (purple)
→ Saturated compound solution (orange) allowed to cool over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated solution (pale-orange). ]]

=== Seeding ===
[[Crystallization]] requires an initiation step. This can be spontaneous or can be done by adding a small amount of the pure compound (a [[seed crystal]])&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP/&gt; to the saturated solution, or can be done by simply scratching the glass surface to create a seeding surface for [[crystal growth]]. It is thought that even dust particles can act as simple seeds.

=== Single perfect crystals (for X-ray analysis) ===
Growing crystals for [[X-ray crystallography]] can be quite difficult. For X-ray analysis, single perfect crystals are required. Typically a small amount (5–100&amp;nbsp;mg) of pure compound is used, and crystals are allowed to grow very slowly. Several techniques can be used to grow these perfect crystals:
* Slow evaporation of a single solvent - typically the compound is dissolved in a suitable solvent and the solvent is allowed to slowly evaporate. Once the solution is saturated crystals can form.

[[Image:x-ray crystals - slow evaporation 1 solvent.png|frame|center| → Solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) to give compound solution (orange) → Vessel sealed but a small hole allows solvent vapour (clear) to slowly evaporate from compound solution (orange) over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated solution (pale-orange).]]

* Slow evaporation of a multi-solvent system - the same as above, however as the solvent composition changes due to evaporation of the more volatile solvent. The compound is more soluble in the volatile solvent, and so the compound becomes increasingly insoluble in solution and crystallizes.

→ Vessel sealed but a small hole allows solvent vapour (clear) to slowly evaporate over time to give crystals (orange) and a saturated mixed solvent solution (blue-green). ]]

* Slow diffusion - similar to the above. However, a second solvent is allowed to evaporate from one container into a container holding the compound solution (gas-diffusion). As the solvent composition changes due to an increase in solvent that has gas-diffused into solution, the compound become increasingly insoluble in solution and crystallizes.

The second vessel is sealed, the first vessel is also sealed, although a small hole in the first vessel is present. This hole allows volatile solvent vapour (blue) to slowly evaporate from second vessel and condensate (that is infuse) into the first vessel, to give a mixed solvent system (green) 
→ Over time this gives crystals (orange) and a saturated mixed solvent system (green-blue).]]

* Interface/slow mixing (often performed in an [[NMR tube]]). Similar to the above, but instead of one solvent gas-diffusing into another, the two solvents mix (diffuse) by liquid-liquid diffusion. Typically a second solvent is "layered" carefully on top of the solution containing the compound. Over time the two solution mix. As the solvent composition changes due to diffusion, the compound becomes increasingly insoluble in solution and crystallizes, usually at the interface. Additionally, it is better to use a denser solvent as the lower layer, and/or a hotter solvent as the upper layer because this results in the slower mixing of the solvents.

[[Image:x-ray crystals - slow liquid diffusion.png|frame|center| → Solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) to give compound solution (orange) → Second solvent added (blue) carefully so that the two solvents do not mix.
→ The two solvents mix (diffuse) slowly over time to give crystals (orange) at solvent interface (green)]]

* Specialized equipment can be used in the shape of a "H" to perform the above, where one of the vertical line of the "H" is a tube containing a solution of the compound, and the other vertical line of the "H" is a tube containing a solvent which the compound is not soluble in, and the horizontal line of the "H" is a tube which joins the two vertical tubes, which also has a fine glass sinter that restricts the mixing of the two solvents.

[[Image:x-ray crystals - slow liquid diffusion - H Tube.png|frame|center| → Solvent added (clear) to compound (orange) to give a compound solution (orange) 
→ Second solvent added (blue) to the second tube chamber 
→ The two solvents mix slowly over time, the mixing is slowed by a fine sinter separating the two solvent chambers, to give crystals (orange) at solvent interface (green) over time]]

* Once single perfect crystals have been obtained, it is recommended that the crystals are kept in a sealed vessel with some of the liquid of crystallisation to prevent the crystal from 'drying out'. Single perfect crystals may contain solvent of crystallisation in the [[crystal lattice]]. Loss of this internal solvent from the crystals can result in the crystal lattice breaking down, and the crystals turning to powder.

==Ice==
For [[ice]], recrystallization refers to the growth of larger crystals at the expense of smaller ones. Some biological [[antifreeze protein]]s have been shown to inhibit this process, and the effect may be relevant in freezing-tolerant organisms.

Specific gravity usually means relative density with respect to water. The term "relative density" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.

If a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.

Temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice the specific gravity as specified above is multiplied by 1000.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881&lt;/ref&gt; Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as [[brine]]s, [[sugar]] solutions ([[syrup]]s, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]], etc.) and acids

==Basic formulas==
Relative density (''RD'') or specific gravity (''SG'') is a [[dimensionless quantity]], as it is the ratio of either densities or weights

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathit{RD} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{substance}}{\rho_\mathrm{reference}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RD'' is relative density, ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;substance&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of the substance being measured, and ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;reference&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the density of the reference. (By convention ''ρ'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)

The reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''&lt;sub&gt;substance/reference&lt;/sub&gt;, which means "the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] or 1&amp;nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.

The relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathit{RD} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{gas}}{\rho_{\mathrm{air}}} \approx \frac{M_\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\mathrm{air}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&amp;nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.

==Temperature dependence==
:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''

The density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)'' with ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and of the water at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures we note that while SG&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.000000 (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) it is also the case that RD&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.998203/0.998840 = 0.998363 (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C). Here temperature is being specified using the current [[ITS-90]] scale and the densities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bettin, H. |author2=Spieweck, F.: |title=Die Dichte des Wassers als Funktion der Temperatur nach Einführung des Internationalen Temperaturskala von 1990|publisher=PTB=Mitt. 100|year=1990|pages=195–196|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale the densities at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 4&amp;nbsp;°C are, respectively, 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 resulting in an RD (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C) value for water of 0.9982343.

The temperatures of the two materials may be explicitly stated in the density symbols; for example:
:relative density: &lt;math&gt; 8.15_{4^\circ \mathrm{C}}^{20^\circ \mathrm{C}} \,&lt;/math&gt; or specific gravity: &lt;math&gt; 2.432_0^{15} &lt;/math&gt;
where the superscript indicates the temperature at which the density of the material is measured, and the subscript indicates the temperature of the reference substance to which it is compared.

==Uses==
Relative density can also help to quantify the [[buoyancy]] of a substance in a [[fluid]], or determine the density of an unknown substance from the known density of another. Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).

As the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]], which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20&amp;nbsp;°C/4&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&amp;nbsp;°C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&amp;nbsp;°C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ''ρ''({{chem|H|2|O}}) equal to 0.999972&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or 62.43&amp;nbsp;lb·ft&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] table&lt;ref&gt;ASBC Methods of Analysis ''op. cit.'' Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer&lt;/ref&gt; in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent relative density measurements at (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt; which uses SG (17.5&amp;nbsp;°C/17.5&amp;nbsp;°C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&amp;nbsp;°F and are thus (15.56&amp;nbsp;°C/15.56&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

==Measurement==
Relative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.

For each substance, the density, ''ρ'', is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}
 = \frac{\text{Deflection} \times \frac{\text{Spring Constant}}{\text{Gravity}}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Water Line} \times \text{Area}_\mathrm{Cylinder}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

When these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving

:&lt;math&gt;
RD=\frac{\rho_\mathrm{object}}{\rho_\mathrm{ref}}
= \frac{\frac{\text{Deflection}_\mathrm{Obj.}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\frac{\text{Deflection}_\mathrm{Ref.}}{\text{Displacement}_\mathrm{Ref.}}}
 = \frac{\frac{3\ \mathrm{in}}{20\ \mathrm{mm}}}{\frac{5\ \mathrm{in}}{34\ \mathrm{mm}}}=\frac{3\ \mathrm{in} \times 34\ \mathrm{mm}}{5\ \mathrm{in} \times 20\ \mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\,
&lt;/math&gt;

===Hydrostatic weighing===
{{main article|Hydrostatic weighing}}
Relative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
RD = \frac{W_\mathrm{air}}{W_\mathrm{air} - W_\mathrm{water}}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''W''&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)
:''W''&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).

This technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.

Another practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.

===Hydrometer===
{{main article|hydrometer}}
[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]
The relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.

First the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.

The hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, Δ''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.

The application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)

In the explanation that follows,

:'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).
:'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.
:'''''RD''&lt;sub&gt;new/ref&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.
:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.
:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.
:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].
:'''''Δx''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, Δ''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, Δ''x'' is negative.
:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.

Since the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;Vg''. Setting these equal, we have

:&lt;math&gt;mg = \rho_\mathrm{ref}Vg\,&lt;/math&gt;

or just

&lt;!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like &lt;div align="right"&gt;(2)&lt;/div&gt; doesn't work properly. --&gt;
:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_\mathrm{ref} V\,&lt;/math&gt;
|style="text-align:right"|(1)
|}

Exactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''A''Δ''x'' (see note above about the sign of Δ''x''). Thus,

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;m = \rho_\mathrm{new} (V - A \Delta x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|style="text-align:right"|(2)
|}

Combining (1) and (2) yields

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;RD_{\mathrm{new/ref}} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{new}}{\rho_\mathrm{ref}} = \frac{V}{V - A \Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;
|style="text-align:right"|(3)
|}

But from (1) we have ''V'' = ''m''/''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;. Substituting into (3) gives

:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%
|-
|&lt;math&gt;RD_{\mathrm{new/ref}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{A \Delta x}{m} \rho_\mathrm{ref}}&lt;/math&gt;
|style="text-align:right"|(4)
|}

This equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If Δ''x'' is small then, as a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]] of the [[geometric series]] equation (4) can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;RD_\mathrm{new/ref} \approx 1 + \frac{A \Delta x}{m} \rho_\mathrm{ref} &lt;/math&gt;

This shows that, for small Δ''x'', changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.

===Pycnometer===
[[File:PycnometerEmpty.jpg|thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper]]
[[File:Pycnometer full.jpg|thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer]]
A '''pycnometer''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: πυκνός (puknos) meaning "dense"), also called '''pyknometer''' or '''specific gravity bottle''', is a device used to determine the [[density]] of a liquid.  A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

If the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density (packed density)|particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.

There is also a gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer known as a ''[[gas pycnometer]]''. It compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.

When a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force

:&lt;math&gt; F_b = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b}) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; F_w = g(m_b - \rho_a{m_b\over \rho_b} + V\rho_w - V\rho_a). &lt;/math&gt;

If we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.

:&lt;math&gt;F_{w,n} = gV( \rho_w - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{s,n} = gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:

:&lt;math&gt;SG_A = {gV(\rho_s - \rho_a) \over gV( \rho_w - \rho_a)} = {( \rho_s - \rho_a) \over ( \rho_w - \rho_a)}. &lt;/math&gt;

This is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.

Further manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.

:&lt;math&gt;RD_A= {{\rho_s \over \rho_w}-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\rho_a \over \rho_w} \over 1 - {\rho_a \over \rho_w}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative denstiy. This is found from

:&lt;math&gt;RD_V = RD_A - {\rho_a \over \rho_w }(RD_A-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the density of dry air at 101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is&lt;ref&gt;DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density&lt;/ref&gt; 0.001205 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&amp;nbsp;°C/20&amp;nbsp;°C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.

The pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014–1985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.

===Digital density meters===
''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.

''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&amp;nbsp;°C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yokogawa.com/an/download/.../Bulletin12T03A01-01E_010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.

''Radiation-based Gauge'': Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation "counts" will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope [[cesium-137]], with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid—typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmartvega.com/en/nuclear_density_DSG.htm Density – VEGA Americas, Inc]. Ohmartvega.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Buoyant Force Transducer'': the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of ± 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardco.com/pages/density/electric_hydrometer.cfm Process Control Digital Electronic Hydrometer].

==Examples==
Substances with a relative density of 1 are neutrally buoyant, those with RD greater than one are denser than water, and so (ignoring [[surface tension]] effects) will sink in it, and those with an RD of less than one are less dense than water, and so will float.

Example:

:&lt;math&gt;
RD_{H_2O} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{Material}}{\rho_\mathrm{H_2O}}\ = RD,
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''rushcart''' ceremony, derives from [[Rogation days|Rogationtide]]. Parishioners would process around the parish once a year, bearing [[juncaceae#Domestic uses|rushes]]. They would end up at the parish church and place the rushes on the floor of the church, to replace worn-out rushes. In modern times the ceremony is practised only in parts of northern England including Lancashire and Cumbria among others.

==History==
{{main|rushbearing}}
According to John Cutting, the earliest record of rushbearing is 1385 at [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]].

The custom of strewing cut vegetation on the floors of churches began at an earlier date: the plants commonly used were hay, straw or rushes and together with [[strewing herbs]] they improved the comfort for those using the church. Before the Reformation churches served for many secular as well as religious purposes and seating was not usual until the early years of the 16th century. Renewal of the floor covering was usually carried out before major festivals such as Easter and the patronal festival. Since these were among the few times in the year available for merrymaking ceremonies grew up and were handed down by tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Gascoigne, Margaret (2002) ''Discovering English Customs and Traditions''. Prince's Risborough: Shire {{ISBN|0-7478-0377-3}}; pp. 8, 16, 18, 24, 35, 44, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

As towns grew in size, the places where rushes still grew were further and further from the church itself. Also changes in the way churches were furnished such as box pews and in the 19th century more effective heating in churches made the ceremonies redundant. The ceremonies either lapsed, or became longer and larger. The earliest depictions of rushcarts are in ''Rush-Bearing'' (1891) by Burton. One illustration shows morris dancers and a rushcart at Failsworth Pole, near Manchester, about 1820. Another, from 1821, is a painting by Alexander Wilson of an event at Long Millgate, Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Alexander [http://www.sphinxfineart.com/Alexander-Wilson-Manchester-1803-1846-Rush-Bearing-Long-Millgate-Manchester-DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=6&amp;tabindex=5&amp;objectid=122310 "Rush Bearing at Long Millgate, Manchester"], 1821, Sphinx Fine Art. Retrieved on 2011-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; They now appear to be confined to the north west of England. At least 5 rushbearing ceremonies still occur in Cumbria where girls dressed in green process around the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/rushbear.htm|title=Rushbearing ceremonies in Cumbria|last=Thurgood|first=Julian|work=visitcumbria.com|accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rushcart''' grew into a festival held on the annual [[wakes week]] or [[mill holidays]]. There would be music, dancing and other entertainments. Each village would try to outdo the others  by building a bigger or more elaborate structure with the front covered by a sheet decorated with tinsel and artificial flowers and hung with polished copper, brass and silver household items.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Behold the rush-cart, and the throng&lt;br&gt;
Of lads and lasses pass along:&lt;br&gt;
Now, view the nimble morris-dancers,&lt;br&gt;
The blithe, fantastic, antic prancers,&lt;br&gt;
Bedeck'd in gaudiest profusion,&lt;br&gt;
With ribbons in a sweet confusion&lt;br&gt;
Of brilliant colours, richest dyes,&lt;br&gt;
Like wings of moths and butterflies-&lt;br&gt;
Waving white kerchiefs in the air,&lt;br&gt;
And crossing here, re-crossing there,&lt;br&gt;
And up and down, and everywhere:&lt;br&gt;
Springing, bounding, gaily skipping,&lt;br&gt;
Deftly, briskly, no one tripping:&lt;br&gt;
All young fellows, blithe and hearty,&lt;br&gt;
Thirty couples in the party ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt; &amp;nbsp;— From ''The Village Festival'' by Droylsden poet Elijah Ridings.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billnkaz.demon.co.uk/poet.htm|title=Droylsden Poets|last=McDonald|first=Bill &amp; Karen|year=2002|work=The McDonal family homepage|accessdate=17 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128195500/http://www.billnkaz.demon.co.uk/poet.htm|archivedate=28 November 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The coming of the railways led to a decline in interest in Rushcarts as the local population were able to travel further afield for their annual break. The Rushcarts eventually died out in the early 20th century. There is a curious similarity between this festival and the [[Hindu]] festival of the [[Ratha-Yatra (Puri)|chariot]] of [[Jagannath]].

==Didsbury==
France and Woodall in their ''A New History of Didsbury'' give the text of an anonymous account of the rushcart perhaps of the 1860s and entries in the churchwardens' accounts for 1733 and 1808 among other statements recorded by local people. It is uncertain when the rushbearing was ended in Didsbury, certainly not before 1870. The associated rowdyism was not thought desirable by the more sober parishioners of the time according to Alfred Burton in his ''Rushbearing''.&lt;ref&gt;France, E.; Woodall, T. F. (1976) ''A New History of Didsbury''. Manchester: E. J. Morten. pp. 54-58. {{ISBN|0-85972-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Fletcher Moss's ''Fifty Years of Public Work'' includes photographs of the Didsbury rushcarts of 1882 and 1911, the last occasion. (If the dates are genuine Burton is either mistaken or it was discontinued for some years and then revived.) In the nearby township of Chorlton cum Hardy, the ceremony took place on the eve of the last Sunday in July though very little is known about how long it continued to be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, John M. (1972) ''The Township of Chorlton-cum-Hardy''; p. 78. Manchester: E. J. Morten, {{ISBN|0-901598-26-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fallowfield==
An account of the [[Fallowfield]] Rushcart was given by Annie C. Williamson in her book about the township (1888). It was part of the Fallowfield Wakes celebrations and often included Robin Hood and Maid Marian seated on a pile of rushes heaped upon a farm cart. The cart was accompanied by the sound of pipes, penny whistles, clogs being used to beat time on the ground, and the shouts of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sussex, Gay &amp; Helm, Peter (1984) ''Looking Back at Rusholme &amp; Fallowfield''. Altrincham: Willow; p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gorton ==

The [[Gorton]] rushbearing ceremony was relaunched by the Gorton Morrismen in 1980 having last been celebrated in 1874. It ceased again in 1991 but was resurrected "one last time" in 2009 to celebrate the 100th year of Gorton becoming a part of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/news/article/4992/gorton_morris_rushcart_revived_one_last_time|title=Gorton Morris Rushcart revived one last time|last=Anon|year=2009|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=20 April 2010|location=Manchester UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Hunter Christie''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (22 March 1784 – 24 January 1865) was a British [[scientist]], [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]].

==Life==
He studied [[mathematics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|id=CHRY800SH|name=Christie, Samuel Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he won the [[Smith's Prize]] and was [[second wrangler]].  He was particularly interested in [[magnetism]], studying the [[earth's magnetic field]] and designing improvements to the [[magnetic compass]].  Some of his magnetic research was done in collaboration with [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]].  He became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1826, delivered their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1833 and served as their Secretary from 1837 to 1853.  In 1833 he published his 'diamond' method, the forerunner of the [[Wheatstone bridge]], in a paper&lt;ref&gt;S. Hunter Christie, ''The Bakerian Lecture: Experimental Determination of the Laws of Magneto-electric Induction in different masses of the same metal, and its intensity in different metals.'', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 123, 1833, pp. 95–142.&lt;/ref&gt; on the magnetic and electrical properties of [[metal]]s, as a method for comparing the resistances of [[wire]]s of different thicknesses.  However, the method went unrecognised until 1843, when [[Charles Wheatstone]] proposed it, in another paper&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wheatstone, ''The Bakerian Lecture: An Account of Several New Instruments and Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit'', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, vol. 133, 1843, pp. 303–327.&lt;/ref&gt; for the Royal Society, for measuring resistance in electrical circuits.  Although Wheatstone presented it as Christie's invention, it is his name, rather than Christie's, that is now associated with the device.&lt;ref&gt;''The Genesis of the Wheatstone Bridge'' by Stig Ekelof discusses Christie's and [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]'s contributions, and why the bridge carries Wheatstone's name. Published in "Engineering Science and Education Journal", volume 10, no 1, February 2001, pages 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie taught mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from 1838 until his retirement in 1854.&lt;ref name="Venn" /&gt;  
He died at [[Twickenham]], on 24 January 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Christie, Samuel Hunter|first= George Clement |last=Boase|authorlink = George Clement Boase|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrait photograph of Christie in 1865 by Ernest Edwards is held by the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]. 
==Family==
He had ten children (five with each wife), of which eight survived him. 
His eldest son with his second wife was the astronomer [[William Henry Mahoney Christie]] (1845–1922).

Samuel Christie is the son of one James Christie, although this was almost certainly not the auctioneer James Christie (founder of the great auction house). 
Instead he was probably the son of a James Christie who in 1821 described himself as a tailor, late of Leicester Square but then of Newman Street, and who died in 1825 aged eighty-six. Because they had the same name, some confusion has arisen between the two James Christie's and many websites incorrectly state that he was the son of the auctioneer. 
But, as the latter occupied a house in Pall Mall from 1768 until 1803, and died in that year, it seems certain that the James Christie who lived in Leicester Square was not the auctioneer.

A '''silylium ion''' is a reactive [[organosilicon compound|silyl-containing cation]] with the formula {{chem|SiR|3|+}}. With three rather than the usual four bonds to Si, silylium ions are the silicon analogues of [[carbenium ion]]s. They can be viewed as protonated [[silylene]]s. A well-characterized example is trimesitylsilylium, {{chem|Si(C|6|H|2|[[methyl|Me]]|3|)|3|+}}. This salt has been crystallized with an anionic [[carborane]], a [[weakly coordinating anion]]. This cation is related to [[trityl]] ({{chem|C(C|6|H|5|)|3|+}}), with the extra methyl groups providing steric protection, compensating for the greater size of Si vs C. Its &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si&amp;nbsp;NMR chemical shift is 225.5&amp;nbsp;ppm, downfield of TMS, which indicates that the cation is quite "naked". In contrast, [[Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate|Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiOTf]], normally considered a source of electrophilic silicon, has a &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si&amp;nbsp;NMR shift of 43&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Hendrik F.

{{Condensed matter physics}}'''Spin gapless semiconductors''' are a novel class of materials with unique electrical band structure for different spin channels in such a way that there is no band gap (i.e., 'gapless') for one spin channel while there is a finite gap in another spin channel.

In a spin-gapless semiconductor, conduction and valence [[Electronic_band_structure|band edges]] touch, so that no threshold energy is required to move electrons from occupied (valence) states to empty (conduction) states. This gives spin-gapless semiconductors unique properties: namely that their band structures are extremely sensitive to external influences (e.g., pressure or magnetic field). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fleet.org.au/blog/dirac-spin-gapless-semiconductors/&lt;/ref&gt;

Because very little energy is needed to excite electrons in an SGS, charge concentrations are very easily ‘tuneable’. For example, this can be done by introducing a new element (doping) or by application of a magnetic or electric field (gating).

A new type of spin gapless semiconductor identified in 2017, known as Dirac-type spin-gapless semiconductors, has linear dispersion and is considered an ideal platform for massless and dissipationless [[spintronics]] because spin-orbital coupling opens a gap for the spin fully polarized conduction and valence band, and as a result, the interior of the sample becomes an insulator, however, an electrical current can flow without resistance at the sample edge. This effect, the [[quantum anomalous Hall effect]] has only previously been realised in magnetically doped topological insulators.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fleet.org.au/blog/dirac-spin-gapless-semiconductors/&lt;/ref&gt;

Electron mobility in such materials is two to four orders of magnitude higher than in classical semiconductors&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/4/2/252/2615248?guestAccessKey=dc5322b1-f2f3-4172-9282-d698648f94bf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Prediction and discovery==
The spin gapless semiconductor was first proposed as a new [[spintronics]] concept and a new class of candidate spintronic materials in 2008 in a paper by [[Xiaolin_Wang_(scientist)|Xiaolin Wang]] of the [[University of Wollongong]] in Australia.&lt;ref name=XW&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Wang| first = Xiaolin | date =  18 April 2008 | title = Proposal for a New Class of Materials: Spin Gapless Semiconductors | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 100 | issue = 15 | pages = 156404 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.100.156404| pmid = 18518135 | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/aiimpapers/14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://media.uow.edu.au/releases/UOW043551 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and applications==
The spin gapless semiconductor is a promising candidate material for [[spintronics]] because its charged particles can be fully spin-polarised, so that spin can be controlled via only a small applied external energy&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fleet.org.au/blog/dirac-spin-gapless-semiconductors/&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Stover''' is the leaves and stalks of [[field crop]]s, such as corn ([[maize]]), [[sorghum]] or [[soybean]] that are commonly left in a field after harvesting the [[grain]]. It is similar to [[straw]], the residue left after any cereal grain or grass has been harvested at maturity for its seed.

The '''Harwell TMG''' [[Stirling engine]], an abbreviation for "Thermo-Mechanical Generator", was invented in 1967 by [[Ted_Cooke-Yarborough|E. H. Cooke-Yarborough]] at the Harwell Labs of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

 | title= Annular Spring
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was intended to be a remote [[electric power|electrical power]] source with low cost and very long life, albeit by sacrificing some efficiency.  The TMG (model TMG120) was at one time the only Stirling engine sold by a manufacturer, namely HoMach Systems Ltd., England.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Principles and Applications of Stirling Engines
 | author=Colin D. West
 | year=1986
 | isbn=0-442-29237-6
}} p. 195, 113, 109, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine has near [[isothermal]] [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s because 1) the heater area covers the entire cylinder end, 2) it is a short stroke device, with wide shallow cylinders, yielding a high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio, 3) the average thickness of the gas space is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;cm, and 4) the working fluid is [[Helium]], a gas having good thermal properties for Stirling engines.  

The engine's displacer also has very low losses.  These low-loss operating characteristics simplify the engine analysis, compared to more conventional Stirling engines.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;{{rp|113}}

The design has many advantages over conventional Stirling engines.  The simplicity of the heater greatly reduces the cost by allowing the TMG to avoid the need for a [[brazing|brazed]] tubular or finned heater, which can account for 40% of the cost of a conventional Stirling engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | title=The Philips Stirling Engine
 | author=Clifford.M.Hargreaves
 | year=1991
 | isbn=0-444-88463-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat exchangers for the heater and cooler are mechanically trivial.  The regenerator is a simple annulus, referred to as a "flat plate".  Along with the cylinder wall and the displacer, there are a total of four regenerating surfaces.  The TMG is a free piston engine.  There are no rolling [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] or sliding [[Cylinder seal|seal]]s, thus there is very little friction or wear.  The working space is hermetically sealed, allowing it to contain pressurized helium gas for many thousands of hours.  

The [[displacer]] is a [[stainless steel]] can, 27&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  It is suspended by a low-loss planer metal [[Spring (device)|spring]] centered in a 27.4&amp;nbsp;cm diameter cylinder.  The 2&amp;nbsp;mm radial clearance is divided into two [[concentric]] [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] gaps by a thin, open-ended cylinder, which is fixed to the engine's cylinder.  This annulus acts as the [[regenerative heat exchanger|regenerator]], which is much less costly than a [[wire mesh|wire-mesh]] type.  

The engine is a "free-cylinder" design, in which the entire engine is mounted on springs and allowed to vibrate slightly.  This allows the displacer to be driven by positive feedback from the motion of the power piston and the magnets in the [[linear alternator|linear-alternator]] magnets, which have a combined weight of 10&amp;nbsp;kg.

The unique power piston was invented by Cooke-Yarborough, and is called an "articulated diaphragm".  It consists of a stainless steel annulus, with an outer diameter of 35&amp;nbsp;cm and an inner diameter of 26&amp;nbsp;cm.  This annulus is clamped to the engine on the outer edge by two flexible rubber o-rings, and on the inner edge it is similarly clamped, in this case to a rigid center hub that makes up the piston's center.  The o-rings flex but do not slide, thus no lubricant is needed and there is negligible wear in the entire machine.  

The compression space is located between the power-piston hub and the displacer, and this space is cooled by direct conduction through the power piston.  A developmental model of the TMG contained a double articulated diaphragm containing cooling water, which was pumped by a [[thermosyphon]].  The depth of the compression space varies from 0.2 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;mm, as governed by the 2&amp;nbsp;mm displacer stroke and the 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm power piston stroke moving 90 degrees out of phase.

The TMG engine successfully overcomes many of the economic and mechanical difficulties common in conventional Stirling engines. However, there are some limitations of this design.  The simple, low-cost annular regenerator is inefficient compared to other types, (and this contributes to this engine's somewhat low thermal efficiency of only 10%).  The mechanical limitations of the articulated diaphragm only allow a maximum stroke of an estimated 3&amp;nbsp;mm.  These properties limit the maximum obtainable power to about 500 - 1000 Watts from an engine of this design.&lt;ref name=West/&gt;{{rp|195}} Nevertheless, it is rare for a low-cost Stirling engine to obtain this high level of reliability and operating life, which can only be attributed to the ingenuity of the design.

The '''Truganina Explosives Reserve''' was a secure storage facility near [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]] in the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. It was in operation from 1901 to 1962 to store mainly civilian explosives for mining and construction. The camp included several storage sheds and a jetty, which were connected by a narrow-gauge horse-drawn [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]]. Like the [[Dry Creek explosives depot]] at [[Port Adelaide]], the site is a testimony to history and transportation in Australia. 

== Location ==
Altona's Truganina Explosives Reserve is located approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} south-west of [[Melbourne]], and {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1}} west of [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]]. 

== History == 
The [[Nobel Enterprises|Nobel]] explosives factory (later [[ICI Australia|ICI]], then [[Orica]]) in [[Deer Park, Victoria|Deer Park]] was set-up in 1873 to produce explosives, especially gelignite and dynamite, for quarries, mines, as well as for road, rail, dam and tunnel construction with the intention to become independent of imports from Britain and South Africa. These explosives were initially stored in specially designed magazines (Jack's Magazine) on the banks of the [[Maribyrnong River]], upstream of [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], before being shipped to other parts of Australia or to New Zealand, New Guinea and the Pacific. As the population of Footscray increased, a more remote location for explosives storage was sought. In 1900, Altona had less than fifty inhabitants. The Truganina Explosives Reserve, located less than {{convert|4|km|mi}} from [[Laverton railway station, Melbourne|Laverton railway station]], was finally selected as a convenient location for a new explosives storage site due to its secluded coastal location.&lt;ref name="alhs"&gt;Altona Laverton Historical Society: [https://alhs.com.au/local-history/truganina-explosives-reserve/ ''Truganina Explosives Reserve - Establishing an Explosives Reserve.''] Retrieved on 25 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the land had been owned by George [[Thomas Chirnside]], before he agreed in 1896 to swap {{convert|225|ha|acre}} of his land against {{convert|256|ha|acre}} of poor quality land of the government of Victoria. The Victorian Government's Victorian Act 1456 is known as the Powder Magazines Act of 1896. A Victorian Act authorized the governor to exchange this land to set-up an explosives reserve and to build and operate a narrow gauge railway line.

The 610 mm (2 ft) narrow-gauge [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] line began at [[Laverton railway station, Melbourne|Laverton railway station]] and ran along what are now Merton Street and Queen Street through the Truganina Explosives Reserve and then to a jetty at [[Laverton Creek]] on [[Altona Bay]].&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Railpage"&gt;Railpage: [https://www.railpage.com.au/f-p1601097.htm ''Truganina Explosives Reserve and Tramway (Historical).''] Retrieved on 25 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It had eight [[passing loops]] parallel to the mainline at the storage facility, as well as sheds and [[Siding (rail)#Refuge siding|dead-end sidings]] at Laverton station.&lt;ref name="Railpage"/&gt;

Explosives were delivered by the Victorian Railways from the factory in Deer Park to Laverton railway station. There, the explosives were reloaded by [[bucket brigade|human chain]] from the railway wagons into the horse-drawn narrow-gauge wagons. The narrow-gauge railway wagons were then hauled by [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] [[draft horse]]s at a speed of about {{convert|4.5|km/h|mph|sigfig=1}} to the explosives reserve. The narrow-gauge railway line was 2.7 km (133 chains) long. It was in operation until 1936, when rail transport was replaced by road transport. Upon arriving at the reserve, the explosives were stored in the magazines, until they were taken to be loaded onto ships for onward transport. Nine explosives transports were carried out each day with 200 explosives boxes of 50 pounds (22.7 kg) each.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt; Nine horses and 43 wagons were used.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;[http://www.hobsonsbay.vic.gov.au/files/assets/public/documents/pdfs/experience-hobsons-bay/parks-gardens/truganina_explosives_reserve_brochure_2_pages_combined_print.pdf ''Truganina Explosives Reserve Brochure.''] Retrieved on 25 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

When the explosives had to be shipped to other ports, the explosive boxes were taken by narrow-gauge railway to small boats (lighters) moored at the pier. The specially designed motor-less sailing ships were towed by tugs from the jetty to their moorings at Williamstown.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt; From there lighters took their cargo to larger ships anchored at special explosives buoys in Port Philip Bay.

== Magazines == 
Each magazine had a size of about {{convert|9|by|5.5|m|ft}} and could store 20 tons of explosives. The magazines were made of brick, with tile roofs. The roofs were not attached to the walls - they stayed there under their own weight. This was so that, in the event of an explosion, the roof would lift off, minimising damage to the building. The explosives were stacked on air-permeable shelves&lt;!-- or benches?--&gt;, so that air could circulate around the boxes at any time. The wooden boxes for explosives were made with brass nails or with only dovetail joints to minimize the possibility of sparking. Each magazine was surrounded on three sides by a large earth wall, with an open side facing away from human activity. These earthworks were designed to protect the workers and their families from explosions. If such an explosion had taken place, the mounds were designed to direct the explosion upwards and outwards and contain the damage. The magazines were built as light as possible to minimize damage caused by flying splinters, with the same design as used in [[:File:New Explosive Magazines Yatala.jpg|Yatala]] and [[Dry Creek explosives depot|Port Adelaide]].&lt;ref name="Jolly"&gt;Bridget Jolly: [http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/bm.doc/high-and-dry-by-the-mangroves-.pdf ''High And Dry By The Mangroves?

== Operation ==
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
The operation of the explosives reserve and the narrow gauge railway was managed by the Trade and Customs Commissioner. The site was officially opened on 1 May 1901, and was enclosed by a {{convert|8|ft|m}} high, {{convert|7|mi|km}} long&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Railpage"/&gt;--&gt; galvanized corrugated iron fence. Careful handling, transportation and storage of the explosive was of paramount importance to ensure safety for employees and residents. Employees who handled the explosives were instructed to wear leather aprons to protect their clothes and to wear canvas overshoes to prevent sparks. Boots with nailed leather soles were considered too dangerous, because of the possibility of the nails causing sparks, which could have resulted in an explosion.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt;

By 1950, the explosives storage in Altona had reached its peak. Sixty-one magazines were in operation. Of these, 52 were used by [[AkzoNobel|Nobel Industries]], which became later [[ICI Australia|Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ)]], and nine by the state government. A total of 36 employees were employed in the explosives reserve. During this time, the population of Altona grew to 4,000. Therefore, the risk of explosives storage in Altona was re-assessed and alternative locations were evaluated. On 11 May 1962, the auxiliary sailing ship ''Failie'' became the last vessel to be loaded at the Truganina explosives reserve; all remaining explosives were transported to a newly-built explosives warehouse at [[Point Wilson]]. The first delivery from Point Wilson took place on 25 May 1962.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt;

After the closure of the Truganina Explosives Reserve in 1962 the Victorian Government sold most of the land, but retained {{convert|16|ha|acre}} for the State Labour Inspectorate for Destruction of Dangerous Goods. Until closed in 1994, unwanted explosives from throughout Victoria were brought to this site for safe destruction in a specially constructed bunker. In 1976, {{convert|0.8|ha|acre|sigfig=1}} of the 16 hectares were transferred to the State Environmental Protection Agency for use as a vehicle test station, which was closed in June 1999. In June 2000, the Government of Victoria commissioned the [[Hobsons Bay City Council]] to administer the former Truganina Explosives Reserve on their behalf as a recreational park.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt;

== Accidents and incidents == 
There were no significant accidents during operation. The stables in Truganina's explosives reserve were burnt down in 1904, presumably by a [[swagman]], however the suspect was not arrested for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1905No19.pdf ''Report of the Chief Inspector of Explosives to the Honorable the Chief Secretary, on the Working of the Explosives Act During the Year 1904.

On 9 April 1946 an ammunition lighter had grounded in a storm and was feared to be in danger of blowing up. It was loaded with 300 tons of ammunition, mainly shells. The ammuniton could not be unloaded at low tide onto trucks, because of seaweed and the softness of the sand. Thus it was tried to pull the lighter back into the sea by tugs during high tide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/aroundaltona/docs/ara_issue_82_web ''Grounded Munition Ship Scares Altona.''] In: ''The Argus'' 10 April 1946.

== Conservation and protection of landscape, culture and monuments ==
=== Plants and animals ===
The {{convert|16|ha|acre}} salt marshes and ancient sand dunes have a high conservation value and are the location of rare animal and plant species.&lt;ref name="chuffed"/&gt; Areas of indigenous, exotic and saline vegetation and the hills of the dune system form landscapes with different characteristics that seem timeless.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/22242|title=Truganina Explosives Magazine Complex (former) and trees  |publisher=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high corrugated sheet metal fence has protected the site from human entry, leaving it largely undisturbed for more than 100 years, creating a natural, native ecosystem.&lt;ref name="hob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hobsonsbay.vic.gov.au/page/page.asp?page_id=506 |title=Conservation Reserves |publisher=Hobsons Bay City Council |accessdate=22 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029094302/http://www.hobsonsbay.vic.gov.au/page/page.asp?page_id=506 |archivedate=29 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reserve is home to three species of birds of local importance, the [[white-bellied sea eagle]], [[Nankeen night heron]] and the [[brown quail]].

=== Cultural significance ===
Archaeological research on the property has uncovered many stone artifacts, including ground-edge axes, anvils and hammer-stones, indicating that the land was inhabited by [[Victorian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] tribes in the coastal area for some 6,500 years. Remnants of indigenous settlement were also found on the property, which together with the artifacts show that the area was used as a storage area.&lt;ref Name="alhs"/&gt; The Department of Treasury and Finance conducted archeological investigations in the former explosives reserve in 1995 and 1996, during which consultants found six artifact sites but no scarred trees, hearths, hearth stones, bone remains or shell scatters.&lt;ref name="NatTrust"&gt;[http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/70270 Altona Explosives Reserve (Former).''] In: National Trust Database.

The area is part of the traditional land of the [[Yalukit|Yalukit-willam]] clan, which settled in the coastal areas that stretch from the northern shores of [[Port Phillip]] to [[Wilson's Promontory]]. Little is known about the lifestyle of the Yalukit-willam clan.

=== Remains of the tramway ===
Only little remains of the former tramway have survived. The only visible part of the route can be seen on the south side of the reserve, where it ran in a curve through a gate towards the pier. Some rails with the embossing "WIW Australia" and a crown symbol are embedded in a in a concrete channel. The crown symbol is probably a trademark of the Commonwealth Steel Company, whose [[Waratah, New South Wales|Waratah]] Iron Works supplied many railways. The route then disappears there underneath the earthworks of a modern footpath.&lt;ref Name="Hermes22240"&gt;[http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/places/22240/download-report ''Truganina Explosives Reserve Tramway.''] In: Victorian Heritage Database Report.

The railway embankment, which was made of bluestone ballast, became visible during road works on the northeast corner of Queen Street and Merton Street. At this point the right of way of the narrow-gauge tramway line ran with a suitable radius over the property situated at the corner. Another section of the road is preserved near the ford westwards of Merton Street, again only as the earth dam, which turns west from the entrance to Laverton railway station and is partly overbuilt with a modern cycle path. The rails and sleepers are missing in these two sections and other sections of the routes within the reserve, but gravel and few metal artifacts are still visible. The sections within the reserve are either buried or overgrown.&lt;ref Name="Hermes22240"/&gt;

'''Volcanic gases''' are gases given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) [[volcano]]es. These include gases trapped in cavities ([[Vesicular texture|vesicles]]) in [[volcanic rock]]s, dissolved or dissociated [[gas]]es in [[magma]] and [[lava]], or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through [[hydrothermal|ground water heated by volcanic action]].

The sources of volcanic gases on Earth include: 
* primordial and recycled constituents from the [[Mantle (geology)#Earth's mantle|Earth's mantle]], 
* assimilated constituents from the [[Earth's crust]], 
* [[groundwater]] and the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. 
Substances that may become gaseous or give off gases when heated are termed volatile substances.

== Composition ==
[[File:Volcanic injection.svg|thumb|Schematic of volcanic eruption]]
The principal components of volcanic gases are [[water vapor]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur]] either as [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (high-temperature volcanic gases) or [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) (low-temperature volcanic gases), [[nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[helium]], [[neon]], [[methane]], [[carbon monoxide]]  and [[hydrogen]]. Other [[compound (chemistry)|compounds]] detected in volcanic gases are [[oxygen]] (meteoric), [[hydrogen chloride]], [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[hydrogen bromide]], [[nitrogen oxide]]  (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[carbonyl sulfide]], and [[organic compounds]]. Exotic trace compounds include [[mercury compounds|mercury]], [[halocarbons]] (including [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s), and [[halogen]] [[oxide]] [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]].

The abundance of gases varies considerably from volcano to volcano, with volcanic activity and with tectonic setting. Water vapour is consistently the most abundant volcanic gas, normally comprising more than 60% of total emissions. Carbon dioxide typically accounts for 10 to 40% of emissions.&lt;ref name="Encyclovolc"&gt;H. Sigurdsson et al. (2000) ''Encyclopedia of Volcanoes'', San Diego, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanoes located at [[convergent plate]] boundaries emit more water vapor and [[chlorine]] than volcanoes at [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]]s or [[divergent plate]] boundaries. This is caused by the addition of seawater into magmas formed at [[subduction zone]]s. Convergent plate boundary volcanoes also have higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/He and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/He ratios than [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] or divergent plate boundary volcanoes.&lt;ref name="Encyclovolc"/&gt;

== Magmatic gases and high-temperature volcanic gases ==

Magma contains dissolved [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile components]], as described above. The solubilities of the different volatile constituents are dependent on pressure, temperature and the composition of the [[magma]]. As magma ascends towards the surface, the ambient pressure decreases, which decreases the solubility of the dissolved volatiles. Once the solubility decreases below the volatile concentration, the volatiles will tend to come out of solution within the magma (exsolve) and form a separate gas phase (the magma is [[Supersaturation|super-saturated]] in volatiles).

The gas will initially be distributed throughout the magma as small bubbles, that cannot rise quickly through the magma. As the magma ascends the bubbles grow through a combination of expansion through decompression and growth as the solubility of volatiles in the magma decreases further causing more gas to exsolve. Depending on the viscosity of the magma, the bubbles may start to rise through the magma and coalesce, or they remain relatively fixed in place until they begin to connect and form a continuously connected network. In the former case, the bubbles may rise through the magma and accumulate at a vertical surface, e.g. the 'roof' of a magma chamber. In volcanoes with an open path to the surface, e.g. [[Stromboli]] in [[Italy]], the bubbles may reach the surface and as they pop small explosions occur. In the latter case, the gas can flow rapidly through the continuous permeable network towards the surface. This mechanism has been used to explain activity at Santiaguito, [[Santa María (volcano)|Santa Maria volcano]], [[Guatemala]]&lt;ref&gt;Holland et al. (2011), ''Degassing processes during lava dome growth: Insights from Santiaguito lava dome, Guatemala'', Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research vol. 202 p153-166&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soufrière Hills]] Volcano, [[Montserrat]].&lt;ref&gt;Hautmann et al. (2014), ''Strain field analysis on Montserrat (W.I.) as a tool for assessing permeable flow paths in the magmatic system of Soufrière Hills Volcano'', Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems vol. 15 p676-690&lt;/ref&gt; If the gas cannot escape fast enough from the magma, it will fragment the magma into small particles of ash. The fluidised ash has a much lower resistance to motion than the viscous magma, so accelerates, causing further expansion of the gases and acceleration of the mixture. This sequence of events drives explosive volcanism. Whether gas can escape gently (passive eruptions) or not (explosive eruptions) is determined by the total volatile contents of the initial magma and the [[viscosity]] of the magma, which is controlled by its composition.

The term `closed system' degassing refers to the case where gas and its parent magma ascend together and in [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] with each other. The composition of the emitted gas is in [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the composition of the magma at the pressure, temperature where the gas leaves the system. In `open system' degassing, the gas leaves its parent magma and rises up through the overlying magma without remaining in equilibrium with that magma. The gas released at the surface has a composition that is a mass-flow average of the magma exsolved at various depths and is not representative of the magma conditions at any one depth.

Molten rock (either [[magma]] or [[lava]]) near the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] releases high-temperature volcanic gas (&gt;400&amp;nbsp;°C). 
In explosive [[volcanic eruption]]s, the sudden release of gases from magma may cause rapid movements of the molten rock. When the magma encounters water, seawater, lake water or groundwater, it can be rapidly fragmented. The rapid expansion of gases is the driving mechanism of most explosive volcanic eruptions.  However, a significant portion of volcanic gas release occurs during quasi-continuous quiescent phases of active volcanism.

== Low-temperature volcanic gases and hydrothermal systems==

As magmatic gas travelling upward encounters [[meteoric water]] in an [[aquifer]], steam is produced. Latent magmatic heat can also cause meteoric waters to ascend as a vapour phase. Extended fluid-rock interaction of this hot mixture can leach constituents out of the cooling magmatic rock and also the [[country rock (geology)|country rock]], causing volume changes and phase transitions, reactions and thus an increase in [[ionic strength]] of the upward percolating fluid. This process also decreases the fluid's [[pH]]. Cooling can cause [[phase separation]] and [[mineral]] deposition, accompanied by a shift toward more reducing conditions. At the surface expression of such [[hydrothermal]] systems, low-temperature volcanic gases (&lt;400&amp;nbsp;°C) are either emanating as steam-gas mixtures or in dissolved form in [[hot springs]]. At the ocean floor, such hot supersaturated hydrothermal fluids form gigantic chimney structures called [[black smoker]]s, at the point of emission into the cold [[seawater]].

== Non-explosive volcanic gas release ==

The gas release can occur by advection through fractures, or via diffuse degassing through large areas of permeable ground as diffuse degassing structures (DDS). At sites of advective gas loss, precipitation of [[Native sulfur|sulfur]] and [[Volcanic sublimate|rare minerals]] forms sulfur deposits and small sulfur chimneys, called [[fumarole]]s. Very low-temperature (below 100&amp;nbsp;°C) fumarolic structures are also known as [[solfatara]]s. Sites of cold degassing of predominantly [[carbon dioxide]] are called [[mofette]]s. [[Hot springs]] on volcanoes often show a measurable amount of magmatic gas in dissolved form.

Volcanic gases were collected and analysed as long ago as 1790 by [[Scipione Breislak]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;N. Morello (editor) (1998), ''Volcanoes and History'', Genoa, Brigati&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of volcanic gases is dependent on the movement of magma within the volcano. Therefore, sudden changes in gas composition often presage a change in volcanic activity. Accordingly, a large part of hazard monitoring of volcanoes involves regular measurement of gaseous emissions. For example, an increase in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of gases at [[Stromboli]] has been ascribed to injection of fresh volatile-rich magma at depth within the system. &lt;ref&gt;Burton et al. (2007) ''Magmatic Gas Composition Reveals the Source Depth of Slug-Driven Strombolian Explosive Activity'' Science vol 317 p.227-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanic gases can be sensed (measured in-situ) or sampled for further analysis. Volcanic gas sensing can be:
* within the gas by means of electrochemical sensors and flow-through [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared-spectroscopic]] gas cells
* outside the gas by ground-based or airborne remote [[spectroscopy]] e.g., Correlation spectroscopy (COSPEC), [[Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy]] (DOAS), or [[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]] (FTIR).

Sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) absorbs strongly in the ultraviolet wavelengths and has low background concentrations in the atmosphere. These characteristics make sulphur dioxide a good target for volcanic gas monitoring. It can be detected by satellite-based instruments, which allow for global monitoring, and by ground-based instruments such as DOAS. DOAS arrays are placed near some well-monitored volcanoes and used to estimate the flux of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted. The [[Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System]] (Multi-GAS) is also used to remotely measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The fluxes of other gases are usually estimated by measuring the ratios of different gases within the volcanic plume, e.g. by FTIR, electrochemical sensors at the volcano crater rim, or direct sampling, and multiplying the ratio of the gas of interest to SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux.

Direct sampling of volcanic gas sampling is often done by a method involving an evacuated flask with [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] solution, first used by [[Robert Bunsen|Robert W. Bunsen]] (1811-1899) and later refined by the German chemist [[Werner F. Giggenbach]] (1937-1997), dubbed ''Giggenbach-bottle''. Other methods include collection in evacuated empty containers, in flow-through glass tubes, in gas wash bottles (cryogenic scrubbers), on impregnated filter packs and on solid adsorbent tubes.

Analytical techniques for gas samples comprise gas [[chromatography]] with [[thermal conductivity]] detection (TCD), [[flame ionization detector|flame ionization detection]] (FID) and [[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) for gases, and various wet chemical techniques for dissolved species (e.g., acidimetric [[titration]] for dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[ion chromatography]] for [[sulfate]], [[chloride]], [[fluoride]]). The trace metal, trace organic and [[isotope|isotopic]] composition is usually determined by different mass spectrometric methods.

== Volcanic gases and volcano monitoring ==
{{Main|Prediction of volcanic activity}}

Certain constituents of volcanic gases may show very early signs of changing conditions at depth, making them a powerful tool to predict imminent unrest. Used in conjunction with monitoring data on [[volcanic tremor|seismicity]] and [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]], correlative monitoring gains great efficiency. Volcanic gas monitoring is a standard tool of any [[volcano observatory]]. Unfortunately, the most precise compositional data still require dangerous field sampling campaigns. However, [[remote sensing]] techniques have advanced tremendously through the 1990s. The [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]] is employing Multi-GAS remote sensing to monitor 9 volcanoes on a continuous basis.

== Hazards ==

Volcanic gases were directly responsible for approximately 3% of all volcano-related deaths of humans between 1900 and 1986.&lt;ref name="Encyclovolc"/&gt; Some volcanic gases kill by acidic [[corrosion]]; others kill by [[asphyxiation]]. The [[greenhouse gas]], carbon dioxide, which is odorless, is emitted from volcanoes, accounting for nearly 1% of the annual global total.&lt;ref&gt;[[Royal Society]] ''Climate Change Controversies'', London, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some volcanic gases including sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen fluoride react with other atmospheric particles to form [[aerosol]]s.&lt;ref name="Encyclovolc"/&gt;
