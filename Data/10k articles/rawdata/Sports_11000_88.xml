'''Arsenal Stadium''' was a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Highbury]], [[North London]], which was the home ground of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal Football Club]] between 6 September 1913 and 7 May 2006. It was popularly known as "'''Highbury'''" due to its location and was given the affectionate nickname of the "Home of Football" by the club.&lt;ref name="nickname"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wdr/18469507/|title=Old Highbury|work=Flickr|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally built in 1913 on the site of a local college's recreation ground and was significantly redeveloped twice. The first reconstruction came in the 1930s from which the [[Art Deco]] East and West Stands date. There was a second development; the first phase was completed in 1989 which added executive boxes to the Clock End, and afterwards in 1993 a new North Bank Stand was constructed, both following the recommendations of the [[Taylor Report]] which replaced the [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] to make the stadium an all-seater with four stands. However, further attempts to expand the stadium were blocked by the community, and the resulting reduction in capacity and matchday revenue eventually led to Arsenal opting to build a new stadium, to become known as the [[Emirates Stadium]] in nearby Islington. After the club moved to their new stadium upon the conclusion of the 2005–2006 season, Highbury was redeveloped as a [[apartment|residential development]] known as [[Highbury Square]], with the Clock End and North Bank stands being demolished; parts of the East and West Stands remained and were incorporated into the new development due to their [[Listed building|listed status]].

The stadium also hosted international matches – both for [[England national football team|England]] and in the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Olympics]] – and [[FA Cup]] [[semi-finals]], as well as [[boxing]], [[baseball]] and [[cricket]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Its presence also led to the local [[London Underground]] station being renamed to [[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]] in 1932, making it the only station on the Underground network to be named after a football club.

In addition to its architecture, the stadium was known for its small but immaculate pitch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/magazines/emirates-stadium-new-goal-for-the-gunners-427035.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Emirates Stadium: New goal for the Gunners | date=4 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the clock which had been positioned in the southern side of the ground since its introduction in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-arsenal-clock |title=The Arsenal Clock &amp;#124; Arsenal's Heritage &amp;#124; History |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Arsenal Stadium Highbury east facade.jpg|thumb|The façade of the East Stand, on Avenell Road, in 2005.]]
The original stadium was built in 1913, when [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] moved from the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]] to Highbury, leasing the recreation fields of St John's College of Divinity for £20,000.&lt;ref name="ConservationPlan"/&gt; The lease negotiation also agreed that no matches were to be played on "[[holy days]]" and that no "intoxicating liquor" would be sold at the stadium; however, these stipulations were dropped within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Jon | last =Spurling  | title = Highbury The Story of Arsenal in N.5| publisher = Orion Books Ltd. | location = London | year = 2007| isbn = 978-0-7528-7639-9 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was hurriedly built over the summer of that year, and was designed by [[Archibald Leitch]], architect of many other football grounds of that era. It featured a single stand on the eastern side and the other three sides had banked terracing. The new stadium cost £125,000.&lt;ref name="ConservationPlan"/&gt; It opened whilst not fully complete, with Arsenal's first match of the [[1913–14 in English football|1913–14]] season, a 2–1 [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] win against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] on 6 September 1913. Leicester's [[Tommy Benfield]] scored the first goal at the new ground while [[George Jobey]] was the first Arsenal player to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

The [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian rugby league team]] suffered the first loss of their [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] at Highbury to an [[England national rugby league team|English side]] 4 points to 5 before approximately 12,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Arsenal bought the stadium site outright in 1925, for £64,000.&lt;ref name="ConservationPlan"/&gt;

No significant portion of Leitch's original stadium remains today following a series of bold redevelopments during the 1930s. The idea was to create a ground for London that could capture the grandeur of [[Villa Park]], home of [[Birmingham]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. The Highbury project was ambitious in its scale and reach, the first stand completed being the West Stand, designed by [[Claude Ferrier|Claude Waterlow Ferrier]] and [[William Binnie (architect)|William Binnie]] in the Art Deco style which opened in 1932.&lt;ref name="ConservationPlan"/&gt; On 5 November the same year the local Tube station was renamed from Gillespie Road to Arsenal. Leitch's main stand was demolished to make way for a new East Stand, matching the West, in 1936. The West Stand cost £45,000 while the East Stand went far over budget and ended up costing £130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Soar, Phil  |author2=Tyler, Martin  |lastauthoramp=yes |

During the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], the stadium hosted the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|football]] preliminaries. For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the [[Second World War]] the North Bank terrace was bombed and had to be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/arsenal-stadium-highbury/arsenal-stadium-a-history | title=Highbury – A history | publisher=Arsenal F.C. | accessdate=2008-08-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080818131707/http://www.arsenal.com/history/arsenal-stadium-highbury/arsenal-stadium-a-history| archivedate= 18 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floodlights (sport)|Floodlights]] were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against [[Hapoel Tel Aviv FC|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] on 19 September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footysphere.tumblr.com/post/188105522/arsenal-tel-aviv |title=Arsenal v Hapoel Tel Aviv 1951 |publisher=Footysphere.tumblr.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The floodlights that adorn [[Dalymount Park]], once stood at the Arsenal stadium.

Before the Taylor report and the era of all-seater stadiums in Britain, both the North Bank and Clock End consisted of [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]], and the stadium often saw crowds of up to 60,000 or more; its largest attendance was 73,295 on 9 March 1935 when Arsenal played [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the First Division; the game finished 0–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/appearances-and-attendances | title=Club Records: Appearances/Attendances | publisher=Arsenal F.C. | accessdate=2008-08-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080818131722/http://www.arsenal.com/history/club-records/appearances-and-attendances| archivedate= 18 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ground was initially constructed, it was to "accommodate 90,000 spectators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woolwich To Have New Ground at Highburg-- English Football News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TnpNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3UADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1223%2C3986307|date=19 August 1913|accessdate=2012-12-09|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph and Daily Witness|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The last ever game at Highbury.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Thierry Henry]] waiting to take a corner kick during the last ever game held at Highbury in 2006]]

In the early 1990s, the [[Taylor report]] on the [[Hillsborough disaster]] was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal's most passionate supporters, was demolished at the end of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]]. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Structure==
[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior Clock End.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Clock End, with executive boxes above, in 2005; since demolished.]]
At the time of its closure, the stadium consisted of four separate all-seater stands; the pitch was aligned north-south, with the North Bank Stand (formerly the Laundry End) and South Stand (popularly known as the Clock End) at the ends of the field. The East and West Stands ran alongside the pitch and are two of the few examples of British football stands designed in the Art Deco style. The East Stand incorporated the club's offices and was well known for its [[marble]] halls (though the floors were actually [[terrazzo]]) which are often cited in media depictions of the stadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

The stadium's main entrances were on [[Gillespie Road]], Avenell Road and Highbury Hill. When it closed, Highbury had a capacity of 38,419&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Arsenal Stadium was well known for its very small immaculately-kept [[Association football pitch|pitch]], which measured only 109×73 yards (100×67 metres).&lt;ref name="QuestionsAndAnswers"/&gt; Arsenal's groundsmen, Steve Braddock and his successor Paul Burgess, have won the [[FA Premier League]]'s Groundsman of the Year award several times for their work on the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

[[File:Highbury Square interior.jpg|thumb|right|Flats in one of the converted Listed Stands]]
The post-Taylor capacity of Highbury was limited to 38,419, while Arsenal's success during the 1990s and 2000s meant that virtually every home match was filled to near capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats2/eng_arsenal.htm | title=Arsenal Football Club plc | work=The Political Economy of Football }}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions, such as the East Stand's status as a [[listed building]] and the fact the stadium was surrounded on all sides by a [[residential area]], made any future expansion of Highbury difficult and expensive, although the club's directors would have liked to have kept Arsenal at a modernized and expanded Highbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/arsenal-consider-leaving-hallowed-marble-halls-1246012.html | title=Arsenal consider leaving hallowed marble halls | work=The Independent | date=18 August 1997 | accessdate=2012-12-09 | first=Clare | last=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1998, just after Arsenal started playing Champions League games at Wembley, the club made an unsuccessful bid to buy the stadium and make it their permanent home to share with the [[England national football team]], although at the time Wembley was two years away from closure for a redevelopment which was not completed until more than six years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-231297/Arsenal-tempted-Wembley.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, Arsenal decided to leave Highbury and construct a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goonernow.co.uk/arsenal-away/where-is-arsenal/ | title=Where is Arsenal | publisher=Goonernow.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed in October 2004 that the new stadium would be called the [[Emirates Stadium]] as part of a sponsorship deal with [[Emirates Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3715678.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium opened in July 2006; Arsenal's offices were moved to a new building, Highbury House, which was named in commemoration of the former stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/155/unhoused-import-pages/latest-stadium-news/new-stadium-secrets | title=New Stadium Secrets | publisher=Arsenal F.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their final season at Highbury ([[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]]) Arsenal ran a series of promotions honouring the stadium's legacy. A commemorative logo was designed featuring the club's traditional Art Deco crest from the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/photo_galleries/4965788.stm | title=Highbury farewell photos | publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-05-07 |accessdate=2013-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the club's history at Highbury was celebrated through a series of themed matchdays. On the field, Arsenal temporarily set aside their traditional red shirts with white sleeves for the season and adopted a solid redcurrant shirt, the colour they wore during their first season at Highbury in 1913–14.

Arsenal's final game at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on 7 May 2006 against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], the last game of the season. The team needed to better the result of neighbours [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] to again secure qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Having been 2–1 behind, a hat trick by captain and all-time leading goal scorer [[Thierry Henry]] secured qualification, with Henry kneeling down to kiss the turf on scoring what proved to be the final goal seen at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/arsenal-4-wigan-athletic-2-highbury-story-ends-with-last-act-of-sublime-skill-from-henry-477270.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Arsenal 4 Wigan Athletic 2: Highbury story ends with last act of sublime skill from Henry | first=Sam | last=Wallace | date=8 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last goal scored in a regulation game at the stadium came in a Football Aid charity match when lifelong fan Alan Alger scored a penalty in the final minute of a fixture played on Thursday 8 June 2006 (exactly one month and one day after Henry's goal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.footballaid.com/news-match-reports/match-reports/553/2006-06-07/arsenal-game-2-2006.html | location=London | work=Football Aid | title=Arsenal Game 2 2006 | date=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the stadium's closure, Arsenal held an [[auction]] to sell off many of the stadium's parts, including pieces of the pitch, the [[goal (sport)|goalposts]] and former manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]]'s desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

{{as of|2010}}, Arsenal Stadium was redeveloped and converted into [[apartment|flats]] in a project known as "[[Highbury Square]]", a scheme that had 711 properties built on the site.&lt;ref name="highburysquare"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/MajorSchemes/ArsenalStadium/HighburyScheme2005/default.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802015516/http://www.islington.gov.uk/Environment/Planning/MajorSchemes/ArsenalStadium/HighburyScheme2005/default.asp |archivedate=2 August 2009 | title=Highbury Square Development (Revised Scheme) | publisher=Islington Council | accessdate=2008-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Bank and Clock End stands were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exteriors of the listed Art Deco East Stand and the matching West Stand were preserved and incorporated into the new developments, while the rest of the stands' structures were removed, and the pitch became a communal garden. In October 2005 the proposed flats went on sale; as of May 2006 all properties in the North, East and West Stands had been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/155/unhoused-import-pages/latest-stadium-news/buy-a-home-at-the-stadium-highbury-square- | title=Buy a home at The Stadium, Highbury Square! | publisher=Arsenal F.C. | accessdate=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal's clock was moved from Highbury to the outer side of the new stadium, with a new larger version of the feature added inside the ground in August 2010. At the same time as the unveiling of the new clock, the south stands at the venue were also renamed ''Clock End'' inline with the same name previously used at Highbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/usa/the-club/history/the-arsenal-clock |title=The Arsenal Clock &amp;#124; The Club |publisher=Arsenal F.C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/emirates-stadium-s-new-clock-pictures |title=Emirates Stadium's new Clock – Pictures &amp;#124; News Archive  |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being home to Arsenal, it also hosted games as home stadium for England matches; 12 internationals were played at Highbury from 1920 to 1961, most of them being friendlies. These included both England's first full home international against opposition outside of Great Britain and Ireland ([[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in 1923), and the "[[Battle of Highbury]]", England's 3–2 win over [[Football World Cup|World Champions]] [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in 1934, where a record seven Arsenal players started the match, the most players from a single club to play in an England fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/155/unhoused-import-pages/ggm-39-seven-gunners-selected-for-england |title=GGM 39: Seven Gunners selected for England &amp;#124; History |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/teamclubs/ClubsMostPlyrsMatch.html |title=Most Players from a Single Club in an England Team |publisher=Englandfootballonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011849/http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamClubs/ClubsMostPlyrsMatch.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highbury was also used as a football venue for two matches in the [[1948 Summer Olympic Games|1948 London Olympics]] – a first-round match and a quarter-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Highbury was the venue for twelve FA Cup semi-finals as a neutral ground, the first in 1929 and the last in 1997, although between 1984 and 1992 it was off the FA's list of approved venues, after Arsenal's refusal to install perimeter fencing following a [[pitch invasion]] by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fans during their semi-final against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref name="feverpitch"/&gt; It also hosted the [[London XI]]'s home leg against [[Lausanne Sports]] in the [[UEFA Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1955-58|1955–58]] [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] semi-finals; London won 2–0 on the night and 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Arsenal did not always play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the [[Second World War]] the stadium was used as an [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] station and was [[bomb]]ed; Arsenal played their matches at [[White Hart Lane]], home of [[North London derby|North London rivals]] [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home [[UEFA Champions League]] matches in the [[UEFA Champions League 1998-99|1998–99]] and [[UEFA Champions League 1999-00|1999–00]] seasons were played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], as Highbury's already limited capacity had to be reduced to accommodate advertising [[Billboard (advertising)|hoardings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Soar &amp; Tyler | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | year=2005 | page=197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed for rebuilding in October 2000, it would not have been able to host their [[UEFA Champions League 2000-01|2000–01]] campaign.

Highbury has also hosted several cricket games and also baseball matches involving American servicemen between 1916 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/football-takes-a-back-seat-at-highbury |title=Football takes a back seat at Highbury &amp;#124; News Archive  |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the venue for the 1966 World Heavyweight boxing title bout between [[Henry Cooper]] and [[Muhammad Ali]], which Ali won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/21/newsid_2504000/2504777.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=1966: Cooper loses to world champ Clay | date=21 May 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has featured on the silver screen as well, having been the backdrop for at least two movies: ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'', and ''[[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|Fever Pitch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/454405/index.html |title=BFI Screenonline: Arsenal Stadium Mystery, The (1939) |publisher=Screenonline.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/football-banter/The-Football-Oscars-The-Damned-United-Escape-To-Victory-Goal-Gregory-s-Girl-The-Football-Factory-There-s-Only-One-Jimmy-Grimble-Fever-Pitch-Shaolin-Soccer-Goal-2-Looking-For-Eric-Yesterday-s-Hero-Best-The-Firm-Green-Street-The-Mean-Machine-Mike-Bassett-England-Manager-Bend-It-LIke-Beckham-and-our-awards-for-the-greatest-football-films-ever-made-article530231.html |title=The Football Oscars: The Damned United, Escape To Victory, Goal, Gregory's Girl, The Football Factory, There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, Fever Pitch, Shaolin Soccer, Goal 2, Loo |publisher=Mirrorfootball.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highbury also played host to an international [[rugby league]] match on 10 October 1921 as part of the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian rugby league team]]'s [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]]. The match saw [[England national rugby league team|England]] defeat Australia 5–4 in front of 12,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1921/game-8/england-vs-australia.html 1921-22 Kangaroo Tour - England vs Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Extreme Heat Policy''' is a rule pertaining to the [[Australian Open]] ([[tennis]]). It was introduced in 1998 after consultation with a number of tennis players.

==Changes for 2015==

Following severe criticism of the handling of the [[2014 Australian Open]], organisers increased the temperature threshold from the 2003 level of {{cvt|35|to|40|°C}} and increased the [[wet-bulb globe temperature]] (WBGT) threshold from the 2003 level of {{cvt|28|to|32.5|°C|0}} to allow for more continuous play and fewer stoppages in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Australian-Open-Unveils-New-Policy/id-3bfc62ed047546232185b206ab066848]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2857068/Australian-Open-revise-extreme-heat-policy-years-vomiting-players-fainting-ball-boys-fiasco.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

WBGT charts show that the new threshold may not be triggered even if the temperature reaches {{cvt|50|°C}} when there is no humidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrononhotonthologos.com/misc/hyg-wbgt-x.png]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the policy is implemented, matches will now be halted after an even number of games in the set, rather than at the conclusion of the set.

There will also be a retractable roof available on [[Margaret Court Arena]] for the first time.

==History==
In 1988, Rod Laver Arena opened making the Australian Open the first Grand Slam to feature a retractable roof. The initial heat policy allowed for the roof to be closed when the temperature rose above {{cvt|39|°C}} or at the referee's discretion when the temperature rose above {{cvt|35|°C}}, but only for daytime matches and only once all singles matches could be scheduled inside Rod Laver Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/21/sports/australian-open-hits-the-roof-as-the-temperatures-soar.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Australian-Open-comes-in-out-of-the-heat/id-7974ddbcfa586ca208507922765687bc]&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively meant that the heat policy could only go in effect in the quarterfinals or later in the tournament. 

Officials considered closing the roof for the final in 1993 due to a temperature of {{cvt|40|°C}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-31/sports/sp-1174_1_australian-open]&lt;/ref&gt; but Jim Courier threatened to boycott the match unless the roof remained open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history/draws/1993_MS_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat rule was first invoked during the quarterfinal round in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/21/sports/australian-open-hits-the-roof-as-the-temperatures-soar.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 a new policy was implemented calling for play on all courts to be stopped if the temperature reached {{cvt|40|°C}}. This was later changed in 2002 to {{cvt|38|°C}}.

The 2002 women's final was played in {{cvt|35|°C}} heat, which triggered a 10-minute break between the 2nd and 3rd sets but no halt in play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2002/australian_open/news/2002/01/25/ausopen_day13_ap/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2003 tournament the policy was changed to {{cvt|35|°C}} and a WBGT of {{cvt|28|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Australian-Open-Unveils-New-Policy/id-3bfc62ed047546232185b206ab066848]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new policy was invoked on January 20, 2003 on a day when the temperature reached {{cvt|37|°C}} and the WBGT reached the {{cvt|28|°C}} mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/20/1042911328214.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Play was halted for the minimum 2 hours.

After the extreme heat policy was invoked in consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, the policy was again changed starting in 2008 to allow matches in progress to be halted at the conclusion of the set.  Prior to that a match already underway had to be completed.  The policy was further changed in 2008 to allow play to be stopped only at the discretion of the tournament referee, rather than relying solely on temperature and WBGT calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tenniscountry.com/blog/2007/12/in_the_heat_of_a_tennis_match.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy was invoked several times in 2009, the hottest tournament to date with an average temperature of {{cvt|34.7|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news/article/-/20804692/extreme-heat-forces-rare-aussie-open-suspension/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201183339/http://au.sports.yahoo.com/tennis/news/article/-/20804692/extreme-heat-forces-rare-aussie-open-suspension/ |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===2014===
The extreme heat policy came under criticism during the [[2014 Australian Open]] after ballboys, attendants in the stands, and players were suffering various heat-related illnesses due to 4 consecutive days with highs between {{cvt|41.5|and|43.9|°C}}, but organizers claimed the humidity remained low enough on all but one day for the policy not to be enforced; tournament referee Wayne McKewen said that "While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where it was necessary to invoke the extreme heat policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/14/australian-open-slammed-inhumane-conditions-heat-tennis|title= Australian Open slammed for 'inhumane' conditions in extreme heat|date=15 January 2014|work=Guardian|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-2539084/AUSTRALIAN-OPEN-2014-Melbourne-heat-takes-toll-players-fans-temperature-reaches-42C.html|title= As players and ballboys collapse in 42C Australian heat, Murray sticks up for stricken stars who blast... it's so cruel!|date=15 January 2014|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Dancevic]], who began to hallucinate and collapse during his 6–7&lt;sup&gt;(12–14)&lt;/sup&gt;, 3–6, 4–6 loss to [[Benoît Paire]], described the conditions as "inhumane" while severely criticising the policy, and [[Andy Murray]] voiced his concerns about people's safety, stating that "it only takes one bad thing to happen". [[Ivan Dodig]], who also collapsed and was forced to retire, said afterwards that he was "thinking he could maybe even die" in the extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url = http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/other-sports/360644/Australian-Open-2014-Ivan-Dodig-thought-he-may-die-after-collapsing-due-to-brutal-heat|title= Australian Open 2014: Ivan Dodig thought he may 'die' after collapsing due to brutal heat|date=15 January 2014|work=Daily Star|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine players retired during the second day, while [[Daniel Gimeno-Traver]] carried off a ball boy who fainted during his match and [[Peng Shuai]] was amongst many throughout the tournament that required medical attention. [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] and [[Caroline Wozniacki]] noted that their shoes and water bottles were beginning to melt in the conditions,&lt;ref name="burlington"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/usatoday/article/4471083&amp;usatref=sportsmod |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140116031103/http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/usatoday/article/4471083&amp;usatref=sportsmod |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 January 2014 |title=Players, officials affected by Australian Open heat |date=14 January 2014 |work=Burlington Free Press |accessdate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Serena Williams]] and [[Victoria Azarenka]] said that the heat was affecting their play.

[[Roger Federer]], however, agreed with the referee's decision, saying that adequate training and preparation should be enough to cope with the weather. [[Gilles Simon]], who was injured prior to the tournament, took a similar view and said that the heat improved his game.&lt;ref name="burlington"/&gt;

On the second day of the tournament the temperature reached {{cvt|42.2|°C}}.  On the third day it reached {{cvt|41.5|°C}}.  On the fourth day it reached {{cvt|43.3|°C}}.  On the fifth day it reached {{cvt|43.9|°C}} with 6% humidity.  Play continued uninterrupted for the second, third, and fifth days and was stopped for 4 hours on the fourth day.  [https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/tennis/25755065]  For many players the stoppage was closer to 3 hours because they had to complete the set in progress even after the policy went into effect.  On Rod Laver Arena, Maria Sharapova and Karin Knapp had to complete a 3rd set that lasted nearly 2 hours and 18 games.  On the third day 970 fans had been treated for heat exhaustion. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skynews.com.au/topstories/article.aspx?id=942452]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact WBGT on these days has not been revealed by the organizers, it is clear that had the earlier 1998 policy been still in effect play would have been halted all 4 days once the temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius

The extreme heat resulted in a record number of 9 withdraws in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/15/australian-open-2014-heat-withdrawals]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spectator lawsuit===
On January 24, 2015, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' reported that Susan Carman sued the Melbourne &amp; Olympic Parks Trust for failing to close the roof at [[Hisense Arena]] during [[Andy Murray]]'s second round match in the [[2013 Australian Open]]. The temperature that day reached {{cvt|40|°C}}. Carman says she fell down the stairs while seeking shade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/hot-and-bothered-fan-suing-tennis-chiefs-for-not-providing-shade/story-fni0fee2-1227195190813]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7872">'''Chess Oscar''' was an international award given annually to the best [[chess]] player. The winner was selected by votes that are cast by chess journalists from across the world.
The traditional voting procedure was to request hundreds of chess journalists from many countries to submit a list of the ten best players of the year. The voters were journalists who knew the game and followed it closely, and so the honor was highly prized. The award itself took the form of a bronze statuette representing a man in a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.64.ru/?/en/news/item=766|title=64.ru|publisher=64.ru|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was created and awarded in 1967 by Spanish journalist Jorge Puig, and the International Association of Chess Press (AIP). The awards were given from 1967 until 1988. Then, after a pause, they resumed in 1995, and were then organized by the Russian chess magazine [[64 (magazine)|''64'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Oscar_of_the_Chess.html|title=Oscar of the Chess - SpeedyLook encyclopedia|publisher=Myetymology.com|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Tata McGraw. General Knowledge Digest 2010. Tata McGraw Hill Education Private Limited. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''64'' ceased publication in 2014, and the awards have not been made since.

==Statuette==
The statuette's final form, a man in a boat, was carved by the sculptor Alexander Smirnov. It represented a figure known as "The Fascinated Wanderer", which refers to a short story written in 1873 by 19th-century Russian author [[Nikolai Leskov]]. In this story, the title character, Ivan Flyagin, is a horse trainer and a brute of a man. From his birth his mother has promised that Ivan's life would be devoted to the church. Ivan spends many years avoiding this fate, but eventually gives in and becomes a monk, not for spiritual reasons, but due to a poverty of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Leskov, Nikolai.

''The Daily Mail''. 16 May 2013|work=Mail Online|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chess Oscar statuette originally took the form of "The Lady of the Umbrella", a figure based on a statue in [[Parc de la Ciutadella]] in [[Barcelona]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.chessclub.com/mailing/2008/05e/news.html|title=ICC Weekly Newsletter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37795">The '''Chess World Cup 2007''' served as a qualification tournament for the [[World Chess Championship 2010]]. It was held as a 128-player [[single-elimination tournament]], between 24 November and 16 December 2007, in [[Khanty-Mansiysk]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugra-chess.ru/eng/press.html|title=Chess in Khanty-Mansiysk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an event attended by most leading players of the world, American [[Gata Kamsky]] emerged as the winner. He was unbeaten in the tournament, going into tie-break only once and defeating [[Spain|Spaniard]] [[Alexei Shirov]], 2½–1½, in the four-game final. Two 17-year-old players, [[Sergey Karjakin]] and [[Magnus Carlsen]], reached the semifinals.

By winning, Kamsky qualified for the Challenger Match, the final stage in determining the challenger for the [[World Chess Championship 2010]]; his participation in that match allowed him direct entry into the [[Candidates Matches]] for the [[World Chess Championship 2012]].

The final four also received direct entry into the [[FIDE Grand Prix 2008&amp;ndash;10]], a qualifying stage for the [[World Chess Championship 2012]].

The winner of the [[Chess World Cup 2005]], [[Levon Aronian]], was defeated by [[Dmitry Jakovenko]] in the fourth round.

==Background==
The 2007 World Cup was part of the cycle for the [[World Chess Championship 2010]]. [[Gata Kamsky]], as the winner of this tournament, played an eight-game match against [[Veselin Topalov]] in 2008, for the right to be the challenger for the [[World Chess Championship 2010]]. Ultimately Topalov won the match and will face World Champion [[Viswanathan Anand]], who successfully defended his title against former champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] at the [[World Chess Championship 2008]].

==Prominent non-participants==
[[Vladimir Kramnik]] and [[Veselin Topalov]] were ineligible to participate, due to special privileges they already had in the 2008&amp;ndash;2010 World Championship cycle.

All other leading players, including world champion [[Viswanathan Anand]], were eligible to participate. However Anand, who was already seeded into the 2008&amp;ndash;2010 cycle, elected not to play.

Three other players who had recently competed in the [[World Chess Championship 2007]] in Mexico - [[Péter Lékó]], [[Aleksandr Morozevich]] and [[Boris Gelfand]] - elected not to play. Lékó and Morozevich refused to take part as a form of protest against the special privileges given for the inclusion of Kramnik and Topalov in the World Chess Championship Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4214 |title=Morozevich: "I cannot play without motivation" |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-28 |publisher=[[Chessbase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3983 |title=Leko's manager Carsten Hensel: "the privilege that Topalov is getting, to play against the winner of the World Cup or to immediately challenge Kramnik in a world championship match, must be of concern to the other top players. I expect all top grandmasters, including Peter Leko, to protest against this special privilege." |date=11 July 2007 |publisher=[[Chessbase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other player from the Top 30 who did not participate was [[Judit Polgár]].

==Qualification==
The final list of 128 qualifiers for the World Cup was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/3-news/1653-144-list-of-qualifiers-for-the-world-cup-2007 List of Qualifiers for the World Cup 2007] from fide.com, accessed 2008-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing conditions==
The tournament is in the style of the [[FIDE World Chess Championships 1998&amp;ndash;2004]]: each round consists of a two-game match (except for the final round, which will be a four-game match), followed by tie breaks at faster time controls if required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=DD106 Regulations for the 2007 - 2009 World Chess Championship Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215013633/http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=DD106 |date=2007-12-15 }}, section 3.2, [[FIDE]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3948 |title=Veselin Topalov and the new FIDE world championship cycle |date=24 June 2007 |publisher=[[Chessbase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The time control for regular games is 90 minutes for the first 40 moves and 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with 30 seconds added after each move. Tie breaks consist of two rapid chess games (25 minutes each + 10 seconds per move); followed by two blitz games if required (5 minutes + 10 seconds per move); followed by a single [[Armageddon chess]] game if required (white has 6 minutes and must win, black has 5 minutes and only needs to draw).

The prize money ranged from US$6,000 for players eliminated in the first round to $80,000 for the losing finalist and $120,000 for the winner.

==Results, rounds 1–4==

With this result, classifies the final hex to then obtain the runners-up in the [[Tercera División B de Chile|Tercera División B]], ascending to the [[Tercera División A de Chile|Tercera División A]].

In 2014, after ascend to the [[Tercera División A de Chile]] changed its name to '''Club de Deportes Vallenar'''. In the tournament, ends in the worst position of its brief history: 5°.
On 12 December of the year 2015, '''Deportes Vallenar''' defeat 2-0 to Deportivo Estación Central, ensuring at least the second place in the [[Tercera División A de Chile|Tercera División A]] to 2015 in the penultimate date. With this is assured one of the 2 posts direct ascent to the [[Segunda División de Chile]]. At the end of the season, '''Deportes Vallenar''' was in the second position. The club will play for the first time in its history, in the professionalism from the year 2016.

In its short history the club has participated for 1 year in [[Tercera División B de Chile|Tercera División B]], 2 years in [[Tercera División A de Chile|Tercera División A]], and 1 year in the [[Segunda División de Chile|Segunda División]].

'''Dice stacking''' is a [[performance art]], akin to [[juggling]] or [[sleight-of-hand]], in which the performer scoops [[dice]] off a flat surface with a dice cup and then sets the cup down while moving it in a pattern that stacks the dice into a vertical column via centripetal force and inertia. Various dice arrangements, colors of dice, scooping patterns and props allow for many degrees of complexity and difficulty. Dice stacking is usually performed with canceled casino dice, as their square edges and heavy weight give them an advantage when being stacked.

Dice stacking comes from lower Germany.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In Germany the first national dice stacking championship tournament took place in May 2008. Tournament rules included the use of a special designed DiceBoard for players which shows the different prescribed moves. There are two disciplines: the "full-area" discipline and the "speed-area" discipline.

'''Dori Lal Agarawal Sports Stadium''' or '''Regional Sports Stadium''' is a multi-purpose stadium in [[Bareilly]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The ground is mainly used for organizing matches of football, cricket, and other sports. The stadium was established in 1960 and has hosted international matches&lt;ref&gt; [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/14/912_misc.html Other Match]&lt;/ref&gt; between [[India women's cricket team]] and [[Sri Lanka women's cricket team]].&lt;ref&gt; [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/158/158469.html India women vs. Sri Lanka women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Government of Uttar Pradesh]] decided to upgrade the stadium's core via construction of a dormitory with 400 beds for both male and female players, as well as staircases.&lt;ref&gt; [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/Sports-stadium-set-for-up-gradation/articleshow/45875266.cms Sports stadium set for up gradation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/2-new-stadiums-to-come-up-in-Bareilly-villages/articleshow/46459356.cms 2 new stadiums to come up in Bareilly villages]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fans Field''' was a [[minor league baseball]] [[baseball park|park]] in [[Bloomington, Illinois]], and was home to the Bloomington franchise of the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League]], popularly known as the Three-I League or jokingly as the Three-Eye League, from the early 1900s through 1939. The team had various names, but was primarily known as the [[Bloomington Bloomers]], as well as the Bloomington Blues, Bloomington Bengals, Bloomington Cubs and  Bloomington Cardinals.  It was a short block east of South Main Street, on the south side of Lafayette, perhaps ''not'' coincidentally near the Brewery that sat just west of South Main and served the city's significant German population well. One of that Brewery's buildings was later used for a clubhouse at the Highland Park golf course. As for the ballpark, after the end of minor league ball in the city, the stands were converted for use as a fairgrounds, and later a ballroom was built on the site.

==Teams that played at Fans Field==
Minor league teams that played at Fans field were independent for the most part, but fans field did see some minor league teams that were affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]] teams.  The 1935 Bloomington Cardinals were affiliated with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], the 1938 Bloomington Bloomers were affiliated with the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the 1939 Bloomers were affiliated with the [[Chicago Cubs]].
Fans field hosted four league championship teams. League champion teams included the 1903, 1919, and 1920 Bloomers and the 1935 Bloomington Cardinals.

==The site today==
Today, the site is home to the RT Dunn Fields at 109 E. Lafayette.&lt;ref&gt;http://softball.isport.com/softball-fields/us/illinois/bloomington/rt-dunn-fields-1652166&lt;/ref&gt; The site remains adjacent to the National Guard Armory, has five acres with two lighted ball fields and is also utilized for football and soccer.&lt;ref&gt;http://4.17.232.139/parks/VW-Systems/Map/map.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19160">'''Formula SAE''' is a [[student design competition]] organized by [[SAE International]] (previously known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE). The competition was started in 1980 by the SAE student branch at the University of Texas (Austin) after a prior asphalt racing competition proved to be unsustainable (see History).

==Concept==
[[Image:FSAE Design 2007.JPG|thumb|right|400px|The 2007 design finalist cars; from the left, [[University of Michigan - Ann Arbor]], [[Graz University of Technology|TU Graz]], [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]], and [[University of Kansas|Kansas]]. Absent is the [[Pennsylvania State University]]]]
The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small [[Formula One|Formula-style]] [[race car]]. The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend [[autocross]] racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.

The prototype race car is judged in a number of different events. The points schedule for most Formula SAE events is:&lt;ref&gt;Bob Woods, ''1996 Formula SAE Rules'', (Warrendale, PA) : Educational Relations SAE International, inadition, winners were Chihuahua Institute of Technology´s students, from mexico p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these events, various sponsors of the competition provide awards for superior design accomplishments. For example, best use of E-85 ethanol fuel, innovative use of electronics, recyclability, crash worthiness, analytical approach to design, and overall dynamic performance are some of the awards available. At the beginning of the competition, the vehicle is checked for rule compliance during the Technical Inspection. Its braking ability, rollover stability and noise levels are checked before the vehicle is allowed to compete in the dynamic events (Skidpad, Autocross, Acceleration, and Endurance).

Formula SAE encompasses all aspects of a business including research, design, manufacturing, testing, developing, marketing, management, and fund raising.

Big companies, such as [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]], can have staff interact with more than 1000 student engineers. Working in teams of anywhere between two and 30, these students have proven themselves to be capable of producing a functioning prototype vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Case, Student Talent, ''Racecar Engineering'', Vol. 5 No. 3 (England): p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteers for the design judging include some of the racing industry's most prominent engineers and consultants including the late [[Carroll Smith]], Bill Mitchell, Doug Milliken, Claude Rouelle, [[Jack Auld]], [[John LePlante]], [[Ron Tauranac]], and [[Bryan Kubala]].

Today, the competition has expanded and includes a number of spinoff events. [[Formula Student]] is a similar SAE-sanctioned event in the UK, as well as [[Formula SAE Australasia]] (Formula SAE-A) taking place in [[Australia]]. A Formula SAE West event takes place in [[California]] but will be replaced by SAE Lincoln in Nebraska for 2012. The Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) holds the [[Formula Student Germany]] competition at [[Hockenheimring]].

In 2007, an offshoot called [[Formula Hybrid]] was inaugurated. It is similar to Formula SAE, except all cars must have gasoline-electric hybrid power plants. The competition takes place at the [[New Hampshire International Speedway]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515131048/http://www.formula-hybrid.org/competition.html]

==Summary of rules==

===Student competition===

Formula SAE has relatively few performance restrictions. The team must be made up entirely of active college students (including drivers) which places obvious restrictions on available work hours, skill sets, experience, and presents unique challenges that professional race teams do not face with a paid, skilled staff. This restriction means that the rest of the regulations can be much less restrictive than most professional series.

Students are allowed to receive advice and criticism from professional engineers or faculty, but all of the car design must be done by the students themselves. Students are also solely responsible for fundraising, though most successful teams are based on curricular programs and have university-sponsored budgets. Additionally, the points system is organized so that multiple strategies can lead to success. This leads to a great variety among cars, which is a rarity in the world of motorsports.

===Engine===
The engine must be a [[four-stroke]], [[Otto cycle|Otto-cycle]] piston engine with a displacement no greater than 710cc. An [[air restrictor]] of circular cross-section must be fitted downstream of the throttle and upstream of any [[forced induction|compressor]], no greater than 20mm for gasoline engines or 19mm for ethanol-fueled engines. The restrictor keeps power levels below 100&amp;nbsp;hp in the vast majority of FSAE cars. Most commonly, production four-cylinder 600cc [[sport bike]] engines are used due to their availability and displacement.  However there are many teams that use smaller [[V-twin]] and [[single-cylinder]] engines, mainly due to their weight-saving and packaging benefits. Though it is permitted, very rarely do teams build an engine from scratch, such as [[Western Washington University]]'s 554cc V8 entry in 2001, [[University of Melbourne]]'s "WATTARD" engine in 2003-2004 and [[University of Auckland]]'s V twin.

===Suspension===
The suspension is unrestricted save for safety regulations. Most teams opt for four-wheel [[independent suspension]], almost universally [[double-wishbone]]. Active suspension is legal.

===Aerodynamics===
There are few regulations or requirements on aerodynamics. Most teams do not build aerodynamic packages as the speeds involved in FSAE competition rarely exceed {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}}, and design judging tends to frown upon aerodynamic parts that do not have definite test data, usually in the form of [[wind tunnel]] testing or at least [[computational fluid dynamics]] analysis. Therefore, most cars that do utilize aerodynamic downforce tend to develop their entire car around the aerodynamic package, including massive wings and undertrays. The benefit of a well-developed aerodynamic package is evident; depending on how fast the course is, the slowest aero-package cars sometimes run several seconds per lap faster than any of the non-aero cars.

===Weight===
There is no weight restriction. The weight of the average competitive Formula SAE car is usually less than {{convert|440|lb|abbr=on}} in race trim. However, the lack of weight regulation combined with the somewhat fixed power ceiling encourages teams to adopt innovative weight-saving strategies, such as the use of composite materials, elaborate and expensive machining projects, and [[rapid prototyping]]. In 2009 the fuel economy portion of the endurance event was assigned 100 of the 400 endurance points, up from 50. This rules change has marked a trend in [[engine downsizing]] in an attempt to save weight and increase fuel economy. Several top-running teams have switched from high-powered four-cylinder cars to smaller, one- or two-cylinder engines which, though they usually make much less power, allow weight savings of {{convert|75|lb|abbr=on}} or more, and also provide much better fuel economy. If a lightweight single-cylinder car can keep a reasonable pace in the endurance race, it can often make up the points lost in overall time to the heavier, high-powered cars by an exceptional fuel economy score. 
:'''Example:''' At the 2009 Formula SAE West endurance event, third-place finishers [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] completed the endurance course in 22 minutes, 45 seconds with their four-cylinder car, while fourth-place finishers [[Oregon State University]] finished in 22 minutes, 47 seconds with their single-cylinder car; this gave RIT 290.6 of 300 points for the race portion of the event and OSU 289.2 points. However, OSU used the least fuel of any car ({{convert|.671|USgal|l|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|20.3|mpgus|l/km|abbr=on}} over the entire endurance race) and received the full 100 points for fuel economy, while RIT used {{convert|1.163|USgal|l|abbr=on}} ({{convert|11.75|mpgus|l/km|abbr=on}}) and was thus only awarded 23.9 of the available points. RIT went on to win the overall competition by only 8.9 points over OSU, having scored slightly better in all of the other dynamic events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sae.org/students/fsaew2009results.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The majority of the regulations pertain to safety. Cars must have two steel [[roll hoop]]s of designated thickness and alloy, regardless of the composition of the rest of the chassis. There must be an [[impact attenuator]] in the nose, and impact testing data on this attenuator must be submitted prior to competing. Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing. Tilt-tests ensure that no fluids will spill from the car under heavy cornering, and there must be no line-of-sight between the driver and fuel, coolant, or oil lines.

==History==
In 1979 the only SAE Mini-Indy was held at the [[University of Houston]].  Conceived by Dr. Kurt M. Marshek, the competition was inspired by a how-to article that appeared in [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine, for a small, "Indy-style" vehicle made out of wood, and powered by a five-horsepower [[Briggs and Stratton]] engine.  Using the [[Mini Baja]] competitions as a guide, engineering students had to design and build small, "Indy-style" vehicles using the same stock engine used in the ''Popular Mechanics'' article. Thirteen schools entered and eleven competed. The University of Texas at El Paso won the overall competition.

Although Dr. William Shapton (who had recently left the [[University of Cincinnati]] to join [[Michigan Technological University]]) broached the idea of hosting a similar competition in 1980, no one stepped up to organize another Mini-Indy.

In 1980 when the members of the new SAE student branch at the University of Texas (Austin) learned that the Mini-Indy had died, they generated the concept for a new intercollegiate student engineering design competition that would allow students to apply what they were learning in the classroom to a complex, real-world engineering design problem: design and development of a race car.  UT SAE student branch members Robert Edwards and John Tellkamp led a discussion among UT SAE members and envisioned a competition that would involve designing and constructing a race car along the lines of the SCCA Formula 440 entry-level racing series that was popular at the time.  Prof. Matthews came up with the “Formula SAE” name following the format of Formula A and Formula Vee but emphasizing that this new race car was an engineering competition rather than a driver’s competition.  Schools would meet after the end of the academic year to compete and determine who had built the best car.  Edwards, Tellkamp, and fellow UT SAE students Joe Green, Dick Morton, Mike Best, and Carl Morris drafted a set of safety and competition rules and presented them to the SAE student branch membership and to UT SAE Faculty Advisor Prof. Ron Matthews.  Prof. Matthews then contacted Bob Sechler of the SAE Educational Relations Department at SAE headquarters and asked for his permission both to establish the new intercollegiate student engineering design competition and to host the first Formula SAE competition during the summer of 1981, and he agreed.  The newly formed UT SAE branch, consisting mostly of automotive and motorcycle enthusiasts pursuing engineering degrees, including several who had left careers in fields for which the job market had virtually disappeared due to the depressed economy in the early 1980s – including some experienced auto mechanics, embraced and adopted the concept with little idea of what they were getting themselves into.  SAE student branch officers Mike Best, Carl Morris, and Sylvia Obregon, along with Dr. Matthews began planning and organizing the event to be held the following year.  

Here, it is important to note that Formula SAE was NOT a simple renaming of the Mini-Indy competition but was instead an entirely new intercollegiate student engineering design competition.  Unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, the Formula SAE rules left the selection of the engine to the design team, as long as a 4 stroke engine with a one-inch diameter intake restrictor was used.  (The current Formula SAE rules allow the teams to use 4-stroke engines up to 710 cc, with a smaller restrictor.)  Also, unlike all previous SAE-sanctioned student racing/design competitions including Mini-Indy, engine modifications were both allowed and encouraged. 
The first Formula SAE competition was held in the parking lot of the UT baseball field (Disch-Falk field) on the University of Texas campus on Memorial Day weekend, 1981.  Judges included legendary race car engineer/owner/driver and Indy 500 champion Jim Hall. While a sudden Texas rain storm sent everyone scrambling for cover just before the endurance event that day, the weather failed to dampen the spirits of the students, judges, or spectators and Formula SAE was born.  
The University of Texas continued to host the event from 1982 to 1984 as the popularity and number of participants grew.  In these subsequent years, UT moved the Formula SAE competition to other parking areas that included elevation changes and driveway aprons that forced the use of functioning suspensions.  The event became international in 1982 with the entry of Universidad La Salle team from Mexico City.  The significant rules changes for 1982 were: 1) a displacement limit of 600 cc (300 cc for Wankels), but the 1 inch diameter restrictor rule was retained, 2) a requirement for 4-wheel independent suspension (Mini-Indy did not have any suspension rules), and 3) the addition of a temporary “B&amp;S” class of vehicles that were originally designed for Mini-Baja, had to retain the 8 hp Briggs &amp; Stratton engine, and did not need to comply with the 4-wheel independent suspension rule.  Formula SAE continued to be an international competition when the team from Universidad La Salle returned.  With the only engine restrictions being a displacement limit of 600 cc and a 1 inch maximum diameter for the intake, creativity flourished.  Also in 1983, the temporary B&amp;S class was eliminated, the University of Texas at Austin entered the first composite Formula SAE vehicle and Marquette University entered the first turbocharged engine.  The rules allowed a Formula SAE car to compete for two years in recognition of the effort required to build and test a quality car.  This also allowed students the experience of re-engineering and improving on design elements that did not work.  The rules for 1984 specifically allowed turbochargers, superchargers, and use of nitrous oxide but the engine had to breathe through a 25.4 mm exit bore of the carburetor casting (1984 was well before electronic fuel injection).  Engine intake restrictors were later tightened as cars became faster year over year as knowledge was passed on within and between teams.  Also, a 65-100 inch wheelbase rule was promulgated, as was a rule requiring all vehicles to have a “body that resembles a formula car”.  The Formula SAE field had grown to eleven cars in 1984, so the University of Texas at Austin decided that the competition had matured sufficiently that it was safe to pass it on to other hosts.

The University of Texas at Austin hosted the competition through 1984. In 1985, the competition was hosted by The [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. There, Dr. Robert Woods, with guidance from the SAE student activities committee, changed the concept of the competition from one where students built a pure racing car, to one that mirrored the SAE Mini-Baja competitions, where they were to design and build a vehicle for limited series production.

General Motors hosted the competition in 1991, Ford Motor Co. in 1992, and Chrysler Corp. in 1993. After the 1992 competition, the three formed a consortium to run Formula SAE.

At the end of the 2008 competition, the consortium ceased to exist.  The event is now funded by SAE through company sponsorships and donations along with the teams' enrollment fees.

[[File:Front handspring.gif|right|thumb|A ''front handspring'', performed as part of an [[acro dance]] routine.]]
A '''handspring''' is an [[acrobatic]] move in which a person executes a complete revolution of the body by lunging headfirst from an upright position into an inverted vertical position and then pushing off (i.e., "springing") from the floor with the hands so as to leap back to an upright position. The direction of body rotation in a handspring may be either forward or backward, and either kind may be performed from a stationary standing position or while in motion. Body movement may be terminated upon completion of a handspring, or the performer's momentum may be leveraged so as to immediately perform another handspring or other rotational move.

Handsprings are performed in various physical activities, including [[acro dance]], [[cheerleading]] and [[gymnastics]]. In competitive activities, handsprings may be judged on a number of criteria.

== Description ==
A handspring is an [[acrobatic]] move in which a person executes a complete revolution of the body by lunging headfirst from an upright position into an inverted vertical position and then pushing off (i.e., "springing") from the floor with the hands so as to leap back to an upright position. Handsprings are performed in various physical activities, including [[acro dance]], [[cheerleading]] and [[gymnastics]].

=== Types ===
The direction of body rotation in a handspring may be either forward or backward, resulting in a '''front handspring''' or '''back handspring''', respectively. In a back handspring the performer does not see where the hands will land until after the move has begun.

A ''standing'' handspring is one that begins from a stationary standing position. For example, a back handspring that begins with the performer in a stationary standing position is a ''standing back handspring''.

Body movement may be terminated upon completion of a handspring, or the performer's momentum may be leveraged so as to immediately perform another handspring or other rotational move (e.g., a [[Gymnastics flip|flip]], such as a tuck or layout). Similarly, another rotational move (e.g., a [[roundoff]]) may precede a handspring in order to develop sufficient momentum for the handspring.

== In gymnastics ==

In [[artistic gymnastics]], handsprings are commonly performed in the [[floor exercise]], [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]], and [[balance beam]] events.

=== Technique ===
A standing back handspring begins with a three phase sequence known as "up, sit, jump". In the ''up'' phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the ''sit'' phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by the sides of the torso, bends knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the ''jump'' phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a "hollow" shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.

=== Judging ===
Gymnastics judges will deduct points if certain criteria are not satisfied during a handspring. For example, in a standing back handspring the judges will evaluate aspects of form and motion such as:
* Begin standing up straight, on flat feet with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal.
* Upon jumping, head held in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together.
* Upon landing, no additional steps (to correct balance), arms raised high ("salute").

In a front handspring, judges will evaluate aspects of form and motion such as:
* Looking at the hands throughout the entire handspring.
* Land on the balls of the feet in a tight arch.

=== Variations ===

A front handspring can be started from a stationary standing position, but it is more common for gymnasts to hurdle into front handsprings at a run. It is also possible to precede a front handspring with a "step out", which is similar to a handspring but lands one foot at a time. It can be performed on beam the same way it is performed on floor. It is the most basic type of vault performed at competitions.

A variation of the back handspring often performed on the balance beam is called the "back handspring step-out". In this variation, the gymnast splits the legs upon takeoff, attains a full split when inverted, and lands one foot at a time. Stepping out makes it easier for the gymnast to land safely and perform other tricks following the handspring. A back handspring can also be performed on the vault as part of a vault called a [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]].

In another variation of a front handspring, called a [[flyspring]], the gymnast's feet are held together from beginning to end. Therefore, in order to do a flyspring, the gymnast must jump into it.

Flips such as a [[Somersault|salto]] or [[Split (gymnastics)|layout]] may be performed after a handspring; these may twist as well as flip. Similarly, a handspring may be preceded by another rotational move, such as a [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]] landing with the feet together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3968">[[Cricket]] must have reached [[Hertfordshire]] by the end of the 17th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is [[1732 English cricket season|dated 1732]] and is also the earliest reference to [[Essex county cricket teams|Essex]] as a county team. On Thursday, 6 July 1732, a team called [[Essex &amp; Hertfordshire cricket team|Essex &amp; Hertfordshire]] played [[London Cricket Club]] in a [[First-class cricket|first-class match]] at [[Epping Forest]] "for £50 a side". The result is unknown.&lt;ref name=GB67&gt;Buckley, ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS20&gt;ACS, ''Important Matches'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertfordshire has not usually been considered a first-class county but its teams did appear frequently throughout the eighteenth century and played in some matches classified as first-class. There was a county organisation of sorts in 1838 and the present [[Hertfordshire County Cricket Club]] was founded on 8 March 1876. It joined the [[Minor Counties Championship]] for the very first season, 1895, and is the only one of the seven competing sides from that season to have maintained membership continuously ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Barclays, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hrazdan Stadium''' ({{lang-hy|Հրազդան մարզադաշտ}}) is a multi-use, [[all-seater stadium]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], opened in 1970. Being the largest sports venue in Armenia, Hrazdan is mostly used for [[Associated football|football]] matches. It is the home stadium of the [[Armenia national football team|Armenian national team]]. The stadium is able to host 54,208 spectators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrazdanholding.com/about.php Hrazdan Holding:Sports Complex]&lt;/ref&gt; after the most recent reconstruction in 2008, which converted the stadium into an all-seater one. Before the reconstruction, Hrazdan was able to hold up to 70,000 spectators. It was among the top four stadiums of the [[Soviet Union]] by its capacity. The stadium hosted the [[Armenian Cup]] finals during many occasions as well as the opening ceremony of the [[Pan-Armenian Games]] in 2003. The [[USSR national football team|USSR national team]] played two games against Finland and Greece in Hrazdan in 1978.

==History==
===Origin and construction===
The earliest idea of building a football stadium in the valley of Hrazdan river was proposed by the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union [[Anastas Mikoyan]] in his visit to Yerevan in the 1950s. During his stay at the presidential mansion on a hill overlooking the Hrazdan river, he observed a "natural amphitheater" in Hrazdan gorge and proposed the construction of a football venue with a capacity of 30,000 seats. However, the idea never became serious during that period.

In 1967, the authorities of [[Soviet Armenia]] launched a serious program to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[sovietization]] of Armenia in 1970. A group of architects, led by former weightlifter Koryun Hakopyan and former [[fencing|fencer]] Gurgen Musheghyan proposed the construction plan of a football stadium in [[Hrazdan River|Hrazdan]] gorge, to host around 75,000 spectators.

A total amount of 5 million rubles was allocated for the project. The construction works were launched during the second half of 1969 and with the financial support of [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], completed in a remarkable period of 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Football diplomacy, Armenia-Turkey: From Ararat’s victory to Jorkaeff’s goal| url = http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=4178&amp;CID=3986&amp;IID=1258&amp;lng=eng | publisher = Armeninow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction process was highly supervised by the Communist leader [[Karen Demirchyan]]. Finally, the venue became ready in November 1970. The official opening of the stadium took place on November 29, 1970 with the presence of [[Leonid Brezhnev]], celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Armenian SSR. However, the planned ceremony for the opening day was postponed due to heavy snow.

Hrazdan Stadium hosted its first official football match on May 19, [[1971 Soviet Top League|1971]] when [[FC Ararat Yerevan|Ararat Yerevan]] defeated [[FC Kairat|Kairat Almaty]] 3-0 in front of 78,000 spectators, with Alexandr Kovalenko (58th min), Oganes Zanazanyan (74th min. pen.) and Nikolai Kazaryan (77th min.) scoring for the hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/su71.html#71l Soviet top league 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hrazdan Stadium 2013.jpg|thumb|General view of the stadium]]
The stadium hosted some glorious moments of the Armenian football during Soviet era. The Armenians celebrated [[FC Ararat Yerevan|Ararat Yerevan]]'s double of the Soviet football in 1973, which allowed them to play in the [[European Cup 1974-75|European Cup]]. Reaching the quarterfinals, they lost the first leg to the defending and future champions Bayern Munich with a result of 2-0 while they won the 2nd leg 1-0 in Hrazdan stadium in front of more than 70,000 spectators.

In 1985, Hrazdan was one of the venues of the [[1985 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championsh]] took place in the Soviet Union. It hosted the matches of the 1st group as well as a match during the quarter finals.

Aftr the independence of Armenia, the arena hosted the matches of the national team until 1999 when the smaller [[Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium|Republican Stadium]] in downtown Yerevan became its home ground. The largest number of spectators for the National team was recorded on October 9, 1996, in a [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|1998 World Cup qualification]] match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. Attended by 42,000 fans, the match ended in favour of the Germans with a result of 5-1.

===Architectural team===
The history of the stadium is closely related with the history of Armenian football. The Stadium which was built in a record period of 18 months, is the first in the world that was built in a mountainous landscape.
  
The architects of the stadium were Koryun Hakobyan and Gurgen Musheghyan from Armenia. The construction process was supervised by engineer Edward Tossunian. The architectural group of the stadium was granted the award of the best construction of the year in 1971 and honoured by the Soviet Government.&lt;ref&gt;Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia vol.7-1981, article:Stadium (''Marzadasht'' in Armenian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation==
[[File:HrazdanArmeniaTurkey.JPG|thumb|The stadium in 2008]]
In 2003 the stadium was privatized and sold to the Hrazdan Holding CJSC, who began to set up a renovation process in 2005. By the end of 2008 the stadium became all-seater.

Shortly after its renovation the Stadium hosted Armenia's match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 6 September 2008, which was the first match [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] had played at ground since a [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000]] qualifying match against [[France national football team|France]] on 8 September 1999. The crucial match was attended by presidents [[Serzh Sargsyan]] and [[Abdullah Gul]], with the presence of more than 30,000 spectators.

After the 2008 renovation, Hrazdan held UEFA three-star status until that rating was superseded by a [[UEFA stadium categories|new system]] of classification.

According to the president of Armenian Football Federation [[Ruben Hayrapetyan]], a total of 6 million Euros will be spent for the modernization of the infrastructure, the pitch, the running track and the installation of a full-tribune cover for the stadium. After the upcoming renovation, the stadium will have an opportunity to bid as a host-venue for UEFA club competitions final matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.am/eng/news/63734.html EUR 6 million for reconstruction of Hrazdan stadium in Armenia's capital]&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation works began in March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/photoset/all/1885 Renovation of "Hrazdan" stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated US$ 10 million was invested.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [http://www.tert.am/am/news/2012/04/06/ruben-hayrapetyan/?sw Ռուբեն Հայրապետյանը Աշոտ Աղաբաբյանի ուղեկցությամբ ծանոթացավ «Հրազդանի» շինաշխատանքներին (լուսանկարներ, տեսանյութ)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance records==
===Famous concerts===
In 1989, a year after the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]] that killed 25,000 people and left more than 500,000 homeless, along with the break out of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh movement]] and the rise of nationalism, hundreds of thousands of Armenians were looking for some kind of temporary diversion from the devastation and feeling the importance of national activities. More than 110,000 fans packed the Hrazdan stadium to hear revolutionary and patriotic songs performed by the Armenian famous singer [[Harout Pamboukjian]]. Then-Minister of Culture Yuri Melik-Ohanjanian remarked this was the highest-attended performance in the history of Armenia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">'''Indiana Bicentennial Torch Relay''' was an Olympic-style torch relay to mark the 200th anniversary of the state of [[Indiana]]. The relay spanned 3,200 miles over all 92 counties in the state. It started on September 9, 2016 in [[Corydon, IN]], the state’s first capital, and ended October 15, 2016 at the Statehouse Grounds in [[Indianapolis]]. The relay path included 17 state parks, 260 cities, 9 rivers and lakes, and 22 college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=11 Things to Know About Indiana’s Bicentennial Flame|url=https://www.indianapolismonthly.com/news-opinion/11-things-to-know-about-indianas-bicentennial-flame/|work=Indianapolis Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Torch==
The torch for the relay has been designed and built by a group of faculty, staff and students at [[Purdue University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Purdue engineers devising a most modern torch for Indiana's bicentennial|url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2015/02/05/purdue-engineers-devising-modern-torch-indianas-bicentennial/22917021/|work=Indianapolis Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The torch design is inspired by the [[flag of Indiana]] and contains two circles of stars. The larger circle is around the burner and similar to that in the flag contains 13 stars for [[Thirteen colonies]]. The smaller circle with 5 stars around the handle is for states that joined by 1812 before Indiana became the 19th state in 1816.

==Torchbearers==
Over 2,000 torchbearers were selected to represent their counties in the torch relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Meet Indiana Bicentennial Torchbearers | url=http://www.jconline.com/story/news/local/2016/06/29/meet-tippecanoes-bicentennial-torchbearers/86511524/ | work=Lafayette Journal and Courrier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Malew A.F.C.''' are a [[Association football|football]] club from [[Ballasalla]], [[Malew]] in the [[Isle of Man]]. They compete in the [[Isle of Man Football League]]. They wear a red and black kit and play their home games at Clagh Vane in Ballasalla.

==History==

Formed in 1922, R H Kermode, Arthur Craine, T Karran, A.E. Craine and A. Cormode were instrumental in getting the club started. The club was admitted to the Second League and continued to contest the Championship up to the Second World War. 
In 1928, only six years into their history, the club won the Southern Section of the 2nd League before defeating Michael United 4-0 in the decider for the Second League Title. At this stage, relegation and promotion had not been incorporated into Manx Football.

In the 1933/34 season, they missed out on the title after losing to Peel in a decider, but made amends the following season by clinching their 2nd title.

In 1937, Malew made their first appearance in the Junior Cup Final only to be beaten by Rushen United but the following season they won their third Second League title. This was a historic occasion as Malew were the last side to win this trophy before the introduction of relegation &amp; promotion.

In the 2014/15 season, Malew's striker Andy Glover won the Isle of Man FA Silver Boot after bagging 42 goals in 18 games and subsequently awarded with the title of Isle of Man Division 2 Player of the Year 2014/15.

'''''Marmnamarz''''', published between 1911 and 1914, was the first sport magazine publication in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Published in [[Armenian language]] by [[Shavarsh Krissian]] (with "Marmnamarz" meaning sport in Armenian) offered an additional incentive for extending the interest towards the sport among the Ottoman Armenians. 

''Marmnamarz'', the "body of national physical training", became the major instrument for the development of sport and athletic life among the Armenian population. This magazine published information about various sport games and their results, as well as published photos of Armenian and foreign athletes and Armenian football teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [http://www.genocide-museum.am/arm/02.09.2008.php Հայկական սպորտը Օսմանյան կայսրությունում]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marmnamarz'' ceased publication in 1914.

'''Woodbine Mohawk Park''' is a [[harness racing]] track in [[Campbellville, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hambletonian.org/resources/BreedersCrownChampionsTableTwoandThree.pdf|title=Breeder's crown: 1984-2009|publisher=Hambletonian.org|date=2010|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned by the [[Woodbine Entertainment Group]], formerly the [[Ontario Jockey Club]], and is about 30&amp;nbsp;km west of the company's other [[racetrack]], [[Woodbine Racetrack]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario. Mohawk also has a large [[slot machine]] parlour, operated by [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation|OLG]]; some of the revenue from this operation is used to increase the horseracing purses.

The track was opened in 1963 by the then [[Ontario Jockey Club]] as Mohawk Racetrack.&lt;ref name="horseracing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseracing.info/mohawk-horse-racing.html|title=Mohawk Horse Racing Information|publisher=horseracing.info|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track specifications==
The track is ⅞ mile (1.4 km) in circumference (originally ⅝ mile or 1 km), and is made of crushed [[limestone]]. It can accommodate ten starters behind the gate. The homestretch is 1,095 feet long (334 m), and the far turn has a larger radius than the clubhouse turn to encourage acceleration into the homestretch. There is no hubrail.

==Races==
Most of the major harness racing stakes events were moved from Woodbine to Mohawk in 2007. These races include-

* [[North America Cup]], which carries a purse of C$1,000,000 and is Canada's richest race. Mohawk hosted the event for the first time in 2007 and was won by Tell All.
* [[Metro Pace]], which is for 2-year-old pacing colts and geldings. It is the richest harness race for 2-year-olds.
* [[Canadian Trotting Classic]] for 3-year-old colt and gelding trotters
* [[She's A Great Lady Stakes]] for 2-year-old pacing fillies
* [[Maple Leaf Trot]] for Free For All (4-year-olds and older of either sex) trotters
* [[Canadian Pacing Derby]] for Free For All pacers
* [[Fan Hanover Stakes]] for 3-year-old filly pacers
* Elegantimage Stakes for 3-year-old filly trotters
* Oakville Stakes for 2-year-old filly trotters
* [[William Wellwood Memorial Trot]] for 2-year-old colt and gelding trotters.
* Mohawk has hosted the [[Breeders Crown]] several times in the past with the most recent edition being the 2008 older division events.

The '''Morphy number''' is a measure of how closely a [[chess]] player is connected to [[Paul Morphy]] (1837–1884) by way of playing chess games.&lt;ref name="Kingston"&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/skittles258.pdf ''Your Morphy Number is Up'', by Taylor Kingston, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;  People who played a chess game with Morphy have a Morphy number of 1.  Players who did not play Morphy but played someone with a Morphy number of 1 have a Morphy number of 2.  People who played someone with a Morphy number of 2 have a Morphy number of 3, et cetera.

The idea is similar to the [[Erdős number]] for mathematicians and the [[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon#Bacon numbers|Bacon number]] for actors.  For example, [[Viswanathan Anand]], along with many current top players, has a Morphy number of 5: Anand played [[Efim Geller]] (Morphy number 4), who played [[Salo Flohr]] (Morphy number 3), who played [[Géza Maróczy]] (Morphy number 2), who played [[John Owen (chess player)|John Owen]] (Morphy number 1), who played Morphy.&lt;ref name="Kingston" /&gt;  Taylor Kingston states that the idea of the Morphy number may have originated in a June 2000 note by [[Tim Krabbé]], who has Morphy number 4.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_4.htm Tim Krabbé - see item #67]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Morphy Löwenthal 1858.jpg|right|thumb|300Ppx|Morphy and [[Johann Löwenthal|Löwenthal]]]]
As of April 2016, [[Leonard Barden]], [[Pal Benko]], [[Arthur Bisguier]], [[Melvin Chernev]], [[Dennis Horne]], [[Borislav Ivkov]], [[Erik Karklins]], [[Franciscus Kuijpers]], [[Aleksandar Matanović]], [[Friðrik Ólafsson]], [[Jonathan Penrose]], [[Oliver Penrose]],  and [[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer]] were the only known living players with Morphy number 3.&lt;ref name="Rhine"&gt;Frederick Rhine, [http://chicagochess.blogspot.com/2010/09/fun-with-morphy-numbers_21.html Fun with Morphy Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barden's comments to [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]], [http://www.chesscafe.com/Tim/kibb166.htm ''Playing the Morphy Number Game''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163132/http://www.chesscafe.com/Tim/kibb166.htm |date=2011-06-06 }}, chesscafe.com, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]], [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/winter71.html#6614._Lasker_v_M._Chernev ''Chess Note'' 6614], June 11, 2010. Retrieved on September 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ordinary players have a Morphy number of 6 or less.&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kibitz166.pdf ''Playing the Morphy Number Game'', by Tim Harding, PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphy number of famous players==
These are players who are important in making links for Morphy numbers.

===Morphy number 1===
Morphy is known to have played about 100 people, but all of the known links for players with Morphy number 2 go through the following five players.&lt;ref name="Kingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhine"/&gt; Some Irish players could go through the Rev. Dr [[George Salmon]], who played in one of Morphy's [[blindfold chess]] simultaneous exhibitions.[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1227744]

===Morphy number 3===
Most of the [[chess master|masters]] in this group played several members of the previous group.  This group includes some of the most important players for making connections to later generations.  Botvinnik and Reshevsky played older masters such as Lasker and Janowski, had long careers, and played many younger players.&lt;ref name="Kingston" /&gt;  Najdorf was Tartakower's pupil and they played a number of published games together, and Najdorf played blitz right into his 80s, allowing many younger players to achieve 4.  C.J.S. Purdy played Tartakower (2), enabling many Australian players to achieve 4. As of March 2015, fewer than 15 of them are still alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40931">The '''[[National Hockey League|NHL]] All-Rookie Team''' is chosen by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association from the best rookies in the [[National Hockey League]] at each position for the season just concluded based on their performance in that year. The team was first named after the [[1982–83 NHL season]] and since then many future stars have been selected.

The team consists of one goalie, two defensemen and three forwards. In order to be considered a rookie in the NHL, the rookie must be eligible to win the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]]. The qualification criteria to be eligible are that the player must not have played in more than 25 NHL games in any previous year nor played in six or more NHL games in each of any two preceding seasons, as well as being under the age of 26 on September 15 of the season in which he is eligible.  The age consideration was added after [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]] won the trophy at age 31 in 1990.

The only player to be awarded the Calder Trophy without being named to the All-Rookie Team is [[Pavel Bure]] (in [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]]), because he received votes at both right wing and left wing, but not enough to lead at either position.&lt;ref&gt;Romain and Duplacey 1994, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, the rules have been changed so that all forwards are voted on together.

The '''Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame''' is an American history museum and [[hall of fame]], located at 1000 Hall of Fame Avenue in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. It serves as the sport's most complete library, in addition to promoting and preserving the [[history of basketball]]. Dedicated to [[Canadian Americans|Canadian-American]] physician and inventor of the sport [[James Naismith]], it was opened and inducted its first class in 1959.

As of the induction of the Class of 2018, the Hall has formally inducted 389 individuals.

==History of the Springfield building==
The Naismith Hall of Fame was established in 1959 by [[Lee Williams (basketball)|Lee Williams]], a former athletic director at [[Colby College]]. In the 1960s, the Basketball Hall of Fame struggled to raise enough money for the construction of its first facility. However, during the following half-decade the necessary amount was raised, and the building opened on Feb. 17, 1968, less than one month after the [[National Basketball Association]] played its 18th All-Star Game. The Basketball Hall of Fame's Board named four inductees in its first year. In addition to honoring those who contributed to basketball, the Hall of Fame sought to make contributions of its own. In 1979, the Hall of Fame sponsored the [[Hall of Fame Tip Off|Tip-Off Classic]], a pre-season college basketball exhibition. This Tip-Off Classic has been the start to the college basketball season ever since, and although it does not always take place in Springfield, Massachusetts, generally it returns every few years.

In the 17 years that the original Basketball Hall of Fame operated at [[Springfield College]], it drew more than 630,000 visitors. The popularity of the Basketball Hall of Fame necessitated that a new facility be constructed, and in 1985, an $11 million facility was built beside the scenic [[Connecticut River]] in Springfield. As the new hall opened, it also recognized women for the first time, with inductees such as [[Senda Berenson Abbott]], who first introduced basketball to women at [[Smith College]]. During the years following its construction, the Basketball Hall of Fame's second facility drew far more visitors than ever anticipated, due in large part to the increasing popularity of the game but also to the scenic location beside the river and the second Hall's interesting modern architecture{{Citation needed|reason=Is there any documentation about the reason for the increase in numbers?|date=December 2017}}.

In 2002, the Basketball Hall of Fame moved again&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebasketballfans.com/where-is-the-national-basketball-hall-of-fame-located/|title=Where is the national basketball Hall of Fame located? - The Basketball Fans|date=2018-10-16|work=The Basketball Fans|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;—albeit merely 100 yards south along Springfield's riverfront—into a $47 million facility designed by renowned architects [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates Architects|Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates]]. The building's architecture features a metallic silver, basketball-shaped sphere flanked by two similarly symmetrical [[rhombus]]es. The dome is illuminated at night and features 80,000 square foot (7,400 m²), including numerous restaurants and an extensive gift shop. The second Basketball Hall of Fame was not torn down but rather converted into an [[LA Fitness]] health clubs. The current Basketball Hall of Fame features Center Court, a full-sized basketball court on which visitors can play. Inside the building there are a game gallery, many interactive exhibits, several theaters, and an honor ring of inductees. A large theater for ceremonies seats up to 300. The honorees inducted in 2002 included the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and [[Magic Johnson]], a five-time NBA champion, three-time NBA finals MVP and Olympic gold medalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caroline Thompson |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/356457-the-history-of-the-basketball-hall-of-fame/#ixzz1Pbup9ruI |title=The History of Basketball in the 1930s |publisher=Livestrong.Com |date=2015-10-14 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the current Basketball Hall of Fame has greatly exceeded attendance expectations, with basketball fans traveling to the Hall of Fame from all over the world. Despite the new facility's success, a logistical problem remains for the Basketball Hall of Fame and the City of Springfield. The two entities (along with the riverfront area entirely) are separated by the [[Interstate 91]] elevated highway—one of the eastern United States' busiest highways—which, essentially, inhibits foot-traffic and other interaction between the Basketball Hall of Fame and Springfield's increasingly lively [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Both the Hall and Springfield have made public statements about cooperating further so as to facilitate even more business and recreational growth for both; however the placement and height of Interstate 91 remain physical obstacles. Urban planners at universities such as [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] have called for the I-91 to be moved, or to be re-configured so as to be pedestrian-friendly to Hall of Fame visitors. In 2010, the [[Urban Land Institute]] announced a plan to make the walk between Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] and the Hall of Fame (and riverfront) easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront-proj.0.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324071020/http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront-proj.0.html |archivedate=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for induction==
In contrast to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Pro Football]] and the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball]] Halls of Fame, Springfield honors international and American professionals, as well as American and international amateurs, making it arguably the most comprehensive Hall of Fame among major sports. Since 2011, the induction process employs a total of seven committees to both screen and elect candidates. Four of these committees screen prospective candidates:&lt;ref name="2011 class"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2011/2/18/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-12-final.html |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces 12 Finalists for 2011 Election |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=February 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222011516/http://www.hoophall.com/news/2011/2/18/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-12-final.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the Veterans and International Committees also vote to directly induct one candidate for each induction class.&lt;ref name="2013 class"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/2013/2/15/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-12-final.html |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces 12 Finalists for 2013 Election |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=February 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218082808/http://www.hoophall.com/news/2013/2/15/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-12-final.html |archivedate=February 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Contributor Direct Election Committee
** Note that other committees may choose to elect contributors. For example, the 2014 class included two contributors. 
* Early [[African American|African-American]] Pioneers of the Game Committee

Individuals who receive at least seven votes from the North American Screening Committee or five votes from one of the other screening committees in a given year are eligible to advance to an Honors Committee, composed of 12 members who vote on each candidate and rotating groups of 12 specialists (one group for female candidates, one group for international candidates, and one group for American and veterans candidates). However, each screening committee is limited as to the number of candidates it can put forth to the Honors Committee—10 from the North American Committee, and two from each other committee. Any individual receiving at least 18 affirmative votes (75% of all votes cast) from the Honors Committee is approved for induction into the Hall of Fame. As long as the number of candidates receiving sufficient votes from a screening committee is not greater than the number of finalists that committee can put forth, advancement to the Honors Committee is generally pro forma, although the Hall's Board of Trustees may remove any candidate who "has damaged the integrity of the game of basketball" from consideration.{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref name=Enshrinement/&gt;

To be considered for induction by a screening committee, a player, retired coach, or referee must be fully retired from that role for at least three full seasons.&lt;ref name="2018 changes"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-announces-modifications-to-its-enshrinement-process-beginning-with-the-class-of-2018/ |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Announces Modifications to its Enshrinement Process Beginning with the Class of 2018 |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=December 19, 2017 |accessdate=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period had originally been five years, but was first changed to four years in December 2015,&lt;ref name="Nomination"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hoophall.com/enshrinement-process/ | title=Guidelines For Nomination and Election | publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame | accessdate=24 December 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904105906/http://www.hoophall.com/enshrinement-process/ | archivedate=4 September 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to three seasons in December 2017.&lt;ref name="2018 changes"/&gt; Prior to the induction class of 2018, referees had been eligible for induction upon 25 years of full-time service, even if still active.&lt;ref name="Nomination"/&gt; Changes to the criteria for consideration of active coaches were announced at the same time as the most recent changes to the induction process. Currently, coaches become eligible upon 25 years of full-time service at the high school level or above, or three seasons after retirement.&lt;ref name=Nomination/&gt; Effective with the class of 2020, active coaches must meet the years of service requirement and be at least 60 years old.&lt;ref name="2018 changes"/&gt; No years of service criterion is applied to those who have made a "significant contribution to the game of basketball". Sportswriters and commentators are elected as full-fledged members (in contrast to the Baseball Hall of Fame that places them in separate wings that are not considered in the "real" Hall of Fame).&lt;ref name=Enshrinement/&gt;

===Controversy===
Controversy has arisen over many aspects of the Hall's voting procedures, including voter anonymity. While sportswriter voters of other major sports' Halls of Fame openly debate their choices, the Naismith Hall does not make the process transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aschburner|first=Steve|title=Hall of Fame selection process leaves much to be desired|url=http://crosarka.com/archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215012/http://www.nba.com/2010/news/features/steve_aschburner/08/12/hall.process/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408010101/http://crosarka.com/archiveurl%3Dhttps%3A//web.archive.org/web/20140408215012/http%3A//www.nba.com/2010/news/features/steve_aschburner/08/12/hall.process/index.html|archivedate=8 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall has also been criticized in opinion columns for a tendency to enshrine active collegiate coaches and relatively obscure players while omitting some accomplished players and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziller|first=Tom|title=Fans to Vote for Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees|url=http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/03/30/fans-to-vote-for-basketball-hall-of-fame-inductees/|publisher=AOL News|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=30 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212083544/http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/03/30/fans-to-vote-for-basketball-hall-of-fame-inductees/|archivedate=12 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Hall awards==
In conjunction with the [[Final Four]] of each year's [[NCAA Division I]] [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|men's]] and [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|women's]] basketball tournaments, the Naismith Hall gives out several awards to college basketball athletes:

For men, the Hall presents awards to the top players in Division I at each of the five standard basketball positions.
* The [[Bob Cousy Award]], presented since 2004 to the top [[point guard]]. The award was originally open to players in all three NCAA divisions (I, [[NCAA Division II|II]], and [[NCAA Division III|III]]), but is now restricted to D-I players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hoophall.com/news/naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-of-fame-narrows-watch-list-for-2018-bob-cousy-award/ |title=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Narrows Watch List for 2018 Bob Cousy Award |publisher=Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |date=February 5, 2018 |accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the award winners is chosen by a Hall of Fame selection committee, plus the award's namesake.

As with the men's awards, the selection committee for the women's awards includes each award's namesake.

The Hall also formerly presented the [[Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award]] to two college seniors—one male player no taller than {{convert|72|in|m|sigfig=3}}, and one female player no taller than {{convert|68|in|m|sigfig=3}}—determined to have been the nation's best student-athletes. The men's award, given since 1969, was voted on by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and the women's, given since 1984, by members of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]]. Both awards were discontinued after the 2012–13 season.

The '''PLDT HOME: The Last Home Stand''' was a charity [[basketball]] event in the [[Philippines]], primarily sponsored by the [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]] (PLDT) and organized by East-West Private LLC, a US-based events organizing company, that featured the [[Philippine men's national basketball team]] (Gilas Pilipinas) together with the players from the [[National Basketball Association]]. The proceeds of the event will be given to the Philippine Disaster Recovery Foundation and Caritas Manila.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/gilas-match-against-nba-stars-to-be-shown-on-slightly-delayed-basis-by-tv Gilas match against NBA stars to be shown on slightly delayed basis by TV5], spin.ph, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[exhibition game]]s between the Philippine national team and the NBA players were scheduled to be held on July 22 and 23 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], but were postponed moments before tipoff of the first game after the NBA players were warned by their league officials of possible penalties and suspensions if they took part in a basketball activity not recognized by the NBA. A drills showcase from both teams were hastily organized in place of the scheduled exhibition game, which was negatively received by the paying patrons of the event.&lt;ref name = "LHS"&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/last-home-stand-forced-to-cancel-exhibition-game-at-last-minute-organizers-ready-for-refund ‘Last HOME Stand’ forced to cancel exhibition game at last minute; Organizers ready to offer refund], Interaksyon.com, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers offered refunds for the ticket holders after the first exhibition game was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/pldt-announces-refund-process-for-last-home-stand-ticket-holders PLDT announces refund process for ‘Last Home Stand’ ticket holders], interaksyon.com, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the scheduled activities for July 23, which included a meet-and-greet event at [[SM Megamall]] and the second exhibition game at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/pba/news/nba-stars-left-early-wednesday-morningnba-stars-gilas-pilipinas-last-home-stand-basketball-charity-game-pldt-mvp-basketball-clinic-refund NBA stars leave country the morning after cancellation of tune-up games with Gilas], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The event was first announced through the [[Twitter]] account of PLDT chairman and [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]] president [[Manny V. Pangilinan]] on June 25, 2014. In his Twitter post, he announced that NBA players [[Blake Griffin]], [[Damian Lillard]], [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Paul Pierce]] would take part in two exhibition games scheduled on July 22 and 23 against [[Gilas Pilipinas]], the Philippine men's basketball team, who are preparing for the [[2014 FIBA World Cup]]. The national team's coach, [[Chot Reyes]] also confirmed the event through his Twitter account. Skills coach [[John Lucas II]] will also conduct a skills training camp during the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/06/25/14/gilas-play-nba-all-stars-charity-game Gilas to play NBA All-Stars in charity game], [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBNnews.com]], June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket prices were announced days later through Ticketnet, the ticketing arm of the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], ranging from Php 23,330 (US$538.35) in the patron section to Php 750 (US$17.33) in the general admission section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ticketnet.com.ph/The-Last-Home-Stand-MNL-2014-All-Star-Charity-Event--Smart-Araneta-Coliseum/EventDetails/202 Event page of the PLDT Last Home Stand in Ticketnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706173146/http://ticketnet.com.ph/The-Last-Home-Stand-MNL-2014-All-Star-Charity-Event--Smart-Araneta-Coliseum/EventDetails/202 |date=2014-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pldt-the-last-home-stand-gilas-pilipinas-nba-manny-pangilinan-james-harden-paul-george-blake-griffin Tickets to Gilas tune-up against NBA stars Blake Griffin, Lillard won't come cheap.

On July 1, the organizers announced that [[Kyle Lowry]], [[Nick Johnson (basketball)|Nick Johnson]] and 2014 NBA Finals MVP [[Kawhi Leonard]] would also take part with the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/62073-leonard-lowry-johnson-gilas-last-home-stand NBA players Leonard, Lowry, Johnson also coming to Manila], Naveen Ganglani, [[Rappler]], July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul George]] was later added to the lineup according to Pangilinan in a post from his Twitter account on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/paul-george-added-to-list-of-basketball-stars-in-gilas-last-home-stand-charity-event Paul George added to list of basketball stars in 'Gilas Last HOME Stand' charity event], interaksyon.com, July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, [[James Harden]], [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Brandon Jennings]] were confirmed to be part of the event. They also announced that Paul Pierce had pulled out of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/basketball/63392-james-harden-tyson-chandler-brandon-jennings-gilas-last-home-stand Harden, Chandler, Jennings added to Last Home Stand], Naveen Ganglani, [[Rappler]], July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was organized by East-West Private LLC, a US-based events organizing company, who had been responsible for bringing in [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]], among others, to play in an exhibition game in the Philippines in 2011, entitled [[2010–11 PBA season#Smart Ultimate All-Star Weekend|Smart Ultimate All-Star Weekend]], while an [[2011 NBA lockout|NBA lockout]] was ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grantland.com/features/kobe-takes-manila-nba-not-invited/ Kobe Takes Manila; NBA Not Invited], Rafe Bartholomew, Gartland, August 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/sports/709718/after-ultimate-all-star-weekend-whats-next  After Ultimate All-Star Weekend, what's next?], [[Quinito Henson]], [[The Philippine Star]], July 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
Hours before the start of the first exhibition game on July 22, the organizers confirmed that [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Paul George]] had backed out of the event. In a video posted on the internet, Griffin apologized to the Filipino fans for not coming because "something from home needed my urgent attention". In a separate report, George cited "personal reasons" as the cause of his sudden pull-out. [[Matt Barnes]] became their last-minute replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/nba-starblake-griffin-paul-george-pull-out-of-gilas-tune-up-games-at-last-minute Organizers announce no-show for NBA stars Blake Griffin, Paul George from Gilas tune-up games at last minute], Richard Dy, spin.ph, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaksyon.com/interaktv/blake-griffin-paul-george-unable-to-make-trip-scratched-form-last-home-stand-lineup Blake Griffin, Paul George unable to make trip, scratched from 'Gilas Last HOME Stand' lineup], interaksyon.com, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After the traditional call up of players to the basketball court, Gilas Pilipinas coach [[Chot Reyes]] told the audience that the Gilas team and the NBA players would not be playing an exhibition game and would instead participate in a live open practice session.&lt;ref name = "GLS-audience"&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/pldt-last-home-stand-fans-open-letter-expresses-disappointment-and-anger-gilas-pilipinas-nba-pba-manny-pangilinan-chot-reyes Fan at Big Dome gives us first-person perspective as Gilas vs NBA 'nightmare' unfolded before his eyes], spin.ph, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; PLDT Vice President Ariel Fermin then told the crowd that if they were not satisfied with the event, the organizers would be offering a full refund for the purchased tickets. He reminded the audience that the proceeds of the event will be given to charity, saying "''Tulungan niyo kaming tulungan ang ibang tao'' (Help us help other people), after all, this is really for a good cause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/371614/sports/opinion/commentary-wais-moves-led-to-gilas-vs-nba-cancellation-fiasco Commentary 'Wais' moves led to Gilas vs NBA cancellation fiasco], Jaemark Tordecilla, GMA News Online, July 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The event started with skills coach [[John Lucas II]] giving instructions to the players on drills, which were broken down in seven-minute segments. At first, the audience were responding positively with the drills, but as time went on, boos from the crowd started erupting after they realized that there will be no five-on-five game that night. When the event finished, the audience began to chant "REFUND! REFUND! REFUND!"&lt;ref name = "GLS-audience"/&gt;

In a hastily called press conference, and in an official statement issued that same day, PLDT chairman Manny Pangilinan apologized to the basketball fans "for disappointing them". He also cancelled the events planned for the second day. He said that refunds would be made to those people who had purchased tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/371512/sports/basketball/mvp-extends-sincerest-apologies-for-gilas-vs-nba-cancellation-assures-refund MVP extends 'sincerest apologies' for Gilas vs NBA cancellation, assures refund] GMA News Online, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pldthome.com/last-home-stand-official-statement PLDT Statement on The Last Home Stand Basketball Event], July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During the press conference, East West Holdings official Maria Espaldon told the media that they had not been able to secure clearance from the NBA to hold the event. In the hopes of having the event comply with the NBA's rules, the organizers set it up as a "basketball clinic" that also included a five-on-five scrimmage between the NBA players and the Gilas team. She also said that the event was never advertised as a game. Hours before the start of the event, the NBA players received calls from representatives of the league, who warned them that they were subject to possible fines and league suspensions should they take part in the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/pba/news/third-party-agency-admits-nba-declined-request-for-sanction-gilas-event-as-early-as-april Third-party agency admits NBA declined request for sanction on Gilas event as early as April], Snow Badua, spin.ph, July 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, the NBA released a press statement regarding the reported intervention of the league in the charity event. East-West Private LLC failed to secure the clearance needed from the NBA for their players to be allowed to participate in the event, as stated in the league's collective bargaining agreement, even after they informed the promoters about the process "several months ago"&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph.nba.com/news-article/2878/nba-issues-statement-on-the-gilas-last-home-stand#.U9J2h7G2qDo NBA issues statement on The Gilas Last Home Stand], NBA Philippines, July 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The organizers reportedly spent up to P200 million (USD$4.6 million) for the event and paid the participating players up to US$150,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.ph/sports/basketball/news/how-much-did-organizers-lose-for-failed-nevent-source-gives-eye-popping-figure How much did organizers lose for failed event?

[[Image:Modernpeteca.jpg|right|thumb|Peteca Shuttlecock]]
'''Peteca''' ({{IPA-pt|peˈtɛkɐ}}) is a traditional [[sport]] in [[Brazil]], played with a "hand [[shuttlecock]]" from [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous]] origins and reputed to be as old as the country itself. The same name is given to the shuttlecock-object itself.

==Objectives==

The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock-like object (the peteca) with your hand over a high [[Net (textile)|net]], similar to a [[volleyball]] net, causing the object to land inbounded on the opposite court. The peteca can only be hit once while on each side of the net. Doubles and singles, male and/or female matches are played, both for competitive or leisure purposes.

==History==

The word ''peteca'' is derived from a [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] word meaning ''hit''. Over time, the word found its way into the [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian Portuguese language]].

Originally, peteca was played at times of celebration with dances and songs. Gradually, this play became more of a sporting activity. The game has been passed down through several generations by the Brazilian ancestors and has developed considerably along the way.

Early petecas were very primitive home-made affairs consisting of stones wrapped in leaves tied inside an [[maize|ear of corn]]. A more sophisticated version was described in a Brazilian-English dictionary as "a leather pad with feathers stuck into it."

Pictures of the first petecas are few and far between, but on 30 May 1979, Brazil issued a set of four [[postage stamp]]s depicting children's toys, to commemorate the [[International Year of the Child]].

When Brazil was present at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]] the Brazilian athletes took with them some shuttlecocks for amusement on the ship and during the intervals between games. The game of peteca fascinated athletes from many other countries who wanted learn the rules of the game. The problem was that there were no rules - it was just for pleasure.

Peteca left the streets, the grass and the sand to become a field sport in [[Belo Horizonte]] in the 1940s.

It was in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]] state, that the toy shape was transformed to its current format, proper for competitive games. The typical peteca has four white chicken feathers attached to a base and connected to a bottom made with several thin layers of rubber. It was also in Belo Horizonte that the rules of the game were first written, as well as the first courts were built and the practice gained competitive sense with internal championships that were held in various social clubs of the city.

In 1973 the Peteca Federation of Minas Gerais (FEMP) was founded, confirming the pioneering spirit of a sport born and developed among the Brazilian people. From Belo Horizonte, the practice has spread to other Brazilian states, and from there to other countries, like [[France]], that adopted the game as it is played in Brazil.

Peteca is now one of Brazil's fastest growing sports closely behind [[Football (soccer)|football]] and volleyball.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Another version of the game, called [[Indiaca]], and closely based on peteca has developed in [[Germany]], first appearing in 1936.

==Rules of the game==

A peteca match is played to the best of the three games, singles or doubles. The first player (or the first pair) who scores twelve points wins the set. One game can last only a maximum of twenty minutes. If neither of the two sides have reached the required score, then the win is given to the team with the most points.

The peteca must be struck with one hand only and must pass above the net to the oppositions side in order for them to return it. The server remains the same one until the service changes side. A point can only be won by the serving team. The player with the service has thirty seconds to score the point. If this is not achieved then the service is given to the opposing player/team.

===Faults===

There are a number of recognised faults which can occur.

*Service fault: service passes to the opposing team if the peteca passes below the net, outside the limits of the court, if the peteca touches the net or if the peteca touches a player of the same team (double) before passing over to the opposing side.
*The 'in play' faults: if a player puts his hands or feet on the opposing teams side (similar to what occurs in a volleyball game); if a player touches the peteca with two hands; if there are marked accompaniment and not striking; if any other part of his/her body touches it and if the peteca is not hit (head, feet).
*The 30-second rule: the server or the team which is serving has 30 seconds to score the point. If the point is not scored in this period, then the service goes to the opposition. At the end of 20 seconds, the [[referee]] announces "10" as a warning of the time remaining. With the sounding of the referee's whistle, the rally is finished. This is a more strict rule, when there's a referee to open count.

==Equipment and court==
*'''Shuttlecocks''': There are two types of shuttlecocks used in two different kinds of games of peteca. In a regular peteca [[tournament]], the shuttlecock has a flat base and a standard weight of 42 grams. The feathers are crimped and straight. In a mini-peteca game, the shuttlecock has a rounded [[rubber]] base attached to five or more rubber discs. The base is softer on the hand. Although designs vary, the most common petecas (especially the competition type) consist of a base in the shape of a filled leather bag or a layered rubber pad, and a flight, which is usually made out of feathers stuck to the base.
*'''Court''': singles' games are played on courts 15 m x 5.5m. Doubles' games are played at 15 m x 7.5m. By comparison, a standard volleyball court is 18 m x 9m. Peteca is played on [[wood]], [[cement]] or [[clay]] courts. Mini-peteca is played on a standard sized [[badminton]] court.
*'''Net''': men's games are played using a rectangular net topping 2.43 m high, similar to a volleyball net. Women's games lower it to 2.24 m. Children (8-12yrs) play over a 2 m high net.
*'''Footwear''': [[Athletic shoe|Sneakers]] with a firm grip to the floor are desirable.
*'''Lightweight gloves''': beginners often find that the rubber base of the peteca is hard on the hands, usually leaving red spots and a stinging sensation on them. It is suggested that they wear a lightweight fingerless [[glove]], similar to those used in [[Rugby football|rugby]].

==Competition==

Competitive court games have been played in Brazil since the early 1930s. It was only in 1973 that the first rules were written.

In 1985, the National Sports Council of Brazil drew up the first official set of rules so that competitions could be held between cities and states, and only into 1987 that the first Brazilian championship of peteca was organized. In 1995, under the direction of the President of the Brazilian Confederation of Terrestrial Sports, new rules were introduced into the game play to make it still more competitive and attractive.

Currently,{{when|date=December 2014}} in Brazil, there's a Confederação Brasileira de Peteca,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peteca.com.br/ peteca.com.br]&lt;/ref&gt; still incipient, being formed around the preexistent Federação Mineira de Peteca,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fempemg.hpg.ig.com.br/ fempemg.hpg.ig.com.br] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127110704/http://www.fempemg.hpg.ig.com.br/ |date=2001-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the state of [[Minas Gerais]].

A version of peteca, [[indiaca]], was developed by {{Ill|Karlhans Krohn|de}} in Germany in 1936 and is very popular. However, [[France]] was one of the first [[Europe|European countries]] to embrace peteca proper. The Federation Française de Peteca (FFP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federationdepeteca.com/ federationdepeteca.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  is the national organ for France and was created in February 1997 by Jean-François Impinna, a French former international rugby player, and counts thousands of French peteca players.

The [[United Kingdom]] has recently followed suit and taken up the game with the United Kingdom Peteca Association - UKPA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukpeteca.co.uk/ ukpeteca.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516163753/http://www.ukpeteca.co.uk/ |date=2006-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  leading its development.

May 2006 would see the first International Peteca Tournament being hosted by the FFP in [[Sannois]], [[Paris]]. Teams from Brazil, France and the United Kingdom were to compete.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Poznań 2018''' was a bid by the city of [[Poznań]] and the [[Polish Olympic Committee]] to host the [[2018 Summer Youth Olympics]]. Poznan withdrew their bid on October 9, 2012 for financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=41308&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Poznań]] was revealed to be one of the bidding cities for the [[2018 Summer Youth Olympics]] when the IOC announced who the applicants were on March 2, 2012.

Poznań was one of the eight cities that hosted games during the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] championship. The [[City Stadium (Poznań)|Stadion Miejski]] hosted three matches during the championship.

Poznań, in last few years, was a host city of such sport events as the [[2011 Men's Indoor Hockey World Cup]]. In 2010 the city hosted the Academic Canoeing World Cup, Academic Basketball World Cup, European Male Basketball Cup and the European Athletic Cup for vets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poznan2011.pl/about About Poznań] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120326165240/http://www.poznan2011.pl/about |date=2012-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the city hosted the Academic Futsal World Cup &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisu.net/en/Futsal-2006-453.html 10th World University Futsal Championship]&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the host cities for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship]].

On October 8, 2012 the city council rejected the proposed budget for the bid. There was a lack of financial guarantees from the city organizer and the city withdrew its bid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samorzady.pb.pl/2676588,85124,poznan-nie-zorganizuje-mlodziezowych-io-w-2018-roku]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buenos Aires]] was ultimately elected as the host city of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games on July 4, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/news/buenos-aires-elected-as-host-city-for-2018-youth-olympic-games/202222 Buenos Aires elected as Host City for 2018 Youth Olympic Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous bids==

[[File:Skateboard facility at Guantanamo.jpg|thumb|350px|A skater performs an [[Ollie (skateboarding)|ollie]].]]
A '''skateboarding trick''', or simply a '''trick''', is a maneuver performed on a [[skateboard]] while [[skateboarding]]. Skateboarding tricks may vary greatly in difficulty.

==History==
Though skateboards emerged in the 1900s, skateboarding tricks like the ones done today did not appear until decades later. In the 1970s and earlier, the most common tricks were "2D" freestyle types such as manuals and pivots. Only later in the 1980s and early 1990s were common modern-day tricks like the ollie and kickflip invented by [[Alan Gelfand]] and [[Rodney Mullen]], setting the stage for other aerial tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Florez|first=Alex|title=History of Skateboarding Tricks|url=http://shredditapp.com/2015/02/01/historyofskateboarding/|publisher=Shreddit|accessdate=6 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306235425/http://shredditapp.com/2015/02/01/historyofskateboarding/|archivedate=6 March 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Ollie===
[[File:Skateboarding at Mexico City - Ollie - 005.JPG|thumb|Ollie]]
{{Main article|Ollie (skateboarding)}}

An ''Ollie'' is a jump where the front [[skateboard#wheels|wheels]] leave the ground first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ollie|title=Ollie - Definition|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motion is attained with a snap of the tail (from the backfoot) and sliding your front-foot forward to reach any altitude. A lot of technical tricks transpire from this element (e.g. the kickflip, heelflip, 360-flip). A '''nollie''' is when the back wheels leave the ground first by snapping the nose of the board, with the back foot sliding towards the tail.

===Grabs===
{{Main article|Aerials (skateboarding)}}

A ''Grab'' involves floating in the air, while using either hand to hold the board against the feet or keeping constant and careful pressure on the board with the feet to keep it from floating away.  Indy Grab usually combine rotation with different grabs. This class of tricks was first popularized when [[Tony Hawk]] became famous for his frontside airs in empty swimming pools in the late 1970s and has expanded to include the bulk of skateboarding tricks to this day, including the [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]] and all of its variations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Skateboarder (magazine)|Skateboarder magazine]]'', July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[900 (skateboarding)|900]] and [[1080 (skateboarding)|1080]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skateboarding.com.au/news/12-year-old-lands-first-ever-1080-skateboard/|title=12 year old lands the first ever 1080 on a skateboard|date=3 July 2012|publisher=Skateboarding.com.au|accessdate=7 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215175336/http://www.skateboarding.com.au/news/12-year-old-lands-first-ever-1080-skateboard/|archivedate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; fall under the class of aerials, though these are commonly confused with aerial grabs.

===Flip tricks===
[[File:Skateboarding at Mexico City - Flip - 001.JPG|thumb|left|Kickflip]]

{{Main article|Flip tricks (skateboarding)}}

''Flip tricks'' are a subset of aerials which are all based on the [[Ollie (skateboarding trick)|ollie]]. An example is the [[kickflip]], the most widely known and performed flip trick. The board can be spun around many different axes as part of a flip trick, thus combining several rotations into one trick. These tricks are undoubtedly most popular among [[street skateboarding]] purists, although skaters with other styles perform them as well. Combining spins and flips is extremely popular in today's culture. A common trick in skateboarding lines is a 360 flip, or tre flip. A 360 flip is the combination of a skateboard spinning 360 degrees and a kickflip. There are also double kickflips and triple kickflips which are very difficult but highly regarded in the skateboarding culture.

===Freestyle===
{{Main article|Freestyle skateboarding tricks}}

''Freestyle skateboarding tricks'' are tricks specifically associated with [[freestyle skateboarding]].

===Slides and grinds===
[[File:Skateboarding at Mexico City - Grind - 011.JPG|thumb|50 Grind]]
{{main|Slides (skateboarding)|Grinds (skateboarding)}}
Slides and grinds involve getting the board up on some type of ledge, [[Grind rail|rail]], or coping and sliding or grinding along the board or trucks, respectively. When it is primarily the board which is contacting the edge, it's called a slide; when it's the truck, it is a grind. Grinding and sliding skateboards started with sliding the board on parking blocks and curbs, then extended to using the coping on swimming pools, then stairway [[handrail]]s, and has now been expanded to include almost every possible type of edge. Grinds and slides on street environments were brought to mainstream skateboarding by professional skateboarder [[Natas Kaupas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6999">[[File:Ski jumping hill schematic.svg|thumb|Overview of a ski jumping hill]]
A '''ski jumping hill''' is a [[sports venue]] used for [[ski jumping]]. They vary in size from temporary handmade snow structures to permanent competition venues. At the top is an in-run where the jumper runs down to generate sufficient speed, before reaching the jump. The skier is then airborne until landing on the landing slope. The last part of the hill is the out-run, which may be either flat or even uphill, allowing the jumper to stop. The steepest point of the hill is the [[construction point]], which is used to determine the score of a particular length. The size of a hill is measured in the [[hill size]]. Hills with a hill size exceeding HS185 are designated [[ski flying]] hills; there are five such hills in the world.

==Structure==
[[File:Lysgård.JPG|thumb|upright|The twin hills of [[Lysgårdsbakken]] in [[Lillehammer]], Norway: the normal HS100 hill to the right, the large HS138 hill to the left]]

The top of the hill is the start. This allows the jury to regulate the speed of the jumpers in varying wind conditions, by shortening or lengthening the distance along the in-run. The platform has a bar across it, which the jumper sits on. By leaning forward, the jumper will naturally start to glide down the prepared tracks along the in-run. The in-run normally has an angle of 38 to 36 degrees, which then curves into a transition; the last part of the in-run, the take-off, typically has an angle between 7 and 12 degrees downhill. The landing slope has a smooth curve which closely follows the profile of the ski jump; this means that the skier is never more than about {{convert|6|m|sp=us}} above the ground. The skier will land on the landing slope, and the rules allow jumpers to land up to ten percent past the construction point. Past the landing slope is the outrun, which is either flat or even uphill, where the skier can slow down.&lt;ref name=east&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skijumpeast.com/genhills.htm |title=Facts about Ski Jumping hills |author=Eastern Ski Jumping &amp; Nordic Combined Foundation |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317031931/http://www.skijumpeast.com/genhills.htm |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the skier is normally measured about {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} before the end of the takeoff; jumpers can reach speeds of {{convert|95|km/h|sp=us}} on large hills and {{convert|105|km/h|sp=us}} on ski flying hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/27-inrun-speed |title=Inrun speed |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[International Ski Federation]] replaced the calculation point as the measurement of the size of a hill with [[hill size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hoppbakkene bort fra K-punkt til HS-punkt |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=29 June 2004 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill size is the length from the takeoff in a straight line to the knoll and then along the level of the landing slope to the hill size point.&lt;ref name=east /&gt; The hill size point is calculated based on the technical data of a hill based on radius, angle of inclination and record distance.&lt;ref name=hillsize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/24-hill-size |title=Hill size |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=11 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224407/http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/24-hill-size |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation point or K-point is slightly further up in the hill and denotes the point where the landing slope is the steepest. It is still used for the calculation of distance points, which along with style points determine the winner of an event.&lt;ref name=distancepoints&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/13-distance-points |title=Distance points |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=11 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224447/http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/13-distance-points |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For hills up to large, the scoring system grants 60 points to jumps which reach the critical point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/5-calculation-point-k-point |title=Calculation point (K-point) |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=11 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224439/http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/5-calculation-point-k-point |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ski flying hills, 120 points are granted for the critical point length. Based on the hill's length, distance points are calculated, which are added for each meter beyond the critical point and subtracted for each point shorter than the critical point. A meter has more distance points in smaller hills.&lt;ref name=distancepoints /&gt; Hills also have a fall line; a jumper who falls or otherwise touches the ground with their body after the fall line is not penalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/72-fall-line |title=Fall line |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measuring of a distance in a hill was traditionally done by people who were positioned along the hill, who would signal where the skier landed. Today this is instead measured by an advanced video system, which allows measurements in 0.5-meter increments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/11-distance-measuring |title=Distance measurement |author=Berkutschi.com |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224542/http://berkutschi.com/en/front/encyclopedia/show/11-distance-measuring |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Misccaparms.jpg|thumb|350px|[[AKM]]s, [[H&amp;K G3]] and [[RPG-7]]s found by U.S. Marines in Fallujah]]
'''Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW)''' is a term used in [[arms control]] protocols to refer to two main classes of man portable weapons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52142.htm  NATO, Small arms and light weapons (SALW) and mine action (MA)&lt;/ref&gt;

“[[Small arms]]” are, broadly speaking, firearms designed for individual use. They include: [[handgun]]s, [[rifle]]s, [[carbine]]s, [[sub-machine guns]], [[assault rifle]]s and [[light machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name=UNODC-ITI /&gt; 

“Light weapons” are, broadly speaking, crew-served machine guns and high-explosive projectile weapons. They include: [[general-purpose machine gun]], [[medium machine gun]]s, [[heavy machine gun]]s, [[rifle grenade]]s, [[grenade launchers]], [[automatic grenade launcher]]s,  [[anti-tank rifle]]s, [[recoilless rifle]]s, [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s, [[anti-tank missile|man-portable anti-tank missiles]], [[man-portable air-defense system]]s, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of a calibre of less than 100 millimetres.&lt;ref name=UNODC-ITI /&gt;

Small Arms and Light Weapons also include [[ammunition]], [[explosives]], [[hand grenades]], [[land mines]] and any other man portable weapons not listed above.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.ipu.org/conf-e/114/114-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52142.htm  NATO, Small arms and light weapons (SALW) and mine action (MA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition by international legal conventions==
According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the international framework on firearms is composed of three main instruments: the [[Firearms Protocol]], the [[Small arms trade#United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms|United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects]] (Programme of Action, or PoA) and the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (International Tracing Instrument, or ITI), where only the Firearms Protocol is legally binding.

The ITI, adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 8 December 2005, defines small arms and light weapons as:&lt;ref name=UNODC-ITI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/organized-crime/Firearms/ITI.pdf |title=International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 February 2013 |website=unodc.org |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|any man-portable lethal weapon that expels or launches, is designed to expel or launch, or may be readily converted to expel or launch a shot, bullet or projectile by the action of an explosive, excluding antique small arms and light weapons or their replicas. Antique small arms and light weapons and their replicas will be defined in accordance with domestic law. In no case will antique small arms and light weapons include those manufactured after 1899:

(a) “Small arms” are, broadly speaking, weapons designed for individual use. They include, inter alia, revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and carbines, sub-machine guns,
assault rifles and light machine guns;

(b) “Light weapons” are, broadly speaking, weapons designed for use by two or three persons serving as a crew, although some may be carried and used by a single person. They include, inter alia, general purpose or universal machine guns, medium machine guns, heavy machine guns, rifle grenades, under-barrel grenade launchers and mounted grenade launchers, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tank guns, recoilless rifles, man portable launchers of anti-tank missile and rocket systems, man portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of a calibre of less than 100 millimetres.&lt;ref name=UNODC-ITI /&gt;}}

Such [[arms control]] policies and treaties are focused on international [[arms trafficking]] (importation and export), and in the standardization of laws, protocols and sharing of law enforcement information and best practices across nations to prevent illicit arms sales. They also focus on terrorism, arms proliferation as a humanitarian concern, disarmament in the face of extreme violence, and cases of ameliorating anarchy, civil war and international conflict. SALW provisions are generally not oriented towards imposing or enforcing domestic national or local legislation of legitimate gun ownership or sale.&lt;ref name=UNODA-SALW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/SALW/ |title=UNODA: Small Arms and Light Weapons |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2013 |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN SALW control efforts==

[[Small arms]] and light weapons are used in conflicts around the world, causing injury and death.&lt;ref name=SALW-Control&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unddr.org/iddrs/04/11.php |title=4.11 SALW Control, Security &amp; Development |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430043852/http://www.unddr.org/iddrs/04/11.php |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small arms control was first broached by UN Resolution A/RES/46/36 (December 1991), which was expanded upon by A/RES/50/70 (January 1996).&lt;ref name=UNRes5070&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/depts/ddar/Register/Resolutions/5070.htm |title= General and complete disarmament: Transparency in armaments |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 January 1996 |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter resolution mandated a panel of experts to research the type of small arms and light weapons being used in the world's conflicts and to study which weapons might apply to fall under an arms control regime.  The recommendations of expert reports returned to the General Assembly, A/52/298 (1997) and A/54/258 (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms, 1999|url=http://www.un-casa.org/CASAUpload/ELibrary/1999%20GGE.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008071925/http://www.un-casa.org/CASAUpload/ELibrary/1999%20GGE.pdf|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a July 2001 [[Small arms trade#United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms|United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms]], with a follow-up in July 2006.

On 26 September 2013 the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2117, which urged nations to remain committed to small arms embargoes and SALW control protocols.&lt;ref name=UNRes2117&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2117%282013%29 |title=Resolution 2117 (2013) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 September 2013 |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on SALW via the United Nations is coordinated by the [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs|Office for Disarmament Affairs]] (UNODA), though the UN Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA) mechanism, which comprises 21 UN departments and agencies working on different aspects of small arms and light weapons control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CASA Participants|url=http://www.un-casa.org/SecCASAMEMBER/MembersOfCasa.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923185907/http://www.un-casa.org/SecCASAMEMBER/MembersOfCasa.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research]] (UNIDIR), carries out research in arms control affairs and has published many articles and books related to small arms and light weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNIDIR selected publications and activities related to small arms|url=http://www.unidir.ch/bdd/focus-search.php?onglet=5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610112243/http://www.unidir.ch/bdd/focus-search.php?onglet=5|archivedate=10 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2013, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to adopt the [[Arms Trade Treaty]] (ATT) to govern the legal international trade in many types of conventional weapons, from warships and aircraft to small arms and light weapons.&lt;ref name=UN-ATT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/ATT/ |title=The Arms Trade Treaty |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2013 |website=un.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic obligation of the treaty is that all States Parties should establish or maintain controls in the area. In this way, the treaty also helps the international community to address unregulated or illegal trade in conventional weapons. The treaty opened for signature on 3 June 2013. To date, two-thirds of UN member states have signed the treaty (130 states), and 72 have ratified it. The treaty entered into force on December 24, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVI-8&amp;chapter=26&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SALW regimes and control organizations==

Many other related governmental bodies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also work on SALW control, major examples being [[IANSA (NGO)|IANSA]], [[Saferworld]] and the [[Control Arms Campaign]]. Regional and sub-regional organizations working on SALW control include the [[African Union]], [[ECCAS]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Southern African Development Community]], [[Andean Community]], [[CARICOM]], [[MERCOSUR]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[European Union]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[ASEAN]], the [[League of Arab States]], and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poa-iss.org/RegionalOrganizations/RegionalOrganizations.aspx |title=PoA-ISS: Regional Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2014 |website=poa-iss.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''T-Blades'' are a type of hockey skate blade manufactured by the German company T-Blade {{Interlanguage link multi|GmbH|de|3=Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (Deutschland)}}. Unlike tradition skate blades, T-blades are replaced when worn out. The manufacturer of the T-Blade states that "Compared to conventional skate blades, the T-Blade runner lasts 4-5 times longer." The T-Blade is held to the skate chassis by a stabilizer and six screws which require a special three-pronged wrench. The blades are sold pre-sharpened.

== Access ==
The Olympic Village is open to the public from 4:00 am until 8:00 pm daily. No fee is charged to use the facilities,&lt;ref name="Travel2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avalon Travel|title=Moon Central America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cew_DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2923|date=2 February 2016|publisher=Avalon Publishing|isbn=978-1-63121-416-5|pages=2923–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the complex is regarded as the property of all Hondurans. It typically receives at least 10,000 visits a day, attracting many walkers and runners as a relatively safe place within the city.&lt;ref name="Travel2016" /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
The maintenance of the Olympic Village is the responsibility of CONAPID, using funding of less than 10 million lempiras per month. This funding is derived mainly from rental income and advertising at the [[Estadio Tiburcio Carías Andino|Tiburcio Carías Andino Stadium]].

The Olympic Village does not collect fees from the public for provision of the installations, although sports organisations do levy a minimal charge to raise funds for participation in international competitions. It has been noted{{by whom|date=October 2017}} that with the constant increase of the price of all resources, adequate maintenance of the complex would require the government to increase the budgetary allocation by at least 30 million ''lempiras''.

== Renovation ==
CONAPID secured a grant of one million dollars, equivalent to some 20 million ''lempiras'', from the [[Central American Integration System|Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE)]] to renovate the Olympic Village. At present it receives adequate maintenance, with 3.5 million ''lempiras'' allocated to its maintenance in 2008.

Germán Duarte, the current supervisor of projects, is engaged with the repair of pitches and the repainting of floors in the three gymnasiums of the sports complex. A new roof has been provided at the Olympic swimming pool, stairways and perimeter fences have been repainted, and several planting areas have been improved.

Further improvements undertaken by CONAPID during 2015, at a cost of 14 million ''lempiras'', included fitting over 300 [[LED light]]s, resurfacing all the main roadways, and a new [[tartan track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernizan la Villa Olímpica de Tegucigalpa|url=http://tiempo.hn/modernizan-la-villa-olimpica-de-tegucigalpa/|work=Diario Tiempo Digital|date=21 August 2015|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lawn Ground''' was located in [[Nailsworth]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], and was, from 1890 to 2006, home to the English football club, [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]] who currently play in [[EFL League Two|League 2]]. The Lawn Ground also hosted local cup finals as well as being home to Forest Green's Ladies and youth sides. 

The ground was located at the top of a steep hill in the hamlet of Forest Green and had a total capacity of 5,141 people. Forest Green matches drew approximately 1,000 spectators on average at the Lawn Ground.   The ground's record attendance is 3,002 for a match between Forest Green and [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]], in a [[FA Trophy]] semi-final on 18 April 1999. 

Until the 1950s, the Lawn was little more than an open field, but the Rovers' success required upgrades to the stadium.  At this point, terraces were constructed for fans and a "famously partial leveling of the pitch" occurred.

In 1996, the Trevor Horsley Stand, named after the chairman of the club, Trevor Horsley, was constructed for over £200,000. This stand seated 300 and included three hospitality boxes, underground changing rooms, a board room, function room, bar, a health suite and offices. It also featured a quirky [[watermill]] behind the stand.  Aside from the Trevor Horsley Stand, the rest of the ground, about 80 percent, was terraced. 

The biggest terrace stand was the covered Barnfield Terrace. The terrace was built during 2001 and 2002 to increase the ground's capacity, and Forest Green fans paid to have their names engraved onto bricks inside that stand. The Barnfield Terrace was sponsored by Rockwool. When the club left the ground at the end of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-2006 season]], the stand was transferred brick by brick to their new ground. 

Other sections of the Lawn Ground included the Nympsfield Road Terrace which was located behind a goal at the northern end of the ground.

The Lawn Ground was demolished and turned into housing after the club moved into the new, modern [[The New Lawn|The New Lawn Stadium]], which now hosts all their matches. Forest Green began playing at the new stadium which is only a few hundred yards from the old Lawn, from the start of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006-2007 season]].&lt;ref name="new lawn"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13089">This '''timeline''' lists the foundation dates of the national governing bodies for '''[[rugby union]]'''&amp;mdash;known as rugby unions  or federations. The first union was the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) that was founded in 1871 to govern rugby union within [[England]]. It was founded following the first ever rugby union international, played between [[England national rugby union team|England]] and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] in 1871. The [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scottish Football Union]] (later renamed the Scottish Rugby Union) was then founded in 1873, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] in 1879 and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] in 1881.

[[File:11 June Stadium BenTaher.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Tripoli Stadium]]
The stadium hosted many games of the [[1982 African Cup of Nations]] held in Libya along with the [[28 March Stadium]] in [[Benghazi]]; it was the venue for the final between Ghana and Libya. It hosted the 2002 [[Italian Supercup]] between [[Juventus]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], which Juventus won, 2–1.

Its old name (June 11 Stadium) is a reference to the date of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Libya, June 11, 1970.

'''Twerton Park''' is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Twerton]] suburb of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]].  It is currently used for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home ground of [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]]. From 1986 to 1996 [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] played there following their departure from [[Eastville Stadium|Eastville]]. The stadium has a capacity of 8,840 people, with 1,066 seats.

The ground was opened on 26 June 1909 as '''Innox Park''' on land that had been donated by Thomas Carr. The opening ceremony involved a parade of scholars, the singing of [[hymn]]s and a speech by the chairman of the [[Parish councils in England|parish council]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Stephen &amp; Jay, Mike (2003): Bristol Rovers Football Club, The Definitive History 1883-2003. {{ISBN|0-7524-2717-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twerton Park became Bath City's ground in 1932.  A record attendance of 18,020 was recorded in 1960 versus [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. The ground has also hosted [[Team Bath F.C.|Team Bath]], who were a full-time professional team playing in the [[Conference South]] until their resignation at the end of the 2008–09 season.

At the end of the 2011–12 season the club offered the naming rights to Twerton Park for just £50. The offer drew 167 entries from as far afield as the US, Australia, Norway and Singapore which raised £3,850 for the club. Businesses made up 58 of the entries with only a handful of the remaining personalised entries being deemed unsuitable. The winning entry drawn at random was The Mayday Trust, a charitable organisation that helps to rehome vulnerable people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bath City's football ground to become Mayday Trust Park|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-17656281|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talks have been held in the past between [[Bath Rugby]] and Bath City about sharing a ground, as the former team wish to move away from their home ground [[Recreation Ground (Bath)|Recreation Ground]], although nothing has amounted from this. Following the resignation of Chairman Manda Rigby, she claimed that the club needed to move away from Twerton Park to "sustain their finances".&lt;ref name=bathchron-20131223&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/question-mark-future-bath-city-fc-s-twerton/story-20358188-detail/story.html |title=Question mark over the future of Bath City FC's Twerton ground |newspaper=Bath Chronicle |date=23 December 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
