      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">'''Adi Ophir''' (born 22 September 1951) is an [[Israel]]i philosopher.

Professor Ophir teaches philosophy at the [[Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas]] at [[Tel Aviv University]]. He is also a fellow at the [[Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]] where he directs an interdisciplinary research project on "Humanitarian Action in Catastrophes: The Shaping of Contemporary Political Imagination and Moral Sensibilities." 

Ophir's recent book ''The Order of Evils'' offers a [[ethics|moral theory]] that emphasizes the socially structured [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[political]] nature of evil.&lt;ref name=Ophir&gt;{{cite web
 |title=The Order of Evils 
 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] 
 |accessdate=2007-12-15 
 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10474 
 |deadurl=yes

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that evils, like pain, suffering, loss, and humiliation, are "superfluous evils" that can often be prevented but are not.&lt;ref name=Ophir/&gt; 

Analyzing seminal works by modern and [[postmodern]] philosophers such as [[Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Marx]], [[Sartre]], [[Arendt]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], and [[Derrida]], Ophir submits that to be moral is to care for others, and to be committed to preventing their suffering and distress.&lt;ref name=Ophir/&gt;

Ophir's focus on understanding particular evils (rather than some transcendentalized [[Evil]]) keeps his thought determinedly secular. While a deeply theoretical work, ''The Order of Evils'' is informed by Ophir's preoccupation with two major events in recent Jewish history: the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and the Israeli [[military occupation|occupation]] of Palestine.&lt;ref name=Ophir/&gt; He does not compare these two events but instead introduces a typology of disasters that locates them within the wide spectrum of calamities generated by humans to exhibit both the specificities and general patterns that subsequently emerge.&lt;ref name=Ophir/&gt;

His pre-monastic name was Visvesvara. In some texts name him as Vishwakendra Saraswati or Girvanendra Saraswati. Sri [[Neelakanta Dikshitar]] in Guru Ratna Malika praised him as Girvanendra Saraswati of [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam]]. He toured south India extensively and stayed at [[Benares]]. He wrote a commentary on the Vedic Sri Rudram. It was Atma Bodhendhra who instructed the great Avadhuta Sri Sadasiva Brahmendra to write the Guru ratna Malika stotram on the Gurus of the Kanchi Mutt. For Sadasiva brahmendra saraswathi and Atma Bodendra Saraswathi, the common guru is 57th Pontiff of Kanchi Mutt, Sri Paramasivendra Saraswathi who attained siddhi at Tiruvengadu. [[ Atma Bodhendra Saraswathi ]] is the immediate guru of  [[ Bodhendra Saraswathi]], the 59th pontiff of Sri Kanchi Mutt who attained siddhi at Govindapuram, near Kumbakonam.

Sri Atma Bodhendra Saraswathi attained Siddhi on the banks of the river Dakshina Pinakini, in 1638 AD. The Maha Samadhi of Sri Atma Bodhendra Saraswathi is located in [[Vadambalam]], in villupuram district.

'''Berkeley Zen Center''' (BZC), temple name {{nihongo|'''Shogakuji'''|正覚寺|Shōgaku-ji}}, is a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen Buddhist]] practice center located in [[Berkeley, California]] led by [[Sojun Mel Weitsman]]. An informal affiliate to the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] (SFZC),&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;Ford, 129&lt;/ref&gt; BZC was founded in 1967 by Weitsman and [[Shunryu Suzuki]] as a satellite group for the SFZC.&lt;ref name="dimidjian"&gt;Dimidjian, 137&lt;/ref&gt; Despite founding the center, Weitsman was not installed as abbot there until 1985, one year after receiving [[Dharma transmission]] from Hoitsu Suzuki.&lt;ref name="gach"&gt;Gach, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Weitsman's [[Dharma heir]], Alan Senauke, lives on site with his wife Laurie Senauke (as of 1999) and also works for the [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;Prebish, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Another former teacher at BZC was [[Maylie Scott]], who died in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Queen, 266&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 [[Zenkei Blanche Hartman]] began sitting [[zazen]] at BZC, receiving Dharma transmission from Weitsman in 1988.[http://www.zencircle.org/speakers.html] In 1979 the center relocated to its current location on Russell Street—and today houses a small group of residents who live on site.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080215173019/http://berkeleyzencenter.org/aboutBZC.shtml]

{{Gnosticism}}
According to the ''[[Panarion]]'' of [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (ch. 26), and [[Theodoret]]'s ''Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium'', the '''Borborites''' or '''Borborians''' ({{lang-el|Βορβοριανοί}}; also Koddians; in [[Egypt]], Phibionites; in other countries, Barbalites, Secundians, Socratites, etc.) were a [[libertine]] [[Christian Gnosticism|Christian Gnostic]] [[sect]], said to be descended from the [[Nicolaitans]]. The word ''Borborite'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''βόρβορος'', meaning "[[mud]]"; the name ''Borborites'' can therefore be translated as "filthy ones".

==Teachings==
===Sacred texts===

The Borborites possessed a number of sacred books, including ''[[Norea|Noria]]'' (the name they gave to [[Noah]]'s wife), a ''[[Gospel of Eve]]'', ''[[Apocalypse of Adam|The Apocalypse of Adam]]'', and ''[[Gospel of Perfection|The Gospel of Perfection]]''. They also used a version of ''[[The Gospel of Philip]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Young Richard Kim|title=Epiphanius of Cyprus: Imagining an Orthodox World|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|isbn=978-0-472-11954-7|pages=37-39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrR0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQEuh__3K7&amp;sig=kxtNV2N-XiRnuic3zwbj4zaod1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a quotation from the Borborite ''Gospel of Philip'' found in Epiphanius's ''Panarion'' is not found anywhere in the surviving version from [[Nag Hammadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=11-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the Borborites' sacred scriptures revolved around the figure of [[Mary Magdalene]], including ''The Questions of Mary'', ''The Greater Questions of Mary'', ''The Lesser Questions of Mary'', and ''The Birth of Mary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Young Richard Kim|title=Epiphanius of Cyprus: Imagining an Orthodox World|date=2015|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|isbn=978-0-472-11954-7|pages=37-39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrR0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQEuh__3K7&amp;sig=kxtNV2N-XiRnuic3zwbj4zaod1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borborites also used a number of sacred texts attributed to [[Seth]], the son of Adam and Eve, including ''The Second Treatise of the Great Seth'' and ''The Three Steles of Seth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=11-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Borborites did also use both the Old Testament and the New Testament, they renounced the God of the Old Testament as an imposter deity.&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius of Salamis 26.6.1 [https://archive.today/20151013103634/http://www.masseiana.org/panarion_bk1.htm%23First]&lt;/ref&gt;

Epiphanius of Salamis records that ''The Greater Questions of Mary'' contained an episode in which Jesus took Mary Magdalene up to the top of a mountain, where he pulled a woman out of his side and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Then, upon ejaculating, Jesus drank his own semen and told Mary, "Thus we must do, that we may live." Upon hearing this, Mary instantly fainted, to which Jesus responded by helping her up and telling her, "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius of Salamis 26.8.1-3 [https://archive.is/20151013103634/http://www.masseiana.org/panarion_bk1.htm%23First]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
They taught that there were eight heavens, each under a separate [[archon (Gnosticism)|archon]]. In the seventh reigned [[Sabaoth]], creator of heaven and earth, the God of the Jews, represented by some Borborites under the form of an ass or a hog; hence the Jewish prohibition of swine's flesh. In the eighth heaven reigned [[Barbelo]], the mother of the living; the Father of All, the supreme God; and [[Jesus Christ]]. They denied that Christ was born of Mary, or had a real body; and also the resurrection of the body. 

The human soul after death wanders through the [[seven heavens]], until it obtains rest with Barbelo. Man possesses a soul in common with plants and beasts. According to [[Saint Augustine]], they taught that the soul was derived from the substance of God, and hence could not be polluted by contact with [[hyle|matter]].

===Sexual sacramentalism===
[[File:Black mass 01.jpg|thumb|Sixteenth-century engraving showing a [[Black Mass]] involving similar sexual sacrementalist rituals to those allegedly practiced by the Borborites]]
Epiphanius claims that the Borborites were inspired by [[Sethian|Sethianism]] and that elements of sexual sacramentalism formed an important role in their rituals. He asserts that the Borborites engaged in a version of the [[eucharist]] in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=11-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her monthly period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraff|first1=Wouter J.|last2=Kripal|first2=Jeffrey J.|title=Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism|date=2011|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York City, New York|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nC0mY_XEIU0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Borborites+Epiphanius+of+Salamis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I4pf5o87vB&amp;sig=9bjbHdJVAT_0pedXuDGQuRCGmG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpe6pqo7UAhUIyoMKHWfIA7MQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Borborites%20Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borborites were also said to extract fetuses from pregnant women and consume them, particularly if the women accidentally became pregnant during related sexual rituals.

Epiphanius claimed to have some first-hand knowledge of the sect, and to have run away from certain Gnostic women who reproached him thus:

{{quote|We have not been able to save the young man, but rather, have abandoned him to the clutches of the ruler!|Epiphanius, ''Panarion'', 26, 17.6}}

Epiphanius later reported the group to the bishops, resulting in the expulsion of around 80 people from the city of Alexandria.

Because everything that is known about the Borborites comes exclusively from polemics written by their opponents, it is still disputed whether or not these reports accurately reflect Borborite teachings or if they are merely propaganda intended to discredit the Borborites. Stephen Gero finds the accounts written by Epiphanius and later writers plausible and connects them with earlier Gnostic myths.&lt;ref&gt;Gero, Stephen (1986). "With Walter Bauer on the Tigris: Encratite Orthodoxy and Libertine Heresy in Syro-Mesopotamian Christianity," in C.W. Hedrick, R. Hodgson (eds.), ''Nag Hammadi, Gnosticism, and Early Christianity'', Peabody, Ma.: Hendrickson Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbelo===
It is highly improbable that the Borborites ever actually used this name to refer to themselves. Nonetheless, this name, along with their alternative names and the descriptions of their beliefs, reveals a connection to [[Barbelo]]. Some of the Gnostic scriptures have been called "Barbeloite" because of her appearance in them, such as the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' and ''[[Trimorphic Protennoia]]''. The last of these seems to have undergone Sethian revision, although similar, fully Sethian texts have their own distinct perspective—maybe suggesting some Sethians were inspired by Barbeloite writings. These writings do not mention any sexual rituals, but neither any moral codes. ''Trimorphic Protennoia'' does describe the divine as a sexual being, but being a highly esoteric work leaves much to the imagination. If the Barbelognostics were libertines and these are their writings, then the unfriendly account of Epiphanius has to be contrasted with the elegant spiritual writings they produced.

'''Brunetto Latini''' (c. 1220–1294) (who signed his name ''Burnectus Latinus'' in Latin and ''Burnecto Latino'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) was an Italian philosopher, scholar, notary, and statesman.

==Life==
Brunetto Latini was born in [[Florence]] in 1220 to a Tuscan noble family, the son of Buonaccorso Latini. He belonged to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] party. He was a notary and a man of learning, much respected by his fellow citizens and famed for his skill as an orator. He expounded the writings of [[Cicero]] as guidance in public affairs.

He was of sufficient stature to be sent to [[Seville]] on an embassy to [[Alfonso el Sabio]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] to seek help for Florence against the Sienese; the mission was unsuccessful. On his return from [[Spain]], travelling along the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]], he describes meeting a student from [[Bologna]] astride a bay mule, who told him of the defeat of the Guelphs at the [[Battle of Montaperti]]. As a result, Latini was exiled from his native city. He took refuge in France from 1261 to 1268 while working as a [[notary]] in [[Montpellier]], [[Arras]], [[Bar-sur-Aube]], and [[Paris]].

In 1269, when the political situation allowed, he returned to [[Tuscany]] and for some twenty years held successive high offices.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1273 he was appointed as Secretary to the Council of the [[Republic of Florence]]. In 1280, he contributed to the temporary reconciliation between the Guelph and Ghibelline parties, and in 1284 presided over the conference in which an attack on [[Pisa]] was agreed. Finally, in 1287, he was elevated to the dignity of "prior" as one of 12 magistrates established through the constitution of 1282.

[[Giovanni Villani]] says that "he was a great philosopher and a consummate master of rhetoric, not only in knowing how to speak well, but how to write well". He was the author of various works in prose and verse.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He died in 1294, leaving behind a daughter, Bianca Latini, who had married Guido Di Filippo De' Castiglionchi in 1284. His tomb can be found in the church of [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence]], to the left of the high altar.

==Works==
[[File:Latini - Livres dou Tresor, per Gioan Antonio &amp; fratelli da Sabbio, ad instanza di Nicolo Garanta &amp; Francesco da Salo libbrari &amp; compagni - 4620219 968525 00005.tif|thumb|''Livres dou Tresor'']]
While in France, he wrote his [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Tesoretto'' and in French his prose ''Li Livres dou Trésor'', both summaries of the encyclopaedic knowledge of the day.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The latter is regarded as the first [[encyclopedia]] in a modern European language. The Italian 13th-century translation known as ''Tesoro'' was misattributed to Bono Giamboni. He also translated into Italian the ''Rettorica'' and three ''Orations'' by Cicero. The Italian translation of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Nicomachean Ethics'' is often misattributed to Brunetto Latini: it is a work of Taddeo Alderotti instead.

==The Divine Comedy==
Latini was Dante’s guardian after the death of his father. Early Dante commentators spoke of Brunetto as his teacher, as does Dante himself. Vittorio Imbriani took issue with that concept, saying Brunetto was far too busy a man to have been a mere teacher. Dante immortalized him in the [[Divine Comedy]] (see [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], XV.82-87). It is also believed that there was an intellectual and affectionate bond between the elderly man and the young poet. It was perhaps Latini who induced Dante to read Cicero and [[Boethius]], after the death of [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].

Many of the characters in Dante's Inferno are also mentioned in the legal and diplomatic documents Brunetto Latini wrote in Latin. There is a portrait of Latini in the ''Bargello'' in [[Florence]], once reputed to be by [[Giotto]], beside the one of Dante. In a wood engraving, Gustave [[Doré]] envisages the same scene from Inferno XV, 1861.

===Canto XV===
Dante places Latini within the third ring of the Seventh Circle, the Circle of the Violent against God, nature and art, with the [[sodomy|sodomites]], [[blasphemy|blasphemers]], and [[profligate]]s. Dante writes of the "clerks and great and famous scholars, defiled in the world by one and the same sin".

Dante's treatment of Latini, however, is commendatory beyond almost any other figure in the 'Inferno'. He calls the poet ''a radiance among men and speaks with gratitude of that sweet image, gentle and paternal, / you were to me in the world when hour by hour / you taught me how man makes himself eternal''. Dante addresses Latini with the respectful pronoun ''voi''; Latini uses the informal ''tu'', as perhaps was their custom when they spoke together in [[Florence]]. The portrait is drawn with love, pathos and a dignity that is more compelling given the squalor of the punishment.

Latini asks first, humbly, if he may keep Dante company, letting his group run on. Dante offers to sit down with him but that would only increase Latini’s penalty; he and the other souls are doomed to keep moving aimlessly around the arena.

Latini proceeds in obscure imagery to foretell Dante's future. The malicious ingrates who of old descended from ''Fiesole'', will be his enemies. They are reputed blind, avaricious, envious and proud. Let him beware, he warns, not to be stained by them. [[Mark Musa]] suggests that in this speech between the two there is sexual imagery indicative of the act of [[sodomy]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

According to John D. Sinclair, Dante respected Latini immensely but nonetheless felt it necessary to place him with the [[sodomy|sodomites]] since, according to Sinclair, such behaviour by Latini was well known in [[Florence]] at the time. The squalor of Latini’s sin and penalty is nevertheless painful for Dante to visualize.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Sinclair, ''The Divine Comedy 1: Inferno: Inferno. Parallel Text Vol 1'', 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other critics point to the fact that, outside of the [[Divine Comedy]], there are no firm historical records suggesting Latini was accused of [[sodomy]] or [[homosexual]] relations - and indeed he seemingly condemns it himself in the ''Tesoretto''. Some therefore have suggested perhaps that Latini is placed in Canto XV for being violent against art and against his vernacular (Latini wrote in French instead of [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]], which Dante championed as a literary language in [[De Vulgari Eloquentia]]); or perhaps also to demonstrate and underline that even the greatest of men may be guilty of private sins. Neither objection rules out the possibility that he was guilty of the perceived sin himself; and given the setting and context, it is difficult to see that there can be any doubt, particularly following the discovery in recent years of a love poem, "S'eo son distretto inamoratamente" which Latini seems to have sent to another man, [[Bondie Dietaiuti]].&lt;ref&gt;Who’s Who in Gay and Lesbian History from Antiquity to World War II.

{{Jainism}}
The [[Karma in Jainism|karmic process]] in [[Jainism]] is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (''[[tattva]]'') of Jainism which explain the human predicament.&lt;ref name=soni&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor-first =E. | editor-last =Craig | title =Jain Philosophy | journal =Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher =Routledge | location =London | year =1998 | url =http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | accessdate =2008-03-05 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060722002023/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT1 | archivedate =22 July 2006 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of those, four—influx ([[asrava|āsrava]]), bondage (''bandha''), stoppage (''[[samvara|saṃvara]]'')  and release (''[[nirjara|nirjarā]]'')—pertain to the karmic process.&lt;ref name=soni/&gt; Karma gets bound to the soul on account of two processes:
*''[[asrava|āsrava]]'' – Influx of karmas, and
*''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' – bondage or  sticking of karmas to consciousness

==Influx of Karma==
{{Main|Asrava}}
The ''āsrava'', that is, the influx of karma occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body.&lt;ref name=Jaini112&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p.112&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tattvārthasūtra]]'', 6:1–2 states: "The activities of body, speech and mind is called ''yoga''. This three-fold action results in ''āsrava'' or influx of karma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }} p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of influx===
The karmas are attracted to the consciousness by combination of the following factors pertaining to action—instrumentality, process, modality and motivation&lt;ref name="tat"&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.191&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the karmas are attracted and bound on account of combination any element of the following four factors:
*the instrumentality of the actions, that is, either through:
**body – physical action,
**speech – verbal action, or
**mind – mental action
*the process of action which consists of:
**decision or plan to act,
**making preparations for the act, like, collecting necessary materials, or
**actually beginning of the action
*the modality of action, that consists of:
**the act carried out by self, or
**instigating someone else to carry out the act, or
**giving approval or endorsing the act.
*the motivation for action. This includes any of the following negative emotions that motivates the action:
**Anger
**Greed
**Pride
**Manipulation or deceit

With a combination of any of the elements of the above four factors, there are 108 ways with which the karmas can be attracted to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal |authorlink=Sukhlal Sanghvi|title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; Even a silent assent or endorsements of acts of violence done by someone else far away, have karmic consequences for the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Prasada | first =Ajit | title =Purushartha Siddhyupaya of Amrtacandra | publisher =AMS Press| year =1974 | location =New York | isbn =0-404-57704-0 }} p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the scriptures advice carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as a means to avoid the karmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Varni | first =Jinendra | first2=Sagarmal |last2=Jain |translator-first=T.K. |translator-last=Tukol |translator-first2=K.K. |translator-last2=Dixit | title ={{IAST|Samaṇ Suttaṁ}} | publisher =Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti | year =1993 | location =New Delhi }}  p.61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra (1993) p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bondage of karmas==
{{Main|Bandha (Jainism)}}
The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''yoga'' or the activities alone do not produce bondage. Out of the many causes of bondage, passion is considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref name=Jaini112/&gt; The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (''kasayas'') because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce  | title =Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages =135–149  | publisher =University of Hawai press  | date =April 1989  | jstor =1399374| doi =10.2307/1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson | first =W.J. | title =Harmless souls: karmic bondage and religious change in early Jainism with special reference to Umāsvāti and Kundakunda | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| year =1995 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1309-X }} p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four fault—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

—''Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Causes of bondage===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soul Attracting Karma.jpg|300px|thumb|Karmas are attracted by the activity of mind, speech and body influenced by various passions.]] --&gt;
According to ''Tattvārthasūtra'', the causes of karmic bondage—in the order they are required to be eliminated by a soul for spiritual progress—are:
* ''[[Mithyatva|Mithyātva]]'' (Irrationality and a deluded world view) – The deluded world view is the misunderstanding as to how this world really functions on account of one-sided perspectives, perverse viewpoints, irrational scepticism, pointless generalisations and ignorance.
* ''Avirati'' (non-restraint or a vowless life) – The second cause of bondage, ''avirati'' is the inability to refrain voluntarily from the evil actions, that harms oneself and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The state of  ''avirati'' can only be overcome by observing the minor vows of a layman.
* ''Pramāda'' (carelessness and laxity of conduct) – This third cause of bondage consists of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and improper actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to oneself or others.&lt;ref name=tatia190&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.190&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|{{IAST|Kaṣāya}}]]'' (passions or negative emotions) –  The four passions—anger, pride, deceit and greed—are the primary reason for the attachment of the karmas to the soul. They keep the soul immersed in the darkness of delusion leading to deluded conduct and unending cycles of reincarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.194&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Yoga]]'' (activities of mind, speech and body) – The threefold activities of mind, body and speech attract and bind the karmas when such actions are influenced by passions.

Each cause presupposes the existence of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose the existence of the previous cause.&lt;ref name=tatia190/&gt; A soul is able to advances on the spiritual ladder called ''[[Gunasthana|{{IAST|guṇasthāna}}]]'', only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one. Duration and intensity of the karmic bond are determined by ''"[[Kashaya (Jainism)|{{IAST|Kaṣāya}}]]"'' and type and quantity of the karmas bound depends on ''yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of different types of karmas==
Chapter VI of ''[[Tattvarthasutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'' provides a detailed description of various causes for various types of karmas. According to Jain texts, there are eight main types of karma—''jñānavāraṇa'' (Knowledge obscuring karma), ''darśanāvaraṇa'' (perception obscuring karma) ''mohanīya'' (deluding karma), ''antarāya'' (obstacles creating karma), ''vedanīya'' (feeling producing karma), ''nāma'' (body determining karma), ''āyu'' (life span determining karma) and "gotra" (status determining karma).

===Causes of knowledge obscuring and perception obscuring karmas===
''Jñānavāraṇa''  and ''darśanāvaraṇa''  karma are knowledge obscuring and perception obscuring. They are caused by:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.244-45&lt;/ref&gt;
#harbouring a feeling of jealousy towards knowledge or perception, towards a possessor of it and towards a means of it.
# Wilful concealment of knowledge or perception
#Ungenerosity as to knowledge
#Obstruction of knowledge or perception to others
#Denial of receipt of knowledge
# False accusation or misrepresentation

===Causes of feeling producing karma===
[[File:Vedniya Karma.jpg|thumb|200px|Vediniya karma: Pain and Pleasure is induced on account of licking honey from the sword]]
''Vedanīya'', feeling producing karmas can be of two types: ''sātāvedanīya'' i.e. pleasant and ''asātāvedanīya'' i.e. unpleasant feeling producing karmas.

====Causes of asātāvedanīya karma====
''Asātāvedanīya'' karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.246&lt;/ref&gt;
#External or an internal pain
#To feel troubled and worried on having been deprived of the company of a well-wisher
#Experience of acute distress or heart burning on account of insult or insulting others
#To enjoy or wallow in misery, to weep and wail
#Injurying self or others
#Lamenting on recalling the merits of a departed one

====Causes of sātāvedanīya karma====
''Sātāvedanīya'' karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.247&lt;/ref&gt;
#Harbouring a feeling of compassion towards all the living
#Leading a religious life i.e. practice of minor vows or [[anuvrata]] by householder and [[mahavrata]] by monks and ascetics
#Donation and charity with humility
#Self restraint or proper attentiveness towards disciplined life even if it is tinged with some attachment
#Forbearance and forgiveness
#Inculcating purity by suppressing the tendency towards greed and the like defilements

===Causes of deluding karmas===
''Mohanīya''  karmas produce a delusion in a soul i.e. the soul is not able to distinguish between right and wrong. They are of two subtypes—''Darśana-mohanīya'' (Perception delusion) and ''cāritra-mohanīya'' (conduct deluding) karmas.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.248-49&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes of Darśana-mohanīya====
#Speaking ill of the [[Kevala Jnana|omniscient]] and holders of true knowledge
#Speaking ill of the [[Jain Agamas|scripture]] i.e. a jealous intellect leveling false charges against the scripture  (e.g.  Saying that this scripture is useless because it is composed in Prakrit which is a language of the illiterate   alternatively, because it is composed in a complication ridden language of the pedant   or that it contains a futile and bothersome description of the various vows, regulations, expiations etc.)
#Speaking ill of the religious order or levelling false charges against the religious order composed of four divisions   viz.  monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen  (e.g.  saying that these monks unnecessarily take the trouble of observing vows, regulations etc., since [[Jain monasticism|monkhood]] is in fact an impossibility nor is it conducive to a wholesome result, or saying about the laymen that they undertake no cultured performances like bath, donation etc., nor do they lead a life of purity.)
#Speaking ill of the religion
#Speaking ill of the deities or denigrating them

====Causes of Cāritra-mohanīya karmas====
#To produce a [[Kashaya (Jainism)|''kasaya'']] (passions) in oneself or in others and to undertake unworthwhile acts under the influence of a ''kasaya''
#To ridicule the [[Jainism|true religion]], to make fun of a poor or helpless person, to develop the habit of frivolous joking
#Indulging in various recreations evincing disinclination towards the proper moral restrains like vows and regulations
#To cause worry to others, to disturb someone in one's rest and to keep the company of petty persons
#To maintain a sorrowful demeanour and to arouse a feeling of sorrow in others
#To feel afraid and to frighten others
#To despise a beneficial act and a beneficial general conduct
#A habit for cheating and finding fault with others
#To nourish mental impressions of various sexual feelings

===The causes of lifespan determining karmas===
The ''āyu'' karmas are the life span determining karmas and they determine the next destiny or reincarnation of a soul. Accordingly, as per the next reincarnations lifespan determined, a soul takes birth in either hell, heaven, animal kingdom or as a human (this list is not exhaustive).&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes of the Narakayus karma or birth in hells====
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Images_of_Hell1.jpg|image2=Images_of_Hell2.jpg|width=350|caption1=Torture in Hells: Ratna prabha, Sharkara prabha and Valuka prabha.|caption2=Torture in Hells: Panka prabha, Dhuma prabha, Tamaha prabha and Mahatamaha prabha}}

Following reasons result in birth in [[Naraka (Jainism)|naraka or hells]]:
#Killing or causing pain with intense passion
# Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life

====Causes of the Tiryagayus karma or birth as animals====
Following actions conducted with deceit  lead to births animals, plants or microbes:
#Preaching religion to introduce sheer falsity
#Propagate religion with a selfish motive
#Vowless and unrestrained life

====Causes of Manusyayus karma or birth as human====
#To reduce the tendency to inflict injury and that to accumulate possession.
#To exhibit softness and simplicity.
#Vowless and unrestrained life
#Helping the needy (poor, friends, old peoples, blind and handicaps etc.)
#Doing charity
#Forgiveness
#To respect humans

====Causes of the Devayus karma or birth in Heavens====
{{Further|God in Jainism}}
#Having a disciplined and restrained life yet accompanied by some attachment
#Partial practice of vows like non-violence, etc.
#Refraining from evil acts but out of compulsion from external factors or for imitating others
#Undergoing childish penances like [[Fasting in Jainism|fasting]] and austerities without understanding
Practicing vows and austerities normally leads to destruction of karmas and of attainment of ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]'' or liberation, but in above cases leads to merit and birth in heavens as demi-gods for a long but finite period of time.

===Causes of body determining karma===
The ''nāma'' karmas or body determining karmas are of two types—''asubha'' and ''subha nama'' karmas i.e. auspicious and inauspicious karmas. Their causes are:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.252-53&lt;/ref&gt;
# Crooked and misleading actions (pertaining to mind, speech and body) causes inflow of inauspicious ''nāma'' karma
# The opposite of the above—straightforwardness and genuine behaviour—causes inflow of auspicious ''nāma'' karma.
# Sixteen dispositions that cause rebirth as a ''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthaṅkara]]'' on account of Tīrthaṅkara–nāma-karma:
## purity of worldview,
## humility,
## non-violation of [[Mahavrata|vows and abstinences]], 
## persistent cultivation of knowledge, 
## ever present fear of worldly existence, 
## charity and renunciation as per one's capacity, 
## penance as per one's capacity, 
## ensuring harmony and peace in the religious order particularly the order of monks, 
## offering services to the competent and deserving persons, 
## devotion towards [[Siddha]]s and Tīrthaṅkaras, 
## devotion towards the preceptor, 
## devotion towards  learned [[Jain monasticism|monks]], 
## devotion towards scriptures, 
## regard for compulsory duties, 
## to cultivate and honour the path of ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|mokṣa]], '' 
## feeling of unattached affection towards the co-religionists.

===Causes of Status determining===
The ''gotra'' karma or status determining karma is of two types:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.254&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Nicagotra'' karma: Praising oneself, defaming others, hiding others’ merits and finding fault in others are the causes of low status or low class.
#''Uccagotra'' karma: Praising others, displaying one’s own shortcomings, ignoring one’s own merit along with humility and modesty cause the inflow of high status determining karma.

===Causes of Obstructing karma===
The causes of inflow of obstructing or ''antarāya'' karma are—causing  obstruction to others or  intending to place or placing obstacles before others in their attempts towards beneficence, gain, satisfaction, comfort and power.&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality''' (German: '''''Zentrum für christliche Meditation und Spiritualität''''') is an institution of the [[Diocese of Limburg]], Germany. It is based at the [[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim|Holy Cross Church]] in [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Bornheim]] and is dedicated to services, contemplation, meditation, [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], [[Christian counseling|counseling]], and other events such as concerts.

== History ==

When [[Franz Kamphaus]], then bishop of Limburg, visited the [[parish]]es of Frankfurt in 2004, he met people who were open to spiritual experiences but not within the traditional churches.&lt;ref name="Franziskaner-2009" /&gt; He founded the centre in 2007. On 15 January he signed the charter of foundation for the theme church Holy Cross – Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The charter of foundation came into effect on 1 July 2007.&lt;ref name="StJosef-Frankfurt" /&gt;

The Holy Cross Church accommodates one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg. The others are the Centre for Mourning Counselling in St. Michael in [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Nordend]] and the three youth churches: Crossover in St. Hildegard in [[Limburg an der Lahn]], Jona in St. Bonifatius in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]], and Kana in Maria-Hilf in [[Wiesbaden-Nordost]]. Like the church St. Michael, the Holy Cross Church is a branch church of the parish St. Josef Frankfurt. The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese&lt;ref name="StJosef-Frankfurt" /&gt; and is subordinated to the head of department of the Episcopalian chair (Dr. Hildegard Wustmans).&lt;ref name="Bistum Limburg-Pastorale Dienste" /&gt; The centre was directed from 2007 until October 2018 by the Franciscan [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]],&lt;ref name="hr-Helmut_Schlegel" /&gt; where he still works as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker. Since November 2018 the centre is directed by Samuel Stricker a spiritual guide and retreat guide&lt;ref name="HK-Team" /&gt; who works with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Missionary Sisters (MMS).&lt;ref name="MMS-Frankfurt" /&gt;

== Program ==
Although the offerings of the centre reflect the tenets of Christianity, the target audience includes people of all religious denominations, worldviews, and cultures.  The center offers different kinds of church services, such as [[expressionist dance]], meditation courses, [[contemplation|contemplative]] prayer, [[Zen]]-meditation courses, days of reflection, [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|spiritual exercises]], [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], lectures by guest speakers such as [[Anselm Grün]],&lt;ref name="HK-FNP-09122014" /&gt; meditations with the [[Sōtō]]-Zen-priest and veteran of the [[Vietnam War]] [[Claude AnShin Thomas]],&lt;ref name="HK-Bornheimer Wochenblatt-19102016" /&gt; and many other kinds of events. The team&lt;ref name="HK-Team" /&gt; publishes a new program annually.&lt;ref name="HK-Program" /&gt;

Event series include days of exercises of [[Christian mysticism]], [[Meditation music#Christian meditation music|meditative singing]], spiritual guided city tours in which topics by Frankfurt tourist guides are joined with spiritual topics or [[pilgrim]] hikes with a picnic and [[Catholic devotions|devotions]].&lt;ref name="HK-Program" /&gt; One-time events are also part of the program, for example, the ''Tram of Silence'' [[tram]] rides on an historic railcar of the [[Trams in Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt tramway system]], including elements such as silence with short, thought-provoking impulses to the senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and smelling.&lt;ref name="HK-TramSilence" /&gt;

The dialogue between the cultures and major religious groups concerning meditation and spirituality is another important aspect of the work of the centre. These include [[panel discussion]]s with representatives of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], and Christianity about meditation, with personal field reports from the different religions. Other examples are courses in [[Yoga]] and [[Yoga nidra]], or dance performances of an Indian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] padre who figures elements of traditional meditative dances such as [[Bharatanatyam]] from Hinduism as a kind of prayer to God.&lt;ref name="HK-Bharatanatyam" /&gt;

For the last few years, a [[Crete|Cretan]]-style [[labyrinth]] consisting of 2,500 [[tealight]]s has been formed on the third Saturday of [[Advent]] before the [[Gaudete Sunday]]. This labyrinth is part of the service and can be walked through by visitors.&lt;ref name="HK-2500-tealights" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BL-Frauenarbeit-FB-11122016" /&gt;

During the Frankfurt {{ill|Luminale|de}} festival of light in 2014 the team members of the centre offered a meditation consisting of light, words, music, and sound in cooperation with the Jona youth church in the [[Frankfurt Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="HK-Luminale-JONA" /&gt;
 
Concert performances at the center have included ''[[A German Requiem (Brahms)|A German Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]] and meditative music from the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Peter Abelard]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]].&lt;ref name="Ensemble Cosmedin" /&gt;

== Interior ==
The interior of the church was modified for the new purpose, completed in 2010. nterior. The fixed pews were removed and replaced by folding chairs which enabled a more flexible use. While the former main [[altar]] is normally not used, a smaller wooden altar has been added, typically surrounded by circles of folding chairs. Stairlifts and ramps for wheelchairs were installed. The former [[crypt]] and the rooms of the former [[clergy house]] were transformed to be used for meditation. In the crypt, the floor was changed to wood, and the meditation area was enclosed by textile panels made from linen.&lt;ref name="HK-Gille" /&gt;

== Church building and parish ==
The Centre of Christian Meditation and Spirituality is located in the parish area of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parish St. Josef Frankfurt am Main, which was founded as a "parish of a new type" on 1 January 2015. In the new greater parish area there are four churches located as "church places" and two churches as "theme churches". One of the two theme churches is the Holy Cross Church, which headquarters the meditation centre and is used for church services and centre events. The buildings are administrated by the Catholic Church of the city of Frankfurt am Main. There is an active collaboration with the parish of St. Josef Frankfurt am Main. During the restoration period of the church [[St. Leonhard]] in the Frankfurt [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], beginning on 7 May 2011, the church services of the International English-speaking Catholic parishes of the Frankfurt area have taken place in the Holy Cross Church.&lt;ref name="English-Parish-Ffm" /&gt;

== Transport connections ==
The Holy Cross Church is one-minute walking distance from the ''Ernst-May-Platz'' tram stop of the tramline 14 of the Frankfurt tramway, and the [[Stadtbahn]] station ''Eissporthalle/Festplatz'' of the line [[U7 (Frankfurt U-Bahn)|U7]] of the Frankfurt [[light rail]] system. Also not far away is the motorway exit ''Frankfurt-Ost'' of the Federal Motorway 661.

== Camino de Santiago ==
Beneath the Bornheim slope to the east of the meditation centre runs a branch of the German [[Camino de Santiago]] (Way of St. James).&lt;ref name="Camino-RMV-map" /&gt; The route is based on the ancient trade route from Leipzig to Frankfurt am Main (''Des Reiches Straße''). The way starts in the bishop city [[Fulda]] and continues through [[Schlüchtern]], [[Steinau an der Straße]], [[Bad Soden-Salmünster]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Langenselbold]], [[Erlensee]], and [[Bruchköbel]]. It belongs to the network of main pilgrimage routes to the grave of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] in the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]. This branch, which is 116&amp;nbsp;km long, passes the Holy Cross Church and leads through the Ostpark, and then passes the [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] at the former [[Großmarkthalle]] (Wholesale Market Hall) on its route to the [[Main (river)|Main River]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|inner city of Frankfurt am Main]]. It also passes the [[Eiserner Steg]] (an iron footbridge) and continues to [[Mainz]] and [[Trier]].&lt;ref name="Camino-RMV-website" /&gt;

The '''Colony Framework''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] [[Software framework|framework]] specification.&lt;ref name="colony-specification"&gt;[http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_colony_specification.html Colony Specification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817050803/http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_colony_specification.html |date=2011-08-17 }} - Guide on the Colony specification&lt;/ref&gt; Implementations of the specification offer a runtime component model, that allows for plugins to be installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled without requiring the application container to be stopped. The specification relies heavily on the [[Inversion of control]] principle, in order to make it easier for application components to discover and interact with each other.

Colony aims to eliminate the complexity typically associated with the creation of modular applications, through a simplified unified model for component development. Practical applications can range from modular enterprise software to application mashing.&lt;ref name="what-colony"&gt;[http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_what_can_i_build_with_colony.html What can I build with Colony?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817051419/http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_what_can_i_build_with_colony.html |date=2011-08-17 }} - Guide with applications that could benefit from the technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

Colony gathers inspiration from other modularity solutions such as [[OSGi]] for the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language and [[Managed Extensibility Framework|Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)]] for the [[.NET Framework]].

Colony aims to be a platform and language independent specification, and serve a wide range of use cases.&lt;ref name="why-colony"&gt;[http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_why_colony.html Why Colony?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817051551/http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_why_colony.html |date=2011-08-17 }} - Guide motivating the need for the framework&lt;/ref&gt; This includes use cases typically associated with [[OSGi]], such as modularized application with a narrow core and large extensibility possibilities. This also includes use cases to which [[Managed Extensibility Framework|MEF]] caters, such as adding modularity to an existing application, without the developer having to create its own plugin infrastructure from scratch.

The need for reducing the number of configuration steps for assembling a computing grid, as well as supporting adding nodes and distributing computation to them as quickly as possible, also drives the Colony Distributed initiative.

==Key concepts==

The Colony conceptual model builds on top of 6 key concepts.&lt;ref name="colony-specification"/&gt;

*'''Plugin Manager''': core facility that manages the plugin lifecycle and [[dependency injection]].
*'''Plugin''': an isolated piece of code and associated resources that makes sense by itself or when working together with other plugins.
*'''Capability''': defines what a plugin is able to do, so that it can be matched with other plugins that desire its abilities.
*'''Dependency''': defines that a plugin requires another plugin to function and is worthless without it.
*'''Event''': a message that can be broadcast by a plugin and listened by whichever plugin wants to receive it.
*'''Bundle''': a set of related plugins, intended to operate together.

The plugin lifecycle includes loading and unloading its resources, injecting it into others as a '''capability''' or '''dependency''', as well as having capabilities and/or dependencies injected into it.&lt;ref name="colony-specification-section-1.1."&gt;[http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_colony_specification.html#section-1.1. Plugin lifecycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817050803/http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_colony_specification.html |date=2011-08-17 }} - Section of the specification describing the plugin lifecycle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==

The framework proposes the concept of '''Viral Distribution''' where computation can be transparently distributed to any number of nodes, by having each node run a Colony instance. The concept takes advantage of the modularity approach, by using the plugin as the unit to be transferred between nodes. The concept also requires the availability of tools for rapid discovery of new nodes (e.g. using [[Zeroconf]] techniques such as [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] through Colony Bonjour Plugin).

Viral distribution, as per the Colony interpretation, would mean that a configured Colony instance could make its computing power available to a Colony managed computing grid, by announcing its specifications, after which it would receive work units in the form of plugins, i.e., mobile code for execution on the instance.

To set up a new Colony instance, and enabling viral distribution support, would require an [[Operating System|operating system]], basic Colony dependencies (e.g. a virtual machine for the Colony implementation language of choice) and the framework manager itself (e.g. using the installer).&lt;ref name="how-to-establish"&gt;[http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_how_to_establish_your_colony_in_3_easy_steps.html How to Establish your Colony in 3 Easy Steps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817051313/http://getcolony.com/docs/colony/documentation_how_to_establish_your_colony_in_3_easy_steps.html |date=2011-08-17 }} - Guide describing the setup of the technology&lt;/ref&gt; Adding the basic bundles required for accessing and downloading from a remote plugin repository to the instance would complete the bootstrap. The node would then announce its availability to the Distribution Server Plugin, and could begin receiving and processing work.

==Notable Components==

Colony framework includes a set of application components for various functions, from domain-specific sub-frameworks to providers for common protocols and services.

Notable components include a complete [[web application framework]], based on the [[Model–view–controller|MVC]] architecture pattern, similar to [[Ruby on Rails]] and [[Django (web framework)|Django]].
The web stack is supported by a modular [[HTTP]] server implementation developed from the ground up under the Colony design philosophy. In practice this implies that even core HTTP server components, such as [[File system|filesystem]] access and [[Internet socket|socket]] interfaces, are provided as modules and can be [[Hot swapping|hotswapped]].
The web MVC plugin also uses the modular [[Object-relational mapping|ORM]] entity manager plugin.
For managing [[Distributed computing|distribution]], the distribution manager component acts as a hub for the various distribution plugins that implement's Colony's viral distribution concept.

Among other available components are a [[build automation]] component (functionally comparable to [[Apache Maven|Maven]]); an extensible revision control facade with extensions available for [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]] and [[Mercurial]]; a self-contained [[Wiki]] application, leveraging the [[Revision control]] plugins. For integration with other technologies, Colony provides servers and clients for common protocols such as [[SMTP]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[Post Office Protocol|POP]], [[Telnet]], [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]], [[LDAP]] as well as support for [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] ([[Apple Inc.]]'s implementation of [[Zeroconf]]).
Some niche components are also included, such as clients for the [[Twitter]] API and [[Apple Push Notification Service]].

==Status==

As of 2011, Colony is considered to be in [[Alpha status|alpha]] although production deployments exist.&lt;ref name="colony-status"&gt;[http://getcolony.com/ Official website] - Reference to the current status of Colony as ''early alpha'' as of 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">'''Descriptive research''' is used to describe characteristics of a  [[statistical population|population]] or phenomenon being studied.   It does not answer questions about how/when/why  the characteristics occurred.  Rather it addresses the "what" question (what are the characteristics of the population or situation being studied?)&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarajan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth discussion of descriptive research&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics used to describe the situation or population are usually some kind of categorical scheme also known as descriptive categories. For example, the [[periodic table]] categorizes the elements. Scientists use knowledge about the nature of electrons, protons and neutrons to devise this categorical scheme. We now take for granted the [[periodic table]], yet it took descriptive research to devise it.  Descriptive research generally precedes explanatory research. For example, over time  the periodic table’s description of the elements allowed scientists to explain chemical reaction and make sound prediction when elements were combined.
Hence, descriptive research cannot describe what caused a situation.  Thus, descriptive research cannot be used as the basis of a ''[[Causality|causal relationship]]'', where one variable affects another. In other words, descriptive research can be said to have a low requirement for [[internal validity]].

The description is used for [[frequency (disambiguation)|frequencies]], [[average]]s and other statistical calculations.  Often the best approach, prior to writing descriptive research, is to conduct a survey investigation. [[Qualitative research]] often has the aim of ''description'' and researchers may follow-up with examinations of why the observations exist and what the implications of the findings are.

==Social science research==
In addition, the conceptualizing of descriptive research (categorization or taxonomy) precedes the hypotheses of explanatory research.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and HassanTajalli. 2006. Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship. Journal of Public Affairs Education. Vol. 12, No. 3. Pp. 313-334. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of how the underlying conceptualization of [[Exploratory research]], Descriptive research and explanatory research fit together see [[Conceptual framework]].
Descriptive research is also known as Statistical Research. The main goal of this type of research is to describe the data and characteristics about what is being studied. The idea behind this type of research is to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. Although this research is highly accurate, it does not gather the causes behind a situation. Descriptive research is mainly done when a researcher wants to gain a better understanding of a topic. That is, analysis of the past as opposed to the future. Descriptive research is the exploration of the existing certain phenomena. The details of the facts won't be known. The existing phenomena’s facts are not known to the person.

==Descriptive science==
Descriptive science is a category of [[science]] that involves descriptive research; that is, observing, recording, describing, and classifying [[phenomena]].  Descriptive research is sometimes contrasted with [[Hypothesis testing|hypothesis-driven research]], which is focused on testing a particular [[hypothesis]] by means of [[experimentation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal

[[David Grimaldi (entomologist)|David A. Grimaldi]] and [[Michael S. Engel]] suggest that descriptive science in biology is currently undervalued and misunderstood:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Descriptive" in science is a pejorative, almost always preceded by "merely," and typically applied to the array of classical -ologies and -omies: anatomy, archaeology, astronomy, embryology, morphology, paleontology, taxonomy, botany, cartography, stratigraphy, and the various disciplines of zoology, to name a few. [...] First, an organism, object, or substance is not described in a vacuum, but rather in comparison with other organisms, objects, and substances. [...] Second, descriptive science is not necessarily low-tech science, and high tech is not necessarily better. [...] Finally, a theory is only as good as what it explains and the evidence (i.e., descriptions) that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1641%2FB570802 BioScience Volume 57, Issue 8 (September 2007)] article ''Why Descriptive Science Still Matters'' by D.A. Grimaldi &amp; M.S. Engel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A negative attitude by scientists toward descriptive science is not limited to biological disciplines: [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford's]] [[Ernest rutherford#Famous statements|notorious quote]], "All science is either physics or stamp collecting," displays a clear negative attitude about descriptive science, and it is known that he was dismissive of [[astronomy]], which at the beginning of the 20th century was still gathering largely descriptive data about stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and was only beginning to develop a satisfactory integration of these observations within the framework of [[physical law]], a cornerstone of the [[philosophy of physics]].{{According to whom|date=November 2014}}

==Descriptive versus design sciences==
[[Ilkka Niiniluoto]] has used the terms "descriptive sciences" and "design sciences" as an updated version of the distinction between [[Basic research|basic]] and [[applied science]].  According to Niiniluoto, descriptive sciences are those that seek to describe reality, while design sciences seek useful knowledge for human activities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;[http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/praatika/Valuefreedom%20of%20science.DOC Heikki J. Koskinen et al. (eds.) Science – A Challenge to Philosophy? - Peter Lang GmbH, Frankfurt am Man, 2006.] article ''The scope and limits of value-freedom in science - Panu Raatikainen''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Stowe Higgs''' (born February 7, 1958) is professor in the School of Environmental Studies at the [[University of Victoria]]. Trained in ecology, philosophy, and environmental planning, his work concerns ecological restoration, historical ecology, intervention ecology, and the changing character of life in technological society.

== Early Life and Training==
Eric Higgs was born in Brantford, Ontario, to David P.J. Higgs and Barbara Isabel Stowe. His pre-school years were in North Delta, British Columbia (near Vancouver). He attended public school in Thornhill, Ontario (near Toronto), and secondary school (Brantford Collegiate and Pauline Johnston Secondary School) in Brantford. In 1976 he turned away from what had been a strong early passion for physics and engineering, and attend the Integrated Studies Program at the University of Waterloo. The Integrated Studies Program was student-driven and required self-motivation to complete an open curriculum in a subjects of the student's choosing. He completed an undergraduate thesis, "A theory for the interaction of ecology and the social order," that blended history of ecology with social philosophy and environmental ethics. Immediately upon graduation with a Bachelor of Independent Studies (B.I.S.) in 1979, he took up an internship at the Hastings Centre (Institute for the Study of Ethics, Society and the Life Sciences) in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he undertook a project on environmental and ecological ethics. He completed a master's degree in philosophy of science at the University of Western Ontario (1980–81), and at the same time undertook ecological consulting work in Southern Ontario. He returned to the University of Waterloo to a new interdisciplinary doctoral program, in which he combined studies in the Department of Philosophy and the School of Urban and Regional Planning. Working with co-supervisors, [[Lawrence Haworth]], a social and moral philosopher, and Robert Dorney, an ecologist and environmental planner, Higgs completed his dissertation, "Planning, Technology and Community Autonomy," in 1988.

== Career ==
He is a Professor at the University of Victoria in the School of Environmental Studies.

His first appointment was in the Department of Environment and Resource Studies at the University Waterloo (1987–88). He moved to New York City in 1988 to continue research in philosophy of technology in the Philosophy and Technology Studies Center at the Polytechnic University of New York. Higgs' taught at Oberlin College as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Program in 1989-90, before taking a tenure-stream position in the new Science, Technology and Society Program at the University of Alberta. The demise of this program led to a formal appointment initially in the Department of Philosophy (1990–92), and later a joint appointment in the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology. He was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor in 1995. In 2002, he became Director (2002-2010) and Associate Professor in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, and promoted to Full Professor in 2005.

Higgs has held shorter appointments in Science, Technology and Society (1995), the Maurice Young Centre for Applied Ethics at the University of British Columbia (1996), the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria (2000). He is Professor-at-Large in the Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Western Australia (2012-2014).

==Professional Activities==
Eric Higgs was Chair of the Society for Ecological Restoration International (now Society for Ecological Restoration [http://www.ser.org ser.org]). He served previously as Secretary to the Board from 1995-2001.

== Writings ==
In 2000 he co-edited (with Andrew Light and David Strong) a volume of essays discussing the work of [[Albert Borgmann]] which was described by [[Paul Durbin]] as one of the first volumes that explicitly strives to establish the philosophy of technology as an academic subdiscipline with canonical texts [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v7n1/intro.html].

Higgs' major conceptual contribution to understanding ecological restoration is his 2003 book, ''Nature By Design: People, Natural Process and Ecological Restoration'' (MIT Press).

'''Euthymius the Athonite''' ({{lang-ka|ექვთიმე ათონელი}} ''Ekvtime Atoneli''; {{circa}} 955–1024) was a renowned [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and scholar. His feast day in the Orthodox Church is [[May 13 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|May 13]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gr icon}} ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/3152/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ὅσιος Εὐθύμιος ὁ Ἀθωνίτης κτήτορας τῆς Ι.Μ. Ἰβήρων].'' 13 Μαΐου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euthymius was a Georgian, the ethnonym used by the Byzantines being ''Abasgians''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elguja Xintʻibiże|title=Designations of the Georgians and their etymology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHBpAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Tʻbilisis Universitetis Gamomcʻemloba|isbn=978-5-511-00775-5|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of [[Ioane Varaz-vache Chordvaneli]] and nephew of the great [[Tornike Eristavi]], Euthymius was taken as a political hostage to [[Constantinople]] but was later released and became a monk joining the [[Great Lavra]] of Athanasios on [[Mount Athos]]. He subsequently became the leader of the Georgian [[Iviron monastery]], which had been founded by his father,&lt;ref name="Salia1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kalistrat Salia|title=History of the Georgian nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjAhAQAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=N. Salia|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged as one of the finest [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian]] [[theologians]] and scholars of his age. Fluent in [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and other languages, he translated many religious treatises and philosophical works. Among his major works was the translation of ''sibrdzne balavarisa'' (Wisdom of Balahvari), a Christianized version of episodes from the life of [[Gautama Buddha]] that became very popular in [[Medieval Europe]] as the story of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]]. Of equal importance was Euthymius’ work to prepare Georgian translations of various Greek philosophical, ecclesiastical and legal discourses.

[[File:Fukan Zazengi Tenpuku Copy.JPG|thumb|Copy of the Tenpuku version of Dogen's Fukanzazengi, originally produced in 1233]]
'''''Fukan zazengi''''' ({{CJKV|j=普勧坐禅儀}}), also known by its English translation '''''Universal Recommendation for Zazen''''', is an essay describing and promoting the practice of [[zazen]] written by the 13th century Japanese [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. The date of its composition is unclear, and the text evolved significantly over the author's lifetime.

It is traditionally thought to have been composed in 1227, shortly after Dōgen's return to Japan from his years of study in China. This is based on a statement to that effect in his essay [[Bendōwa]] from 1231. However, a manuscript of ''Fukan zazengi'' discovered in modern times that was produced by Dōgen's own hand ends with a [[Colophon (publishing)]] stating it was written in 1233. This version, known as the Tenpuku manuscript, also has a number of major differences from the more widely known version, the "vulgate version". The vulgate version, which is included in the [[Eihei Kōroku]], likely has an even later date. Carl Bielefeldt, a scholar of Dōgen's work, believes it could not have been composed before 1242 based on similarities with the [[Shōbōgenzō]] book ''[[Zazen shin]]'', which was composed in that year. There is also a Shōbōgenzō book entitled [[Zazen gi]], composed sometime between 1243 and 1246, that appears to draw material from the vulgate ''Fukan zazengi'' and thus suggesting it would not have been written afterwards. Regardless of the exact date of its first composition, it is clear the material went through many rounds of editing over the author's lifetime.&lt;ref name=manuals&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520068353|year=1988|pages=15–17, 39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the section describing the actual practice of zazen is copied from the ''Zuochan yi'', a meditation manual written by [[Changlu Zongze]] in the early 12th century.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{citation|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|pages=307|isbn=9780691157863|publisher=Princeton University Press|place=Princeton|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gila Sher''' is a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. She has worked extensively in the theory of [[truth]] and [[philosophy of logic]]. Sher is a leading advocate of foundational [[holism]], a holistic theory of [[epistemology]].

==Career==
Sher earned a [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy from [[Columbia University]], where she studied the works of [[Willard Quine]] and [[Alfred Tarski]].  Her dissertation was directed by [[Charles Parsons (philosopher)|Charles Parsons]]. Her early work focused on Tarski's definition of truth. Her reformulation of this definition has been influential in modern truth theory. Her [[dissertation]] was expanded into the book ''The Bounds of Logic'' (1991),&lt;ref name="Sher, Gila 1991"&gt;Sher, Gila. (1991), ''The Bounds of Logic'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Sher also formalized definitions for unique second-order quantifiers such as 'most'.&lt;ref name="Sher, Gila 1991"/&gt;

Sher has pursued research into [[logical positivism]] and logical [[foundationalism]]. She has argued that strict-ordering Foundationalism, in the vein of [[Rudolf Carnap]], is untenable, supporting Quine's argument from ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]''. She has, however, resisted the mainstream move toward all-or-nothing and semantic holism. The former view she considers unexplanatory, and the latter she considers untenable (see: [[Jerry Fodor]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sher, Gila. (2004), ''In Search of a Substantive Theory of Truth'', The Journal of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

Sher has also written more generally on the [[metaphysics]] of truth. She put forward an influential criticism of [[John Etchemendy]] in the article "Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?"&lt;ref&gt;Sher, Gila. (1996), ''Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?'', The Journal of Symbolic Logic 61, 653-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This article was influential in defending Tarskian truth theory from the radical attack posed by Etchemendy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Gonsalvus Hispanus''' ({{circa}} 1255 – 1313) was a Spanish [[Franciscan]] theologian and [[scholastic philosopher]], who became [[Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor]].

He was born at [[Lugo, Spain|Lugo]]. He taught at the [[University of Paris]], where he carried out a disputation with [[Meister Eckhart]] in 1303.&lt;ref name=cambridge&gt;{{cite book|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805216/32058/sample/9780521632058ws.pdf|title=The Cambridge Companion to Duns Scotus|editor=Thomas Williams|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0521635632}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} He was expelled from Paris as a papal supporter, in the dispute with [[Philip IV of France]].&lt;ref name=cambridge /&gt;{{rp|5}} He came across the younger [[Duns Scotus]] and supported him, appointing him [[regent master]] of the Franciscans there in 1304.&lt;ref name=cambridge /&gt;{{rp|2,5}}

==Dispute with Meister Eckhart==
The origin of Gonsalvus's dispute with Eckhart has to do with the relative superiority of the will to that of the intellect in knowing God.  Gonsalvus held that the will was superior since, through it, God is known as he actually is whereas the intellect only knows the image of God in the mind.  Eckhart believed that the intellect was superior to the will in this regard since through it, God can be known without any of the human qualities with which the will invests its image of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Parisian Questions and Prologues|author=Meister Eckhart|editor=Armand A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">According to the '''growing block universe theory of time''' (or the '''growing block view'''), the past and present exist and the future does not exist. The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of [[spacetime]], where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.

The growing block view is an alternative to both [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to [[common sense|common-sense]] intuitions than the alternatives. [[C. D. Broad]] was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are [[Michael Tooley]] (in 1997) and [[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] (in 2004).

==Criticism==
Recently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and [[Trenton Merricks]] have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of "now" is an [[indexical]] and the second occurrence of "now" is the [[objective tensed property]]. Their observation implies the following sentence: "This part of spacetime has the property of being present".)

Take [[Socrates]] discussing, in the past, with [[Gorgias]], and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, [[Grammatical tense|tense]] is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being.  But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.

However, some{{who|date=October 2017}} have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.

'''Gunnar Aspelin''' (23 September 1898, in [[Simrishamn Municipality|Södra Mellby]], [[Kristianstads län]] &amp;ndash; 29 August 1977), was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] at [[Lund University]] in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="r"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/vemardet/1957/0072.html ''Vem är det'', 1957.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Aspelin was the son of the artist [[Karl Aspelin]] (1857–1932) and his wife Ellen Bergh. Prof. Aspelin married in 1923 with Dagmar Scherstén, daughter of the physician Frithiof Scherstén and Ida Schröder. Prof. Aspelin was the father of Herbert Aspelin, the researcher in [[comparative literature]] [[Kurt Aspelin]], the lawspeaker Erland Aspelin, the teacher Marianne Aspelin and the artist [[Gert Aspelin]].&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

Prof. Aspelin received his doctorate at [[Lund University]] in 1925 on the dissertation ''Hegels praktiska filosofi under åren 1800-1803'' ("The practical philosophy of [[Hegel]] during the years 1800-1803"). The same year Prof. Aspelin became a [[docent]] in [[Practical philosophy|Practical Philosophy]] at [[Lund University]]. In his dissertation, as well as in following works, he had a [[marxist]] view of history.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

In 1936 he was named a Professor at the [[University of Gothenburg]], and in 1949 he became a Professor in [[Theoretical philosophy|Theoretical Philosophy]] at [[Lund University]]. In 1953 he co-founded the [[Hans Larsson Society]], and was its first [[Chair (academic)|chair]]. In 1968 Prof. Aspelin published his [[memoirs]] ''Lek och allvar'' ("Play and seriousness").&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

A common thread in Prof. Aspelin's research was the relationship between the individual and the collective. He primarily focused on the philosophers [[Hans Larsson]], [[John Locke]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Hegel]], [[Bertrand Russel]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]]. During his later years he became interest in the ideas of the [[medieval]] age, and also conducted research in the fields of [[history of ideas]] and [[sociology]]. In 1958 he published the work ''Tankens vägar'' ("The paths of thought"), which is a survey of the history of philosophy in Europe.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

[[Image:Ubuntumobile.jpg|right|thumb|Hildon in [[Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition]]]]

'''Hildon''' is an [[application framework]] originally developed for mobile devices ([[PDA]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, etc.) running the [[Linux]] [[operating system]] as well as the [[Symbian]] [[operating system]].  The Symbian variant of Hildon was discontinued with the cancellation of [[Series 90 (software platform)|Series 90]]. It was developed by [[Nokia]] for the [[Maemo]] operating system and is now a part of [[GNOME]].  It focuses on providing a finger-friendly interface.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/06/14/nokia-pushes-hildon-upstream Nokia Pushes Hildon Upstream]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily a set of [[GTK+]] extensions that provide mobile-device–oriented functionality, but also provides a [[desktop environment]] that includes a task navigator for opening and switching between programs, a control panel for user settings, and status bar, task bar and home applets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/maemo_release_documentation/maemo4.1.x/node6.html#SECTION00624000000000000000 Maemo Diablo 4.1 release documentation] - 5.2.4 Hildon Framework&lt;/ref&gt; It is standard on the [[Maemo]] platform used by the [[Nokia Internet Tablet]]s and the [[Nokia N900]] [[smartphone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/development/documentation/tutorials/Maemo_tutorial_bora.html maemo Tutorial Bora] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421144531/http://maemo.org/development/documentation/tutorials/Maemo_tutorial_bora.html |date=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildon has also been selected as the framework for [[Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileAndEmbedded/HildonDesktopManualProcedure Hildon Desktop Manual Procedure]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildon was an early instance of a [[software platform]] for generic computing in a tablet device intended for internet consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/nokia_hildon_the_great_lost_platform/|title=Nokia's Great Lost Platform
|author=Andrew Orlowski|publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Nokia didn't commit to it as their only platform for their future mobile devices and the project competed against other in-house platforms. The strategic advantage of a modern platform was not exploited, being displaced by the [[Series 60]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/nokia_hildon_the_great_lost_platform/page4.html|title=Nokia's Great Lost Platform - Page 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asus_flo_hildon.jpg|thumb|Hildon running in [[postmarketOS]]]]
== Components ==
The Hildon framework includes components that effectively provide a [[desktop environment]].

=== Hildon Application Manager ===
Hildon Application Manager is the Hildon graphical package manager, it uses the [[Debian]] package management tools APT ([[Advanced Packaging Tool]] and [[dpkg]]) and provides a graphical interface for installing, updating and removing packages. It is a limited package manager, designed specifically for end-users, in that it doesn't directly offer the user access to system files and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hildon-app-mgr.garage.maemo.org/index.html Hildon Application Manager] - Overview&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Internet Tablet OS#Diablo|Diablo release]] of Maemo, Hildon Application Manager now supports "Seamless Software Update" (SSU), which implements a variety of features to allow system upgrades to be easily performed through it.

=== Hildon Control Panel ===
Hildon Control Panel is the user settings interface for Hildon. It provides simple access to control panels used to change system settings.

=== Hildon Desktop ===
Hildon Desktop is the primary UI component of Hildon, so makes up the bulk of what a user will see as "Hildon". It controls application launching and switching, general system control, and provides interfaces for task bar (application menu and task switcher), status bar (brightness and volume control), and home (internet radio and web search) applets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umeguide.net/C/hildondesktop.html Ubuntu Documentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606085304/http://umeguide.net/C/hildondesktop.html |date=2008-06-06 }} - Hildon Desktop&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hildon Library ===
The Hildon library, originally developed by [[Nokia]] but since Maemo 5, developed by [[Igalia]] and [[Lanedo]] (who developed [https://web.archive.org/web/20120307124516/http://live.gnome.org/Maemo/ MaemoGTK+], the Maemo version of [[GTK+]]). It is a set of mobile specific GTK+ widgets for applications in Maemo. Up to Maemo 4, these widgets were designed for stylus usage. However, in Maemo 5, most widgets were deprecated and new widgets for direct finger manipulation were introduced, including a kinetic panning container.

The '''internal affairs doctrine''' is a [[choice of law]] rule in [[corporations law]].  Simply stated, it provides that the "internal affairs" of a [[corporation]] (e.g. conflicts between [[shareholder]]s and [[management]] figures such as the [[board of directors]] and [[corporate officer]]s) will be governed by the corporate [[statute]]s and [[case law]] of the state in which the corporation is [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], sometimes referred to as the '''''lex incorporationis'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Edgar v. MITE Corp.'', 457 U.S. 624, 645 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''McDermott Inc. v. Lewis'', 531 A.2d 206 (Del. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical effects of the doctrine==
The internal affairs doctrine ensures that such issues as voting rights of shareholders, distributions of [[dividend]]s and corporate [[property]], and the [[fiduciary]] obligations of management are all determined in accordance with the law of the state in which the company is incorporated.  On the other hand, the "external affairs" of a corporation, such as [[labor law|labor and employment]] issues and [[Tax law|tax liability]], are typically governed by the law of the state in which the corporation is doing business. Some issues and activities, such as [[contract]]s, [[mergers and acquisitions]], and sales of [[Security (finance)|securities]] to third parties, may be governed both by the laws of the state of incorporation and by the laws of the state in which the transaction takes place, and in some cases, by [[federal law]] as well (for example, [[United States securities law]] and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]).

==Relation to federalism==
{{see also|Federalism in the United States}}

In the [[United States]], each [[U.S. state|state]] has the power to set its own corporate law.  Because of this, and the fact that the internal affairs doctrine has been used by courts to allow application of the ''lex incorporationis'', this has created a competitive market for incorporations among the states.  Several states have taken advantage of this situation by becoming [[corporate haven]]s, particularly [[Delaware]] and [[Nevada]].  Likewise, many jurisdictions apply the internal affairs doctrine internationally, which has permitted [[offshore financial centre]]s to flourish.

'''Josephine Gatt Ciancio''' (born 1946) is a Maltese [[social scientist]], and minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy she is mostly interested in [[Possible worlds#Possible-world theory in literary studies|Possible-world theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Gatt Ciancio was born at [[Msida]], Malta, in 1946. She studied at the [[University of Malta]], from who acquired a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Maltese Language]], [[English Language]], and [[Mediterranean]] Studies (1973). She also studied at the [[Pacific Western University]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, United States. From here she acquired a [[Master’s degree]] in [[Science]] with a major in [[Neuroscience]]. She also conducted studies in [[Social Democracy]] and [[Political Economy]]. In 1967 Gatt Ciancio began teaching in [[Malta]] at a primary level, and in 1969 proceeded to teach on a secondary level (till 1975). Later she taught at the sixth level of education (1976). Somewhat active in [[party politics]] with the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] in [[Malta]], in 1989 she edited the pages reserved for the political affairs of women in weekly paper of the [[General Workers' Union (Malta)|General Workers Union]], ''It-Torca'' (under the pseudonym ‘Anna’). Between 1991 and 1993 she was Co-ordinator of the [[Adult Education]] programme of the [[Guzè Ellul Mercer]] Foundation.

==Works==
Though the published works of Gatt Ciancio are few, together with philosophical argumentation they might be considered as explorations into what might be possible and even beyond. Her main interests in her works are of a social and political nature, very often connecting to the concept of an undivided world with no frontiers. Her main publications are the following:

* 1977 - '''''Power to the Man in the Street'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, pp. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; A 62-page book published in [[Malta]], which, in its speculative projection, is quite ambitious, for not only does it uphold a political theory but furthermore proposes an interesting political programme. Essentially, Gatt Ciancio puts forward the possibility of future world unity based on the emancipation of so-called 'superdwarf' humans. This will create a peaceful, fraternal and laborious people. This type of human being will be motivated to improve humankind's cultural levels for pure intellectual pleasure. The 'superdwarf' people will prolong life, perhaps even through a form of 'materialistic immortality'.
* 1992 - '''''Tomorrow We Shall Be Here'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. II, pp. 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; A 94-page book published in Malta which is basically a novel. In it Gatt Ciancio imagines a future world in which, though advanced socially and technologically, is still plagued with party revelry, [[corruption]] and political [[religion]]. Through difficult situations, [[hope]] is found in [[education]], especially through [[communication]].

[[image:Nanyang_Huizhong.jpg|thumb|right|The "National Teacher", [[Nanyang Huizhong]], whose saying provides much of the inspiration for Dōgen's ''Kobutsushin'']]
'''''Kobutsushin''''' or '''''Kobusshin''''' ({{CJKV|j=古佛心}}), also known in various English translations such as '''''The Mind of Eternal Buddhas''''' or '''''Old Buddha Mind''''', is a book of the [[Shōbōgenzō]] by the 13th century [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. The book appears ninth in the 75 fascicle version of the [[Shōbōgenzō]], and it is ordered 44th in the later chronological 95 fascicle "''Honzan'' edition".&lt;ref name=textual&gt;{{citation|last=Heine|first=Steven|title=Dōgen: Textual and Historical Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|pages=27, 39|isbn=978-0-19-975447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented to his students in the fourth month of 1243 at Rokuharamitsu-ji, a temple in a neighborhood of eastern [[Kyoto]] populated primarily by military officials of the new [[Kamakura shogunate]]. This was the same location where he presented another book of the same collection called [[Zenki (Shōbōgenzō)|Zenki]]. Both were short works compared to others in the collection, and in both cases he was likely invited to present them at the behest of his main patron, [[Hatano Yoshishige]], who lived nearby. Later in the same year, Dōgen suddenly abandoned his temple [[Kōshōhōrin-ji]] in Kyoto and began to establish [[Eihei-ji]].&lt;ref name=bielefeldt&gt;{{citation|last=Bielefeldt|first=Carl|title=Kobutsushin: Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Sotoshu Shumucho|url=http://stanford.edu/group/scbs/sztp3/translations/shobogenzo/translations/kobutsushin/kobutsushin.intro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the text stakes out a novel interpretation of the meaning of the term ''Kobutsu'' (古佛), literally meaning "Old Buddha". While typically the term had been used to refer to the [[List of the named Buddhas#The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity|Seven Buddhas of Antiquity]], Dōgen uses it to refer to all of those before him who have passed on the Zen tradition. More specifically, Dōgen denies the duality of the buddhas of the ancient past and the practitioners of the more recent past and present.&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt; He then supports this usage by citing examples from Zen records of the past teachers [[Rujing|Tiantong Rujing]], [[Yuanwu Keqin]], [[Sushan Guangren]],
and [[Xuefeng Yicun]].&lt;ref name=Gudo&gt;{{Citation| last1 =Nishijima|first1=Gudo|last2=Cross|first2=Chodo|authorlink1=Gudo Nishijima|year = 2008| title = Master Dogen's Shōbōgenzō| volume=3|pages=29, 38|publisher = Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research| isbn=978-1-886439-37-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second half of the text focuses on the full term used as the title of the book, ''Kobutushin'' (古佛心), literally "Old Buddha Mind". He does so through the presentation of a famous saying from [[Nanyang Huizhong]], the so-called "National Teacher", who said the old buddha mind is nothing other than "fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles", which is to say everyday reality and the phenomena that comprise it. Dōgen then engages in his characteristic wordplay by rearranging the characters of the term, speaking of "old Buddha", "old mind", and even the strange expression "Buddha old". To conclude, he cites [[Jianyuan Zhongxing]], who said that "old buddha mind" is the same as "the world collapses in ruins", before finally putting this phrase in his own terms, writing that the old buddha mind must be "sloughed off" to really know the old buddha mind. He also reiterates that the old buddha mind extends to times both before and after the [[List of the named Buddhas#The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity|Seven Buddhas of Antiquity]].&lt;ref name=bielefeldt/&gt;

{{Confucianism}}
'''Li''' ({{zh|p=lǐ|t=禮|s=礼}}) is a classical Chinese word which is commonly used in [[Chinese philosophy]], particularly within [[Confucianism]].  ''Li'' does not encompass a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea and, as such, is translated in a number of different ways. [[Wing-tsit Chan]] explains that ''li'' originally meant "a religious sacrifice," but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with [[Natural law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chan|first=Wing-tsit|title= A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy|publisher= Princeton University Press |date= 1963|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chinese [[cosmology]], human agency participates in the ordering of the universe by Li ('rites'). There are several Chinese definitions of a rite, one of the most common definitions is that it transforms the invisible to visible; through the performance of rites at appropriate occasions, humans make visible the underlying order. Performing the correct ritual focuses, links, orders, and moves the social, which is the human realm, in correspondence with the terrestrial and celestial realms to keep all three in harmony. This procedure has been described as centering, which used to be the duty of the Son of Tian, the emperor. But it was also done by all those who conducted state, ancestral, and life-cycle rites and, in another way, by [[Daoists]] who conducted the rites of local gods as a centering of the forces of exemplary history, of liturgical service, of the correct conduct of human relations, and of the arts of divination such as the earliest of all Chinese classics—the ''[[Book Of Changes|Book of Changes]]'' (''Yi Jing'')—joining textual learning to bodily practices for health and the harmonized enhancement of circuits of energy (qi).  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9780415858816|location=New York|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The rites of ''li'' are not rites in the Western conception of religious custom. Rather, ''li'' embodies the entire spectrum of interaction with humans, nature, and even material objects. Confucius includes in his discussions of ''li'' such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] cites "songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|translator-last=Watson|translator-first=Burton|title= Basic Writings of Mo Tzu, Hsun Tzu, and Han Fei Tzu|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=1967|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; as vital parts of the fabric of ''li''.

==Approaches to ''Li''==
Among the earliest historical discussions on ''li'' stands the 25th year of Zhao Gong ({{cjkv|p=zhāo gōng|t=昭公|s=昭公}}) in the [[Zuo Zhuan]].

''Li'' consists of the norms of proper social behavior as taught to others by fathers, village elders and government officials. The teachings of li promoted ideals such as [[filial piety]], brotherliness, [[righteousness]], good faith and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Arthur F.|last1=Wright|first2=Dennis|last2=Twitchett|title= Confucian Personalities|date=1962|publisher= Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ''li'' guided public expectations, such as the loyalty to superiors and [[respect]] for elders in the community.

Continuous with the emphasis on community, following ''li'' included the internalization of action, which both yields the comforting feeling of tradition and allows one to become "more open to the panoply of sensations of the experience" (Rosemont 2005). But it should also maintain a healthy practice of selflessness, both in the actions themselves and in the proper example which is set for one's brothers. Approaches in the community, as well as personal approaches together demonstrate how ''li'' pervades in all things, the broad and the detailed, the good and the bad, the form and the formlessness. This is the complete realization of ''li''.

The rituals and practices of ''li'' are dynamic in nature. ''Li'' practices have been revised and evaluated throughout time to reflect the emerging views and beliefs found in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Asia/AsiaWong.htm|last=Wong|first=Yew Leong|title=''Li'' and Change|date= August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these practices may change, which happens very slowly over time, the fundamental ideals remain at the core of ''li'', which largely relate to social order.

==''Li'' in Government==
Confucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of ''li''. Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of  human beings with learning Li as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on ''li'' and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.

Confucius stressed the importance of the rites as fundamental to proper governmental leadership. In his sayings, Confucius regarded feudal lords in China that adopted the Chinese rites as being just rulers of the Central States. Contrarily, feudal lords that did not adopt these rites were considered uncivilized, not worthy of being considered Chinese or part of the Central States (Spring and Autumn Annals).

''Li'' should be practiced by all members of the society. ''Li'' also involves the superior treating the inferior with propriety and respect. As Confucius said "a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety (Li); ministers should serve their prince with loyalty" (Analects, 3:19).

==In quotations==

''Li'' is "one term by which the [traditional Chinese] historiographers could name all the principles of conservatism they advanced in the speeches of their characters." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Schaberg |first= David |title= A Patterned Past: Form and Thought in Early Chinese Historiography|publisher= Harvard University Press |date= 2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical necessity''' is a [[United States]] [[legal doctrine]], related to activities which may be justified as reasonable, necessary, and/or appropriate, based on [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] clinical [[standard of care|standards of care]]. Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term '''clinical medical necessity''' is also used. In contrast, [[unnecessary health care]] lacks such justification.

== Implementations of the 'medical necessity' doctrines ==

=== Medicare ===

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pays for medical items and services that are "reasonable and necessary" for a variety of purposes. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are "reasonable and necessary"for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 42 U.S.C. &amp;sect; [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1862.htm 1395y(a)(1)(A)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicare has a number of policies, including [[National coverage determination]]s (NCDs) and [[Local Coverage Determination]]s (LCDs), formerly known as Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP), that describe coverage criteria.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://www.cms.hhs.gov/mcd/overview.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In a small number of cases, Medicare may determine if a method of treating a patient should be covered on a case-by-case basis. Even if a service is medically determined to be "reasonable and necessary," coverage may be limited if the service is provided more frequently than allowed under Medicare coverage policies.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [[Certificate of medical necessity]], [http://medicarelaw.info/wiki/Reasonable_and_Necessary]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, or [http://www.gotelecare.com/medical-billing].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific instances==

===Medical use of marijuana===
{{main|Medical cannabis}}
The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also known as marijuana) for medical purposes is a notable 'medical necessity' case. Cannabis is a plant whose active ingredients are widely reported by sufferers to be effective in pain control for various conditions, usually [[neuropathic]] in nature, where common painkillers have not had great benefit; however as a [[scheduled drug|Schedule I drug]] under the [[Controlled Substance Act]], it is illegal and is targeted by government, police, and anti-drug campaigners: in some states, possession is decriminalized for even non-medical purposes, wherein other states possession is a felony offense. In this case the doctrine of medical necessity would be used by a patient who believed marijuana was beneficial to them if charged with use or growing/production of illegal controlled substance relating to marijuana.

In several medical marijuana cases, the patients' physician has been willing to state to the court that the patient's condition requires this medicine and thus that the Court should not interfere. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of United States has outrightly rejected this defense in the landmark case ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'', in which the Court ruled that there was no medical necessity exception to drug laws, and federal government is free to [[Police raid|raid]], [[arrest]], [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who are using medical marijuana no matter if the medicine is crucially necessary to them. On the other hand, in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals told a sufferer in extreme pain that they could not rely on state law allowing medical use, but if arrested they could seek to use medical necessity as a defence.

In the state of [[Maryland]], a bill signed by former governor [[Robert Ehrlich]], became law in 2003 permitting patients to use medical necessity defense to marijuana possession in the state. The maximum penalty for these users cannot exceed $100. However, this law does not prevent federal prosecution of patients, as the federal law does not recognize medical necessity.

He served as the Director of Quaid-e-Azam Academy for six years and was the President of [[Progressive Writers Association]] in 2013 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/491917/transitions-muhammad-ali-siddiqui-literary-critic-is-no-more/ Transitions: Muhammad Ali Siddiqui, literary critic, is no more] The Express Tribune (newspaper), Published 10 Jan 2013, Retrieved 23 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Siddiqui had penned more than 100 research articles. He has 16 books to his credit, two of them ''Tawazun'' and ''Croce ki Sarguzasht'', were adjudged as the 'Best Books of the Years' in 1976 and 1979 respectively. He used to write for the business journal [[Business Recorder]] and he wrote a  column for the [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper under the pen name '''Ariel''' for over two decades.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3027838331/obituary-dr-muhammad-ali-siddiqui Obituary: Muhammad Ali Siddiqui (Pakistan Historical Society article excerpt on questia.com website)] Retrieved 23 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

He had delivered lectures in many overseas universities such as the School of Oriental &amp; American Studies [[London University]], [[Carlton University]], Canada, the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, [[Oslo University]], [[Norway]].

His importance as a critic has been applauded by the critics of [[Urdu language|Urdu]] language like [[Majnun Gorakhpuri]],  [[Akhtar Hussain Raipuri]], Professor Mumtaz Husain, Professor Mujtaba Husain, Dr. Ali Jawwad Zaidi, Dr. [[Wazir Agha]] etc. Among the creative writers, [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] regarded him as the only creative critic from Pakistan, the others being Dr. Narang, Dr. Zoe Ansari &amp; Dr. Qamar Rais from [[India]].

Journalist [[Khalid Ahmed]] wrote:

{{quotation|1=Most people think Muzaffar Ali Syed was the most learned man in Pakistan. Among the living, Muhammad Ali Siddiqui or Ariel of Dawn is undoubtedly the most learned man. He holds his own compared with the late Syed who created waves more often by being controversial. Not that Siddiqui is non-controversial. His assessments of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Allama Iqbal have been heretical but have escaped attention because his scholarship is unassailable and we generally don't like reading controversial things if they are deeply scholarly. If you can't face a critic, ignore him."

The '''Médaille de la Famille française''' ({{lang-en|Medal of the French Family}}) is a [[award|decoration]] awarded by the [[government]] of [[France]] to honour those who have successfully raised several [[child]]ren with dignity.{{huh|date=September 2017}}

==History==
The decoration was created by a [[decree]] of May 26, 1920, under the name Médaille d'honneur de la famille française (''Medal of Honour of the French Family'') with the aim of honouring [[mother]]s of large [[families]]. The text of the decree underwent several changes before being completely reformed by a decree of October 28, 1982, which renamed the decoration Médaille de la Famille française (''Medal of the French Family''). This decree came into force on January 1, 1983, and was completed by an ''arrêté'' (administrative order) of March 15, 1983. The reform opened the award of the decoration to [[father]]s or anyone else who had raised several children in an appropriate way: for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] Père Mayotte, [[curate]] of the [[parish]] of [[Randan, Puy-de-Dôme]] was granted the award in recognition of his raising the six children of his [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], a [[widow]] who died suddenly.

==Decoration==
Three classes of medal exist: [[bronze]] for those raising four or five children, [[silver]] for parents of six or seven children, and [[gold]] for those with eight or more children. A bronze medal is also granted to widowed mothers of three children whose husbands have been killed in action. The recipient's eldest child must be at least sixteen years old. The medal is decorated with the words "Famille Française" ("French Family") and a modernistic image of a [[wikt:couple|couple]] and their children. The words "République Française" ("French Republic") are inscribed on the reverse side. The [[ribbon]] is divided vertically into three equal parts, the outer two being red and the inner green. Recipients of silver and gold medals are also granted a [[Rosette (decoration)|rosette]] in the same colours.

==Conditions==
Recommendations or applications for the award must be deposited at the local [[town hall]]. An enquiry into the family is then conducted. If the enquiry reports positively, the final decision on whether to grant the award belongs to the [[prefect (France)|prefect]] of the [[department (France)|department]]. While the award has always been open to mothers raising families alone, and to other [[single parent]]s and [[legal guardian]]s since the 1982 reforms, this applies only in cases of widowhood or [[Abandonment (legal)#Abandonment_of_family|abandonment]]: the medal is only granted to [[divorce]]d parents in the most exceptional circumstances. The medal may be awarded [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly, provided that the application is made within two years of the recipient's death.

'''Patricia Kitcher''' (born 1948) is the Roberta and William Campbell Professor of Philosophy at [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Kitcher|url=http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/patricia-kitcher|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  widely known for her work on [[Immanuel Kant]] and on [[philosophy of psychology]].

==Biography==
Born Patricia Williams, she attended [[Wellesley College]] and then graduate school in philosophy at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] where she studied with [[George Pitcher]]. Kitcher has held faculty positions at the [[University of Vermont]], the [[University of Minnesota]], and [[University of California]], [[San Diego]], and a visiting position at [[University of Michigan]]. In 1998 she went to [[Columbia University]] where she became the Mark van Doren Professor of the Humanities and chair of the philosophy department. She lives in [[New York City]] with her husband, [[Philip Kitcher]], also a philosopher, with whom she has two sons, Andrew and Charles.

==Career==
Kitcher's interest in cognition manifested early and has continued to shape and inform her work throughout her career. Her doctoral dissertation defended a psychological continuity criterion for personal identity but extended the scope of the psychological criterion beyond that traditionally posited to include broader and more abstract cognitive characteristics, such as cognitive approach or cognitive style. Since then her work has ranged widely from traditional philosophy of psychology, to [[Sigmund Freud]], and ultimately to her greatest philosophical passion: Kant scholarship.

In her early work Kitcher wrote a number of papers in [[philosophy of psychology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[philosophy of science]]. She argued for the viability of intentional psychology and the autonomy of functionalist psychology from [[neurophysiology]]. Later work predominantly concentrated on analysis of problems stemming from the interpretation of Kant's first Critique. Kitcher has written numerous articles on the forms of intuition, Kant's epistemology, [[self-consciousness]], and on how transcendental arguments work.
Kitcher has written two books that also pursue psychological themes. ''Kant's Transcendental Psychology'' was a radical departure from most Kant exegesis. The book makes two main claims about the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. First, contra [[Peter Frederick Strawson]], Kitcher argues that to understand synthetic a priori knowledge, it is essential to consider transcendental psychology. Second, she explicates a Kantian argument for the necessity of an integrated thinking subject, which serves as a reply to [[David Hume]]'s denial of the unity of the self.

''Kant's Thinker'' (2011), was called "an ambitious and challenging work" by [[Paul Guyer]] in the ''[[European Journal of Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guyer|first=Paul|date=2013-09-01|year=|title=A Declaration of Interdependence Kant's Thinker, by A1  - Patricia Kitcher . New York: PB  - Oxford University Press, 2011, xiv + 312 pp. ISBN 978-0-19-975482-3|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejop.12043/abstract|journal=European Journal of Philosophy|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=495–505|doi=10.1111/ejop.12043|issn=1468-0378|subscription=yes|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, she continues work on "a central theme of her earlier work: how to understand Kant's view of the unity of self-consciousness in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Colin|date=2011-12-01|year=|title=Kant's Thinker|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09608788.2011.624727|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|volume=19|issue=6|pages=1226–1229|doi=10.1080/09608788.2011.624727|issn=0960-8788|subscription=yes|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Freud's Dream'' Kitcher argued that Freud was the first cognitive scientist: [[Psychoanalysis]] should be thought of as an exercise in interdisciplinary theory construction, and as such, it illuminates the pitfalls to which such interdisciplinary approaches are subject. (Kitcher jokes that her arguments managed to alienate all readers: Freudians, because she exposes the mistaken foundation of psychoanalysis, and anti-Freudians, because she portrays his program as scientifically legitimate.)

Around the turn of the new century, Kitcher's interests turned toward Kantian [[ethics]]. Her works from this period provide an account of Kantian maxims and an interpretation of Kant's argument for the Formulation of the Universal Law for the Categorical Imperative, a task that has led many other Kant experts to throw up their hands in perplexity.

Kitcher's published contributions to philosophy are matched by her contributions to the philosophical community. She has served as department chair in three different universities, on numerous academic committees (including being a founding chair of the UC committee on the status of women), as president of the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]], as president of the North American Kant Society, and on the editorial board of [[Journal of Philosophy]]. Her philosophical integrity, her fiery lectures, and her incisive comments on student papers make her an inspiring teacher and mentor.

'''Peter Lipton''' (October 9, 1954 &amp;ndash; November 25, 2007) was the [[Hans Rausing]] [[Professor]] and Head of the Department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] at [[Cambridge University]], and a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], until his unexpected death in November 2007. According to his obituary on the Cambridge web site, he was "recognized as one of the leading [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[epistemology|epistemologists]] in the world."

==Career==
Lipton was an undergraduate at [[Wesleyan University]] and a graduate student at [[Oxford University]]. Before coming to Cambridge, he taught at [[Clark University]] and [[Williams College]]. He was a member of the [[Nuffield Council]] on [[Bioethics]] and chaired the working party that produced ''Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues''. He was also on the [[AskPhilosophers]] panel. In 2004, Lipton had the honour of being the [[Medawar Prize Lecturer]] of the [[Royal Society]].

Lipton's research interests focused on the philosophy of science, including topics such as [[explanation]], [[inference]], [[Test method|testing]], [[theory change]], [[Physical law|laws of nature]], and [[scientific realism]]. Lipton's research in philosophy of science led him to do work in other related areas of philosophy; in [[epistemology]], Lipton also investigated the philosophy of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Testimony, philosophical problems of|testimony]]. Likewise in [[philosophy of mind]] Lipton researched notions of [[mental content]] and the [[mind-body problem]].

He was a member of the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] (2003–2007).

==Personal life==
Lipton lived with his wife Diana and two sons Jonah and Jacob. He was a self-confessed "religious atheist"; he held that he could follow the customs and culture of a Jewish lifestyle, and use the teachings of [[Judaism]] to help him tackle moral problems in life, without simultaneously believing in the [[metaphysics]] of such a religion (such as the existence of [[God]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/02/03/DI2006020301423.html |title=Post Magazine: Darwin v. God |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216140743/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/02/03/DI2006020301423.html |archivedate=2017-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2007, Lipton suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] after playing a game of [[Squash (sport)|squash]].  He was succeeded in his capacity as Head of Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the [[University of Cambridge]] by Professor [[John Forrester (historian of philosophy and science)|John Forrester]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19812">'''Philosophy in Malta''' refers to the philosophy of Maltese nationals or those of Maltese descent, whether living in [[Malta]] or abroad, whether writing in their native [[Maltese language]] or in a foreign language. Though [[Malta]] is not more than a tiny [[Europe]]an island in the middle of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], for the last six centuries its very small population happened to come in close contact with some of [[Europe]]’s main [[political]], [[academic]] and [[intellectual]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;H. Frendo, ‘National identity’, ''Malta: Culture and Identity'', ed. by H. Frendo and O. Friggieri, Ministry of Youth and the Arts, Malta, 1994, pp. 2–5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philosophy]] was among the interests fostered by its [[Academia|academics]] and [[intellectual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cassola, ''The Literature of Malta: An example of unity in diversity'', European Commission, Minima, Malta, 2000, pp. vii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Rispoli 1609 thesis.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of [[John Matthew Rispoli|Rispoli]]'s 1609 ''magnum opus'']]

For the greater part of its history, in Malta [[philosophy]] was simply studied as part of a basic institutional programme which mainly prepared candidates to become [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]], [[lawyers]] or [[physicians]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Cassar Pullicino, ‘The re-opening of the university in 1800’, ''Journal of the Faculty of Arts'', Malta, 1958, 2, pp. 144–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the latter part of the 20th century that [[philosophy]] began to acquire an ever-growing importance of its own.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friggieri, 'Letter from Malta', The Philosophers' Magazine (England), 55, 4th quarter, 2011, pp. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, throughout the years a few [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[Academia|academics]] and [[intellectual]]s have stood out for their philosophical prowess and acumen. Despite their limitations, they gave their modest share for the understanding of [[philosophy]] and some of the areas it covers.

Though, from the mid-16th century onwards, in Malta [[philosophy]] was taught at various institutions of higher education, from the latter part of the 18th century onwards the main academic body which promoted philosophical activity and research was the [[University of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Friggieri, Letter from Malta, ''The Philosophers' Magazine'' (England), 55, 4th quarter 2011, pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, mainly due to easier access to data sources and to enhanced communication networks, such philosophical inquiries and pursuits are more extensive in prevalence as in content.

==Short history==
{{See also|History of Malta}}

===Pre-Knights Period (pre-1530)===
Before the advent of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] to [[Malta]] in the first half of the 16th century, the [[Maltese Islands]] were a forlorn place with little, if any, political importance.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Vella, ''Storja ta' Malta'' (History of Malta), Vol. I, Klabb Kotba Maltin, Malta, 1993, pp. 185–188.&lt;/ref&gt; The few intellectuals who lived here grew within or around the [[Catholic religious order]]s that were present. Their cultural ties were mostly with nearby [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;G.F. Abela, ''Descrittione di Malta'', Malta, 1647, pp. 288ff., ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy was mainly studied as a stepping stone to theology.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fsadni, ''Id-Dumnikani fir-Rabat u fil-Birgu sa l-1620'', Malta, 1974, pp. 134–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, [[Sicily]] was a celebrated and thriving academic, intellectual and cultural centre, and all local professionals studied there.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wettinger and M. Fsadni, ''Peter Caxaro's Cantilena'', Malta, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Renaissance]] was in full bloom. Though the [[Counter-Reformation]] played an important part in every academic and intellectual institution, literature issued by the major [[Reformation]] educationalists, including [[Martin Luther]], were available and read extensively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bonnici, ''Storja tal-Inkizizzjoni ta' Malta'' (The History of the Inquisition in Malta), Vol. I, Religjon u Hajja, Storja, 16, Frangiskani Konventwali, Rabat, Malta, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period of Knights Hospitallers (1530–1798)===

The [[Knights Hospitallers]] made Malta their island-home in 1530 and remained sovereign rulers of the islands until they were expelled by [[Napoleon]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;J. Galea, ''Malta's Timeline'', ed. by R.M. Cassar, Malta, 1989, pp. 27 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; As a rule, they cared about education and cultivation as much as their military campaigns and their economic welfare.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zammit Mangion, ''Education in Malta'', Studia Editions, Malta, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they encouraged higher learning by giving protection to the various colleges and universities that were established (especially by [[Catholic religious order]]s), they also kept a very strict surveillance on all aspects of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cassar, ''Sex, Magic, and the Periwinkle'', PIN Publications, Malta, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; They certainly did not like being picked on by the [[Inquisition]], which could make them look bad with the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Ciappara, ''The Roman Inquisition in Enlightened Malta'', PIN Publications, Malta, pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philosophia Metaphyicae.jpg|thumb|[[Angelo Pirotta]]'s work on Ontology (1935/40)]]
Though philosophy continued to be mainly viewed as the ''hand-maid'' of theology, some intellectuals had an interest in cautiously branching out along some pathways of their own. Though the philosophical contributioins of these masters are fascinating in themselves, prevalent control and restrictions on intellectual activity hardly ever left them room for originality and innovation.

During this period intellectual circles were practically all part of the great movement of [[Scholasticism]], almost giving godlike status to [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Vella, ''Reflections in a Canvas Bag'', PEG Publishers, Malta, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, they were divided into two intellectually opposing camps: the larger group which read the great [[Stagirite]] through the eyes of [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the others who read him through the eyes of [[John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Vella, 'The University of S. Maria Portus Salutis', ''Journal of the Faculty of Arts'', Vol. II, No. 2, 1960, pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these academics and intellectuals produced large numbers of commentaries, either on [[Aristotle]] or on their respective mentor. Their creativity was largely expressed strictly within the confines of their particular school of thought, and this severely restricted their novelty.

During the 18th-century part of the period of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], science and the scientific method began to make head-way over the trenches of the Scholastics.&lt;ref&gt;F. Ciappara, ''Society and the Inquisition in Early Modern Malta'', PEG Publications, Malta, 2000, pp. 101–113.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was generally not pursued by ecclesiastics, on whom control was more stern, but by lay professionals, especially doctors. These, however, usually had no sway over studends registered with academic institutions, which were still rigorously controlled by members of [[religious orders]].

===Inter-Regium Period (1798–1813)===

Towards the end of the period of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in [[Malta]], ideas which had been explosive through the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 began to make way into some intellectual circles susceptible to them.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sammut, ''Il-Holma Maltija'', SKS Publications, Malta, pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; They came to full fruition around 1798, when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] expelled the [[Knights Hospitallers]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Mallia-Milanes, ed. (1993), ''Hospitaller Malta 1530–1798'', Studies on Early Modern Malta and the Order of St John of Jerusalem, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were already making the rounds during the decade preceding [[Napoleon]]. Of course, these ideas were much influenced by [[Illuminist]] philosophies, especially in [[France]].

[[File:Muscat, John Nicholas - La Giurisprudenza.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Nicholas Muscat|Muscat]]'s ''La Giurisprudenza Vindicata'' (1779)]]

===British Colonial Period (1813–1964)===

During this period, the higher schools resumed their business very much as was done during the rule of the [[Knights Hospitallers]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Mallia-Milanes, ed. (1988), ''The British Colonial Experience 1800–1964: The Impact on Maltese Society'', ''passim''; and Bonnici, A., (1990–1994), ''Storja ta’ l-Inki]izzjoni ta’ Malta'' (History of the Inquisition in Malta), 3 volumes, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Again [[Scholasticism]] came to the fore and flourished. However, this time around, it was the [[Thomist]] version which prevailed almost exclusively, even if circumstances, along two centuries and a half of British rule, changed drastically over the years.&lt;ref&gt;J. Chircop, ''The Left within the Maltese Labour Movement'', Mireva Publications, Malta, pp.50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; As in former years, the larger part of the philosophsers of this period were ecclesiastics, predominantly members of [[religious orders]]. Again, due to censor and control, they hardly ever ventured to propose anything philosophically bold or imaginative. An outstanding exception to all of these was [[Manuel Dimech]], who lived and worked during the first decade of the 20th century. He not only did not adhere to any form of [[Scholasticism]] but, furthermore, was a surprisingly innovative and original philosopher and social reformer.&lt;ref&gt;M. Montebello, ''Dimech'', PIN Publications, Malta, 2004, Chap. IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Independence Period (1964–)===

By the time of Malta's independence [[Scholasticism]] had waned and slowly faded away.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vella (1966) ‘The origins and development of the Royal University of Malta’, ''Foundation Day Ceremony'', Oration delivered in the church of the university, 12 November 1965, University Press, Malta, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Very few continued to uncritically adhere to its tenets, and these were restricted to small religious (particularly Catholic) circles.

[[File:Beginning Philosophy.JPG|thumb|[[Peter Serracino Inglott|Serracino Inglott]]'s ''Beginning Philosophy'' (1987)]]
Most of the other philosophers became somewhat more adventurous, exploring spheres which were to some extent inaccessible  during the British (and much less the [[Knights Hospitallers]]’) period.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sammut, 'Reassessing the Maltese media system', ''Social Transitions in Maltese Society'', ed. by J. Cutajar and G.Cassar, Agenda Publications, Malta, pp. 77–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the development of doing philosophy in Malta, [[Peter Serracino Inglott]] stands out as all-important, especially from the late 1960s onwards.

Some other Maltese philosophers worked abroad. Though they retained their limited contact with Malta, they of course had a different frame of mind. Their influence on young Maltese philosophers was negligible.

==Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta==

The following is the list of professors who held the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Malta]], [[Malta]]’s highest academic philosophy institution.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friggieri, Letter from Malta, ''The Philosophers' Magazine'' (England), 55, 4th quarter 2011, pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The dates refer to their period of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;M. Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'', vol. I, PIN Publications, Malta, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The chair of philosophy was established in 1771 by the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]], when he transformed the ''Collegium Melitense'' (Maltese College) of the [[Jesuits]] into the [[University of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 83–84, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last twenty years or so there has been an effort to aptly recognise and duly honour the modest share of philosophy in [[Malta]]. The necessity arose for two main reasons.&lt;ref&gt;M. Montebello, ''Stedina ghall-Filosofija Maltija'' (An Invitation to Maltese Philosophy), PEG Publications, Malta, 1995, pp. 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One, because the Maltese ''themselves'', mostly due to a dearth of required research, did not acknowledge, much less appreciate, any local philosophical tradition; and, secondly, because any activity that was being carried out in the philosophical field—whether it was teaching, writing or simply discussing—was done as if the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] themselves had, at most, a present without a past.&lt;ref&gt;P. Serracino Inglott and C. Mangion, 'Il-Filosofija f'Malta' (Philosophy in Malta), ''Oqsma tal-Kultura Maltija'' (Areas of Maltese Culture) (1991), ed. by T. Cortis, Ministry of Education and the Interior, Malta, pp. 263–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archival work revealed names and manuscripts and personalities,&lt;ref&gt;P. Serracino Inglott, 'Presentation', ''20th Century Philosophy in Malta'', M. Montebello, Agius &amp; Agius Publications, Malta, 2009, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; text-books were published (1995; 2001) and courses were read at the [[University of Malta]] (1996/97; 2012/13; 2013/14) and at other institutions of higher education. A first public conference on ‘Maltese’ philosophy was also organised (1996). A further step was taken by the establishment of [[Philosophy Sharing Foundation]] (2012).

===Appreciation===

Since the 16th century, philosophy has contributed to the academic and, sometimes, the intellectual and cultural life of Maltese intelligentsia. In most cases it functioned as a tool of the establishment—including the [[Catholic Church]]―to conserve and perpetuate orthodox and official doctrines. In other cases it offered alternative and imaginative routes of thinking. Despite its relatively long philosophical tradition, however, Malta has no particular philosophy associated to its name. Though sometimes innovative and creative, in their large majority Maltese philosophers have always worked with imported ideas and, but for very rare cases (like in the case of [[Manuel Dimech]]), seldom did break new ground in the philosophical field. Although the philosophy of many of them did not affect social or political life, some interacted lively with current affairs and sometimes even stimulated societal change. Throughout the ages, Maltese philosophers did not adhere to just one philosophical tradition. The larger part pertains to the Aristotelico-Thomistic school. Every now and then, however, other trends appear along the way, especially during the last quarter of the 20th century, such as humanism, empiricism, pragmatism, existentialism, linguistic analysis and some others. But for unique, rather than rare, exceptions, theism has been a constant trait throughout the whole Maltese philosophical tradition.

During the last thirty years or so philosophy in Malta took an unprecedented twist. [[Peter Serracino Inglott]] gave it an extraordinary new breath of life by widening its horizon, diversifying its interests and firmly propelling it into social and political action. This style then was taken up by others who continued this trend.

==Some Maltese Philosophers==
The following list includes some of [[Malta]]’s best and most representative philosophers through the ages. Most of the philosophical contributions made by these scholars have lasting significance since they go beyond reflections which are merely descriptive, comparative or contextual. Some of them also appeal for their creativity and style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12095">[[File:Pinocchio paradox.png|thumb|Pinocchio paradox causes Pinocchio's nose to grow if and only if it does not grow.]]

The '''Pinocchio paradox''' arises when [[Pinocchio]] says "My nose grows now" and is a version of the [[liar paradox]].&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 2" /&gt; The liar paradox is defined in [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] as the statement "This sentence is false." Any attempts to assign a classical binary [[truth value]] to this statement lead to a contradiction, or [[paradox]]. This occurs because if the statement "This sentence is false" is true, then it is false; this would mean that it is technically true, but also that it is false, and so on without end. Although the Pinocchio paradox belongs to the liar paradox tradition, it is a special case because it has no [[semantic]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]], as for example "My sentence is false" does.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

The Pinocchio paradox has nothing to do with [[Pinocchio]] being a known liar. If Pinocchio were to say "I am getting sick," this could be either true or false, but Pinocchio's sentence "My nose grows now" can be neither true nor false; hence this and only this sentence creates the Pinocchio (liar) paradox.

==History==
Pinocchio is a hero of the [[children literature|children's novel]] ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' by [[Italy|Italian]] author [[Carlo Collodi]]. Pinocchio, an animated puppet, is punished for each lie that he tells by undergoing further growth of his nose.&lt;ref name="chapter 17"/&gt; There are no restrictions on the length of Pinocchio's nose. It grows as he tells lies and at one point grows so long that he can not even get his nose "through the door of the room".&lt;ref name="chapter 35"/&gt;

The Pinocchio paradox was proposed in February 2001 by 11-year-old Veronique Eldridge-Smith. Veronique is the daughter of Peter Eldridge-Smith, who specializes in logic and the philosophy of logic. Peter Eldridge-Smith explained the liar paradox to Veronique and Veronique's older brother, and asked the children to come up with their own versions of the famous paradox. In a few minutes Veronique suggested: "Pinocchio says, 'My nose will be growing'." Eldridge-Smith liked the formulation of the paradox suggested by his daughter and wrote an article on the subject. The article was published in the journal ''[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]'', and the Pinocchio paradox became popularized on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=criticism/&gt;

==The paradox==
The paradox suggested by Veronique, "My nose grows now", or in [[Future tense#English|future tense]]: "will be growing", leaves room for different interpretations. In the novel Pinocchio's nose continues to grow as he lies: "As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer."&lt;ref name="chapter 17"/&gt; So [[logician]]s question if the sentence "My nose will be growing" was the only sentence that Pinocchio spoke, did he tell a lie before he said "My nose will be growing", or was he going to tell a lie—and how long would it take for his nose to start growing?&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

The [[Present tense#English|present tense]] of the same sentence "My nose is growing now" or "My nose grows", appears to provide a better opportunity to generate the liar paradox.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

The sentence "My nose grows" could be either true or false.

Assume the sentence: "My nose grows now" is true:

* Which means that Pinocchio's nose grows now because he truthfully says it is, but then
* Pinocchio's nose does not grow now because according to the novel it grows only as Pinocchio lies, but then
* Pinocchio's nose grows now because Pinocchio's nose does not grow now, and Pinocchio trustfully says it grows now, and it is false, that makes Pinocchio's sentence to be false, but then
* Pinocchio's nose does not grow now because Pinocchio's nose grows now, and Pinocchio trustfully says it grows now, and it is true that makes Pinocchio's sentence to be true, but then
* And so on without end.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

Assume the sentence: "My nose grows now" is false:

* Which means that Pinocchio's nose does not grow now because he falsely says it is, but then
* Pinocchio's nose grows now because according to the novel it grows only as Pinocchio lies, but then
* Pinocchio's nose does not grow now because Pinocchio's nose grows now, and Pinocchio falsely says it grows now, and it is false that makes Pinocchio's sentence to be true, but then
* Pinocchio's nose grows now because Pinocchio's nose does not grow now, and Pinocchio falsely says it grows now, and it is true, that makes Pinocchio's sentence to be false, but then
* And so on without end.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

And just to make it easier, as Eldridge-Smith states, "Pinocchio's nose is growing if and only if it is not growing," which makes Pinocchio's sentence to be "a version of the Liar".&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;

Eldridge-Smith argues that because the phrases "is not true" and "is growing" are not [[synonyms]], the Pinocchio paradox is not a [[semantic]] paradox:

{{quotation|The Pinocchio paradox is, in a way, a counter–example to solutions to the Liar that would exclude semantic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicates]] from an object–language, because "is growing" is not a semantic predicate.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;}}

Eldridge-Smith believes [[Alfred Tarski]]'s theory, in which he states that liar paradoxes should be diagnosed as arising only in languages that are "semantically closed". By this he means a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate the truth (or falsehood) of a sentence in the same language should not be applied to the Pinocchio paradox:

{{quotation|The Pinocchio paradox raises a purely logical issue for any metalanguage–hierarchy solution, strict or liberal. The Pinocchio scenario is not going to arise in our world, so it is not a pragmatic issue. It seems though that there could be a logically possible world in which Pinocchio's nose grows if and only if he is saying something not true. However, there cannot be such a logically possible world wherein he makes the statement "My nose is growing." A metalanguage hierarchy approach cannot explain this based on Tarski's analysis, and therefore cannot solve the Pinocchio paradox, which is a version of the Liar.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 1"/&gt;}}

In his next article, "Pinocchio against the dialetheists", Eldridge-Smith states: "If it is a true contradiction that Pinocchio's nose grows and does not grow, then such a world is metaphysically impossible, not merely semantically impossible." He then reminds the readers that, when (in [[Buridan's bridge]]) [[Socrates]] asked if he may cross a bridge, [[Plato]] responded that he may cross the bridge only "if in the first proposition that you would utter you speak the truth. But surely, if you speak falsely I shall throw you into water." Socrates replied, "You are going to throw me into the water." Socrates's response is a [[sophism]] that puts Plato in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into water, because by doing this Plato would have violated his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato would have allowed Socrates to cross the bridge, it would have meant that Socrates said an untruth when he replied "You are going to throw me into the water," and he therefore should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.&lt;ref name="Pinocchio paradox 2"/&gt;

==Solutions==

===Future tense===
[[William F. Vallicella]], while admitting that he has not read the articles published in ''Analysis'', says that he does not see a paradox in the future tense of the sentence "My nose will grow now", or in the present tense of the sentence "My nose grows now".&lt;ref name=criticism/&gt;

Vallicella argues that the future tense sentence cannot generate the liar paradox because this sentence cannot be ever treated as a falsity. He explains his point with this example: "Suppose I predict that tomorrow morning, at 6 AM, my blood pressure will be 125/75, but my prediction turns out false: my blood pressure the next morning is 135/85. No one who heard my prediction could claim that I lied when I made it even if I had the intention of deceiving my hearers. For although I made (what turned out to be) a false statement with the intention to deceive, I had no way of knowing exactly what my blood pressure would be the next day."&lt;ref name=criticism/&gt; The same explanation could be used to explain Pinocchio's sentence. Even if his prediction that his nose will grow turns out to be false, it is impossible to claim that he has lied.&lt;ref name=criticism/&gt; Then Vallicella explains why he does not see the liar paradox in Pinocchio's sentence if the present tense is used:

{{quotation|If Pinocchio says 'My nose grows now,' he is either lying or not. If he is lying, then he is making a false statement, which implies that his nose does not grow now. If he is not lying, then his statement is either true or false, which implies that either his nose does grow now or his nose does not grow now. Therefore, either his nose does not grow now or his nose does grow now. But that is wholly unproblematic.&lt;ref name=criticism/&gt;}}

However, Vallicella's argument can be criticized in the following way:{{Or|date=July 2011}} Unlike Pinocchio, Vallicella's blood pressure does not respond to the veracity of his own statements. However, Pinocchio, operating within the framework of having observed that his nose grows when ''and only when'' he lies, would be making an inductively reasoned statement which he believes to be true based on his past experiences.

But this critique to Vallicella's argument can also be challenged. Based on Pinocchio's own presumed understanding of the nature of when and why his nose grows, "my nose grows now" can only have been 'inductively reasoned' if Pinocchio was referring to a lie that he stated right beforehand. For Pinocchio, "my nose grows now" is a statement that merely serves to imply that whatever he said ''right before'' was a lie and that therefore his nose will probably be growing now because of that lie. In this context, the statement "my nose grows now" is a prediction or an 'educated' guess, which in its nature cannot be construed as a lie. Thus, whether or not his nose grows now would solely depend on what he said before "my nose grows now".

'''Grand Prince Yangnyeong''' ([[Hangul]]: 양녕대군, [[Hanja]]: 讓寧大君, 1394–1462) was a [[Joseon dynasty]] politician and prince. The Grand Prince, first-born son of [[King Taejong]] of the [[Joseon dynasty]] and his consort [[Queen Wongyeong]], elder brother of [[Sejong the Great]], and ancestor of [[Syngman Rhee]], Korean independence activist and first [[Presidents of South Korea|President of South Korea]].

==Biography==
He was born as '''Yi Je''' (李褆 in [[Hanja]], 이제 in [[Hangul]]) in 1394. Originally his father appointed him as the Crown Prince but he eventually executed the Queen Wongyeong's brothers and in the 18th year of his reign replaced prince Yangnyeong with his third son [[Sejong the Great|prince Chungnyeong]] as his successor &lt;ref&gt; https://books.google.ru/books?id=p3yW5MdzKnUC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Yangnyeong&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIovjtvPLeAhWSlIsKHeNECdAQ6AEITTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Yangnyeong&amp;f=false &lt;/ref&gt;. Known for his [[literature]] and [[calligraphy]] skills, the former Crown Prince viewed himself as lacking in the requisite skills for kingship and believed that [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]] was destined to become king. Considering it his duty to make Sejong king, he purposely acted extremely rude in the court, lost his position as a prince, married a peasant and was eventually officially banished from [[Seoul]] in June 1418. Grand Prince Hyoryeong, Yangnyeong's second brother, had similar feelings about Sejong being king, and so became a monk in a [[Buddhist]] temple. Possibly King Tajong's willingness to execute troublesome family members helped encourage his first two sons to step aside and allow King Taejong's third and favorite son to become King Sejong.
This plot ultimately brought [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]] to the throne. Later, Yangnyeong became a wandering traveler and lived in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.naver.com/ Naver Encyclopedia], "[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=109130 양녕대군 [讓寧大君, 1394~1462&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]", [[Naver]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]] had taken the throne, the relationship between the brothers was strong, and Sejong often invited Yangnyeong to the palace.

Yangnyeong lived as a wanderer and died in 1462, almost living for 68 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.naver.com/ Naver Encyclopedia], "[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=109130 양녕대군 [讓寧大君, 1394~1462&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]", [[Naver]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is believed that the plaque on the [[Namdaemun]] was personally written by him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.naver.com/ Naver Encyclopedia], "[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=109130 양녕대군 [讓寧大君, 1394~1462&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]", [[Naver]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an ancestor of [[Syngman Rhee]], Korean independence activist and the first [[Presidents of South Korea|South Korean president]].

In [[Process philosophy|philosophy]], a '''process ontology''' refers to a universal model of the structure of the world as an ordered wholeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Rescher |first=Nicholas}} Cf. [[Michel Weber]] (ed.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279952/After_Whitehead_Rescher_on_Process_Metaphysics After Whitehead: Rescher on Process Metaphysics]'', Frankfurt / Paris / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sohst, Wolfgang|url=http://www.xenomoi.de/product_info.php/info/p180_NEU--Prozessontologie--Ein-systematischer-Entwurf-der-Entstehung-von-Existenz-.html|title=Prozessontologie. Ein systematischer Entwurf der Entstehung von Existenz|location=Berlin|year=2009|isbn=978-3-936532-60-9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827005142/http://www.xenomoi.de/product_info.php/info/p180_NEU--Prozessontologie--Ein-systematischer-Entwurf-der-Entstehung-von-Existenz-.html|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ontologies are [[Fundamental ontology|fundamental ontologies]], in contrast to the so-called [[Applied ontology|applied ontologies]]. Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any [[empirical]] proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical [[phenomena]] can be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental ontology is the so-called [[substance theory]]. However, fundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times, because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as "[[energy]]," "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]", and those of the physical dimensions of [[space]] and [[time]].

In [[computer science]], a '''process ontology''' is a description of the components and their relationships that make up a process. A formal process ontology is an [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take advantage of the benefits of an [[Upper ontology (information science)|upper ontology]]. [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning software]] can be used to perform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its constraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning ontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/old/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==

A process may be defined as a set of transformations of input elements into output elements with specific properties, with the transformations characterized by parameters and constraints, such as in manufacturing or biology. A process may also be defined as the [[workflow]]s and [[sequence of events]] inherent in processes such as manufacturing, engineering and [[business process]]es.

== Ontologies ==

=== PSL ===
{{main|Process Specification Language}}
The Process Specification Language (PSL) is a process ontology developed for the formal description and modeling of basic manufacturing, engineering and business processes. This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level of event-instances, object-instances, and timepoints. PSL’s top level is built around the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Activity – a class or type of action, such as install-part, which is the class of actions in which parts are installed
* Activity-occurrence – an event or action that takes place at a specific place and time, such as a specific instance of install-part occurring at a specific [[timestamp]]
* Timepoint – a point in time
* Object – anything that is not a timepoint or an activity

=== Cyc ===
{{main|Cyc}}
In a process/planning ontology developed for the ontology Cyc, classes and relations above the ground level of PSL allow processes to be described purely at the type-level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|title=Process Representation and Planning in Cyc: From Scripts and Scenes to Constraints|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/plan01-ws.pdf|publisher=Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI), University of Edinburgh|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stuart|last1=Aitken|first2=Jon|last2=Curtis&lt;!--|title=A Process Ontology--&gt;|title=Design of a Process Ontology: Vocabulary, Semantics, and Usage&lt;!--|url=http://www.cyc.com/doc/white_papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf--&gt;|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~stuart/Papers/ekaw02-aitken-curtis.pdf|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|work=Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management: Ontologies and the Semantic Web|year=2002|volume=2473|location=Berlin/Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|pages=263–270|doi=10.1007/3-540-45810-7_13|ISBN=978-3-540-44268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground level of PSL uses the primitives of event-instance, object-instance, and timepoint description. The types above the ground level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology above this ground level use the following concepts:
* Process – formalized as a ''script''
* Aggregate process – a process at a level above that of a single episode of a process, to represent the numbers of participants in an action by ranges of integers and qualitative values like ''few'' or ''many''
* Script – a typical pattern of events that can be expected to re-occur
** a ''script'' has subevents, which means that ''scripts'' are composite events
* Scene – a subevent of a ''script''
* Roles/participants – specifies types of actors and objects that may play in the ''script'' or ''scene''
* Conditions – precondition(s) that must be true for a ''scene'' (event) to be executable, and postcondition(s) (effects) that must be true after a ''scene''
* Repetition – the number of repetitions of a process may be known, or may be unspecified, or may be repeated until a specific condition is true
* Properties of ordering and constitution of repeated subevents for composite processes:
** Begin-Ordered – subevents start at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** End-Ordered – subevents end at distinct time points that are totally ordered
** EndsBeforeEnd – subevents end before or at the same time as subevent instances which start before them
** Sequential – no overlapping subevents
** Terminating – there is a subevent after which no other subevents begin, and since all activities have a begin and end point, there is a time point at which the process ends
** Uniform – all subevents are of the same event type
* Identity – the identity of participants in a process, that actor(s) or object(s) playing a role in one ''scene'' or repetition are the same as those in another ''scene'' or repetition, is represented by constraints on possible participants

=== SUPER and DDPO ===
The project SUPER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Business Process Ontology Framework (deliverable 1.1)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M12/D1.1.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''S'''emantics '''U'''tilised for '''P'''rocess management within and between '''E'''nte'''R'''prises) has a goal of the definition of ontologies for Semantic Business Process Management (SBPM), but these ontologies can be reused in diverse environments. Part of this project is to define an Upper Process Ontology (UPO) that ties together all other SUPER ontologies. The results of the project SUPER include the UPO and a set of ontologies for processes and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUPER Ontologies|url=http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011224532/http://www.ip-super.org/content/view/129/136/ |archivedate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project IST 026850 SUPER: Process Ontology Stack, Evolved Version (deliverable 1.5)|url=http://www.ip-super.org/res/Deliverables/M36/D1.5.pdf|publisher=Information Society Technologies (IST)|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ontologies are written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], and some are also written in [[OCML]].

A candidate model for the UPO was DDPO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gangemi, A., Borgo, S., Catenacci, C., and Lehman, J.|title=Task taxonomies for knowledge content (deliverable D07)|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D07_v21a.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=2005|pages=27–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DOLCE+DnS Plan Ontology), a planning ontology which specifies plans and distinguishes between abstract and executable plans. [[Upper ontology (information science)#DOLCE and DnS|DOLCE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Masolo, Claudio |author2=Borgo, Stefano |author3=Gangemi, Aldo |author4=Guarino, Nicola |author5=Oltramari, Alessandro |title=WonderWeb Deliverable D18: Ontology Library|url=http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/Papers/D18.pdf|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)|year=c. 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOLCE: a Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering|url=http://dolce.semanticweb.org/|publisher=Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. [[Upper ontology (information science)#DOLCE and DnS|DnS]] (Descriptions and Situations), is a constructivist ontology that allows for context-sensitive redescriptions of the types and relations postulated by other given ontologies (or ground vocabularies). Together in DDPO, DOLCE and DnS are used to build a Plan Ontology that includes physical and non-physical objects (social entities, mental objects and states, conceptualizations, information objects, constraints), events, states, regions, qualities, and constructivist situations. The main target of DDPO is tasks, namely the types of actions, their sequencing, and the controls performed on them.

=== oXPDL ===
The ontology oXPDL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Marmolowski, Mateusz |author3=Oren, Eyal |author4=Gaaloul, Walid |title=A Process Ontology for Business Intelligence|url=http://www.deri.ie/fileadmin/documents/DERI-TR-2008-04-01.pdf|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language ([[XPDL]]). The purpose of oXPDL is to model the semantics of XPDL process models in standardized Web ontology languages such as [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] and [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]], while incorporating features of existing standard ontologies such as [[Process Specification Language|PSL]], [[RosettaNet]], and [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|SUMO]].

=== GFO ===
{{main|General Formal Ontology}}
The General Formal Ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO)|url=http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo|publisher=Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=University of Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Herre, Heinrich|title=General Formal Ontology (GFO): A Foundational Ontology for Conceptual Modelling|url=http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2010/gfo-basic-principles.pdf|publisher=Research Department Ontologies in Medicine and Life Sciences (Onto-Med)|location=IMISE University of Leipzig|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Upper ontology (information science)#General Formal Ontology .28GFO.29|GFO]]) is an ontology integrating processes and objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, such as the existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistant{{sic}}. A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances "remain identical" over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called "time boundaries") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.

=== m3po and m3pl ===
The multi metamodel process ontology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haller, Armin |author2=Oren, Eyal |title=A process ontology to represent semantics of different process and choreography meta-models|url=http://www.m3pe.org/deliverables/process-ontology.pdf|location=National University of Ireland, Galway|publisher=Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI)|date=February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |author3=Kotinurmi, P. |title=m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)|date=September 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3po.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (m3po) combines workflows and choreography descriptions so that it can be used as a process interchange ontology. For internal business processes, Workflow Management Systems are used for process modelling and allow describing and executing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Georgakopoulos, D. |author2=Hornick,  M. |author3=Sheth, A. |title=An overview of workflow management: From process modeling to workflow automation infrastructure|journal=Distributed and Parallel Databases|volume=3|issue=2|pages=119–153|year=1995|doi=10.1007/bf01277643}}&lt;/ref&gt; For external business processes, choreography descriptions are used to describe how business partners can cooperate. A choreography can be considered to be a view of an internal business process with the internal logic not visible, similar to public views on private workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chiu, D. K. W.|title=Workflow view driven cross-organizational interoperability in a web service environment|journal=Inf.

Eng.|volume=51|issue=1|pages=109–147|year=2004|doi=10.1016/j.datak.2004.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The m3po ontology unifies both internal and external business processes, combining reference models and languages from the workflow and choreography domains. The m3po ontology is written in [[Web Services Modeling Language|WSML]]. The related ontology m3pl, written in [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] using the extension FLOWS (First Order Logic for Web Services), enables the extraction of choreography interfaces from workflow models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haller, A. |author2=Oren, E. |title=m3pl: A Work-FLOWS ontology extension to extract choreography interfaces|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Semantics for Business Process Management, in conjunction with ESWC2006|location=Budva, Montenegro|date=June 2006|url=http://www.m3pe.org/publications/m3pl_sbpm2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The m3po ontology combines features of the following reference models and languages:
* [[XPDL]] – a standard for exchanging workflow models, without runtime information, between different workflow management systems
* [[Process Specification Language|PSL]] – an ontology that allows the capture of the semantics of workflow models and enables translations of models between workflow management systems
* [[YAWL]] – a research workflow language that supports all workflow patterns directly
* [[BPEL]] – an executable business process language and includes an abstract protocol
* [[WS-CDL]] – a multi-party collaboration model

The m3po ontology is organized using five key aspects of workflow specifications and workflow management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jablonski, S. |author2=Bussler, C. |title=Workflow Management: Modeling Concepts, Architecture and Implementation|publisher=International Thomson Computer Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different workflow models put a different emphasis on the five aspects, the most elaborate reference model for each aspect was used and combined into m3po.
* Functional and Behavioural – the most important concepts are ''processType'', ''processOccurrence'', ''activityType'' and ''activityOccurrence''
* Informational – defined by data and data-flow
* Organizational – defines who is responsible for carrying out a specific task; security related issues
* Operational – interaction of the workflows with their environment by manual tasks performed by users and automatic tasks performed by automated computer programs
* Orthogonal – scheduling based on time; integrity and failure recovery

'''Richard Bevan Braithwaite''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (15 January 1900&amp;nbsp;– 21 April 1990), usually cited as '''R.&amp;nbsp;B. Braithwaite''', was an English philosopher who specialized in the philosophy of science, ethics, and the [[philosophy of religion]]. He was a lecturer in moral science at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1934 to 1953, then [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy]] there from 1953 to 1967. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1946 to 1947, and was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1957.

==Life==
Braithwaite was born in [[Banbury]], [[Oxfordshire]], son of the historian of early Quaker history, [[William Charles Braithwaite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/auden/cgi-bin/auden/individual.php?pid=I16368&amp;ged=auden-bicknell.ged stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Sidcot School]], [[Somerset]] (1911–14), and [[Bootham School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bootham School Register|place=York, England|publisher=&lt;!--Bootham Old Scholars Association--&gt;BOSA|first=Jenny | last=Woodland |year=2011|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[York]], 1914–18. As a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]].

He entered [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 1919 to study physics and mathematics, gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1923 and [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1926. He was a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge from 1924 to 1990. He was appointed Cambridge University Lecturer in Moral Sciences in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0272%2FPP%2FRBB The Papers of Richard Bevan Braithwaite]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married (secondly) to the computational linguist and philosopher [[Margaret Masterman]], with whom he founded the [[Epiphany Philosophers]] a group of (largely) [[Anglican]]s and [[Quaker]]s seeking a new view of the relationship between philosophy and science (see the Pardshaw Dialogues, below).

==Work==
Although he was [[Logical positivism|positivistically]] inclined, Braithwaite was a Christian, having been brought up a Quaker and becoming an Anglican later. According to theologian [[Alister E. McGrath]], Braithwaite's 1955 Eddington Memorial Lecture "An Empiricist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief"&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QU44AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+empiricist%27s+view+of+the+nature+of+religious+belief&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WxCITImVK4rmnAfx4pn6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "An Empiricist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief"] in [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] (ed.). ''The Philosophy of Religion''. Oxford University Press, 1970, pp. 72–91.&lt;/ref&gt; is to date the most widely cited publication (e.g. by Anglican priest [[Don Cupitt]]) from a genre of 1970s–1980s theological works arguing that "God" and "religion" are human constructs—having no independent reality of their own—and that human dignity and freedom may best be advanced by systematic [[deconstruction]] of these two ideas, although Braithwaite himself had little sympathy for vague claims like these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alister E. McGrath]]. ''[[A Scientific Theology]]''. Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2001, pp.74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

His major work was his book ''Scientific Explanation'' (1953) but, like his Eddington Lecture (above) it was his inaugural lecture ("Theory of Games as a Tool for the Moral Philosopher") that was his more original contribution: although a logician and philosopher of science, he had been elected to a chair of moral philosophy (ethics) about which he considered he knew little. His inaugural lecture attempted to bring what he did know about ([[Game theory|the theory of games]]) into some relation with ethical reasoning and, in doing that, he effectively started a whole new field of study, namely, how game-theoretic considerations are related to ethical ones.

It was Braithwaite's poker that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] reportedly brandished at [[Karl Popper]] during their confrontation at a [[Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club|Moral Sciences Club]] meeting in Braithwaite's rooms in [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]]. The implement subsequently disappeared.

{{Globalize/US|date=April 2018}}
The '''right to privacy''' is an element of various legal traditions to restrain [[governmental]] and private actions that threaten the [[privacy]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.privacilla.org/business/privacytorts.html The Privacy Torts]" (December 19, 2000). Privacilla.org.{{failed verification|reason=Source addresses particular development in US law, lacking the universal perspective expressed in intro|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Brandeisprivacy.htm|title=Right to Privacy|author=|date=|website=faculty.uml.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=privacy|title=Read about "Right to privacy" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013, initiated by ex-[[NSA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]], the inalienable human right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. In combating worldwide terrorism, government agencies, such as the [[NSA]], [[CIA]], [[R&amp;AW]] and [[GCHQ]], have engaged in [[mass surveillance|mass]], [[global surveillance]].

There is now a question as whether the right to privacy act can co-exist with the [[surveillance state|current capabilities]] of [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] to access and analyse virtually in every detail of an individual's life. A major question is that whether or not the right to privacy needs to be forfeited as part of the [[social contract]] to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats.

Private sector actors could also threaten the right to privacy. Increasingly, questions have arisen about the use of [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] for targeted advertising, sharing data with external parties and reusing personal data within [[big data]] by large technology giants, such as  [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]],  [[Apple Inc.|Apple]],  [[Facebook]],  [[Google]], and [[Yahoo]]. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, revealing that the [[Psychographics|psychographic]] company [[Cambridge Analytica]] was using personal data, illegitimately obtained through Facebook, to manipulate and influence large groups of people, including during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US Presidential elections]].

==Background==
State of consideration of constitutional laws and acts formed by sectors and sections

Privacy uses the theory of [[natural rights]], and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In the United States, an article in the December 15, 1890 issue of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', written by attorney [[Samuel D. Warren]] and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Louis Brandeis]], entitled "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", is often cited as the first explicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone", and focused on protecting individuals.  This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as "[[yellow journalism]]".&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right to Privacy"], 4 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 article ''The Right to Privacy''. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified...as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of [[Katz v. United States|Katz]], in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[FTC Fair Information Practice|Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===
In recent years there has been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define the "right to privacy". In 2005, students of the [[Haifa Center for Law &amp; Technology]] asserted that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''],  Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment," suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===
[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
:— Alan Westin, ''Privacy and Freedom'', 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). ''Privacy and Freedom'' (Fifth ed.). New York.: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marc Rotenberg]] has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: "the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information." Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A. &amp; Rotenberg, M. (2016). Privacy Law and Society. West Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]] and [[Lawrence Lessig]] focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. [[The American Economic Review]], 71(2), 405–409.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective value and a human right===
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.  This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). "Are new technologies the enemy of privacy?" ''Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy'', 20, 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight.  He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
A right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Privacy laws in different countries ==

=== United States ===
{{main article| Privacy laws of the United States}}
Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion from the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hao. ''Protecting Privacy in China: A Research on China's Privacy Standards and the Possibility of Establishing the Right to Privacy and the Information Privacy Protection Legislation in Modern China''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of [[civil liberties]] cases, including ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', which invalidated a successful 1922 [[Oregon]] [[initiative]] requiring compulsory [[state school|public education]], ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', where a right to privacy was first established explicitly, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which struck down a [[Texas]] abortion law and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against [[abortion]], and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which struck down a Texas [[sodomy law]] and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against [[sodomy]].

The 1890 Warren and Brandeis article "The Right To Privacy" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy.&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;  This right is frequently debated. [[Strict constructionism|Strict constructionists]]{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that  such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be [[surveillance]] ([[telephone tapping|wiretaps]], public cameras [[film industry]], etc.).

Most states of the United States {{who|date=January 2014}}also grant a right to privacy and recognize four [[tort]]s based on that right:
#Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs;
#[[Public disclosure]] of embarrassing private facts;
#[[Publicity]] which places a person in a false light in the public eye; and
#[[Personality rights|Appropriation]] of name or likeness.

The four privacy torts above were introduced by [[William Lloyd Prosser|William Prosser]] in his ''California Law Review'' article titled "Privacy" in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=Richards, Neil|last2=J.|first2=Solove, Daniel|date=2010|title=Prosser's Privacy Law: A Mixed Legacy|url=https://doi.org/10.15779/Z38541P|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|doi=10.15779/z38541p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that these torts, along with the "Right to Privacy"  article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis form the basis for modern U.S. privacy legislation.

Also, in some American jurisdictions the use of a person's name as a keyword under Google's [[AdWords]] for advertising or trade purposes  without the person's consent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fishman|first=Ross|title=Bad Precedent: Lawyer Censured for Buying Google Keywords for Other Lawyers and Law Firms|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/bad-precedent-lawyer-censured-buying-google-keywords-other-lawyers-and-law-firms|accessdate=5 March 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has raised certain personal privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=93174 Robert L.

Right to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California’s “online erasure” law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. However, the United States is still far behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zurbriggen|first1=Eileen L.|last2=Hagai|first2=Ella Ben|last3=Leon|first3=Gabrielle|title=Negotiating privacy and intimacy on social media: Review and recommendations.|journal=Translational Issues in Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=248–260|doi=10.1037/tps0000078|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/tps0000078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice [[Jagdish Singh Khehar|JS Khehar]], ruled on August 24, 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India (mostly under Article 21 and additionally under Part III rights). Thus no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for encroachment of any Article 21 right – legality-i.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object. This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/170988/right-to-privacy-supreme-court-2/|title=For the Many and the Few: What a Fundamental Right to Privacy Means for India - The Wire|author=|date=|website=The Wire|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalisation of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalising same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thequint.com/india/2017/08/24/supreme-court-verdict-right-to-privacy|title=Too Lazy to Read Right to Privacy Ruling?

The new data sharing policy of Whatsapp with Facebook after Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must decide if the right to privacy can be enforced against private entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scobserver.clpr.org.in/cases/whatsapp-facebook-privacy-case/|title=Whatsapp-Facebook Privacy Case - Supreme Court Observer|work=Supreme Court Observer|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
It is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the [[mass media|media]], that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press.  The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public have a right to know personal information about those with status as a [[public figure]].  This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of [[freedom of speech]].

==Mass surveillance and privacy==
{{further information|Global surveillance|Edward Snowden|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}

Governmental organizations such as the NSA, CIA, and GCHQ amongst others conduct [[mass surveillance]] throughout [[Global surveillance|the world]]. Programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]], and other operations conducted by [[NATO]]-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. The existence of programs is justified by their conductors in terms of supposed benefits for defense and law enforcement, however this is also in conflict with the right to privacy established under various treaties, constitutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The argument in favor of privacy has therefore come under a larger opposition to [[intelligence agency|intelligence operations]] carried out for political purposes, and has become a contentious issue since it undermines the perceived need of nations to spy on the general population in order to maintain their power structures.

* The right to privacy is alluded to in the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which states, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,{{efn|Effects are items of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denniston|first1=Lyle|title=Argument preview: Police and cellphone privacy|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/argument-preview-police-and-cellphone-privacy/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|title=America's Founding Documents|author=|date=30 October 2015|website=archives.gov|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logical extension of the amendment to digital properties would make sense since if the internet had existed when it was written, digital documents would have been considered more important than the literal "papers" mentioned in the text.
* Privacy helps to avoid unwanted and potentially intrusive interference in an individual's personal affairs.
* Privacy is one of the rights that were absent in the society in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Without privacy, there would be nothing to stop a [[Big Brother (1984 character)|Big Brother]]-like entity from taking control of every aspect of life.

==Opposition==
* In 1999, during a launch event for the [[Jini]] technology, [[Scott McNealy]], the chief executive officer of [[Sun Microsystems]], said that privacy issues were "a [[red herring]]" and then stated "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref&gt;Sprenger, Polly. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20170206072011/https://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538 Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It']". ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. January 26, 1999. Retrieved on Feb 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nothing to hide argument]] states that government [[data mining]] and surveillance programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover some illegal activities and those committing such activities do not have the right to keep them private. One who supports this argument may state, "I've got nothing to hide" thus, not opposing data mining and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rncAXAFD1jcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy%20%22nothing%20to%20hide%22%20argument&amp;f=false 252].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In wake of the Snowden scandal, governments have claimed that there is an existential terrorist threat that overrides the so-called right to privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">The '''Royal Institution of South Wales''' is a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[learned society]] founded in [[Swansea]] in 1835 as the '''Swansea Philosophical and Literary Society''' with the following objectives:

:"The Cultivation and Advancement of the various Branches of Natural History, as well as the Local History of the Town and Neighbourhood, the Extension and Encouragement of Literature and the Fine Arts, and the General Diffusion of Knowledge."

In 1838, the Society received its [[Royal charter]] as the Royal Institution.

The '''''Annual Report of the Swansea Literary and Scientific Society''''' was an annual magazine first published by 'Swansea Literary and Scientific Society' in 1850. In addition to reports on the society's activities it contained articles on scientific subjects, history, and antiquarianism.

It later published a journal known as [[Minerva (magazine)|Minerva]] until 2006. This has now been renamed The Swansea History Journal (thus avoiding confusion with an arts magazine called Minerva).

Scarcity can lead people to focus on enjoying an experience more deeply, which increases happiness.

Others argue self-denial involves avoidance and holding back of [[happiness]] and pleasurable experiences from oneself that is only damaging to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethics of Interpersonal Relationships|author=Robert W.

==Religion and self-denial==
Self-denial can constitute an important element of religious practice in various belief systems. An exemplification is the self-denial advocated by several Christian confessions where it is believed to be a means of reaching happiness and a deeper religious understanding, sometimes described as 'becoming a true follower of Christ'. The foundation of self-denial in the Christian context is based the recognition of a higher God-given will, which the Christian practicer choose to adhere to, and prioritize over his or her own will or desires. This can in daily life be expressed by renunciation of certain physically pleasureable, yet from a religious stand-point inappropriate activities, sometimes referred to as 'desires of the flesh', which e.g. could entail certain sexual practices and over-indulgant eating or drinking. In the Christian faith Jesus is often mentioned as a positive example of self-denial, both in relation to the deeds performed during his life, as well as the sacrifice attributed to his death.

==Based on gender==
Self-denial in women is linked to cultural definitions of [[femininity]] which women have [[internalization|internalized]] to such an extent that self-abnegation had become basic to women's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self Love and Christian Ethics|author=Darlene Fozard Weaver|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-521-52097-3|page=79|url=http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/reader.action?docID=10070261#}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]] observed this and argued that it was more linked to women than men because they were to follow this Christian virtue because of their detriment. Women are seen in a domestic perspective and self-denial puts all things women were once exposed to the side so they can be committed to their marriage and family. The way women are portrayed has not changed much throughout the years because the [[patriarchal]] perspective continues to be present. Through self-denial women have to sacrifice their interests and goals to satisfy not only family, but many times social norms. They are not allowed to be independent but more so are trapped to be the individual they are expected to be. However, in men, this is different.

[[Masculinity]] is linked to self-denial when put in a male perspective. Men's self-denial is both a source of men's existential alienation and part of the infrastructure of men's power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recreating Sexual Politics(Routledge Revivals):Men, Feminism, and Politics|author=Victor Seidler|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|date=1991|isbn=978-0-415-57289-7|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=why+women+self-denial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-J_3qrnJAhUDOD4KHcRuCTcQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=why%20women%20self-denial&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When men go through self-denial it is interpreted as self-improvement as put by the book ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'' in which they emphasize self-denial as a comparison to the image of the goal of Superman in "What does not kill me makes me stronger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manliness|author=Harvey C.

However, the psychological differences between men and women are often disputed among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender similarities in the relationship between psychological aspects of disordered eating and self-silencing|author=Locker, T.

'''Sigmund Schining ein Ringeck''' (Sigmund ain Ringeck, Sigmund Amring, Sigmund Einring, Sigmund Schining) was a 14th- or 15th-century German fencing master. While the meaning of the surname "Schining" is uncertain, the suffix "ain Ringeck" may indicate that he came from the [[Rhineland]] region of south-western [[Germany]]. He is named in the text of his treatise as ''Schirmaister'' to one Duke Albrecht, [[Count Palatine]] of Rhine and [[Duke of Bavaria]]. Other than this, the only thing that can be determined about his life is that his renown as a master was sufficient for [[Paulus Kal]] to include him on his memorial to the deceased masters of the [[Johannes Liechtenauer|Society of Liechtenauer]] in 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Kal, Paulus. Untitled [manuscript]. Paulus Kal Fechtbuch (CGM 1507). Munich, Germany: [[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek]], 1470.&lt;/ref&gt; Ringeck seems to have authored one of the few complete [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] of the [[epitome]] of the grand master [[Johannes Liechtenauer]], making him one of the most important German fencing masters of the 15th century.

The identity of Ringeck's patron remains unclear, as four men named Albrecht held the title during the fifteenth century. If it is [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht I]], who reigned from 1353 to 1404, this would signify that Ringeck was likely a direct associate or student of Liechtenauer. However, it may just as easily have been [[Albert III, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht III]], who carried the title from 1438 to 1460, making Ringeck a second- or third-generation master carrying on the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, Christian Henry. "Chicken and Eggs: Which Master Came First?" ''In Saint George's Name: An Anthology of Medieval German Fighting Arts''. Wheaton, IL: Freelance Academy Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht IV]] claimed the title in 1460 and thus also could have been Ringeck's patron; this seems less likely in light of Ringeck's apparent death within that same decade, meaning the master would have had to have penned his treatise in the final few years of his life. In its favor, however, is the fact that Albrecht IV reigned until 1508 and both the Dresden and  [[Glasgow Fechtbuch|Glasgow]] versions of the text were likely created during his time.

== Writings ==

Ringeck is often erroneously credited as the author of the [[Codex Ringeck (MS Dresd.C.487)|MS Dresden C487]]. While Ringeck seems to be the author of three of the core texts, glosses of Liechtenauer's verses on unarmored [[longsword]] fencing, armored fencing, and mounted fencing, the manuscript is an anthology of several treatises by different masters and is currently thought to have been composed between 1504 and 1519&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handschriftencensus.de/18797 Handschriftencensus]. Retrieved 27 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (well after the master's lifetime). Likewise, the [[Glasgow Fechtbuch|MS E.1939.65.341]], though often described as merely an illustrated version of the Dresden manuscript, is a separate anthology with its own collection of works by various authors and is internally dated to 1508.&lt;ref&gt;Internally dated on folio 22r.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was not copied nearly as often as the more famous [[Johannes Liechtenauer|Anonymous gloss]] (often misattributed to [[Peter von Danzig]]), Ringeck's gloss nevertheless seems to have had a lasting influence. Not only was it reproduced by [[Joachim Meyer]] in 1570 as part of his final manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Joachim. ''Fechtbuch zu Ross und zu Fuss'' [manuscript]. MS Var.82. Rostock, Germany: Universitätsbibliothek Rostock, 1570.&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1539 Hans Medel von Salzburg took it upon himself to create a revised version of Ringeck's Bloßfechten gloss, integrating his own commentary in many places.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3158">'''Simmias of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]''' ({{lang-el|Σιμμίας Θηβαῖος}}; fl. 5th–4th century BC) was an ancient [[Greece|Greek]] philosopher, disciple of [[Socrates]], and a friend of [[Cebes]]. In his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'', [[Xenophon]] includes him in the inner circle of Socrates' followers.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.48, 3.10.17,&lt;/ref&gt; He appears in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' as a main discussion partner of Socrates alongside Cebes, as well as ''[[Crito]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Crito'', 45b&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedrus'', 242b&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Epistles (Plato)|Epistle]]'' ''[[Epistles (Plato)#Thirteenth Letter|XIII]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Epistle XIII'', 363a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Plato's ''Phaedo''==
Simmias is one of Socrates' interlocutors in Plato's ''Phaedo''. This is a philosophical [[Socratic dialogue|dialogue]] by Plato, so the analogy presented in it by the character Simmias, although summarized here, need not reflect the views of the historical Simmias.

'''Simmias' attunement analogy'''&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedo'', 86a&lt;/ref&gt;
# Body is visible, composite and mortal.
# A harp is visible, composite and mortal.
# When the harp is destroyed the tune which is ethereal, invisible and divine is also destroyed.
# The [[soul]] is like a tune (''harmonia'') of the parts of the body. If the body is destroyed, the tune cannot survive.

Socrates attacks Simmias's Analogy with four different arguments:&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Phaedo'', 92a7-95a6&lt;/ref&gt;
# Harmonia-argument would be a contradiction to the [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]-argument that Simmias had already agreed on before.
# If the soul would be a tune, and bodies can be tuned differently, there would be more or lesser souls - which is not possible. 
# Virtue is the proper attunement of the soul, and vice the lack of such an attunement. But if the soul itself is an attunement, then virtue and vice would be attunements of an attunement. But an attunement can't participate in non-attunement. So if a soul is a perfect attunement, it could not have virtue or vice.
# The soul is the ruling principle of the body. But attunement is governed by the material of the musical instrument. By analogy, that would make the body the ruler of the soul.

Thus, Simmias' argument cannot be upheld.

==Later tradition==
In addition to the references in Plato and Xenophon, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] mentions Simmias as the author of 23 brief dialogues, now lost, including ''On Philosophy'' and ''On Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ii. 124&lt;/ref&gt;  Simmias appears as a character in [[Plutarch]]'s ''De Genio Socratis'' section of the ''[[Moralia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 7.46, 575-598&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sri Yukteswar Giri''' (also written '''Sriyuktesvara''', '''Sri Yukteshwar''') ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|श्रीयुक्तेश्वर गिरि}}, {{lang-bn|শ্রীযুক্তেশ্বর গিরী}}) (10 May 1855 – 9 March 1936) is the monastic name of '''Priya Nath Karar''' ({{lang-bn|প্রিয়নাথ কাঁড়ার}}), the [[guru]] of [[Satyananda Giri]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]. Sri Yukteswar was a [[Kriya Yoga|Kriya yogi]], a [[Jyotisha]] (Vedic astrologer), a scholar of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the Upanishads, an educator and an astronomer. He was a disciple of [[Lahiri Mahasaya]] of [[Varanasi]] and a member of the ''Giri'' branch of the [[Dasanami Sannyasi|swami]] order. Yogananda considered Sri Yukteswar as ''Jnanavatar'', or "Incarnation of Wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramahansa (1997). ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 1997 Anniversary Edition p. 383. Self-Realization Fellowship (Founded by Yogananda) http://www.yogananda-srf.org/, Chapter 35, p.383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sri Yukteswar was born as Priya Nath Karar in [[Serampore]], [[India]] to Kshetranath Karar and Kadambini. Priya Nath lost his father at a young age, and took on much of the responsibility for managing his family's land holdings.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; A bright student, he passed the entrance exams and enrolled in Srirampur Christian Missionary College, where he developed an interest in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Satyananda, p. 12"&gt;Satyananda, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This interest would later express itself in his book, ''[[The Holy Science]]'', which discusses the unity behind the scientific principles underlying Yoga and the Bible. He also attended [[Calcutta Medical College]] (then affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]]) for almost two years.&lt;ref name="Satyananda, p. 12"/&gt;

After leaving college, Priya Nath married and had a daughter. His wife died a few years after their marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, pp. 12, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and he eventually was formally initiated into the monastic Swami order as "Sri Yuktesvar Giri" (note: thus 'Sri' is not a separate [[honorific]], but part of his given name). "...many follow the usual procedure (for writing or saying someone's name informally) and drop the "Sri" and say only "Yukteswar", but this is not correct. If one wants to put a "Sri" at the beginning as in the prevalent fashion, then his name would look as: "Sri Sriyukteswar Giri".&lt;ref name="Satyananda, p. 38"&gt;Satyananda, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884, Priya Nath met [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], who became his Guru and initiated him into the path of [[Kriya Yoga]].&lt;ref name="Yogananda, p. 324"&gt;Yogananda, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Yukteswar spent a great deal of time in the next several years in the company of his guru, often visiting Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. In 1894, while attending the [[Kumbha Mela]] in Allahabad, he met the Guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, [[Mahavatar Babaji]],&lt;ref name="Yogananda, p. 324"/&gt; who asked Sri Yukteswar to write a book comparing Hindu scriptures and the Christian bible.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahavatar Babaji also bestowed on Sri Yukteswar the title of 'Swami' at that meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Yukteswar completed the requested book in 1894, naming it ''Kaivalya Darsanam'', or ''The Holy Science''.&lt;ref name="Sri Yukteswar, introduction"&gt;Sri Yukteswar, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual life==
Sri Yukteswar converted his large two-story family home in Serampore into an ashram, named "Priyadham",&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; where he resided with students and disciples. In 1903, he also established an ashram in the seaside town of [[Puri]], naming it "Karar Ashram".&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; From these two ashrams, Sri Yukteswar taught students, and began an organisation named "Sadhu Sabha".&lt;ref name="Satyananda, p. 38"/&gt;

An interest in education resulted in Sri Yukteswar developing a syllabus for schools, on the subjects of physics, physiology, geography, astronomy, and astrology&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a book for Bengalis on learning basic English and Hindi called ''First Book'', and wrote a basic book on astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he became interested in the education of women, which was uncommon in Bengal at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yukteswar was especially skilled in [[Jyotiṣa]] (Indian astrology), and prescribed various astrological gemstones and bangles to his students.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied astronomy and science, as evidenced in the formulation of his ''Yuga theory'' in ''The Holy Science''.&lt;ref name="Sri Yukteswar, introduction"/&gt;

[[Image:Sriyukteswaryogananda.JPG|160px|right|thumb|Sri Yukteswar and his disciple, Paramahansa Yogananda]]He had only a few long-term disciples, but in 1910, the young Mukunda Lal Ghosh would become Sri Yukteswar's most well known disciple, eventually spreading the teachings of [http://www.yogananda-srf.org/tmp/meditation.aspx?id=116 Kriya Yoga] throughout the world as [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] with his church of all religions – [[Self-Realization Fellowship]]/[[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]]. Yogananda attributed Sri Yukteswar's small number of disciples to his strict training methods, which Yogananda said "cannot be described as other than drastic".&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the role of the Guru, Sri Yukteswar said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look, there is no point in blindly believing that after I touch you, you will be saved, or that a chariot from heaven will be waiting for you. Because of the guru's attainment, the sanctifying touch becomes a helper in the blossoming of Knowledge, and being respectful towards having acquired this blessing, you must yourself become a sage, and proceed on the path to elevate your Soul by applying the techniques of sadhana given by the guru.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author [[W.Y. Evans-Wentz]] described his impression of Sri Yukteswar in the preface to Yogananda's ''[[s:Autobiography of a Yogi|Autobiography of a Yogi]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration, which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yukteswar attained [[mahasamadhi]] at Karar Ashram, Puri, India on 9 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Holy Science==
{{Main article|The Holy Science}}
Sri Yukteswar wrote ''[[The Holy Science]]'' in 1894.&lt;ref name=holy&gt;Sri Yukteswar Giri, The Holy Science. Yogoda Satsanga Society, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose of this book is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.&lt;ref name=holy/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The work introduced many ideas that were revolutionary for the time{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} – for instance Sri Yukteswar broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of [[Kali Yuga]], but has advanced to [[Dwapara Yuga]].&lt;ref name=holy/&gt; His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes. He also introduced the idea that the sun takes a 'star for its dual', and revolves around it in a period of 24,000 years, which accounts for the precession of the [[equinox]].&lt;ref name=holy/&gt; Research into this theory is being conducted by the Binary Research Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.binaryresearchinstitute.org/| title = Binary Research Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced a documentary on the topic titled ''The Great Year'', narrated by [[James Earl Jones]].&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thegreatyeardvd.com/| title = The Great Year DVD| accessdate = December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; There is an Apple iPhone Application for calculating Sri Yukteswar's calculations, just as there are calculators for currencies, lengths, areas and volumes.

The theory of the Sun's binary companion expounded by Sri Yukteswar in ''The Holy Science'' has attracted the attention of [[David Frawley]], who has written about it in several of his books. According to Frawley, the theory offers a better estimate of the age of [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] and other important historical Indian figures than other dating methods, which estimate some of these figures to have lived millions of years ago – belying accepted human history.&lt;ref&gt;Frawley, pp. 55–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theology Today''''' is an [[academic journal]] published by [[SAGE Publications]] for the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]; it was formerly published by [[Westminster John Knox]]. It appears four times a year.

The first issue of Theology Today appeared in April, 1944. The lead editorial, "Our Aims," by founder and [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] [[John A. Mackay]], President of [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], set forth the aims of the journal as adopted by its Editorial Council. These were:
# "To contribute to the restoration of theology in the world of today as the supreme science, of which both religion and culture stand in need for their renewal."
# "To study the central realities of Christian faith and life, and to set forth their meaning in clear and appropriate language."
# "To explore afresh the truths which were rediscovered by the Protestant Reformation, especially the tradition usually called Reformed, and to show their relevancy to the contemporary problems of the Church and society."
# "To provide an organ in which Christians whose faith is rooted in the revelation of God in the Bible and in Jesus Christ, and who are engaged in different spheres of intellectual activity, may combine their insights into the life of man in the light of God, with a view to interpreting our human situation and developing a Christian philosophy of life."&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Our Aims," Theology Today, vol. 1, no. 1 (April, 1944), 4,5,7, and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven years the journal "achieved an established place in the world of religious thought", and Hugh Thomson Kerr assumed the role of editor as Mackay became Chairman of the Editorial Council.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, "Other Frontiers Call," Theology Today, vol. 8, no. 1 (April, 1951), 3,4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes continued over the years. F.W. Dillistone, a long serving member of the Editorial Council, discussed new emphases and developments confronting theologians that occurred during his tenure. Among other issues he noted the collapse of barriers brought about by [[Vatican II]], and that the editorial board included Roman Catholic Scholars. Catholic writers and reviewers regularly contributed to ''Theology Today''.&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Dillistone, "Retrospective For Today," Theology Today, vol. 40, no. 4 (January, 1984), 394-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the journal is edited by Gordon S. Mikoski (Princeton Theological Seminary).

{{dict}}'''Transcendent truths''' are those unaffected by [[time]] or [[space]]. They define the world, but are not defined by the world. An example of a transcendent [[truth]] is "[[God]] is good", or "there is no God". Either way, how one looks at things contained by time and space is a result of the transcendent truth. One is true; both cannot be true at the same time.

[[World view]]s are made up of transcendent truths, things we believe are true before we question whether or not anything else is true.

'''The Transcendent Truth''' is the only Truth that is, ultimately, beyond human comprehension and before all concepts. It is beyond reality, and is the [[Creator deity|Creator]] of realities, existence, time and all there is, was and is yet to be. It is the Light that sacred texts speak of that illuminates hearts with knowledge from a Source beyond  our universe. It is actually the true definition of God. Gandhi once signed a photograph of himself with the text "God is truth". Buddha once said that truth is the saviour from sin. And Christ said to His disciples "I am the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;''The Wisdom and Mystery of Truth'', by Fortune L Majola. The book has its own Facebook page by the same name, and so does its publisher. (Published by Buddha Palm Productions in 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5321">'''Triphon Silyanovski''', ({{lang-bg|Трифон Силяновски}}) ({{birth date|1923|12|16}} &amp;ndash; {{death date|2005|5|19}}), born in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[composer]], [[pianist]], [[pedagogue]] and musical [[theory|theoretician]]. He died at the age of 81.

== Life and career ==
Triphon Silyanovsky graduated both from the Law Faculty of [[Sofia University]] and from the State Academy of Music, Sofia majoring in Composition under Professor [[Pancho Vladigerov]] and in Piano under Professor [[Dimitar Nenov]]. He also studied [[History of Art]] and Stylistics with [[Hans Sedlmayr]] in [[Vienna]] (1941–43). In 1948 he won the first Bulgarian Singers’ and Instrumentalists’ Competition, an event that resulted in a number of recordings for the [[Bulgarian National Radio]]’s Golden Fund.

After the instauration of the [[communist regime]] in 1944, his professional career was interrupted and his music was banished up to 1959. He was persecuted by the authorities for political reasons and was sent to a [[concentration camp]] (1949–51); he was periodically jailed thereafter and was exiled from Sofia. He got a living as a labourer, played the piano in restaurants and taught [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. Not until 1959 was he allowed to work as an [[accompanist]] at Sofia Opera.

In 1973 Silyanovsky co-founded, with the director Plamen Kartalov, the Blagoevgrad Chamber Opera where he worked as music director until 1982. He then taught Score Reading at Plovdiv Academy of Music and Dance Art (1982–91).

After the fall of the communist regime at the end of the 1980s he joined the staff of the State Academy of Music in Sofia and was made professor extraordinary (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultura.bg/media/my_html/2370/memts.htm Triphon Silyanovsky (1923-2005)], Kultura, 20, 27 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Triphon Silyanovsky composed three symphonies; three concertos for string orchestra, piano concerto and other orchestral works; choral opuses; chamber and solo songs. Thematic material is often related to [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] chant. His professionally crafted scores are distinguished by an individual style, rigorous structural clarity, dense textures and complex polyphony.

He authored books,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.online.bg/kultura/my_html/2236/silianov.htm ''The German Symphonism. Style and Interpretation Problems'' by Triphon Silyanovsky], Peter Shopov, Kultura, 28, 12 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; studies and over 70 unpublished research works in the field of [[philosophy]], [[aesthetics]], [[theology]], [[art history]], [[political sciences]], but also on problems related to music [[Aesthetic interpretation|interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubc-bg.com/en/composer/142 Triphon Silyanovski, composer, music theoretician, pedagogue, pianist - Union of the Bulgarian Composers]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26160">'''Youth empowerment''' is a process where children and young people are encouraged to take charge of their lives. They do this by addressing their situation and then take action in order to improve their access to resources and transform their consciousness through their beliefs, values, and attitudes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empowerment of women for health promotion: a meta-analysis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953699002002|journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine|date = 1999-12-01|pages = 1431–1460|volume = 49|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00200-2|first = Snehendu B|last = Kar|first2 = Catherine A|last2 = Pascual|first3 = Kirstin L|last3 = Chickering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth empowerment aims to improve quality of life. Youth empowerment is achieved through participation in youth empowerment programs. However scholars argue that children’s rights implementation should go beyond learning about formal rights and procedures to give birth to a concrete experience of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golay|first1=Dominique|last2=Malatesta|first2=Dominique|title=Children's councils implementation : a path toward recognition ? In D. Stoecklin &amp; J.-M. Bonvin (Eds.), Children’s Rights and the Capability Approach. Challenges and Prospects|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|pages=109–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous models that youth empowerment programs use that help youth achieve empowerment. A variety of youth empowerment initiatives are underway around the world. These programs can be through non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.

Youth empowerment is different than youth development because development is centered on developing individuals, while empowerment is focused on creating greater community change relies on the development of individual capacity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.youthempoweredsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Youth_Empowerment_The_Theory_and_Its_Implementation_YES-11-13-13.pdf|title = Youth Empowerment: The theory and its implementation|date = 2013|accessdate = November 21, 2015|website = Youth Empowerment Solutions|publisher = Youth Empowerment Solutions|last = Ledford|first = Meredith King|last2 = Lucas|first2 = Bronwyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empowerment movements, including youth empowerment, originate, gain momentum, become viable, and become institutionalized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Youth empowerment is often addressed as a gateway to [[intergenerational equity]], [[civic engagement]] and [[democracy building]]. Activities may focus on [[youth-led media]], [[youth rights]], [[youth council]]s, youth [[activism]], youth involvement in community decision-making,&lt;ref name="Sazama, J. 2006"&gt;Sazama, J. &amp; Young, K. (2006) ''15 Points to Successfully Involving Youth in Decision-Making,'' Boston: Youth jHGbagY On Board.&lt;/ref&gt; and other methods.

== Elements of empowerment ==

=== Empowerment theory ===
Empowerment theory focuses on processes that enable participation; enhance control through shared decision making; and create opportunities to learn, practice, and increase skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-4193-6_2|title=Empowerment Theory|last=Zimmerman|first=Marc A.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461368816|editor-last=Rappaport|editor-first=Julian|pages=43–63|language=en|editor-last2=Seidman|editor-first2=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Marc A.|date=1995-10-01|title=Psychological empowerment: Issues and illustrations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1007/BF02506983/abstract|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=5|pages=581–599|doi=10.1007/BF02506983|issn=1573-2770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment theory suggests that engaging youth in pro-social, meaningful, and community-enhancing activities that the youth themselves define and control, helps youth gain vital skills, responsibilities, and confidence necessary to become productive and healthy adults.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reischl|first=Thomas M.|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Marc A.|last3=Morrel-Samuels|first3=Susan|last4=Franzen|first4=Susan P.|last5=Faulk|first5=Monique|last6=Eisman|first6=Andria B.|last7=Roberts|first7=Everett|date=2011-12-01|title=Youth empowerment solutions for violence prevention|journal=Adolescent Medicine: State of the Art Reviews|volume=22|issue=3|pages=581–600, xiii|issn=1934-4287|pmid=22423465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of empowerment ===
Youth empowerment examines six interdependent dimensions: psychological, community, organizational, economic, social and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Psychological empowerment enhances individual's consciousness, belief in self-efficacy, awareness and knowledge of problems and solutions and of how individuals can address problems that harm their quality of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This dimension aims to create self-confidence and give youth the skills to acquire knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Community empowerment network|Community empowerment]] focuses on enhancing the community through leadership development, improving communication, and creating a network of support to mobilize the community to address concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Organizational empowerment aims to create a base of resources for a community, including voluntary organizations, unions and associations that aim to protect, promote and advocate for the powerless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Economic empowerment teaches entrepreneurial skills, how to take ownership of their assets and how to have income security.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Social empowerment teaches youth about social inclusion and literacy as well as helping kids find the resources to be proactive in their communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cultural empowerment aims to recreate cultural practices and redefine cultural rules and norms for youth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Edralin, Divina M.; Tibon, Maria Victoria P.; Tugas,, Florenz C. (Jan 2015). "Initiating Women Empowerment and Youth Development through Involvement in Non-Formal Education in Three Selected Parishes: An Action Research on Poverty Alleviation". ''DLSU Business &amp; Economics Review''. Vol. 24 (Issue 2,): p108–123. {{ISSN|0116-7111}}. Retrieved October 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Through these dimensions of empowerment, programs can work on empowering youth in one or more aspects of their lives.

=== Goals of empowerment ===
Youth empowerment programs are aimed at creating healthier and higher qualities of life for underprivileged or at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The five competencies of a healthy youth are: (1) positive sense of self, (2) self- control, (3) decision-making skills, (4) a moral system of belief, and (5) pro-social connectedness. Developmental interventions and programs have to be anchored on these competencies that define positive outcomes of healthy youth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Measurable empowerment ===
Over the last two decades, [[quality of life]] (QOL) has emerged as an important unit of measurement to evaluate the success of empowerment programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used as a goal of programs and as well as an indicator of effectiveness. However, there is no standard definition of QOL. A person's QOL is dependent upon subjective evaluation of the individual aspects of that individual's life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Positive development settings ===
Youth empowerment programs thrive in positive developmental settings. Positive developmental settings promote youth competence, confidence and connections.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Youth–Adult Partnership: Exploring Contributions to Empowerment, Agency and Community Connections in Malaysian Youth Programs|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-013-0027-1|journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date = 2013-10-12|issn = 0047-2891|pages = 1550–1562|volume = 43|issue = 9|doi = 10.1007/s10964-013-0027-1|first = Steven Eric|last = Krauss|first2 = Jessica|last2 = Collura|first3 = Shepherd|last3 = Zeldin|first4 = Adriana|last4 = Ortega|first5 = Haslinda|last5 = Abdullah|first6 = Abdul Hadi|last6 = Sulaiman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two features of the positive developmental youth settings are supportive relationships and support for efficacy and mattering. Supportive relationships are those that are between youth and non-familial adults that foster trust and respect. Support for efficacy and mattering specifically focuses on youth being active, instrumental agents of change in their communities, collective decision-making and adults listen to and respect their voice.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Youth empowerment programs ==
There are various types of empowerment programs across the globe that empower youth through many different tactics and programs. Programs can operate in a variety of settings. The majority of programs operate in more than one setting, which may be a key factor in their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Positive Youth Development in the United States: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url = http://ann.sagepub.com/content/591/1/98|journal = The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 0002-7162|pages = 98–124|volume = 591|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0002716203260102|first = Richard F.|last = Catalano|first2 = M. Lisa|last2 = Berglund|first3 = Jean A. M.|last3 = Ryan|first4 = Heather S.|last4 = Lonczak|first5 = J. David|last5 = Hawkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beneficial outcomes to youth empowerment programs are improved social skills, improved behavior, increased academic achievement, increased self-esteem and increased self-efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Youth empowerment programs|url = http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/policies/youth-empowerment-programs|website = County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are programs are aimed at just empowering women and young girls. Regardless of specific goals or methods, empowering effects include improving women’s wellbeing, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, and enhancing social status by teaching technical and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Other youth empowerment programs are focused on [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]]. Living standards are for those living in poverty are declining causing forms of deprivation as it relates to food, resources and education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Matin, I., &amp; Hulme, D. (2003). Programs for the poorest: Learning from the IGVGD program in Bangladesh. ''World Development'', 31(3), 647-665.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs aimed at empowering poor youth, work toward livelihood protection or livelihood promotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There are also empowerment movements that use the [[social action model]], aiming for disadvantaged people to become empowered, organized, and educated so that they may create change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These programs advocate for constructive confrontations to enhance the social power of people who are considered disadvantaged. Another model is the 5C's model that focuses on emphasizing competence, confidence, connection, character and caring.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Linking the prevention of problem behaviors and positive youth development: Core competencies for positive youth development and risk prevention|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cd.225/abstract|journal = New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|date = 2008-12-01|issn = 1534-8687|pages = 1–17|volume = 2008|issue = 122|doi = 10.1002/cd.225|first = Nancy G.|last = Guerra|first2 = Catherine P.|last2 = Bradshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth C of contribution to society was later added.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This model focuses primarily on engagement as a key marker of positive youth development, emphasizing the need to foster initiative. [[Youth-adult partnership]]s are another type of empowerment method used around the world. This method has been defined as a developmental process and a community practice. The partnership involves people of different ages working together on community issues over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The method emphasizes reciprocity among adults and youth with a focus on shared decision making and reflective learning. The concept of shared control is key for empowering youth.

Youth empowerment has also been used as a framework to prevent and reduce youth violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franzen|first=Susan|last2=Morrel-Samuels|first2=Susan|last3=Reischl|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Zimmerman|first4=Marc A.|date=2009-10-16|title=Using Process Evaluation to Strengthen Intergenerational Partnerships in the Youth Empowerment Solutions Program|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10852350903196290|journal=Journal of Prevention &amp; Intervention in the Community|volume=37|issue=4|pages=289–301|doi=10.1080/10852350903196290|issn=1085-2352|pmid=19830624}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that these youth empowerment programs can improve conflict avoidance and resolution skills, increase group leadership skills, and civic efficacy &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and improve ethnic identity and reduce racial conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuentes|first=Vanessa E.|last2=Goncy|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Sutherland|first3=Kevin S.|date=2016-05-17|title=Cross-Cultural Perspectives After Participation in the YES Program: A Pilot Study|url=http://jyd.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jyd/article/view/8|journal=Journal of Youth Development|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|issn=2325-4017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of youth empowerment programs  ===

Around the globe there are various empowerment programs focused on a wide variety of things and this is not a comprehensive list. Unsuccessful youth empowerment programs have not been carefully documented or published in case studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In India, Youth Empowerment Foundation, a not for profit organization is focused at uplifting the underprivileged young generation of the society right from providing them with basic education to create a strong foundation for their careers, to developing personality skills, because the youth is the future of the country.
 
In Namibia, one popular empowerment program is Pots of Hope. Pots of Hope's main goal is to reduce the vulnerability youth to HIV and Aids through education, information and awareness, as well as income security projects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Mutumbulwa, Fransina. "Empowering youth and women through Pots of Hope." Sister Namibia 20.3 (2008): 16+. Global Issues In Context. Web. 9 Oct. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Pots of Hope works by educating, and providing counseling to those in rural settings who do not have access to those resources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This program focuses on organizational empowerment within the community.
[[File:Georgia 4-H Communications Team.jpg|thumb|Youth participating in 4-H, a youth empowerment organization primarily in the United States.]]
Within the United States there are countless empowerment programs for youth. Urban [[4-H]] is a culturally responsive, community-based practice that authentically engages families, youth and the community in the development of youth.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Landrieu, Josey; Pierson Russo, Jessica.

Urban 4-H focuses on empowering youth to think critically, communicate across cultural boundaries and lead others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In India, youth empowerment has been taken up by other organizations run by young people. [[Young India Foundation]] has been working on youth empowerment by directly engaging young people and electoral politics, a first for an organization to do in India.&lt;ref&gt;https://youngindiafoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations has numerous development programs, one of them being youth empowerment programs. The United Nations provides support to national policy development surrounding empowerment within the five regions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Youth empowerment|url = http://www.undp.org/youth|website = UNDP|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do this by providing evidence-based policy guidance and programmatic support by promoting the active participation of youth in society. The [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] promotes inclusive youth participation in effective and democratic governance, economic empowerment of youth, strengthened youth engagement in building resilience in their communities, inclusion of youth in the future development agenda, including through consultations and discussions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The United Nations youth empowerment programs examine all four dimensions of youth empowerment and seeks to improve all of them.

[[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] has youth empowerment programs set up around the world that are aimed at civic engagement, access to resources and opportunities for education and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Highlights: USAID Youth Programs|url = https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/fact-sheets/global-highlights-usaid-youth-programs|website = www.usaid.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government involvement in empowerment ==
Youth empowerment is often addressed as a gateway to [[intergenerational equity]], [[civic engagement]] and [[democracy building]]. Local, state, provincial, regional, national, and international government agencies and nonprofit community-based organizations provide programs centered on youth empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;(1998) [http://www.joe.org/joe/1998december/a1.html "Examining empowerment: A 'how-to' guide for youth development professionals"] ''Journal of Extension,'' December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Activities involved therein may focus on [[youth-led media]], [[youth rights]], [[youth council]]s, youth [[activism]], youth involvement in community decision-making,&lt;ref name="Sazama, J. 2006"/&gt; and other methods.

Each major political party in the United States, including the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], as well as several major European, African, South American (Peru), and Australian political parties have statements supporting youth empowerment. Youth empowerment is also a central tenet of [[United Nations|the United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which every country in the world (minus the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]]) has signed into law.

=== United States ===
Youth empowerment occurs in [[home]]s, at [[schools]], through [[youth organizations]], government policy-making and [[community organizing]] campaigns. Major structural activities where youth empowerment happens throughout society include community [[decision-making]], organizational planning, and education reform.

Educational activities that cite youth empowerment as an aim include [[student-centered learning]], [[popular education]], and [[service learning]]. [[Democratic education|Free schools]] and [[youth-led media]] organizations often state their intention to empower youth, as well as [[youth voice]], [[community youth development]], and [[youth leadership]] programs. Youth empowerment is studied by a variety of scholars including [[Shawn Ginwright]], [[Henry Giroux]], [[Barry Checkoway]], [[Mike Males]] and [[Marc A. Zimmerman]]. Their research is highlighted by advocacy from notable activists such as [[William Upski Wimsatt]], [[Alex Koroknay-Palicz]], Salome Chasnoff and [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]].

=== Republic of Ireland ===
{{main|Comhairle na nÓg}}

In 2002 [[Comhairle na nÓg]] was established in each local authority area as part of the National Children's strategy. Comhairle na nÓg is Irish for Youth Council. These councils are encouraged to include the participation of young people from all walks of life and to tackle local issues affecting young people. It is run by the local county or city councils under the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It is a recognized political organisation by the Irish Government. An extension of Comhairle na nÓg is the Comhairle na nÓg National Executive. The National Executive has one "youth councillor" from every Comhairle na nÓg and deal with issues important to young people. These issues are nominated by young people themselves at an AGM every two years. The Comhairle na nÓg National Executive has the opportunity to express there views in a form of a researched report, ad-campaign, conferences, seminars and to put those views to policy makers.

=== Commonwealth ===
The 53 member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] have all signed up to the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment (2007–2015). The Plan of Action underpins the work of the [[Commonwealth Youth Programme]] (CYP). On the Commonwealth definition, "Young people are empowered when they acknowledge that they have or can create choices in life, are aware of the implications of those choices, make an informed decision freely, take action based on that decision and accept responsibility for the consequences of those actions. Empowering young people means creating and supporting the enabling conditions under which young people can act on their own behalf, and on their own terms, rather than at the direction of others."

The Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment was developed by the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], working closely with Ministers of Youth and young people themselves. It encourages [[youth mainstreaming]] and contains thirteen action points for governments. The first of these is: “Develop and implement measures to promote the economic enfranchisement of young people” through a range of measures ranging from micro-credit and entrepreneurship education through to reviewing  macro-economic planning and trade regimes and how they affect young people. Other action points address gender equality, HIV/AIDS, education, the environment, youth participation in decision-making, and democracy and human rights.

== Benefits of empowerment ==
When youth participate in established empowerment programs they see a variety of benefits. The practices of youth involvement and empowerment become embedded within the organizational culture and the community culture.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Adults and organizations also benefit from empowerment programs. The both become more communicable and responsive to youth in the community, which leads to program improvements as well as increased participation from youth.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Critiques of youth empowerment ==
One major critique of youth empowerment is that most programs take a risk-focused approach.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; There has been a major emphasis on what is going wrong for youth in their lives rather than what goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that adolescence is a time when young people master skills and concepts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
