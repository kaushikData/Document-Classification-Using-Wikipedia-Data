The '''Algerian Red Crescent Society''' is an [[Algeria]]n humanitarian volunteer organization founded in 1957. It has only been recognized by the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] since 1963.

==History and Creation of the Algerian Red Crescent==
The Algerian Red Crescent society was born out of the preliminary humanitarian missions by the Internal Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) during the [[Algerian War]]  of 1954-1962.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; Although the colonial French government did provide Algerian students with education in regards to human rights, they did not have explicit access to these rights in certain politically-motivated situations.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 708&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for the International Committee of the Red Cross was represented in their first mission on February 1, 1955, when the organization send aid to detainees and their families, who were experiencing human rights violations and mistreatment during their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, joined by a medical professional, the ICRC conducted meetings with prison inmates and staff in regards to the condition of sanitary facilities, dorms and kitchens, as well as investigations into medical treatment and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 715&lt;/ref&gt; The success of this mission brought relief, supplies, recommendations and set a precedent for the ICRC to return again from May 12-June 28, 1956 to visit 61 internment camps, where they found evidence of torture and misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 718&lt;/ref&gt; These findings were important to the January 10th, 1957 establishment of the Algerian Red Crescent, as a more consistent presence was needed in Algiers to monitor human rights in detention centres.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 722&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was actually first established in two locations, [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]], where the leadership of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front (NLF)]] were living in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Jennifer|title=The Battle for Algeria: Sovereignty, Health Care, and Humanitarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvAfCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=2015|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-8122-9200-8|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mamia Chentouf]] was one of the founders in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=(منصر) Mansar|first1=(زهية) Zahia|title=مامية شنتوف تلتحق ببيار شولي إلى الرفيق الأعلى|url=http://www.al-fadjr.com/ar/index.php?news=227410?print|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=''Al Fadjr''|date=10 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223707/http://www.al-fadjr.com/ar/index.php?news=227410%3Fprint|archivedate=2017-10-09|location=Algiers, Algeria|language=Arabic|trans-title=Chentouf's mother joins Pierre Schully as the Comrade's Supreme Comrade|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tahri|first1=Hamid|title=Mamia Chentouf, Moudjahida, membre fondatrice de l'UNFA: «Je me sens toujours engagée»|url=http://elwatan.com/archives/rubrique.php?ed=2008-05-15&amp;rub=ew:w:hebdo:portrait|accessdate=9 October 2017|publisher=''[[El Watan]]''|date=15 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025032319/http://elwatan.com/archives/rubrique.php?ed=2008-05-15&amp;rub=ew:w:hebdo:portrait|archivedate=25 October 2012|location=Algiers, Algeria|language=French|trans-title=Mamia Chentouf, Moudjahida, founding member of UNFA: "I still feel committed"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its establishment, the Algerian Red Crescent aided the ICRC in providing aid to the forty thousand refugees in neighbouring [[Morocco]], as a result of their newly granted independence on March 2, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Perret and Bugnion 2011, p. 723&lt;/ref&gt;

== Algerian Red Crescent missions ==
Since the formation of the Algerian Red Crescent in 1957, the organization has remained active in providing humanitarian assistance throughout Algeria. As Pierre Gaillard remarked from his personal experience with the Algerian Red Crescent when an Israeli plane from the airline [[El Al]] was hijacked to Algiers in 1962, the Algerian Red Crescent was active in receiving the ICRC delegate as well as directing those responsible for prosecution, effectively preserving the safety of Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Algerian War: memoirs of an ICRC delegate - ICRC|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/interview/2011/algeria-history-al-insani-2011-04-01.htm|website=www.icrc.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en-us|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, on October 18, 2008, the Algerian Red Crescent responded to a catastrophic mudslide in the region of [[Ghardaïa]] that resulted in a dozen casualties, as well as the displacement of over one thousand Algerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria floods and mudslides - IFRC|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/middle-east-and-north-africa/algeria/algeria-floods-and-mudslides/|website=www.ifrc.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over four-hundred and fifty Algerian Red Crescent members contributed to the relief effort by evacuating civilians, providing first aid and distributing emergency relief including temporary housing, water purification tablets, sanitary supplies, blankets, kitchen utensils, basic health care and psychological support programs.

On June 3, 2016, the organization provided five hundred parcels of nutritional aid to the communities of [[Tizi Mahdi]], [[Bouaichoune]], [[Bouchrahil]], and Guelb El Kebir in the Wilaya de Médea region after the already socially-stratified sub-village settlements ([[Hameaux]]) were hit by an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opération de solidarité en faveur des populations des villages déshérités de la Wilaya de Médea|url=http://www.cra-algerie.org/main/old/ar03062016.html|website=www.cra-algerie.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the [[Arabs]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]], [[mysticism]] (etc.) are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40043536|title=Beauty in Arabic culture|last=Doris.|first=Behrens-Abouseif,|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=1558761993|oclc=40043536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions including [[Greater Maghreb|Al-Maghrib Al-Arabi]] (consisting of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania), [[Fertile Crescent]] (consisting of Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (consisting of south Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya,  Oman and the UAE) and the Arabian Peninsula's Al-Janoub Al-Arabi (consisting of Yemen and Oman).

==Literature==
{{main article|Arabic literature}}
[[Arabic literature]] is the writing produced, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], by speakers of the [[Arabic language]]. It does not include works written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] but not in the Arabic language such as [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Urdu literature]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''[[Adab (literature)|adab]]'' which is derived from a word meaning "to invite someone for a meal" and implies politeness, culture and enrichment. Arabic literature emerged in the 6th century, with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], from the 7th century, had the greatest and longest-lasting effect on Arabic culture and literature. [[Al-Khansa]], a female contemporary of Muhammad, was an acclaimed Arab poet.

[[File:Antarah ibn Shaddad &amp; Abla.jpg|thumb|[[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antara and Abla]], the Arab [[Romeo and Juliet]]]]

===Mu'allaqat===
{{Main article| Muallaqat}}
The [[Mu'allaqat]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المعلقات, {{IPA-ar|al-muʕallaqaːt|}}) is the name given to a series of seven Arabic poems or [[qasida]] that originated before the time of Islam. Each poem in the set has a different author, and is considered to be their best work. Mu'allaqat means "The Suspended Odes" or "The Hanging Poems," and comes from the poems being hung on the wall in the Kaaba at Mecca.

The seven authors, who span a period of around 100 years, are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa]], [[Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma|Zuhayr]], [[Labīd]], [['Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [['Amr ibn Kulthum]], and [[Harith ibn Hilliza]]. All of the Mu’allaqats contain stories from the authors’ lives and tribe politics. This is because poetry was used in pre-Islamic time to advertise the strength of a tribe’s king, wealth and people.

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة}} ''ʾAlf layla wa-layla''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021|edition=3rd|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade, a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar (Šahryār), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Music==
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], [[Syria]], [[Ummayad]] [[caliphs]] Palace, built in the early 7th century]]
[[Arabic music]] is the [[music]] of [[Arabs|Arab people]], especially those centered around the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from [[Tunisia]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. Regional styles of [[popular music]] include Iraqian el Maqaam, [[Algeria]]n ''[[raï]]'', [[Kuwait]]i ''[[sawt (music)|sawt]]'' and [[Egypt]]ian ''[[el gil]]''.

"The common style that developed is usually called 'Islamic' or 'Arab', though in fact it transcends religious, ethnic, geographical, and linguistic boundaries" and it is suggested that it be called the [[Near East]] (from Morocco to India) style ([[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] (1996, p.xix-xx) lists "five components" which "characterize the music of the Arabs:
# The [[Arab tone system]] (a [[musical tuning]] system) with specific interval structures, invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
# [[Rhythmic-temporal structures]] that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'', used to accompany the metered vocal and instrumental genres and give them form.
# [[Musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arabian world and that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with standardized performance techniques, and exhibit similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts for the making of music, whereby [[Music genre|musical genres]] can be classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants).
# A musical mentality that is responsible for the aesthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures in Arabian music, whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]. The Arab's musical mentality is defined by:
## The maqām phenomenon.
## The predominance of vocal music.
## The predilection for small instrumental ensembles.
## The mosaiclike stringing together of musical form elements, that is, the arrangement in a sequence of small and smallest melodic elements, and their repetition, combination, and permutation within the framework of the tonal-spatial model.
## The absence of polyphony, polyrhythm, and motivic development. Arabian music is, however, very familiar with the ostinato, as well as with a more instinctive heterophonic way of making music.
## The alternation between a free rhythmic-temporal and fixed tonal-spatial organization on the one hand and a fixed rhythmic-temporal and free tonal-spatial structure on the other. This alternation... results in exciting contrasts."

Much Arab music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]] rather than [[harmony]]. Thus much Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]] in nature. Some genres of Arab music are [[polyphonic]]—as the instrument [[Kanun (instrument)|Kanoun]] is based upon the idea of playing two-note [[chord (music)|chords]]—but quintessentially, Arabic music is melodic.

It would be incorrect though to call it [[Musical mode|modal]], for the Arabic system is more complex than that of the [[Greece|Greek]] modes. The basis of the Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The maqam has a "[[tonality|tonal]]" note on which the piece must end (unless modulation occurs).

[[File:Riqq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[riq]] is widely used in Arabic music]]

The maqam consists of at least two jins, or scale segments. "Jins" in Arabic comes from the ancient Greek word "genus," meaning type. In practice, a jins (pl. ajnas) is either a [[trichord]], a [[tetrachord]], or a [[pentachord]]. The trichord is three notes, the tetrachord four, and the pentachord five. The maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (two jins), but sometimes it covers more than one octave. Like the [[Minor scale|melodic minor]] scale and Indian ragas, some maqamat have different ajnas, and thus notes, while descending or ascending. Because of the continuous innovation of jins and because most music scholars don't agree on the existing number anyway, it's hard to give an accurate number of the jins. Nonetheless, in practice most musicians would agree on the 8 most frequently used ajnas: Rast, Bayat, Sikah, Hijaz, Saba, Kurd, Nahawand, and Ajam — and a few of the most commonly used variants of those: Nakriz, Athar Kurd, Sikah Beladi, Saba Zamzama. Mukhalif is a rare jins used exclusively in Iraq, and it does not occur in combination with other ajnas.

The main difference between the western [[chromatic scale]] and the Arabic scales is the existence of many in-between notes, which are sometimes referred to as [[quarter tone]]s for the sake of practicality. However, while in some treatments of theory the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969) in practice there are many fewer tones (Touma 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;170).

In fact, the situation is much more complicated than that. In 1932, at International Convention on Arabic music held in Cairo, Egypt (attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]), experiments were done which determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale, and furthermore that the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq). The commission's recommendation is as follows: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are..." (translated in Maalouf 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;220). Both in modern practice, and based on the evidence from recorded music over the course of the last century, there are several differently tuned "E"s in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale, depending on the maqam or jins in use, and depending on the region.

Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as "quarter-tones" ("half-flat" or "half-sharp") for ease of nomenclature, but perform and teach the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Touma's comment above, that these "quarter-tones" are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]], and so the most commonly used "quarter tones" are on E (between E-flat and E-natural), A, B, D, F (between F-natural and F-sharp) and C.

The prototypical Arab ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], which includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[qanun (instrument)|qanún]], [[rabab]], nay, [[violin]] (which was introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santur]]—with [[riq]] and [[dumbek]].

Prior to the Islamic Era, [[poetry]] was regarded as the main means of communication on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It related the achievements of tribes and defeats of enemies and also served as a tool for [[propaganda]]. After the arrival of [[Islam]] other forms of communication replaced poetry as the primary form of communication. [[Imams]] (preachers) played a role in disseminating information and relating news from the authorities to the people. The suq or marketplace gossip and interpersonal relationships played an important role in the spreading of news, and this form of communication among [[Arabs]] continues today. Before the introduction of the [[printing press]] [[Muslims]] obtained most of their news from the imams at the [[mosque]], friends or in the marketplace. [[Colonial powers]] and [[Christian Missionaries]] in [[Lebanon]] were responsible for the introduction of the printing press. It was not until the 19th century that the first newspapers began to appear, mainly in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], which had the most newspapers per capita.

During [[France|French]] rule in [[Egypt]] in the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the first newspaper was published, in French. There is debate over when the first Arabic language newspaper was published; according to Arab scholar Abu Bakr, it was ''Al Tanbeeh'' (1800), published in Egypt, or it was ''Junral Al Iraq'' (1816), published in [[Iraq]], according to other researchers. In the mid-19th century the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] dominated the first newspapers. In the [[Northern Africa]]n countries of [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] the French colonial power built a press link between mainland countries.

The first newspapers were limited to official content and included accounts of relations with other countries and civil trials. In the following decades Arab media blossomed due to [[journalist]]s mainly from Syria and Lebanon, who were intellectuals and published their newspapers without the intention of making a profit. Because of the restrictions by most governments, these intellectuals were forced to flee their respective countries but had gained a following and because of their popularity in this field of work other intellectuals began to take interest in the field.
The first émigré Arab newspaper, ''Mar’at al Ahwal'', was published in Turkey in 1855 by Rizqallah Hassoun Al Halabi. It was criticized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shut down after only one year. Intellectuals in the [[Arab world]] soon realized the power of the press. Some countries' newspapers were government-run and had political agendas in mind. Independent newspapers began to spring up which expressed opinions and were a place for the public to out their views on the state. Illiteracy rates in the Arab world played a role in the formation of media, and due to the low reader rates newspapers were forced to get political parties to subsidize their publications, giving them input to editorial policy.

Freedoms that have branched through the introduction of the Internet in [[Middle East]] are creating a stir politically, culturally, and socially. There is an increasing divide between the generations. The Arab world is in conflict internally. The internet has brought economic prosperity and development, but [[blog]]gers have been incarcerated all around in the Middle East for their opinions and views on their regimes, the same consequence which was once given to those who publicly expressed themselves without anonymity. But the power of the internet has provided also a public shield for these bloggers since they have the ability to engage public sympathy on such a large scale. This is creating a dilemma that shakes the foundation of Arab culture, government, religious interpretation, economic prosperity, and personal integrity.

Each country or region in the Arab world has varying colloquial languages which are used for everyday speech, yet its presence in the media world is discouraged. Prior to the establishment of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), during the 19th century, the language of the media was stylized and resembled literary language of the time, proving to be ineffective in relaying information. Currently MSA is used by Arab media, including newspapers, books and some television stations, in addition to all formal writing. Vernaculars are however present in certain forms of media including satires, dramas, music videos and other local programs.

=== Media values ===

Journalism ethics is a system of values that determines what constitutes "good" and "bad" journalism.&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Kai|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=147–64|authorlink=The Unknown Desire for "Objectivity": Journalism Ethics in Arab (and Western) Journalism|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of media values consists of and is constructed by journalists'  and other actors'  decisions about issues like what is "newsworthy," how to frame the news, and whether to observe topical "red lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itule|first=Bruce|title=News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|author2=Douglas Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a system of values varies over space and time, and is embedded within the existing social, political, and economic structures in a society. William Rugh states, "There is an intimate, organic relationship between media institutions and society in the way that those institutions are organized and controlled. Neither the institution nor the society in which it functions can be understood properly without reference to the other. This is certainly true in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Media values in the Arab world therefore vary between and within countries. In the words of Lawrence Pintak and Jeremy Ginges, “The Arab media are not a monolith.”&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=2008|volume=13|issue=3|page=219|doi=10.1177/1940161208317142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists in the Arab world hold many of the same values with their news generation as do journalists in the [[Western world]]. Journalists in the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of journalist training programs in North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rampal|first=Kuldip Roy|title=Professionals in Search of Professionalism: Journalists' Dilemma in Four Maghreb States|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/001654929605800102}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.”&lt;ref name="Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramaprasad|first=Jyotika|author2=Naila Nabil Hamdy|title=Functions of Egyptian Journalists: Perceived Importance and Actual Importance|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=2006|volume=68|issue=2|pages=167–85|doi=10.1177/1748048506062233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Further, many journalists in the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 journalists in the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.&lt;ref name=Mission /&gt;

Important differences between journalists in the Arab world and their Western counterparts are also apparent.  Some journalists in the Arab world see no conflict between objectivity and support for political causes.&lt;ref name="Inside Arab Newsroom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=Inside the Arab Newsroom|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=2|page=173|doi=10.1080/14616700802337800}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ramprasad and Hamdy’s sample of 112 Egyptian journalists gave the highest importance to supporting [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]] and Arab values, which included injunctions such as “defend Islamic societies, traditions and values” and “support the cause of the Palestinians.” Sustaining democracy through “examining government policies and decisions critically,” ranked a close second.&lt;ref name=Function /&gt;  This view is further endorsed in Kirat’s survey where 65 percent of Algerian journalists agreed that the task for the press is to "help achieve the goals and objectives of development plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kirat, Mohamed. "The Algerian News People: A Study of Their Backgrounds, Professional Orientations and Working Conditions". Diss. Indiana University, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an approach to media fits within the larger scope of  [[development communication]] and journalism. The extent to which professional and political aims conflict is a subject of study for scholars of the Arab world's media.

Other journalists reject the notion of media ethics altogether because they see it as a mechanism of control. Kai Hafez states, “Many governments in the Arab world have tried to hijack the issue of media ethics and have used it as yet another controlling device, with the result that many Arab journalists, while they love to speak about the challenges of their profession, hate performing under the label of media ethics.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt;

Historically, news in the Arab world was used to inform, guide, and publicize the actions of political practitioners rather than being just a consumer product. The power of news as political tool was discovered in the early 19th century, with the purchase of shares from Le Temps a French newspaper by Ismail the grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Doing so allowed Ismail to publicize his policies.&lt;ref name=Ayalon&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|title=The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Media coming to modernity flourished and with it its responsibilities to the political figures that have governed its role. Ami Ayalon argues in his history of the press in the Arab Middle East that, “Private journalism began as an enterprise with very modest objectives, seeking not to defy authority but rather to serve it, to collaborate and coexist cordially with it. The demand for freedom of expression, as well as for individual political freedom, a true challenge to the existing order, came only later, and hesitantly at that, and was met by a public response that can best be described as faint." &lt;ref name=Ayalon /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Media researchers stress that the moral and social responsibility of newspeople dictates that they should not agitate public opinion, but rather should keep the status quo. It is also important to preserve national unity by not stirring up ethnic or religious conflict.&lt;ref name="Mellor, Noha 2005"&gt;Mellor, Noha. The Making of Arab News. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The values of media in the Arab world have started to change with the emergence of “new media." Examples of new media include news websites, blogs, and satellite television stations like [[Al Arabiya]]. The founding of the Qatari [[Al Jazeera]] network in 1996 especially affected media values. Some scholars believe that the network has blurred the line between private- and state- run news. Mohamed Zayani and Sofiane Sabraoui state, “Al Jazeera is owned by the government, but has an independent editorial policy; it is publicly funded, but independent minded.”&lt;ref name="Culture of Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zayani|first=Mohamed|title=The Culture of Al Jazeera: Inside an Arab Media Giant|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, NC|author2=Sofiane Sahroui}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Al Jazeera media network espouses a clear mission and strategy, and was one of the first news organizations in the Arab world to release a code of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"Code of Ethics." Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera Media Network, 07 Nov. 2010. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/2006/11/2008525185733692771.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its government ties, it seeks to “give no priority to commercial or political over professional consideration” and to “cooperate with Arab and international journalistic unions and associations to defend freedom of the press.” With a motto of “the view and the other view,” it purports to “present the diverse points of view and opinions without bias and partiality.” It has sought to fuse these ostensibly Western media norms with a wider “Arab orientation,” evocative of the social responsibility discussed by scholars such as Noha Mellor above.

Some more recent assessments of Al Jazeera have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized]] it for a lack of credibility in the wake of the Arab Spring. Criticism has come from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Jillian|title=Syrian TV Station Accuses Al Jazeera of Fabricating Uprising|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/syrian-tv-station-accuses-al-jazeera-of-fabricating-uprising/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=In Syria, al Jazeera’s Credibility Implodes|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/05/in-syria-al-jazeeras-credibility-implodes/|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media values are not the only variable that affects news output in Arab society. Hafez states, “The interaction of political, economic, and social environments with individual and collective professional ethics is the driving force behind journalism.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In most Arab countries, newspapers cannot be published without a government-issued license. Most Arab countries also have press laws, which impose boundaries on what can and cannot be said in print.

Censorship plays a significant role in journalism in the Arab world. Censorship comes in a variety of forms: [[Self-censorship]], Government [[Censorship]] (governments struggle to control through technological advances in ex. the internet), [[Ideology]]/Religious Censorship, and Tribal/Family/Alliances Censorship. Because [[Journalism]] in the Arab world comes with a range of dangers – journalists throughout the Arab world can be imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in their line of work – self-censorship is extremely important for many Arab journalists. A study conducted by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in Jordan, for example, found that the majority of Jordanian journalists exercise self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hazaimeh |first=Hani |title=Majority of Jordanian Journalists Exercise Self-censorship - Survey |url=http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |publisher=The Jordan Times |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083856/http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |archivedate=8 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] found that 34 journalists were killed in the region in 2012, 72 were imprisoned on December 1, 2012, and 126 were in exile from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the Front Lines in 2012|url=http://cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-mideast.php|publisher=Committee for the Protection of Journalists|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related point is that media owners and patrons have effects on the values of their outlets. Newspapers in the Arab world can be divided into three categories: government owned, [[partisan (military)|partisan]] owned, and independently owned. Newspaper, radio, and television patronization in the Arab world has heretofore been primarily a function of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Now, newspaper ownership has been consolidated in the hands of powerful chains and groups. Yet, [[profit (economics)|profit]] is not the driving force behind the launching of newspapers; [[publishers]] may establish a newspaper to ensure a platform for their political opinions, although it is claimed that this doesn’t necessarily influence the news content".&lt;ref&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. "Arab Media: Not Quite Utopia"&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arab world, as far as content is concerned, news is politics. Arab states are intimately involved in the economic well-being of many Arab news organizations so they apply pressure in several ways, most notably through ownership or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Justin D. |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102479/Investigative-Journalism-in-the-Arab-World.aspx |title=Nieman Reports &amp;#124; Investigative Journalism in the Arab World |publisher=Nieman.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts hold that cultural and societal pressures determine journalists' news output in the Arab world. For example, to the extent that family reputation and personal reputation are fundamental principles in Arab civilization, exposes of corruption, examples of weak moral fiber in governors and policy makers, and [[investigative journalism]] may have massive consequences. In fact, some journalists and media trainers in the Arab world nevertheless actively promote the centrality of investigative journalism to the media’s larger [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] function. In Jordan, for example, where the degree of government and security service interference in the media is high, non-governmental organizations such as the Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) train journalists to undertake investigative journalism projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pies|first=Judith|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=165–81|chapter=Agents of Change? Journalism Ethics in Lebanese and Jordanian Journalism Education.|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists sign.JPG|thumb|The Jordanian Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) posted this sign in protest of the country's 2012 Press and Publications law. It reads, "The right to obtain information is a right for all people".]]

Some Saudi journalists stress the importance of enhancing Islam through the media. The developmental role of media was acknowledged by an overwhelming majority of Saudi journalists, while giving the readers what they want was not regarded as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Tash, Abdulkader. A Profile of Professional Journalists Working in the Saudi Arabian Daily Press. Diss. Southern Illinois University, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalism codes, as an important source for the study of media values, complicate this notion. Kai Hafez states, “The possible hypothesis that Islamic countries might not be interested in ‘truth’ and would rather propagate ‘Islam’ as the single truth cannot be verified completely because even a code that limits journalists’ freedom of expression to Islamic objectives and values, the Saudi Arabian code, demands that journalists present real facts.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In addition, [[Media of Saudi Arabia|Saudi journalists]] operate in an environment in which anti-religious talk is likely to be met with censorship.

Patterns of consumption also affect media values. People in the Arab world rely on newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet to differing degrees and to meet a variety of ends. For Rugh, the proportion of radio and television receivers to Arab populations relative to UNESCO minimum standards suggests that radio and television are the most widely consumed media. He estimates that television reaches well over 100 million people in the region, and this number has likely grown since 2004. By contrast, he supposes that Arab newspapers are designed more for elite-consumption on the basis of their low circulation. He states, "Only five Arab countries have daily newspapers which distribute over 60,000 copies and some have dailies only in the under-10,000 range. Only Egypt has dailies which distribute more than a half million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating newspaper readership is complicated, however, by the fact that single newspapers can change hands many times in a day. Finally, the internet continues to be a fairly common denominator in Arab societies. A report by the Dubai School of Government and Bayt.com estimates that there are more than 125 million Internet users in the region, and that more than 53 million of them actively use social media. They caution, however, that while "the internet has wide-ranging benefits, these benefits do not reach large segments of societies in the Arab region. The digital divide remains a significant barrier for many people. In many parts of the Arab world levels of educational attainment, economic activity, standards of living and internet costs still determine a person's access to life-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arab World Online: Trends in Internet Usage in the Arab Region|url=http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/dsg-gip_bayt_report_final_16822_EN.pdf|publisher=The Dubai School of Government with Bayt.com|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, according to Leo Gher and Hussein Amin, the Internet and other modern telecommunication services may serve to counter the effects of private and public ownership and patronage of the press. They state, "Modern international telecommunications services now assist in the free flow of information, and neither inter-Arab conflicts nor differences among groups will affect the direct exchange of services provided by global cyberspace networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gher|first=Leo A.|author2=Hussein Y. Amin|title=New and Old Media Access and Ownership in the Arab World|journal=International Communications Gazette|date=1999|volume=61|series=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/0016549299061001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
In most Arab countries, [[magazines]] cannot be published without a government-issued license. Magazines in the Arab world, like many of the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women. However, the number of magazines in the Arab world is significantly smaller than that of the Western world. The Arab world is not as advertisement driven as the Western world. Advertisers fuel the funding for most Western magazines to exist. Thus, a lesser emphasis on [[advertisement]] in the Arab world plays into the low number of magazines.

=== Radio ===
There are 90 private radio stations throughout [[the Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. ([http://www.newarabia.net/arabic_radio_stations.php list of private radio stations in the Arab world])

Arab radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, but only a few Arab countries had their own broadcasting stations before [[World War II]]. After 1945, most Arab states began to create their own radio broadcasting systems, although it was not until 1970, when [[Oman]] opened its radio transmissions, that every one of them had its own radio station.

Among Arab countries, [[Egypt]] has been a leader in radio broadcasting from the beginning. Broadcasting began in Egypt in the 1920s with private commercial radio. In 1947, however, the Egyptian government declared radio a government monopoly and began investing in its expansion.

By the 1970s, Egyptian radio had fourteen different broadcast services with a total air time of 1,200 hours per week. Egypt is ranked third in the world among radio broadcasters. The programs were all government controlled, and much of the motivation for the government's investment in radio was due to the aspirations of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to be the recognized leader of the Arab world.

Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" station, which targeted other Arab countries with a constant stream of news and political features and commentaries, became the most widely heard station in the region. Only after the [[June 1967 war]], when it was revealed that this station had misinformed the public about what was happening, did it lose some credibility; nevertheless it retained a large listenership.

On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], radio was slower to develop. In [[Saudi Arabia]], radio broadcasts started in the [[Jidda]]-[[Mecca]] area in 1948, but they did not start in the central or eastern provinces until the 1960s. Neighboring [[Bahrain]] had radio by 1955, but [[Qatar]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Oman]] did not start indigenous radio broadcasting until nearly a quarter century later.

===Television===
Almost all television channels in the Arab world were [[government]]-owned and strictly controlled prior to the 1990s. In the 1990s the spread of satellite television began changing television in Arab countries. Often noted as a pioneer, [[al-Jazeera]] represents a shift towards a more professional approach to news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |title=Arab media: television |publisher=Al-bab.com |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505045604/http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financed by the [[Qatar]] government and established in 1996, [[al-Jazeera]] was the first Arabic channel to deliver extensive live news coverage, going so far as to send reporters to "unthinkable" places like Israel. Breaking the mold in more ways than one, al-Jazeera’s discussion programs raised subjects that had long been prohibited. However, in 2008, [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] called for a meeting to approve a charter to regulate [[satellite]] [[broadcasting]]. The [[Arab League]] Satellite Broadcasting Charter (2008) lays out principles for regulating satellite broadcasting in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008):[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (Unofficial Translation)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008): [http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (in Arabic)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other satellite channels:

* [[Al-Arabiya]]: established in 2003; based in Dubai; offshoot of MBC
* [[Al-Hurra]] ("The Free One"): established in 2004 by the United States; counter perceives "biases" in Arab news media
* Al-Manar: owned by Hizbullah; Lebanese-based; highly controversial

"Across the [[Middle East]], new [[television stations]], [[radio stations]] and [[websites]] are sprouting like incongruous electronic mushrooms in what was once a media desert. Meanwhile [[newspapers]] are aggressively probing the red lines that have long contained them".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. Reporting a Revolution: the Changing Arab Media Landscape. Arab Media &amp; Society (February, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] is playing a significant role in the changing Arab media. Pintak furthers, "Now, there are 263 free-to-air (FTA) satellite television stations in the region, according to Arab Advisors Group. That’s double the figure as of just two years ago".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; [[Freedom of speech]] and money have little to do with why [[satellite television]] is sprouting up everywhere. Instead, "A desire for political influence is probably the biggest factor driving channel growth. But ego is a close second".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; The influence of the West is very apparent in Arab media, especially in television. [[Arab soap operas]] and the emerging popularity of [[reality TV]] are evidence of this notion.

"In the wake of controversy triggered by ''Super Star'' and ''Star Academy'', some observers have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |title=Arab Media &amp; Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |accessdate=2011-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110405121157/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85| archivedate= 5 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Academy]]'' in [[Lebanon]] is strikingly similar to ''[[American Idol]]'' mixed with ''[[The Real World]]''. ''Star Academy'' began in 2003 in the Arab world. "Reality television entered Arab public discourse in the last five years at a time of significant turmoil in the region: escalating violence in [[Iraq]], contested elections in Egypt, the struggle for women’s political rights in [[Kuwait]], [[political assassination]]s in [[Lebanon]], and the protracted [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]]. This geo-political crisis environment that currently frames Arab politics and Arab-Western relations is the backdrop to the controversy surrounding the social and political impact of Arab reality television, which assumes religious, cultural or moral manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan M. Reality Television and Politics in the Arab World: Preliminary Observations. Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 15 (Fall/ Winter, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
{{main article|Arab cinema}}
Most Arab countries did not produce films before nation independence. In [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], production is even now confined to short films or television. [[Bahrain]] witnessed the production of its first and only full-length feature film in 1989. In [[Jordan]] national production has barely exceeded half a dozen feature films. [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]] have produced approximately 100 films each, [[Morocco]] around seventy, [[Tunisia]] around 130, and [[Syria]] some 150. [[Lebanon]], owing to an increased production during the 1950s and 1960s, has made some 180 feature films. Only [[Egypt]] has far exceeded these countries, with a production of more than 2,500 feature films (all meant for cinema, not television).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shafik, Viola. Arab Cinema: History and Cultural Identity.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most aspects of [[Arab media]], censorship plays a large art of creating and distributing films. "In most Arab countries, film projects must first pass a state committee, which grants or denies permission to shoot. Once this permission is obtained, another official license, a so-called visa, is necessary in order to exploit the film commercially. This is normally approved by a committee of the Ministry of Information or a special censorship authority".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The most significant taboo topics under state supervision are consistent with those of other forms of media: [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[politics]].

=== Internet ===
The [[Internet]] in the Arab world is powerful source of expression and information as it is in other places in the world. While some believe that it is the harbinger of freedom in media to the [[Middle East]], others think that it is a new medium for [[censorship]]. Both are true. The Internet has created a new arena for discussion and the dissemination of information for the Arab world just as it has in the rest of the world. The youth in particular are accessing and utilizing the tools. People are encouraged and enabled to join in political discussion and critique in a manner that was not previously possible. Those same people are also discouraged and blocked from those debates as the differing regimes try to restrict access based on religious and state objections to certain material.

The internet in the Arab world has a snowball effect; now that the snowball is rolling, it can no longer be stopped. Getting bigger and stronger, it is bound to crush down all obstacles. In addition, to the stress caused by the Arab bloggers, a new forum was opened for Arab activists; Facebook. Arab activists have been using Facebook in the utmost creative way to support the democracy movement in the region, a region that has one of the highest rates of repression in the world. Unlike other regions where oppressive countries (like China, Iran and Burma) represent the exception, oppression can be found everywhere in the Arab world. The number of Arab internet users interested in political affairs does not exceed a few thousands, mainly represented by internet activists and bloggers, out of 58 million internet users in the Arab world. As few as they are, they have succeeded in shedding some light on the corruption and repression of the Arab governments and dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;How the Internet has snowballed in the Arab world. &lt;http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929043556/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470 |date=September 29, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public Internet use began in the US in the 1980s. Internet access began in the early 1990s in the Arab world, with [[Tunisia]] being first in 1991 according to Dr. Deborah L. Wheeler. The years of the Internet's introduction in the various Arab countries are reported differently. Wheeler reports that [[Kuwait]] joined in 1992, and in 1993, [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] and the [[UAE]] came online. In 1994 [[Jordan]] joined the Internet, and [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Syria]] followed in the late 1990s. Financial considerations and the lack of widespread availability of services are factors in the slower growth in the Arab world, but taking into consideration the popularity of [[internet cafe]]s, the numbers [[online]] are much larger than the subscription numbers would reveal.&lt;ref&gt;Hofheinz, Albrecht. "The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization." (n.d.): 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The people most commonly utilizing the Internet in the Arab world are youths. The [[café]] users in particular tend to be under 30, single and have a variety of levels of [[education]] and language proficiency. Despite reports that use of the internet was curtailed by lack of [[English language|English]] skills, Dr. Wheeler found that people were able to search with [[Arabic]]. Searching for jobs, the unemployed frequently fill cafes in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. They are [[men]] and [[women]] equally. Most of them chat and they have email. In a survey conducted by Dr. Deborah Wheeler, she found them to almost all to have been taught to use the Internet by a friend or family member. They all felt their lives to have been significantly changed by the use of the Internet. The use of the Internet in the Arab world is very political in the nature of the posts and of the sites read and visited. The Internet has brought a medium to Arabs that allows for a [[free will|freedom]] of expression not allowed or accepted before. For those who can get online, there are blogs to read and write and access to worldwide outlets of information once unobtainable. With this access, regimes have attempted to curtail what people are able to read, but the Internet is a medium not as easily manipulated as telling a [[newspaper]] what it can or cannot [[publish]]. The Internet can be reached via [[proxy server]], mirror, and other means. Those who are thwarted with one method will find 12 more methods around the blocked site. As [[journalists]] suffer and are imprisoned in traditional media, the Internet is no different with [[bloggers]] regularly being imprisoned for expressing their views for the world to read. The difference is that there is a worldwide audience witnessing this crackdown and watching as [[laws]] are created and recreated to attempt to control the vastness of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Rinnawi, Khalil. "The Internet and the Arab world as a virtual public shpere." (n.d.): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jihadists]] are using the Internet to reach a greater audience. Just as a simple citizen can now have a worldwide voice, so can a movement. Groups are using the Internet to share video, photos, programs and any kind of information imaginable. Standard media may not report what the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would say on their site. However, for the interested, the Internet is a tool that is utilized with great skill by those who wish to be heard. A file uploaded to 100 sites and placed in multiple forums will reach millions instantly. Information on the Internet can be thwarted, slowed, even redirected, but it cannot be stopped if someone wants it out there on the Internet.

The efforts by the various regimes to control the information are all falling apart gradually. Those fighting crime online have devised methods of tracking and catching criminals. Unfortunately those same tools are being used to arrest bloggers and those who would just wish to be heard. The Internet is a vast and seemingly endless source of information. Arabs are using it more than perhaps the world is aware and it is changing the media.

==Society==
[[File:Cairo Cafe.JPG|thumb|right|A café in [[Cairo]]]]
Social loyalty is of great importance in Arab culture. Family is one of the most important aspects of the Arab society. While self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.  "Unlike the extreme individualism we see in North America (every person for him or herself, individual rights, families living on their own away from relatives, and so on), Arab society emphasizes the importance of the group. Arab culture teaches that the needs of the group are more important than the needs of one person."&lt;ref&gt;J. Esherick, Women in the Arab World (Philadelphia: Mason Crest Publishers, 2006), 68&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, "intense feelings of loyalty and dependence are fostered and preserved"&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Gannon, Understanding Global Culture: Metaphorical Journeys Through 28 Nations, 3rd Edition, (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 70&lt;/ref&gt; by the family.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Samovar, et al., Communication Between Cultures, 7th Ed., (Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2010), 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times'', writes "family loyalty and obligations take precedence over loyalty to friends or demands of a job."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"&gt;M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times, 4th Ed., (Boston: Intercultural Press, 2006), 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She goes on to state that "members of a family are expected to support each other in disputes with outsiders. Regardless of personal antipathy among relatives, they must defend each other’s honor, counter criticism, and display group cohesion..."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  Of all members of the family, however, the most revered member is the mother.

Family honor is one of the most important characteristics in the Arab family. According to Margaret Nydell, social exchanges between men and women happen very seldom outside of the work place.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; Men and women refrain from being alone together. They have to be very careful in social situations because those interactions can be interpreted negatively and cause gossip, which can tarnish the reputation of women. Women are able to socialize freely with other women and male family members, but have to have family members present to socialize with men that are not part of the family.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; These conservative practices are put into place to protect the reputation of women. Bad behavior not only affects women but her family’s honor. Practices differ between countries and families. Saudi Arabia has stricter practices when it comes to men and women and will even require marriage documents if a woman and man are seen together alone.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;

'''Arab values'''
One of the characteristics of Arabs is generosity and they usually show it by being courteous with each other. Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times' &lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  '' says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite. Tarek Mahfouz explains in the book "Arab Culture" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mahfouz, Tarek. Arab Culture, Vol. 1: An In-depth Look at Arab Culture Through Cartoons and Popular Art (English and Arabic Edition). Ed. Thane Floreth. 2011 ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is common for Arabs in dinner situations to insist on guests to eat the last piece of the meal or to fight over who will pay the bill at a restaurant for generosity.''

'''Female Infanticide''' 
Like many societies around the world, the preference for a son is much higher than that for a daughter in the Arab world. In pre-Islamic Arabia, husbands would go as far as burying female infants alive because of the shame it caused them among their peers. Women are typically seen as a burden whereas men represent honor and dignity to a family. Muhammad revealed a verse which deals with this phenomenon. It says, "And God will ask the female infant who had been buried alive (''"mau'udda"'') for what wrongdoing was she killed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quran.com/81/8-9 Surah At-Takwir]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is long gone in the Arab world, but the sentiment of having a son over a daughter still resides and women are still subject to divorce for failure to give birth to a son as a first born child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sports==

===Pan Arab Games===
{{Main article|Pan Arab Games}}
The Pan Arab Games are a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab world. The first Games were held in 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties has made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985. By the [[2007 Pan Arab Games|11th Pan Arab Games]], the number of countries participating reached all 22 members of the [[Arab League]], with roughly over 8,000 Arab athletes participating, it was considered the largest in the Games History, with the [[2011 Pan Arab Games|Doha Games]] in 2011 expected to exceed that number.

===Arab women in sports===
Women around the world have struggled in the professional world of sports since it has been something that has been dominated by men. When looking at the Arab world currently there is an emergence of Arab women playing sports, something that for the most part is not much discussed but is of great importance. Muslim Arab women are taking part in playing on futsal, football (soccer), softball, basketball, and various other teams. Some women are participating in boxing, archery, running, swimming, tennis and other individual sports. Because more Muslim women are playing sports, sportswear is being developed so that a woman can still be able to participate in sports like swimming without limiting their participation due to the way they choose to dress. Although women have received great support from family members in playing sports, there is still much criticism towards female athletes in the Arab world. Many conservative men have criticized that sports and women do not go together and that a woman would not be able to wear her headscarf or should not wear shorts while playing sports.

Some people do not see Islam and women playing sports as being compatible. Despite the various criticisms Arab women around the Arab world face, it has not stopped the popularity of women’s participation in sports. Football is one of the sports that has exploded in popularity with women in the Arab world. With the coming of the Women’s World Cup in 2011, there is a Women’s Football Cup Arabia occurring in Bahrain which is bringing together women’s teams from all over the Arab world to play in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com/2010/10/womens-football-cup-arabia-2010-on-road.html |title=Muslim Women in SPORTS: WOMEN'S FOOTBALL CUP ARABIA 2010 - on the road to Germany |publisher=Muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are teams in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Jordan and events like this show that, as said by Dr. Sahar al Hawary who is a member of FIFA’s Women’s Committee from Egypt, "women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world... women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=90760.html |title=Princess champions game for Arab women |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab women are also challenging and becoming a part of sports that even outside of the Arab world are considered not for women. There are Arab women who are participating in boxing, even reaching international competition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cY2p8fjX1s |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab women are not limiting themselves and although they receive criticism from some of society, their families and communities have been very supportive while still considering themselves conservative and faithful to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2jYLCloFo&amp;feature=channel |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women and their families are challenging the very narrow view that society at times has of the capabilities of women and have inspired women all around the Arab world to not limit themselves. Despite this occurring in the Arab world, what these Arab female athletes are doing is an inspiration to women all over the globe.

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Arab cuisine}}
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of Jordanian [[Meze|mezze]], appetizers or small dishes, in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of [[date palm|dates]], wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, with a heavy emphasis on yoghurt products, such as [[leben (food)|leben]] (لبن) (yoghurt without butterfat). Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, spanning the Arab world and incorporating [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], Egyptian, and others. It has also been influenced to a degree by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Berber, and others. In an average Arab household in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, a visitor might expect a dinner consisting of a very large platter, shared commonly, with a vast mountain of rice, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both, as separate dishes, with various stewed vegetables, heavily spiced, sometimes with a tomato sauce. Most likely, there would be several other items on the side, less hearty. [[Tea]] would certainly accompany the meal, as it is almost constantly consumed. [[Coffee]] would be included as well.

===Tea culture===
{{further|Arabic tea}}
Tea is a very important drink in the Arab world, it is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs tea is a hospitality drink that is served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates.

== Dress ==

===Men===
Arab dress for men ranges from the traditional flowing robes to blue jeans, T-shirts and business suits. The robes allow for maximum circulation of air around the body to help keep it cool, and the head dress provides protection from the sun. At times, Arabs mix the traditional garb with clothes.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thobe'''
In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] men usually wear their national dress that is called "thobe" but can be also called "Dishdasha" (Kuwait) or "Kandoura" (UAE). "Thobes" differ slightly from state to state within the Gulf, but the basic ones are white. This is the traditional attire that Arabs wear in formal occasions.

'''Headdress'''
The male headdress is also known as [[Keffiyeh]]. Headdress pattern might be an indicator of which tribe, clan, or family the wearer comes from. However, this is not always the case. While in one village, a tribe or clan might have a unique headdress, in the next town over an unrelated tribe or clan might wear the same headdress.
[[File:Jissr-groom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A wedding carriage in [[Jisr az-Zarqa]], Israel]]
* Checkered headdresses relate to type and government and participation in the [[Hajj]], or a pilgrimage to Mecca.
* Red and white checkered headdress – Generally of Jordanian origin. Wearer has made Hajj and comes from a country with a Monarch.
* Black and white checkered headdress – The pattern is historically of Palestinian origin.
* Black and grey represent Presidential rule and completion of the Hajj.

'''Guthra (headdress) in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]'''
The male headdress in the Gulf states is called Guthra and it is different in each country (size and shape). It is usually worn with a black cord called "agal" that keeps the guthra on the wearer's head.
* The Qatari guthra is heavily starched and it is known for its "cobra" shape.
* The Saudi guthra is a square shaped cotton fabric. The traditional is white but the white and red (shemagh) is also very common in Saudi Arabia.
* The Emirati guthra is usually white and can be used as a wrapped turban or traditionally with the black agal.

===Women===
Adherence to traditional dress varies across Arab societies. [[Saudi Arabia]] is more traditional, while [[Egypt]] is less so. Traditional Arab dress features the full length body cover ([[abaya]], [[jilbāb]], or [[chador]]) and veil ([[hijab]]). Women are only required to wear ''[[abaya]]s'' in Saudi Arabia. In most countries, like [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]], the veil is not prevalent.

The '''Argobba''' are an ethnic group inhabiting [[Ethiopia]]. A [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]] community, they are spread out through isolated village networks and towns in the northeastern and eastern parts of the country. Group members have typically been astute traders and merchants, and have adjusted to the economic trends in their area. These factors have led to a decline in usage of the [[Argobba language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argobba of Ethiopia|url=http://joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10422&amp;rog3=ET|work=Ethnic people profile|publisher=Joshua Project|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelealem&gt;[http://www.sil.org/silesr/2002/026/SILESR2002-026.pdf Leyew, Zelealem and Ralph Siebert. (2001) "Sociolinguistic survey report of the Argobba language of Ethiopia"], SIL International (accessed 25 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Argobba communities can be found in the [[Afar Region|Afar]], [[Harari Region|Harari]], [[Amhara Region|Amhara]], and [[Oromia Region|Oromia]] Regions, in and along the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]]. They include Yimlawo, Gusa, [[Shonke]], [[Berehet]], Khayr Amba, Melka Jilo, [[Aliyu Amba]], [[Metehara]], [[Shewa Robit]], and the surrounding rural villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=agj "Argobba: A language of Ethiopia"], Ethnologue website (accessed 25 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Argobba traditionally speak the [[Argobba language]], an [[Afro-Asiatic language]] of the [[Semitic language|Semitic]] branch. In some places, Argobba has homogenized with [[Oromo language|Oromo]]. In other areas, the people have shifted to neighboring languages for economic reasons. At this time there are only a few areas left where the Argobba are not at least bilingual in Amharic, [[Oromo language|Oromiffa]] or [[Afar language|Afar]]. All of these languages have a literature that can be used to serve the Argobba, even though their current literacy rate in any language is low; the Argobba reportedly do not like to send their children to school and do not go to court.&lt;ref name=Zelealem/&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}}

There are around 16,000 '''Assyrians in France,''' most of which are concentrated in the [[Paris metropolitan area]].

== History ==
The community has a history in [[France]] dating back to the First World War, with most arriving due to ethnic and religious conflicts, leaving [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=northern+Iraq,+southeastern+Turkey,+northwestern+Iran,+northeastern+Syria+Assyrians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20Iraq%2C%20southeastern%20Turkey%2C%20northwestern%20Iran%2C%20northeastern%20Syria%20Assyrians&amp;f=false Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century  By Sargon Donabed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the Assyrian presence dates back to the early 20th century, when some Assyrians, fleeing the [[Assyrian genocide]], found refuge in France.&lt;ref name=Wieviorka166/&gt; Others arrived from rural south-eastern Turkey as a result of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] in the 1960s and 70s. Their numbers swelled after the [[Iraq War]] in 2003 by those arriving from Iraqi cities.

== Population ==
Around 10,000 of the 16,000 Assyrians live in [[Sarcelles]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. They are generally compared to [[French Jews]] who are seen as inward-looking, conservative and well-integrated in the French society.&lt;ref name=Wieviorka167&gt;{{Harvnb|Wieviorka|Bataille|2007|pp=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assyrians in Russia''' number from 14,000 (according to the 2002 census) up to 70,000.&lt;ref name="aina.org"/&gt;

== History ==
Assyrians came to [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in three main waves: 
*The first wave was after the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1828, that delineated a border between [[Russia]] and [[Persia]]. Many Assyrians found themselves suddenly under Russian sovereignty and thousands of relatives crossed the border to join them. 
*The second wave was a result of the repression and violence during and after [[World War I]]. 
*The third wave came after [[World War II]], when Moscow unsuccessfully tried to establish [[Republic of Mahabad|a satellite state in Iranian Kurdistan]]. Soviet troops withdrew in 1946, and left the Assyrians exposed to exactly the same kind of retaliation that they had suffered from the [[Turkish people|Turks]] 30 years earlier. Again, many Assyrians found refuge in the Soviet Union, this time mainly in the cities. From 1937 to 1959, the Assyrian population in USSR grew by 587.3%. The Soviets in the thirties oppressed the Assyrians' religion and persecuted religious and other leaders.

In recent years, the Assyrians have tended to assimilate, but their cultural and ethnic identity, strengthened through centuries of hardships, found new expression under [[Glasnost]].

== Current situation ==
According to the 2002 Russian census there were 13,649&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Assyrians in Russia. 7,762 people (56.9% of all Assyrians) spoke [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic language|Assyrian]] as native language.

[[File:Gasteizko blusen asto-lasterketa.jpg|thumb|The Blusas parading in the streets of Vitoria-Gasteiz]]
'''''Blusas''''' are [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] citizens who dress in the traditional clothes of the region and attend events in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (Basque Country) such as the [[Virgen Blanca Festivities]]. The ''blusas'' assemble in groups called ''cuadrillas'' and their main role is to provide entertainment at these events.

== Etymology ==
Etymologically, ''blusas'' comes from the [[Basque language]] and refers to the typical blouse worn a festivities. However, this word was a loanword from the Spanish ''blusa'' which describes the clothes worn in the countryside by farmers. It was also a loanword from the French ''blouse'' which itself had a German origin.

== History ==
[[File:Vitoria 9.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Celedón]]]]
The festivities in Vitoria-Gasteiz have a rural origin. Throughout history they have been developed in accordance with the population. 
Even though the beginning of the ''blusas'' tradition is pretty unknown, it is believed that it may have a direct relationship with the myth of ''Celedón''.  There are several versions of this story as the tale was passed down orally. However, two have been reckoned by the Basque traditions as the most reliable ones:
# The first version tells the story of Celedonio Aizola, an outgoing bricklayer from Zalduondo. His fame came from his good people skills used in the [[Virgen Blanca Festivities]] several decades before. It is said that every time he stepped into this village, he made all the inhabitants gather in order to party with him. Later, in 1975, some friends of his came up with an idea to hang an artificial figure which resembled Celedonio so as to make the Vitoria's festivities start some year after the man's death. Nowadays that invention is part of the tradition. , s along the [[Virgen Blanca]] Square pushed by some ropes. 
# The second hypothesis is about Celedón Iturralde. A friend of his, Pedro Fernandez de Retana, who was the organist of Vitoria around the 1870s, took the role of organizing this village's festivities. This man, emphasised in telling that he was doing it as a memorial of Celedon iturralde, who died 12 year before in the [[Carlist Wars]]. In 1918, Mariano San Miguel gathered all the typical songs of the festivities into a song book, and among them, there was the one which Celedón wrote with the strophe that sounds non-stop in the festivities "''Celedón ha hecho una casa nueva. Celedón, con ventana y balcón''". These lines talk about the house which was made by ''Celedón'' in Bitoriano (a small village next to Vitoria) where he had a balcony and a window (said in the song several times).

This emblematic character of the Basque was undoubtedly the origin of the festivities of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]. It is a mystery when did officially the ''blusas'' and ''neskas'' start with the tradition of dressing up  but it is believed{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that at the very beginning, there used to be only men. However, those ancient characteristics have gradually changed up to the point that nowadays almost every ''cuadrilla'' are mixed.  One curiosity could be that it is thought ''blusas''  have celebrated this tradition from its very beginning to nowadays inconstantly, but after the civil war and the time of the dictation this tradition disappeared for some years.

== The "''cuadrillas''" in the present day ==
These groups are usually thought to be just the grouping of inhabitants in the festivities but it is far more than that. In fact, they give social aid by going to elderly's residences or organizing special events for children during the year. Also their brotherhood goes much further as in other festivities such as "[[San Prudencio]]" they also hang up. The ''cuadrillas'', have the curiosity that inside them there are not real rules. Nevertheless, they do have some unwritten ones, which are given from the veterans to the freshmen. Besides, everybody has the opportunity to join these groups in exchange of some money.

== Festival routine ==
Blusas are the main cheerleaders of festivals and thus, their routine is connected with it. Their activities could be divided into two parts:
* Religious activities: consist of going to San Miguel's church and participating in the religious pilgrimage in order to give the Virgen Blanca bouquets of flowers.
* Social activities: As an example, doing the famous "Paseillos" or organizing activities from the citizens. The Paseillo is called to the activity of parading across the centre of the city with a fixed route. During the parade each cuadrilla goes dancing, singing and drinking happily with the help of musicians who play "''txarangas''" (songs with a lively rhythm and catchy lyrics). Meanwhile, the audience stays on the edges of the road the blusas have to follow, especially young ladies, who wait for the blusas to pick them and take them to dance. The blusas give stickers which symbolise the ''cuadrilla'' they belong to, which are meant to be placed on to festival-goers clothing.

== Attire ==
The blusas wear the typical rural attire the Araba natives once wore. The outfit consists of a shirt, a "blusa" (blouse), a pair of trousers and the "[[albarca]]s" whereas "neskak" wear a blouse, long skirt and "[[albarca]]s".

[[File:CRPE logo.png|alt=Logo of CRPE|thumb|294x294px|CRPE's logo.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt;]]
The '''Center on Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment''' (CRPE) is a California-based [[environmental justice]] organization founded in 1989 dedicated to providing legal aid to [[grassroots organization]]s in environmental justice communities. CRPE helps communities dealing with problems related to the disproportionate burden of pollution placed upon poor people and people of color. CRPE’s mission is “to achieve environmental justice and healthy, sustainable communities through collective action and the law”.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt; As part of this mission, CRPE provides organizational, technical, and legal assistance to help underserved communities stop immediate environmental threats. With their main offices located in San Francisco and [[Delano, California|Delano, CA]], they conduct most of their efforts in Central California, especially the [[San Joaquin Valley]], which includes Delano and [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], but they also work across the United States.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt;

==History of CRPE==
[[File:California map showing Kern County.png|alt=A map of California highlighting Kern County.|thumb|A map of California highlighting Kern County, which is part of the San Joaquin Valley and home to the cities of Delano, Bakersfield, and Shafter, places where CRPE has conducted a lot of their work. Delano is also home to one of CRPE's headquarters.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt;]]The two founders of CRPE, [[Luke Cole]] and [https://crpe-ej.org/about/ Ralph Abascal], created the organization in 1989. In order to help the environmental justice movement, Cole continued to push the philosophy of a “from the ground up” framework. This ultimately means that the [https://crpe-ej.org/about/ CRPE] works to establish a foundation that is community based in which it focuses on organizing directly through the members of society that are impacted by environmental justice issues. It focuses on three objectives; "(1) to build individual capacity; (2) increase community power vis-a-vis decision-makers; and (3) address environmental hazards facing the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Center on Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment |url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/05-0557231 |website=GuideStar |publisher=GuideStar |accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abascal was an attorney for over 29 years and was dedicated to helping clients of various environmental justice topics and also worked to educate others on [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] advocacy. There are numerous locations that CRPE focuses their work, but most of their efforts are rooted in California, specifically in the San Joaquin Valley and Kern County, which includes the city of Delano, home to many CRPE efforts. CRPE has offices in San Francisco and Delano, CA.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt; CRPE has also conducted work in Alaska.&lt;ref name="Bauman 2008" /&gt;

==Notable People of CRPE==

The Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment operates with the help of environmental justice attorneys and lawyers.  Co-founder Luke Cole provided legal and technical assistance to attorneys and community groups involved in environmental justice struggles nationwide. Berkeley’s [[Ecology Law Quarterly]] awarded him with the Environmental Leadership Award in 1997. Ingrid Brostrom and Caroline Farrell are also noteworthy people associated with CRPE and the legal side of environmental justice. Brostrom is an attorney and Assistant Director at CRPE who focuses on helping low-income communities that are disproportionately faced with environmental injustices.&lt;ref name="Auperlee 2007"/&gt; Farrell is the Executive Director at CRPE and based out of the Delano office. She advocates for communities of color as well as low-income communities by leading many different environmental justice groups. She is known to be a major leader in environmental advocacy in the Valley.&lt;ref name="London et al. 2011" /&gt; 

==CRPE's Work==

CRPE participates in many campaigns and legal disputes to support the health and rights of underrepresented communities and communities of color who struggle under the burdens of environmental injustices. This organization works to provide solutions for the communities for both environmental and health issues. CRPE uses integrated legal techniques to work towards the goals of environmental justice groups that they are working with.&lt;ref name="Foster and Glick 2007"/&gt;
 
===Climate Change and Energy===

The Romo v. Brown&lt;ref&gt;Romo vs. Brown (2017, February 11). https://crpe-ej.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Romo-v-Brown-Complaint-Endorsed-By-Court.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is one of CRPE’s major open legal cases that surrounds climate change and energy issues. This case involves Governor Jerry Brown’s decision to sign the Senate Bill No. 4, ending regulation on hydraulic fracturing, also known as [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. Fracking is a process that extracts natural gas from reservoirs beneath the surface by spraying large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the rock to break it.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2016" /&gt; On Nov 9th 2015 the Kern County Board of Supervisors passed an amendment, which allowed oil &amp; gas zoning permits to be obtained quickly and without the public’s knowledge through public hearings. These two issues caused Rodrigo Romo to sue the Governor and the Division of Oil, Gas &amp; Geothermal Resources due to various health issues his daughters face. Other community members were also upset, and went on a 4-day fast (known as the Cruz Fasts) to protest the amendment and Senate Bill. These actions from the community members attempted to end fracking and other oil extraction methods. All the chemicals produced throughout the fracking process releases high amounts of pollutants into the air, including methane, benzene, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrogen sulfide. These pollutants destroy the ozone layer, leaving Kern County third in most ozone pollution. This could potentially lead to many negative health effects from high level of particulate matter.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2016" /&gt;
CRPE also represented the residents of [[Kettleman City, California|Kettleman City]], another area in the San Joaquin Valley that is exposed to environmental hazards due to growing industrial demands. Oil and gas production have exposed this small town and its community members to various chemical hazards. One of the largest waste facilities in the region is only 3 miles from the city.&lt;ref name="Richter 2017" /&gt;

In another legal battle, CRPE represented the [[Iñupiat|Inupiat]] town of [[Kivalina, Alaska|Kivalina]] as they sued Exxonmobil in the case of [[Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp.|Kivalina vs Exxonmobil Corp.]] for contributing to [[climate change]]. Kivalina is located on an island which was protected from erosion by winter freezing however, as the arctic gets warmer, this ice is no longer protecting the island’s shores from erosion. With the help of CRPE, they took this case to federal court, demanding that these companies pay for their relocation as their island shrunk. This was a historic case that set the tone for the use of common law in the fight against large corporations in the battle against climate change. They ultimately lost the suit.&lt;ref name="Péloffy 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz 2010" /&gt;

===Sustainable Agriculture===

CRPE sued multiple dairies in the San Joaquin valley over their noncompliance with [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations. They allied with other groups to address harmful methane emissions produced by these farms. One farm was building a facility that would house more cows than allowed under the EPA regulations. This dairy asserted that they would only house the number of cows allowed under EPA regulations, and that they would never use the facility to its full capacity. CRPE sued under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], arguing that the dairy’s claims differed from their actions.&lt;ref name="Ruby 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustin 2016" /&gt;

CRPE wrote a report about the institutional failures of the EPA, with regard to specific cases concerning agricultural justice in California. In the report, CRPE states that the EPA denied [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomically]] underserved communities in California’s agricultural centers appropriate protection from pesticide exposure, including areas where schoolchildren were affected. This reported include claims regarding improper administration of Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name="Lopez-Wagner 2016" /&gt;

CRPE in conjunction with the [[Center for Environmental Health]] (CEH) worked on a lawsuit against [[Dow Chemical Company]] for the use of [[1,3-Dichloropropene|Telone]], a pesticide that they have found often impacts Latino communities. CRPE and CEH, base their case in the [http://cehtp.org/file/pesticides_schools_report_april2014_pdf findings] by the [[California Department of Public Health|California Department of Health]] that Latino school aged children are significantly more likely to be exposed to the highest levels of toxic pesticides such as Telone. CRPE stated claims that the state had ignored the threats that their chemicals posed to the health of local schools and communities. In their legal action, CRPE called for an end of fumigation and high levels of pesticide use in these California communities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CEH Taking on a Notorious Chemical Polluter |url=https://www.ceh.org/news-events/newsletters/content/october2016/ |website=October 2016 News Letter |publisher=Center for Environmental Health |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barboza |first1=Tony |title=Pesticide use near schools triggers a push for statewide regulations |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-adv-pesticides-schools-20150614-story.html# |accessdate=29 September 2018 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxics in Our Environment===

Air pollution is a large source of environmental distress in the San Joaquin Valley, a central point of most work done by CRPE. Air pollution has been connected to public health problems, such as [[asthma]] and [[cancer]]. In one study, researchers determined that air quality in the very polluted San Joaquin Valley, a socioeconomically underserved region, may contribute to the development of congenital conditions in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name="Padula 2013" /&gt; This air pollution affects many communities that CRPE represents as part of their work called “Toxics in our Environment”.

In one case taken on by CRPE, the California Portland Cement Company was burning tires in Kern County, and releasing highly toxic chemicals into the surrounding atmosphere. The public protested against this pollution, but California Portland and the Kern County Air Pollution Control District did not respond to concerns and challenged any presented lawsuits. CRPE represented the Kern County community members in opposition of California Portland and the Air District to help reduce toxins in the environment of this central California community.&lt;ref name="Kuhn 1999" /&gt;

In another case, CRPE vs. San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, CRPE sued the Air District, a government organization committed to protecting air quality in San Joaquin, for failing to meet air quality standards for [[ozone]] set by the Clean Air Act for three consecutive years. The ozone problem has prevented the San Joaquin Valley, a region home to many Hispanic/Latinx farmworkers, from having healthy air since the 1970s, mostly due to the Air District’s inability to implement ozone pollution control measures that would reduce ozone emissions by regulating emissions of [[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]] and [[NOx]], ozone creating chemicals. Eventually, the Air District settled the lawsuit, promising to implement the measures. Since the case was settled, the amount of ozone in the community has been reduced.&lt;ref name="Yengoyan 2003" /&gt;

In a more remote case, CRPE joined with other groups to represent the town of Kivalina in Alaska, as they fought to hold [[Red Dog mine]] accountable for illegal pollution of waterways with mining waste and debris. The EPA listed the Red Dog mine as the top source of toxic emissions in the country, and it is the largest zinc mine in the world.&lt;ref name="Bauman 2008" /&gt; Kivalina is a small Inupiat town, where the nearby mine’s pollution contaminated fish and other animals needed for Kivalina’s subsistence. Kivalina claims that Red Dog has violated its permit over 4,000 times. Represented by CRPE, Kivalina sued [[Teck Cominco]], the mine’s parent company. Teck Cominco claimed that the rivers have been made cleaner by the mining, along with the removal of zinc. They also asserted that their failure to meet permit requirements is due to Kivalina blocking their efforts to renew their permit.&lt;ref name="Stano 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauman 2008" /&gt;

===Community Investment and Infrastructure===

The Delano Guardians Committee represents members of Kern County in the decision making processes within the city council.&lt;ref name="Sierra Health Foundation 2017" /&gt; In a lawsuit between the city of Delano and the Delano Guardians Committee, the Delano Guardians sued the city over rising utility rates. The lawsuit claimed that by facilitating these increases the city violated policies that state a majority of voters must approve property-related fees.&lt;ref name="KGET 2013" /&gt; CRPE helped the Delano Guardians and people of Delano fight the city by providing them with legal aid and representation.

CRPE has also worked with the Comite Progreso de Lamont, a group of community members working towards improving the lives of the citizens of Lamont in Kern County. Through their joint efforts they succeeded in their east side sidewalks project. This project will create sidewalks in an area where numerous accidents have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/new-sidewalks-in-lamont-bring-safety-to-kids-and-drivers|title=New sidewalks in Lamont bring safety to kids and drivers|last=News|first=Emma Goss, Eyewitness|work=KBAK|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, CRPE, along with The Power to the People Campaign, has worked with Kern County community members to help define and establish guidelines for a healthy community. The guidelines are as follows:

# Promotion of Environmental Health and Justice
# Economic Opportunity for All People
# Equity and Justice in Green Jobs&lt;ref name="CRPE Green Paper" /&gt;

Through these guidelines, and their community investments, CRPE aims to build and protect the communities of Kern County. Citizens face many issues, including unemployment rates as high as 9.9%, which often disproportionately affect the large Hispanic population within the county.&lt;ref name="Sierra Health Foundation 2017" /&gt; While these guidelines were created to help the citizens Kern County, it is hoped that they can also be implemented in the other counties that comprise the San Joaquin Valley. 

===Movement Building===

CRPE supports the missions of many grassroots organizations in the San Joaquin Valley and often partners with one or more groups at a time to help improve a community’s wellbeing and environment.&lt;ref name="CRPE-EJ.org/About" /&gt; In doing so, the CRPE demonstrates organizational integration, which involves lawyers merging their work with the goals of environmental justice groups or organizations they work with.&lt;ref name="Foster and Glick 2007" /&gt; Some of CRPE’s partners include: the Committee for a Better [[Arvin, California|Arvin]], the Committee for a Better [[Shafter, California|Shafter]], Delano Guardians, [[Greenfield, California|Greenfield]] Walking Group, and Comite Progreso de [[Lamont, California|Lamont]]. The Committee for a Better Arvin, with the help of CRPE, strives to obtain better water and air quality for marginalized communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airhugger.wordpress.com/tag/committee-for-a-better-arvin/|title=Committee for a Better Arvin|last=|first=|date=|website=airhugger.wordpress.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee for a Better Shafter currently receives help from CRPE in the Romo Case concerning fracking and energy issues in their low income town.&lt;ref name="Rowe 2016" /&gt; CRPE helped Delano Guardians sue the city of Delano over unfair spikes in utility costs that highly impacted the low income community.&lt;ref name="KGET 2013" /&gt; The Greenfield Walking Group and CRPE teamed up to create a walkability assessment that led to the clean up of Greenfield, CA parks with the goal of making the mainly Latinx/Hispanic community safer and healthier by picking up litter, refurbishing paths, and implementing measures aimed at reducing gang presence in the parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://californiawalks.org/greenfield-walking-group/|title=Greenfield Walking Group|last=|first=|date=|website=CaliforniaWalks.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRPE and the Comite Progreso de Lamont work to promote a clean environment and better community for health and education in Lamont, CA, a low income community of color burdened by many environmental issues, especially air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bearmtnprk.com/files/828842eef/Minutes+January+18%2C+2018.pdf|title=Minutes January 18, 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=January 18, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these partnerships involve CRPE providing legal aid and support to grassroots organizations in order to improve underserved communities.

The '''Chaush''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|چاوش}}}}) are [[Muslim]]&lt;ref name="Mediaeval Deccan history"&gt;Mediaeval Deccan History, eds Kulkarni, M A Naeem and de Souza, Popular Prakashan, Bombay, 1996, pg 63, https://books.google.com/books?id=O_WNqSH4ByQC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; community of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] [[Arab]] descent found in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region of [[India]].&lt;ref name="Khalidi"&gt;Omar Khalidi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O_WNqSH4ByQC&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Arabs of Hadramawt in Hyderabad] in Mediaeval Deccan History, eds Kulkarni, Naeem and de Souza, Popular Prakashan, Bombay, 1996, pg 63&lt;/ref&gt; The name is believed to originate from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word [[Chiaus]] used during the [[Ottoman era]] of the [[Balkans]] for military officers who were often tasked with guarding palaces.&lt;ref name="Mediaeval Deccan history"/&gt; They have a common origin with the [[Arab (Gujarat)|Chavuse]] community of [[Gujarat]].

The Chaush were brought from Yemen to work in the former [[Hyderabad State]] as military men and body guards for the '''[[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]]s'''. It is said that especially when it came to safe guarding his family, the [[Mir Osman Ali Khan|7th Nizam]] had absolute trust on these Arab bodyguards.

The founders of both the [[Qu'aiti]] and [[Kathiri]] states in [[Hadhramawt]] had previously served as [[jemadar]]s in [[Hyderabad]].&lt;ref&gt;Boxberger, Linda. On the Edge of Empire: Hadhramawt, Emigration, and the Indian Ocean, 1880s-1930s. 2002. [[State University of New York Press ]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the best known cultural contributions of the Chaush to India are [[Marfa (music)|Marfa]] music and dance, and [[Hyderabadi haleem]], both which are culturally important to the [[Hyderabadi Muslims|Hyderbadi Muslim people]], and seen at almost all wedding ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/from-the-era-of-the-nizams-arabi-marfa-continues-to-be-a-hit-even-now/article4032031.ece|title=From the era of the Nizams ‘Arabi marfa’ continues to be a hit even now|date=2012-10-26|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in France''' describes the prevention and occurrence of [[corruption]] in [[France]].

France has ratified several important international anti-corruption conventions such as the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. In general, investors do not consider corruption a problem for doing business in France, and companies operating in France generally have a good reputation of corporate social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the France Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/france/snapshot.aspx|work=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|publisher=GAN Integrity Solutions|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French National Assembly have proved two bills for combating tax evasion. However, in recent years there are several corruption scandals involving high-ranking public officials. Public works and the defence industry are considered the most affected by corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Investment Climate Statement - France|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204643.htm|work=The US Department of State|publisher=The US Department of State|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 23rd place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016|title=Corruption Perception Index 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent and perceptions ==

In 2011, [[Transparency International]] concluded in its annual report for 2011 that France does not do enough to stop corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20120906-corruption-watchdog-says-france-could-do-better  "Corruption watchdog says France could do better", Radio France Internationale, September 6, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Sofres]] poll in October 2011 indicated that 72% of the French public had the perception that politicians are corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21531035  "Bad smells", The Economist, October 1, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in 2009 all major foreign investors and exporters and more than 80 per cent of surveyed executives admitted to 'not being familiar at all' with one of the most important legal frameworks in global business. A cartel constitutes a crime punishable by imprisonment and/or fines.  Staff and budgets for public enforcement of securities regulation was ca one third in France compared to UK in 2008.&lt;ref name=GCR2009&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/46187/739801 Global Corruption Report 2009], Corruption and the Private Sector, [[Transparency International]] August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas ==

=== Elections ===
Political corruption studies include the presidential campaign 2007 finance investigation in the value of 150,000 € from [[Liliane Bettencourt]] to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. Maximum individual support is 4,600 €. [[Jacques Chirac]] was accused of using public funds for his election campaign in Paris in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=korruptio&gt;Korruptio mädättää Ranskaa HS 7.11.2011 B4 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 15 December 2011, Chirac was found guilty and given a suspended sentence of two years.&lt;ref name="BBC guilty 15 December"&gt;{{cite news|title=French ex-President Jacques Chirac guilty of corruption|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16194089|work=BBC  |accessdate=15 December 2011|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of diverting public funds, abuse of trust and illegal conflict of interest. The suspended sentence meant he did not have to go to prison, and took into account his age, health, and status as a former head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/jacques-chirac-guilty-corruption "Jacques Chirac found guilty of corruption"], ''Guardian'', 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not attend his trial, since medical doctors deemed that his neurological problems damaged his memory.&lt;ref name="BBC guilty 15 December" /&gt;

=== Bribery ===
Bribery investigations from South Africa to France are ongoing, including bribery claims of [[Jacques Chirac]], [[Dominique de Villepin]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] bribery claim from Gabon ex-president [[Omar Bongo]]. In September 2011 was judged [[Bernard Granie]] of 300 000 bribery from Provence Recyclage.&lt;ref name="korruptio"/&gt;

=== Energy sector ===
[[Alstom]] has been under investigation in [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] for allegedly making improper payments of US$200 million for contracts for Brazil's Itá hydroelectric plant, for São Paulo's subway expansion and for other major works in Venezuela, Singapore and Indonesia. The Mexican government has penalised Alstom and in 2007 the European Commission's antitrust authority fined Alstom €65 million for price fixing with competitors.&lt;ref name="GCR2009"/&gt;

[[Transparency International]]’s [[Global Corruption Barometer]] 2013 reveals that [[Political parties in Germany|political parties]] and businesses are the most corrupt institutions in [[Germany]]. 

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 12th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|date=|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same report also indicates that [[petty corruption]] is not as uncommon as in other [[Europe]]an countries. The survey shows that 11% of the respondents claim to have been asked to pay a bribe at one point in their life and only few of those said that they had refused to pay the bribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Freedom House]]'s report, Germany’s ability to ensure integrity and to prevent corruption in state bodies is generally sufficient due to a strong institutional setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2013- Germany|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/germany|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding business and corruption, business executives from [[World Economic Forum]] [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014 consider tax regulations and restrictive labour regulations as the most problematic factors for doing business. They also report that trust in the ethical standards of politicians is relatively high, and that irregular payments and bribes only rarely take place in relation to public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6438">'''Crime in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]''', as with many other countries and territories in [[Crime and violence in Latin America|Latin America and the Caribbean]], is considerably higher than in other parts of the world. Most violence and criminal activity in the country is believed to be gang and drug related.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issat.dcaf.ch/Learn/Resource-Library/Country-Profiles/Saint-Kitts-and-Nevis-Country-Profile|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis – Country Profile|publisher=ISSAT|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Saint Kitts and Nevis had a homicide rate of 33.6 per 100,000 citizens, the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate#By country|8th highest]] in the world.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 [[Basseterre]] had the highest murder rate of any capital city in the world at 131.6 per 100,000 inhabitants (a total of 17 murders in the city that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2014/jun/24/10-world-cities-highest-murder-rates-homicides-in-pictures|title=The 10 world cities with the highest murder rates – in pictures |author=Nick Van Mead and Jo Blason|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 June 2014|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and History==
Saint Kitts and Nevis gained its independence in 1983. In 2001 the country's homicide rate was at an all time low with only 6 murders reported that year. Since then however there has been a rapid rise in homicides and other crimes. 2011 was the worst year for homicides in the country with 34 murders reported, giving the country a homicide rate of 67.6 per 100,000 citizens, at that time one of the top three in the world.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; Since 2011 measures and precautions have been placed by the government that have reduced the number of murders. The Saint Kitts government has also claimed that these measures more than halved crime during that period although this claim has been viewed skeptically by independent organizations.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;

Generally speaking the courts and police in Saint Kitts and Nevis are considered effective and corruption free, and the legal system is considered effective.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; However there is a lack of civilian oversight and interaction with the police department, as well as occasional reports of abuse perpetrated by the police.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; The biggest barrier to fighting crime is seen as the country's outdated prison system, with many, if not all, prisons old and overcrowded. Building new prisons and improving the relationships between the police and community are seen as the biggest improvements the government can make to combat crime.

==Effect on Tourism==
Tourism plays a significant role in the Saint Kitts and Nevis economy, and despite the levels of crime tourists are not usually victims. A rare instance of tourists being targeted happened in 2010 when an elderly British couple were murdered in a courtyard.&lt;ref name=Nomads&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/caribbean/saint-kitts-and-nevis/safety-on-st-kitts-and-nevis|title=Safety on St. Kitts &amp; Nevis: The inside story|publisher=World Nomads|first=Phil|last=Sylvester|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Firearms in crime==
Firearms have been increasingly used in crimes on Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 2003 only 63.6 percent of murders were gun-related, while in 2010 it had risen to 85 percent. The global average of firearm-related homicides is 42 percent.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2016: Homicides 24, murder convictions 0|url=http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/local-news/2016-homicides-24-murder-convictions-0/|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=29 April 2017|last=Washington|first=Monique|publisher=[[The St. Kitts-Nevis Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs and gangs==
Since the turn of the 21st century there has been an increase in gang and drug-related violence and crime. [[Cocaine]] especially is known to be frequently trafficked through the country, although the presence of the drug trade is considered relatively minor compared to other Caribbean and Latin American countries. Transnational gangs are not believed to operate in the country.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;

Most gang activities relate to drug trafficking as well as petty crime, robberies, and extortion. Many homicides and attempted homicides are believed to be drug and gang-related, many caused by rival factions fighting over turf.&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt;

A rivalry starting in 2008 is credited with the escalation of violence in the country. The Saint Kitts and Nevis government eventually arrested several gang leaders, one of which was later executed by hanging.&lt;ref name=Nomads/&gt;

==Criminalization of Homosexuality==
[[LGBT rights in Saint Kitts and Nevis|Male homosexuality]] is considered a crime in Saint Kitts in Nevis. By law homosexuality will result in 10 years in prison, and male-on-male assault can be punished with 4 years imprisoned. However actual prosecution of homosexuality is rare, as many members of the LGTB community have hidden their sexual identity due to social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49b92b2614.html|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis: The situation of homosexuals; state protection and availability of support groups|work=refworld|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBC controversy==
In 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis was named by the [[BBC]] in a report as "the most violent place on earth". The BBC's report was widely criticized in Saint Kitts and Nevis for exaggerating the level of violence and crime in the country. The police department of Saint Kitts and Nevis released a report shortly afterwards stating that crime in the country had fallen 60% in the time period from 2011 and 2015, as well as the fact that visitors and tourist to Saint Kitts and Nevis are rarely targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Kitts angered as country named among ‘most dangerous places on the earth’|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/St-Kitts-angered-as-country-named-among--most-dangerous-places-on-the-earth-|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=21 April 2017|work=Jamaica Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dansaekhwa''' ({{lang-ko|단색화}}), also known as "Tansaekhwa" refers to a loose grouping of paintings that emerged in Korean painting starting in the mid-1970s, when a group of artists began to push paint, soak canvas, drag pencils, rip paper, and otherwise manipulate the materials of painting. Tansaekhwa means ‘monochrome painting’ in Korean and was used by the critic Lee Yil in 1980 to refer to a group of largely non-figurative paintings painted in neutral hues.  Promoted in Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris, Tansaekhwa grew to be the international face of contemporary Korean art and a cornerstone of contemporary Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kee|first1=Joan|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0966350391|pages=384|edition=1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures associated with Tansaekhwa include: [[Cho Yong-ik]], Chung Chang-Sup, [[Chung Sanghwa|Chung Sang-Hwa]], Ha Chonghyun, Heu Hwang, Kim Guiline, Kwon Young-woo, [[Lee Dong-youb|Lee 
Dong Youb]], [[Lee Ufan]], [[Park Seo-bo|Park Seobo]], Suh Seung-Wong, and Yun Hyong-keun.

==History==
Lee Ufan had moved to Japan in 1956, where he established himself with the Mono-ha movement in the late 1960s. In the mid-1970s he introduced his Korean peers to the Tokyo art scene. “Five Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,” a group show held at Tokyo Gallery in May 1975, is often credited as the first major presentation of the works that later became known as Tansaekhwa. The five featured artists were Kwon Young-woo, Lee Dong Youb, Heu Hwang, Suh Seung-won and Park Seobo.

==Recent attention==
In 2013, the first extended scholarly discussion of Tansaekhwa, written by Joan Kee, was published by the University of Minnesota Press. It was a finalist for the annual College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize for the most distinguished book in the history of art, the first book on any aspect of modern and contemporary Asian art to receive this designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322211016/http://www.collegeart.org/awards/moreyfinalists# |archive-date=2016-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jenny Jungsil|title=Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method|journal=Journal of Korean Studies|date=2014|volume=38|pages=157–160|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/594914|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, a spate of survey shows in Korea and the United States triggered renewed critical and commercial interest in Dansaekhwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Degen|first1=Natasha|last2= Kim|first2=Kibum|year= 2015|title=The Koreans at the Top of the Art World |website=New Yorker |url= http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-koreans-at-the-top-of-the-art-world |access-date= 2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of the definition of "nationals but not citizens of the United States"===
{{Further|Americans|United States nationality law}}
In 1986, less than a year before the [[United Nations Convention against Torture|CAT]] became effective, Congress expressly and intentionally expanded the definition of "[[national of the United States|nationals]] but not [[citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]]" by adding paragraph (4) to 8 U.S.C. § 1408, which reads as follows:{{Quote|Unless otherwise provided in section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401 1401] of this title, the following ''shall'' be '''nationals, but not citizens, of the United States''' at birth: ....

==Education==
Zuckerman is a graduate of [[Williams College]], where he received a [[B.A.]] in Philosophy in 1993.&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/ezuckerman |title= Ethan Zuckerman |publisher= [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], [[Harvard University]] |accessdate= October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent a year on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] at the [[University of Ghana|University of Legon, Ghana]] and the [[National Theatre of Ghana]] in [[Accra]], where he studied [[ethnomusicology]] and percussion.&lt;ref name="cyber.law.harvard.edu" /&gt;

==Career==
Zuckerman was one of the first staff members of [[Tripod.com]], one of the first successful "dot com" enterprises, where he worked from 1994 to 1999. There, he was in charge of the design and the implementation of the website which, at that time, marketed content and services to recent college graduates. The business model of this website was exclusively based on advertising. After one of the website's major advertisers complained that one of their banner advertisements had appeared on a page that celebrated [[anal sex]], Zuckerman imagined a way to associate an ad with a user’s page without putting it directly on the page. His solution was to open a new dedicated window with only the ad in it. The [[Pop-up ad|popup ad]] was born. While he claims having only written the code to open a new window, since then, he is considered as the inventor of the [[pop-up ad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/?single_page=true |title=The Internet's Original Sin: It's not too late to ditch the ad-based business model and build a better web. |last=Zuckerman |first=Ethan |date={{date|2014-08-14|mdy}} |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate={{date|2014-08-20|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he founded [[Geekcorps]]&lt;ref name="Wired 8.08 Aug 2000"/&gt; and 2004, [[Global Voices Online]].&lt;ref name="BCIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/ethan_zuckerman |title=Ethan Zuckerman &amp;#124;  Berkman Center |last=Zuckerman |first=Ethan |website=Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society |accessdate={{date|2006-04-22|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won the MIT Technology Review "Technology in the Service of Humanity" award in 2002 for his work on [[Geekcorps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/business/12864/ |title=2002 TR100 |accessdate={{date|2012-04-16|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan has been a senior researcher at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], where he is also a long-time fellow. His work at the Berkman Center has included research into [http://h2odev.law.harvard.edu/ezuckerman/ global media attention],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = E. | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.487943 | title = Global Attention Profiles - A Working Paper: First Steps Towards a Quantitative Approach to the Study of Media Attention | journal =  | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zuckerman | first1 = E. | doi = 10.1007/s11127-007-9200-y | title = Meet the bridgebloggers | journal = Public Choice | volume = 134 | pages = 47–65 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the co-founding of [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices]] in collaboration with [[Rebecca MacKinnon]]. For some years he was also a contributing writer for [[Worldchanging|Worldchanging.com]], where he served as president of the board of directors.

In 2011, he was named by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to its list of top global thinkers, in which he stated the ''Best idea'' is "The world isn't flat and globalization is only beginning, which means we have time to change what we're doing and get it right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,44#thinker73 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers |publisher=Foreign Policy |date={{date|2011-11-28|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2012-04-14|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416082704/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/28/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers?page=0,44#thinker73 |archivedate=April 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September of that year, he became the director of the MIT [[Center for Civic Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2011/zuckerman-civic-media |title=Ethan Zuckerman, cyberscholar and activist, to lead MIT Center for Civic Media, |publisher=MIT News |date={{date|2011-06-30|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2014-08-20|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman is an Open Society Global Board member, and also sits on the board of directors of [[Ushahidi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ushahidi.com/about-us/team/board-of-directors |title=Board of Directors |website=ushahidi.com |accessdate={{date|2012-04-16|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419215146/http://ushahidi.com/about-us/team/board-of-directors |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Voices Online|Global Voices]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalvoices.org/about/board-of-directors/ |title=Board of Directors |website=globalvoices.org |accessdate={{date|2012-04-16|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ghanaian journalism training nonprofit, PenPlusBytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penplusbytes.org/detail.cfm?prodcatID=1&amp;tblNewsCatID=23&amp;tblNewsID=143 |title=About Penplusbytes: Board of Directors |website=penplusbytes.org |accessdate={{date|2012-04-16|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnobiology''' is the [[Science|scientific study]] of the way living things are treated or used by different human cultures. It studies the [[System dynamics|dynamic relationships]] between people, [[Biota (ecology)|biota]], and environments, from the distant past to the immediate present.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;[http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html Society of Ethnobiology's "What is Ethnobiology" webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416233913/http://www.ethnobiology.org/education/whatis.html |date=2008-04-16 }}  Accessed 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"People-biota-environment" interactions around the world are documented and studied through time, across [[culture]]s, and across [[List of academic disciplines|disciplines]] in a search for [[Validity (logic)|valid]], [[Reliabilism|reliable]] answers to two 'defining' questions: "How and in what ways do human societies use nature, and how and in what ways do human societies view nature?"&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Brent (1992) Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings (15th century–19th century)===
[[File:WrightMolyneux-ChartoftheWorld-c1599.jpg|thumb|16th-century English map of the world showing extent of western geographic knowledge in 1599]]

Biologists have been interested in [[Traditional knowledge|local biological knowledge]] since the time [[Europe]]ans started [[European colonialism|colonising]] the world, from the 15th century onwards. Paul Sillitoe wrote that:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;

{{quote|Europeans not only sought to understand the new regions they intruded into but also were on the look-out for resources that they might profitably exploit, engaging in practices that today we should consider tantamount to [[biopiracy]]. Many new crops .. entered into Europe during this period, such as the potato, tomato, pumpkin, maize, and tobacco.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt; (Page 121)}}

Local biological knowledge, collected and sampled over these early centuries significantly informed the early development of modern [[biology]]:&lt;ref name="SILL2006"/&gt;
* during the 17th century [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] benefited from local biological knowledge in producing his catalogue, [[Rumphius#Herbarium Amboinense|''"Herbarium Amboinense"'']], covering more than 1,200 species of the plants in [[Indonesia]];
* during the 18th century, [[Carl Linnaeus]] relied upon Rumphius's work, and also corresponded with other people all around the world when developing the [[Scientific classification|biological classification]] scheme that now underlies the arrangement of much of the accumulated knowledge of the biological sciences.
* during the 19th century, [[Charles Darwin]], the 'father' of [[Evolution|evolutionary theory]], on his [[Charles Darwin#Journey of the Beagle|Voyage of the Beagle]] took interest in the local biological knowledge of peoples he encountered.

===Phase I (1900s–1940s)===
Ethnobiology itself, as a distinctive practice, only emerged during the [[20th century]] as part of the records then being made about [[Other (philosophy)|other peoples]], and other cultures. As a practice, it was nearly always ancillary to other pursuits when documenting others' languages, [[folklore]], and natural resource use. Roy Ellen commented that:

{{quote|At its earliest and most rudimentary, this comprised listing the names and uses of plants and animals in native non-Western or 'traditional' populations often in the context of salvage ethnography ..[ie] ''ethno''-biology as the descriptive biological knowledge of 'primitive' peoples.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"&gt;Ellen, Roy (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This 'first phase' in the development of ethnobiology as a practice has been described as still having an essentially [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] purpose, often focusing on identifying those 'native' plants, animals and technologies of some potential use and value within increasingly dominant [[Capitalism|western economic systems]]&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Examples of studies from this 'first' phase in the development of ethnobiology include Stevenson (1915), Castetter (1944) and Harrington (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase II (1950s–1970s)===
Arising out of practices in Phase I (above) came a 'second phase' in the development of 'ethnobiology', with researchers now striving to better document and better understand how other peoples' themselves "conceptualize and categorize" the natural world around them.&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; In Sillitoe's words:

{{quote|By the mid-20th century .. utilitarian-focussed studies started to give way to more cognitively framed ones, notably studies that centred on elucidating classificatory schemes.&lt;ref name="SILL2006"&gt;Sillitoe, Paul (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; (Page 122)}}

[[File:Tawbuid men.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Some Mangyan (who count the Hanunóo among their members) men, on [[Mindoro]] island, [[Philippines]], where Harold Conklin did his ethnobiological work]]

This 'second' phase is marked:&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt;
* in [[Northern America]] (mid 1950s) with [[Harold Conklin]]'s completing his doctorate entitled ''"The relation of [[Hanuno'o language|Hanunóo]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213135409/http://www.mangyan.org/tribal/index.html#hanunoo] culture to the plant world"''&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, H.C. (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;
* in [[Great Britain|Britain]] (mid 1960s) with the publication of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]' book ''The Savage Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; legitimating "folk biological classification" as a worthy cross-cultural research endeavour
* in [[France]] (mid 1970s) with [[André-Georges Haudricourt]]'s [[Linguistics|linguistic]] studies of [[botanical nomenclature]]&lt;ref&gt;Haudricourt, Andre-Georges (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; and R. Porteres' and others work in economic biology.&lt;ref&gt;Porteres, R. (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present (1980s–2000s)===
By the turn of the 21st century ethnobiological practices, research, and findings have had a significant impact and influence across a number of fields of biological inquiry including [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on ecology, see Balée (1998); Plotkin (1995); Schultes &amp; von Reis (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; [[conservation biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;for instances of ethnobiology's influence on conservation biology see Cunningham (2001); Johannes (1989); Laird (2002); Tuxill &amp; Nabhan (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; [[development studies]],&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on development studies, see Warren, Slikkerveer &amp; Brokensha (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[political ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;for an instancing of ethnobiology's influence on political ecology see Zerner (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society of Ethnobiology advises on its web page:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ethnobiology is a rapidly growing field of research, gaining professional, student, and public interest .. internationally
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethnobiology has come out from its place as an ancillary practice in the shadows of other core pursuits, to arise as a whole field of inquiry and research in its own right: taught within many tertiary institutions and educational programs around the world;&lt;ref name="ELLE2006"/&gt; with its own methods manuals,&lt;ref&gt;Ethnbiology methods manuals include Alexiades (1996) and Martin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; its own readers,&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology reader is Minnis (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own textbooks&lt;ref&gt;one Ethnobiology textbook is Cotton (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects of inquiry==

===Usage===
All societies make use of the biological world in which they are situated, but there are wide differences in use, informed by perceived need, available technology, and the culture's sense of morality and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists investigate what lifeforms are used for what purposes, the particular techniques of use, the reasons for these choices, and symbolic and spiritual implications of them.

===Taxonomy===
Different societies divide the living world up in different ways. Ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in particular cultures for living things, from the most specific terms (analogous to species names in [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnean]] biology) to more general terms (such as 'tree' and even more generally 'plant'). They also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of the classification system (if there is one; there is ongoing debate as to whether there must always be an implied hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Roy (1993) pages 216 forward&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological, moral and spiritual significance===
Societies invest themselves and their world with meaning partly through their answers to questions like "how did the world happen?", "how and why did people come to be?", "what are proper practices, and why?", and "what realities exist beyond or behind our physical experience?" Understanding these elements of a societies' perspective is important to cultural research in general, and ethnobiologists investigate how a societies' view of the natural world informs and is informed by them.

===Traditional ecological knowledge===
In order to live effectively in a given place, a people needs to understand the particulars of their environment, and many traditional societies have complex and subtle understandings of the places in which they live.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Ethnobiologists seek to share in these understandings, subject to ethical concerns regarding [[Indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]] and [[cultural appropriation]].

===Cross-cultural ethnobiology===
In cross cultural ethnobiology research, two or more communities participate simultaneously. This enables the researcher to compare how a bio-resource is used by different communities.&lt;ref&gt;Franco, F.M. and Narasimhan, D. (2012). ''Ethnobotany of the Kondh, Poraja, Gadaba and Bonda of the Koraput region of Odisha, India''. D.K. Printworld, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

===Ethnobotany===
{{main article|Ethnobotany}}

:Ethnobotany investigates the relationship between human societies and plants: how humans use plants – as food, technology, medicine, and in ritual contexts; how they view and understand them; and their symbolic and spiritual role in a culture.

===Ethnozoology===
{{main article|Ethnozoology}}
{{further information|Birds in culture|Insects in culture}}

:The subfield ethnozoology focuses on the relationship between animals and humans throughout human history. It studies human practices such as hunting, fishing and [[animal husbandry]] in space and time, and human perspectives about animals such as their place in the moral and spiritual realms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Ethnoecology===
{{main article|Ethnoecology}}

:Ethnoecology refers to an increasingly dominant 'ethnobiological' research [[paradigm]] focused, primarily, on documenting, describing, and understanding how other peoples perceive, manage, and use whole [[ecosystem]]s.

==Other disciplines==
Studies and writings within ethnobiology draw upon research from fields including [[archaeology]], [[geography]], [[linguistics]], [[systematics]], [[population biology]], [[ecology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnography]], [[pharmacology]], [[nutrition]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Ethics==
Through much of the history of ethnobiology, its practitioners were primarily from dominant cultures, and the benefit of their work often accrued to the dominant culture, with little control or benefit invested in the [[indigenous peoples]] whose practice and knowledge they recorded.

Just as many of those indigenous societies work to assert legitimate control over physical resources such as traditional lands or artistic and ritual objects, many work to assert legitimate control over their [[indigenous intellectual property|intellectual property]].

In an age when the potential exists for large profits from the discovery of, for example, new food crops or medicinal plants, modern ethnobiologists must consider [[Intellectual Property Rights|intellectual property rights,]] the need for informed consent, the potential for harm to informants, and their "debt to the societies in which they work".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/committees/ethics/ethcode.htm Code of Ethics of the American Anthropological Association, section A]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, these questions must be considered not only in light of western industrialized nations' common understanding of ethics and law, but also in light of the ethical and legal standards of the societies from which the ethnobiologist draws information.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In applied mathematics, a '''forest-fire model''' is any of a number of [[dynamical system]]s displaying [[self-organized criticality]]. Note, however, that according to Pruessner et al. (2002, 2004) the forest-fire model does not behave critically on very large, i.e. physically relevant scales. Early versions go back to Henley (1989) and Drossel and Schwabl (1992). The model is defined as a [[cellular automaton]] on a grid with ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; cells.  ''L'' is the sidelength of the grid and ''d'' is its dimension.  A cell can be empty, occupied by a tree, or burning.  The model of Drossel and Schwabl (1992) is defined by four rules which are executed simultaneously:

# A burning cell turns into an empty cell
# A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
# A tree ignites with probability ''f'' even if no neighbor is burning
# An empty space fills with a tree with probability ''p''

The controlling parameter of the model is ''p''/''f'' which gives the average number of trees planted between two lightning strikes (see Schenk et al. (1996) and [[Peter Grassberger | Grassberger]] (1993)).  In order to exhibit a [[fractal]] frequency-size distribution of clusters a double separation of time scales is necessary

:&lt;math&gt;f \ll p \ll T_\mathrm{smax}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;smax&lt;/sub&gt; is the burn time of the largest cluster. The scaling behavior is not simple, however ([[Peter Grassberger | Grassberger]] 1993,2002 and Pruessner et al. 2002,2004). 

A '''cluster''' is defined as a coherent set of cells, all of which have the same state.  Cells are coherent if they can reach each other via nearest neighbor relations. In most cases, the von Neumann neighborhood (four adjacent cells) is considered.

The first condition &lt;math&gt;f\ll p&lt;/math&gt; allows large structures to develop, while the second condition &lt;math&gt;p\ll T_\mathrm{smax}&lt;/math&gt; keeps trees from popping up alongside a cluster while burning.

In landscape ecology, the forest fire model is used to illustrate the role of the fuel mosaic in the wildfire regime. The importance of the fuel mosaic on wildfire spread is debated. Parsimonious models such as the forest fire model can help to explore the role of the fuel mosaic and its limitations in explaining observed patterns.

The '''four occupations''' ({{zh |t = 士農工商
|s = 士农工商 }}) or "'''four categories of the people'''" ({{zh | 四民}})&lt;ref name="Outcast"&gt;Hansson, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brook 72"&gt;Brook, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[job|occupation]] [[International Standard Classification of Occupations|classification]] used in [[History of China|ancient China]] by either [[Confucianism|Confucian]] or [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] scholars as far back as the late [[Zhou dynasty]] and is considered a central part of the [[fengjian]] social structure (c. 1046–256 BC).&lt;ref name="fairbank 108"&gt;Fairbank, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the ''[[wiktionary:士|shi]]'' ([[Gentry (China)|gentry]] scholars), the ''[[wiktionary:农|nong]]'' (peasant farmers),  the ''[[wiktionary:工|gong]]'' (artisans and craftsmen), and the ''[[wiktionary:商|shang]]'' (merchants and traders).&lt;ref name="fairbank 108"/&gt;
The four occupations were not always arranged in this order.&lt;ref name =guliang&gt;{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh|title= Guliang Zhuan |wslink= 春秋穀梁傳/成公 |quote= 古者有四民：有士民，有商民、有農民、有工民。夫甲，非人人之所能為也。丘作甲，非正也。}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xunzi&gt;{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh|title= Xunzi |wslink= 荀子/王制篇 |quote= 農農、士士、工工、商商 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The four categories were not socioeconomic classes; wealth and standing did not correspond to these categories, nor were they hereditary.&lt;ref name="Outcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feudalism and Non European Societies" /&gt;

The system did not factor in all social groups present in premodern Chinese society, and its broad categories were more an idealization than a practical reality. The [[commercialism|commercialization]] of Chinese society in the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] periods further blurred the lines between these four occupations. The definition of the identity of the ''shi'' class changed over time—from  warriors, to aristocratic scholars, and finally to scholar-bureaucrats. There was also a gradual fusion of the wealthy merchant and landholding gentry classes, culminating in the late Ming Dynasty. 

In some manner this system of social order was adopted throughout the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. In Japanese it is called ''mibunsei'' (身分制) and is sometimes stated as {{nihongo|"Shi, nō, kō, shō"|士農工商,| shinōkōshō}}, although in Japan it became a hereditary [[caste]] system.&lt;ref name=gdvhw&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Fashion: A Cultural History|author=Toby Slade|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-252-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean as "Sa, nong, gong, sang" (사농공상), and in Vietnamese as "Sĩ, nông, công, thương (士農工商). The main difference in adaptation was the definition of the ''shi'' (士).

== Background ==
[[File:Along the River During the Qingming Festival (detail of original).jpg|thumb|left|500px|Street scene in Bianjing (modern [[Kaifeng]])]]
From existing literary evidence, commoner categories in China were employed for the first time during the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC).&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 37"&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, [[Han Dynasty|Eastern-Han]] (AD 25–220) historian [[Ban Gu]] (AD 32–92) asserted in his ''[[Book of Han]]'' that the four occupations for commoners had existed in the [[Zhou Dynasty|Western Zhou]] (c. 1050 – 771 BC) era, which he considered a [[golden age]].&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 37"/&gt; However, it is now known that the classification of four occupations as Ban Gu understood it did not exist until the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 37"/&gt; Ban explained the social hierarchy of each group in descending order:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants; each of the four peoples had their respective profession. Those who studied in order to occupy positions of rank were called the ''shi'' (scholars). Those who cultivated the soil and propagated grains were called ''nong'' (farmers). Those who manifested skill (''qiao'') and made utensils were called ''gong'' (artisans). Those who transported valuable articles and sold commodities were called ''shang'' (merchants).&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Han-era text ''[[Guliang Zhuan]]'' described the four groups in a different order, with merchants second after scholars,&lt;ref name=guliang /&gt; and the Warring States-era ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' placed farmers before scholars.&lt;ref name=xunzi /&gt; The ''[[Shuo Yuan]]'' mentioned a quotation which stressed the ideal of equality for the four occupations.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh|title=Shuo Yuan|wslink=說苑/卷07|quote=春秋曰：四民均則王道興而百姓寧；所謂四民者，士、農、工、商也。&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, Professor of Early Chinese History at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], writes that the classification of "four occupations" can be viewed as a mere rhetorical device that had no effect on government policy.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 37"/&gt; However, he notes that although no statute in the Qin or Han law codes specifically mentions the four occupations, some laws did treat these broadly classified social groups as separate units with different levels of legal privilege.&lt;ref name="barbieri low 2007 37"/&gt;

The categorisation was sorted according to the principle of economic usefulness to state and society, that those who used mind rather than muscle (scholars) were placed first, with farmers, seen as the primary creators of wealth, placed next, followed by artisans, and finally merchants who were seen as a social disturbance for excessive accumulation of wealth or erratic fluctuation of prices.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuhn |first1=Philip A. |title=Chinese views of social classification, in James L. Watson, Class and Social stratification in post-Revolution China |date=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521143845 |pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath the four occupations were the "mean people" ({{zh |賤民}}), outcasts from "humilitating" occupations such as entertainers and prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Outcast1"&gt;Hansson, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

The four occupations were not a hereditary system.&lt;ref name="Outcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feudalism and Non European Societies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byres|first1=Terence|last2= Mukhia|first2=Harbans|title=Feudalism and Non European Societies|year=1985|publisher=[[Frank Cass and Co.]] |location=London|isbn=0-7146-3245-7|pages=213, 214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four occupations system differed from those of European feudalism in that people were not born into the specific classes, such that, for example, a son born to a gong craftsman was able to become a part of the shang merchant class, and so on. Theoretically, any man could become an official through the Imperial examinations.&lt;ref name="Outcast1"/&gt;

From the fourth century B.C., the ''shi'' and some wealthy merchants wore [[Shenyi|long flowing silken robes]], while the working class wore trousers.&lt;ref name="gernet 129 130"&gt;Gernet, 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ancient [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] (1600 B.C. to 1046 B.C.) and Early Zhou dynasties (1046 B.C. to 771 B.C.), the ''shi'' were regarded as a knightly social order of low-level aristocratic lineage compared to [[Chinese nobility|dukes and marquises]].&lt;ref name="ebrey 22"&gt;Ebrey (2006), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This social class was distinguished by their right to ride in chariots and command battles from mobile chariots, while they also served civil functions.&lt;ref name="ebrey 22"/&gt; Initially rising to power through controlling the new technology of [[History of metallurgy in China|bronzeworking]], from 1300 B.C., the ''shi'' transitioned from foot knights to being primarily chariot [[Chinese archery|archers]], fighting with [[composite bow|composite]] [[recurve bow|recurved]] bow, a double-edged sword known as the ''[[jian]]'', and armour.&lt;ref name=peers&gt;Peers, pp. 17, 20, 24, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''shi'' had a strict code of [[chivalry]]. In the battle of Zheqiu, 420 B.C., the ''shi'' Hua Bao shot at and missed another ''shi'' Gongzi Cheng, and just as he was about to shoot again, Gongzi Cheng said that it was unchivalrous to shoot twice without allowing him to return a shot. Hua Bao lowered his bow and was subsequently shot dead.&lt;ref name=peers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh |title= Zuo Zhuan |wslink= 春秋左氏傳/昭公#昭公二十一年|chapter= 昭公二十一年|quote= 將注豹．則關矣．曰．平公之靈．尚輔相余．豹射出其間．將注．則又關矣．曰．不狎鄙．抽矢．城射之．殪．張匄抽殳而下．射之．折股．扶伏而擊之．折軫．又射之．死．}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 624 B.C. a disgraced ''shi'' from the [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] led a suicidal charge of chariots to redeem his reputation, turning the tide of the battle.&lt;ref name=peers/&gt; In the [[Battle of Bi]], 597 B.C., the routing chariot forces of Jin were bogged down in mud, but pursuing enemy troops stopped to help them get dislodged and allowed them to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh |title= Zuo Zhuan |wslink= 春秋左氏傳/宣公#宣公十二年|quote= 晉人或以廣隊．不能進．楚人惎之脫扃．少進．馬還．又惎之拔旆投衡．乃出}} &lt;/ref&gt;

As chariot warfare became eclipsed by mounted cavalry and infantry units with effective crossbowmen in the [[Warring States period]] (403–221 BC), the participation of the ''shi'' in battle dwindled as rulers sought men with actual military training, not just aristocratic background.&lt;ref name="ebrey 29 30"&gt;Ebrey (2006), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also a period where [[Hundred Schools of Thought|philosophical schools flourished in China]], while intellectual pursuits became highly valued amongst statesmen.&lt;ref name="ebrey 32"&gt;Ebrey (2006), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ''shi'' eventually became renowned not for their warrior's skills, but for their scholarship, abilities in administration, and sound ethics and morality supported by competing philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (2006), 32–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Duke Xiao of Qin]] and the chief minister and reformer [[Shang Yang]] (d. 338 BC), the ancient [[State of Qin]] was transformed by a new [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] yet harsh philosophy of Legalism. This philosophy stressed stern punishments for those who disobeyed the publicly known laws while rewarding those who labored for the state and strove diligently to obey the laws. It was a means to diminish the power of the nobility, and was another force behind the transformation of the ''shi'' class from warrior-aristocrats into merit-driven officials. When the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC) unified China under the Legalist system, the emperor assigned administration to dedicated officials rather than nobility, ending feudalism in China, replacing it with a centralized, bureaucratic government. The form of government created by the first emperor and his advisors was used by later dynasties to structure their own government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/michael-loewe/china%E2%80%99s-first-empire|title=China's First Empire {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-04-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417235658/http://www.historytoday.com/michael-loewe/china%E2%80%99s-first-empire|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WIP:ESA36&gt;World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borthwick 2006, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, the government thrived, as talented individuals could be more easily identified in the transformed society. However, the Qin became infamous for its oppressive measures, and so [[Chu-Han contention|collapsed into a state of civil war]] after the death of the Emperor.

In the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618) and the subsequent [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907)  the ''shi'' class would begin to present itself by means of the fully standardized [[Imperial examinations|civil service examination system]], of partial recruitment of those who passed [[Standardized test|standard exams]] and earned an official degree. Yet recruitment by recommendations to office was still prominent in both dynasties. It was not until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) that the recruitment of those who passed the exams and earned degrees was given greater emphasis and significantly expanded.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 145 146"&gt;Ebrey (1999), 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''shi'' class also became less aristocratic and more bureaucratic due to the highly competitive nature of the exams during the Song period.&lt;ref name="ebrey 159"/&gt; 

Beyond serving in the administration and the judiciary, scholar-officials also provided government-funded social services, such as prefectural or county schools, free-of-charge public hospitals, retirement homes and paupers' graveyards.&lt;ref name="gernet 172"&gt;Gernet, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 167"&gt;Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yuan, 193–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) and [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, mathematics, music and statecraft,&lt;ref name="ebrey 162 163"&gt;Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007–1072) or [[Zeng Gong]] (1019–1083)  pioneered ideas in early [[epigraphy]], [[archeology]] and [[philology]].&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 148"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser &amp; Haber, 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic times in China]], agriculture was a key element to the rise of China's civilization and every other civilization. The food that farmers produced sustained the whole of society, while the [[land tax]] exacted on farmers' lots and landholders' property produced much of the state revenue for China's pre-modern ruling dynasties. Therefore, the farmer was a valuable member of society, and even though he was not considered one with the ''shi'' class, the families of the ''shi'' were usually landholders that often produced crops and foodstuffs.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the ninth century BC (late Western [[Zhou dynasty]]) to around the end of the [[Warring States period]], agricultural land was distributed according to the [[Well-field system]] (井田), whereby a square area of land was divided into nine identically-sized sections; the eight outer sections (私田; ''sītián'') were privately cultivated by farmers and the center section (公田; gōngtián) was communally cultivated on behalf of the landowning aristocrat. When the system became economically untenable in the [[Warring States period]], it was replaced by a system of private land ownership. It was first suspended in the state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] by [[Shang Yang]] and other states soon followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

As government control weakened in the 8th century, land reverted into the hands of private owners.

[[Song Dynasty]] (950-1279) rural farmers engaged in the small-scale production of wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods.&lt;ref name="ebrey cambridge 141"&gt;Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), the socioeconomic class of farmers grew more and more indistinct from another social class in the four occupations: the artisan. Artisans began working on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth.&lt;ref name="spence 13"/&gt; The distinction between what was town and country was blurred in Ming China, since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city.&lt;ref name="spence 13"&gt;Spence, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pottery workshop - technology from the time of the Ming dynasty.jpg|thumb|Ming era pottery workshop]]
[[Artisan]]s and craftsmen — their class identified with the [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] meaning ''labour'' — were much like farmers in the respect that they produced essential goods needed by themselves and the rest of society. Although they could not provide the state with much of its revenues since they often had no land of their own to be taxed, artisans and craftsmen were theoretically respected more than merchants. Since ancient times, the skilled work of artisans and craftsmen was handed down orally from father to son, although the work of architects and structural builders were sometimes codified, illustrated, and categorized in Chinese written works.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, 88–94&lt;/ref&gt;

Artisans and craftsmen were either government-employed or worked privately. A successful and highly skilled artisan could often gain enough capital in order to hire others as apprentices or additional laborers that could be overseen by the chief artisan as a manager. Hence, artisans could create their own small enterprises in selling their work and that of others, and like the merchants, they formed their own [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, 88–94&lt;/ref&gt;

The merchants, traders, and peddlers of goods were viewed by the scholarly elite as essential members of society, yet were esteemed least of the four occupations in society, due to the view that they were a threat to social harmony from acquiring disproportionally large incomes,&lt;ref name="Kuhn"/&gt; [[market manipulation]] or exploiting farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |wslanguage=zh |title= Han Feizi |wslink= 韓非子/五蠹|quote=其商工之民，修治苦窳之器，聚弗靡之財，蓄積待時，而侔農夫之利。}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the merchant class of China throughout all of Chinese history were usually wealthy and held considerable influence above their supposed social standing.&lt;ref name=Gernet /&gt;

Han Dynasty writers mention merchants owning huge tracts of land.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'ü (1972), 113&amp;ndash;114.&lt;/ref&gt; A merchant who owned property worth a thousand [[catty|catties]] of gold—equivalent to ten million cash coins—was considered a great merchant.&lt;ref name="ch'u 1972 114"&gt;Ch'ü (1972), 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a fortune was one hundred times larger than the average income of a middle class landowner-cultivator and dwarfed the annual 200,000 cash-coin income of a marquess who collected taxes from a thousand households.&lt;ref name="ch'u 1972 114 115"&gt;Ch'ü (1972), 114&amp;ndash;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Some merchant families made fortunes worth over a hundred million cash, which was equivalent to the wealth acquired by the highest officials in government.&lt;ref name="ch'u 1972 115 117"&gt;Ch'u (1972), 115&amp;ndash;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Itinerant merchants who traded between a network of towns and cities were often rich as they had the ability to avoid registering as merchants (unlike the shopkeepers),&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 576"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 576.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chao Cuo]] (d. 154 BCE) states that they wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 576&amp;ndash;577; Ch'ü (1972), 114; see also Hucker (1975), 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians like Yu Yingshi and Billy So have shown that as Chinese society became increasingly commercialized from the [[Song dynasty]] onward, Confucianism had gradually begun to accept and even support business and trade as legitimate and viable professions, as long as merchants stayed away from unethical actions. Merchants in the meantime had also benefited from and utilized Confucian ethics in their business practices. By the Song period, merchants often colluded with the scholarly elite; as early as 955, the [[Scholar-officials]] themselves were using intermediary agents to participate in trading.&lt;ref name=Gernet&gt;Gernet, Jacques (1962).

Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}} pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Song government took over several key industries and imposed strict state monopolies, the government itself acted as a large commercial enterprise run by scholar-officials.&lt;ref name="gernet 77"&gt;Gernet, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; The state also had to contend with the merchant [[guild]]s; whenever the state requisitioned goods and assessed taxes it dealt with guild heads, who ensured fair prices and fair wages via official intermediaries.&lt;ref name="gernet 88"&gt;Gernet, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 157"&gt;Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late Ming Dynasty, the officials often needed to solicit funds from powerful merchants to build new roads, schools, bridges, pagodas, or engage in essential industries, such as book-making, which aided the gentry class in education for the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 90–93, 129–130, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants began to imitate the highly cultivated nature and manners of scholar-officials in order to appear more cultured and gain higher prestige and acceptance by the scholarly elite.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 128–129, 134–138.&lt;/ref&gt; They even purchased printed books that served as guides to proper conduct and behavior and which promoted merchant morality and business ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 215–216.&lt;/ref&gt; The social status of merchants rose to such significance&lt;ref&gt;Yu Yingshi 余英時, ''Zhongguo Jinshi Zongjiao Lunli yu Shangren Jingshen'' 中國近世宗教倫理與商人精神.

[[Image:TangTaizong.jpg|thumb|left|The renowned [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626–649); the [[Emperor of China|emperor]] represented the pinnacle of traditional Chinese society, and was above that of the scholar-official.]]
There were many social groups that were excluded from the four broad categories in the social hierarchy. These included soldiers and guards, religious clergy and diviners, eunuchs and concubines, entertainers and courtiers, domestic servants and slaves, prostitutes, and low class laborers other than farmers and artisans. People who performed such tasks that were considered either worthless or "filthy" were placed in the category of mean people  (賤人), not being registered as commoners and having some legal disabilities.&lt;ref name="Outcast" /&gt; 

=== Imperial clan ===
[[Emperor of China|The emperor]]—embodying a [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]] to judicial and executive authority—was on a social and legal tier above the [[Gentry (China)|gentry]] and the [[Imperial examinations|exam]]-drafted [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]]. Under the principle of the Mandate of heaven, the right to rule was based on "virtue"; if a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate, and there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Kallie|title=What Is the Mandate of Heaven in China?|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/ancientchina/f/What-Is-The-Mandate-Of-Heaven.htm|website=About Education|access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mandate of Heaven does not require noble birth, depending instead on just and able performance. The [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] were founded by men of common origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mote|first= Frederick W.

Although his royal family and noble extended family were also highly respected, they did not command the same level of authority.

During the initial and end phases of the [[Han dynasty]], the [[Western Jin Dynasty]], and the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], the members of the Imperial clan were enfeoffed with vassal states, controlling military and political power: they often usurped the throne, intervened in Imperial succession, or fought civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, R.G., p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; From the 8th century on, the [[Tang dynasty]] imperial clan was restricted to the capital and denied fiefdoms, and by the [[Song dynasty]] were also denied any political power. By the [[Southern Song dynasty]], imperial prince's were assimilated into the scholars, and had to take the imperial examinations to serve in government, like commoners. The [[Yuan dynasty]] favoured the Mongol tradition of distributing Khanates, and under this influence, the [[Ming dynasty]] also revived the practice of granting titular "kingdoms" to Imperial clan members, although they were denied political control;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, R.G. p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; only near the end of the dynasty were some permitted to partake in the examinations to qualify for government service as common scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, R.G. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eunuchs ===
[[File:Xu Xianqing part12.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Imperial court conference, Ming dynasty]]
The court [[eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] who served the royals were also viewed with some suspicion by the scholar-officials, since there were several instances in Chinese history where influential eunuchs came to dominate the emperor, his imperial court, and the whole of the central government. In an extreme example, the eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]] (1568–1627) had his critics from the orthodox Confucian '[[Donglin Academy|Donglin Society]]' tortured and killed while dominating the court of the [[Tianqi Emperor]]—Wei was dismissed by [[Chongzhen Emperor|the next ruler]] and committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture texts such as Zhang Yingyu's ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 The Book of Swindles]'' (ca. 1617), eunuchs were often portrayed in starkly negative terms as enriching themselves through excessive taxation and indulging in cannibalism and debauched sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The eunuchs at the Forbidden City during the later Qing period were infamous for their corruption, stealing as much as they could.&lt;ref name="Behr, Edward page 73"&gt;Behr, Edward ''The Last Emperor'' London: Futura, 1987 page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of eunuch at the Forbidden City offered such opportunities for theft and corruption that countless men willingly become eunuchs in order to live a better life.&lt;ref name="Behr, Edward page 73"/&gt; [[Ray Huang]] argues that eunuchs represented the personal will of the Emperor, while the officials represented the alternate political will of the [[bureaucracy]].

[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monkhood grew immensely popular from the fourth century, where the monastic life's exemption from tax proved alluring to poor farmers. 4,000 government-funded monasteries were established and maintained through the medieval period, eventually leading to [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|multiple persecutions of Buddhism in China]], a lot of the contention being over Buddhist monasteries' exemption from government taxation,&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques.

[[File:Ming musketeers.jpg|thumb|350px|Ming Dynasty troops in formation]]
The social category of the soldier was left out of the social hierarchy due to the gentry scholars' [[Wen and wu|embracing of intellectual cultivation (文 wén) and detest for violence (武 wǔ)]].&lt;ref name="fairbank 109"&gt;Fairbank, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars did not want to legitimize those whose professions centered chiefly around violence, so to leave them out of the social hierarchy altogether was a means to keep them in an unrecognized and undistinguished social tier.&lt;ref name="fairbank 109"/&gt; 

Soldiers were not highly respected members of society,&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically from the Song dynasty onward, due to the newly instituted policy of "Emphasizing the civil and downgrading the military" ({{zh|重文輕武}}).&lt;ref&gt;Peers, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers traditionally came from farming families, while some were simply debtors who fled their land (whether owned or rented) to escape lawsuits by creditors or imprisonment for failing to pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants were encouraged to join militias such as the [[Baojia system|Baojia]] (保甲) or [[Tuanlian]] (團練),&lt;ref&gt;Peers, pp. 114,130 &lt;/ref&gt; but full-time soldiers were usually hired from amnestied bandits or vagabonds, and peasant militia were generally regarded as the more reliable.&lt;ref name="fairbank 109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peers, pp. 128-130,180,199 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swope |first1=Kenneth M. |title=The Military Collapse of China's Ming dynasty |date=2009 |publisher=Routledge |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 2nd century B.C. onward, soldiers along China's frontiers were also encouraged by the state to settle down on their own farm lots in order for the food supply of the military to become self-sufficient, under the Tuntian system (屯田),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Theobald |first1=Ulrich |title=Tuntian |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/tuntian.html |website=China knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Weisuo system (衛所) and the [[Fubing system]] (府兵).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu|first1=Zhaoxiang et al.|date=2000|title=History of Military Legal System|location=Beijing|publisher=Encyclopedia of China Publishing House.|ISBN=7-5000-6303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peers, pp. 110-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these schemes, multiple dynasties attempted to create a hereditary military  [[caste]] by exchanging border farmland or other privileges for service. However, in every instance, the policy would fail due to rampant desertion caused by the extremely low regard for violent occupations, and subsequently these armies had to replaced with hired mercenaries or even peasant militia.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, pp. 175-179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairbank 109"/&gt;

=== Entertainers ===
{{See also|Music of China}}
Entertaining was considered to be of little use to society and was usually performed by the [[underclass]] known as the "mean people" ({{zh |賤民}}).&lt;ref name="Outcast1"/&gt;

Entertainers and courtiers were often dependents upon the wealthy or were associated with the often-perceived immoral pleasure grounds of urban entertainment districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Andrew F. |title=Yellow Music: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age |date=2001 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822326949 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=aIDzyVzb9r4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=the+social+status+of+professional+musicians+china&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n6e7Nb4lsb&amp;sig=fKKPh0B4UU2v24ih2BVFMEXFVC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjp6faY2t7cAhUTWX0KHSgnDjoQ6AEwBXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians who played music as full-time work were of low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nettl |first1=Bruno |last2=Rommen |first2=Timothy |title=Excursions in World Music |date=2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=1317213750 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=hjklDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+social+status+of+professional+musicians+china&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=baV5Tvx7bY&amp;sig=30b83omyorx_DJ6zlkM8j_OwqxM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjp6faY2t7cAhUTWX0KHSgnDjoQ6AEwB3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give them official recognition would have given them more prestige.

"Proper" music was considered a fundamental aspect of nurturing of character and good government, but vernacular music, as defined as having "irregular movements" was criticised as corrupting for listeners. In spite of this, Chinese society idolized many musicians, even women musicians (who were seen as seductive) such as Cai Yan (ca. 177) and Wang Zhaojun (40-30 B.C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ko |first1=Dorothy |last2=Kim |first2=JaHyun |last3=Pigott |first3=Joan R. |title=Women and Confucian Cultures in Premodern China, Korea, and Japan |date=2003 |publisher=University of california press |isbn=0520231384 |pages=112-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical abilities were a prime consideration in marriage desirability.&lt;ref name=music /&gt; During the Ming dynasty, female musicians were so common that they even played for imperial rituals.&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ko |first1=Dorothy |last2=Kim |first2=JaHyun |last3=Pigott |first3=Joan R. |title=Women and Confucian Cultures in Premodern China, Korea, and Japan |date=2003 |publisher=University of california press |isbn=0520231384 |pages=97-99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional dancers of the period were of low social status and many entered the profession through poverty, although some such as Zhao Feiyan achieved higher status by becoming concubines.

[[Six dynasties]], Tang dynasty, and to a partial extent Song dynasty society also contained a complex system of servile groups included under "mean people" (賤人) that formed intermediate standings between the four occupations and outright slavery. These were, in descending order:&lt;ref name="Outcast1"/&gt;

* general bondsmen 雑戶, including Imperial tomb guards
* musician households 樂戶
* official bondsmen 官戶

The '''gallowglasses''' (also spelt '''galloglass''', '''gallowglas''' or '''galloglas'''; from {{lang-ga|gall óglaigh}} meaning foreign warriors) were a class of elite [[mercenary]] [[warrior]]s who were principally members of the [[Norse-Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] clans of Scotland between the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|mid 13th century and late 16th century]]. As [[Scottish people|Scots]], they were [[Gaels]] and shared a common background and language with the [[Irish people|Irish]], but as they were descendants of 10th century [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland, the Irish called them ''Gall Gaeil'' ("foreign Gaels").

Large numbers of gallowglass [[sept]]s settled in Ireland after being dispossessed of their lands in Scotland for choosing to fight on the side for independence from England in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]]. An early family of gallowglasses were the [[Clan Sweeney|MacSweeneys]], settled by the [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnells]] in north Donegal. These were followed by [[MacDonnell of Antrim|MacDonnells]], [[MacCabe (surname)|MacCabes]] and several other groups settled by powerful Irish nobles in different areas. The gallowglasses were attractive as a heavily armoured, trained aristocratic infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position, unlike most Irish foot soldiers, who were lower class and less well armoured than the typical Irish noble who fought as cavalry. In time there came to be many native Irish gallowglasses as the term came to mean a type of warrior rather than an ethnic designation.

They were a significant part of Irish infantry before the advent of [[gunpowder]], and depended upon seasonal service with Irish chieftains. A military leader would often choose a gallowglass to serve as his personal aide and bodyguard because, as a foreigner, the gallowglass would be less subject to local feuds and influences.

==Name==
[[Image:Norse-Gael Warrior.PNG|thumb|125px|A Medieval [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] warrior.]]

The term is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''gallóglaigh'' (lit. "foreign young warriors"), with the [[English plural]] ''-s'' added to the end. The singular of ''gallóglaigh'' is ''gallóglach''. The word ''óglach'' comes from [[Old Irish]] ''oac'' (meaning "youth") and Old Irish ''lóeg'' (meaning "calf" but later becoming a word for a hero). Although the English term comes from an Irish plural, [[Encarta]] specifies the plural of gallowglass to be "gallowglasses".   [[Shakespeare]] uses the form "gallowglasses" in the play ''[[Macbeth]]''. 

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' prefers the spelling "galloglass" and provides several examples attesting to ordinary English plural forms of the word, dating back to a c. 1515 use of "galloglasseis". "The etymologically correct form galloglagh appears later than the erroneous galloglass, which was probably the result of the plural gallogla(gh)s; in some early instances galloglas seems to be used as a plural, but galloglasses is found already in our earliest quot."&lt;ref name="galloglass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/76340|title=galloglass |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origin==
The gallowglass were from the western coast of Scotland, principally Argyll and the Western Isles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_rvnmfJCGEAC&amp;dq=gallowglass#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cannan, Fergus. ''Gallowglass 1250–1600'', Osprey Publishing, 2010], {{ISBN|9781846035777}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their weapon of choice was a battle axe. Each was usually accompanied by a man to see to his weapons and armour and a boy to carry provisions.

==Description==
A description from 1600, speaks of the Gallowglass as "...pycked and scelected men of great and mightie bodies, crewell without compassion. The greatest force of the battell consisteth in them, chosing rather to dye than to yeelde, so that when yt cometh to handy blowes they are quickly slayne or win the fielde."&lt;ref&gt;''Tracts relating to Ireland'', Irish Archeological Society, vol. ii., Dublin, 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first record of gallowglass service was in [[1259 in Ireland|1259]], when [[Aedh mac Felim Ó Conchobair|Aedh Ó Conchobair]], [[King of Connacht]], received a dowry of 160 Scottish warriors from the daughter of [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri]], the [[Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Hebrides]]. They were organised into groups known as a "Corrughadh", which consisted of about 100 men. 

The importation of gallowglasses into Ireland was a major factor in containing the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] invasion of the 12th century, as their ranks stiffened the resistance of the Irish lordships. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Ireland, gallowglass troops were maintained by Gaelic Irish and [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords alike. Even the English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] usually kept a company of them in his service. (''See also: [[Norman Ireland]]''.)

In return for military service, gallowglass contingents were given land and settled in Irish lordships, where they were entitled to receive supplies from the local population.

By 1512, there were reported to be fifty-nine groups throughout the country under the control of the Irish nobility. Though initially they were mercenaries, over time they settled and their ranks became filled with both Scots-Norse and many native Irish men.

In 1569, [[Turlough Luineach O'Neill]] (''The O'Neill'') married [[Agnes Campbell|Lady Agnes Campbell]], daughter of [[Colin Campbell, 3rd Earl of Argyll]], and widow of [[James MacDonald, 6th of Dunnyveg]]. Her dowry consisted of at least 1,200 gallowglass fighters. Along with two young men as support and friends on top to assist or fight this could easily have numbered over 5,000 current and future gallowglasses coming into the area.&lt;ref name="Gallowglass"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albion-swords.com/swords/albion/nextgen/sword-medieval-irish-bastard-xix.htm |title=Gallowglass children in battle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were noted for wielding the massive two-handed [[Pole weapon#Sparth axe|sparth axe]] (a custom noted by [[Geraldus Cambrensis]], died c. 1223, to have derived from their Norse heritage) and broadsword or [[claymore]] ("claidheamh mór"). For armour, the gallowglass wore a [[mail (armour)|mail]] shirt over a padded jacket and an iron helmet; he was usually accompanied by two boys (like a knight's [[squire]]s), one of whom carried his [[Javelin|throwing spear]]s while the other carried his provisions.

[[Shakespeare]] mentions gallowglasses in his play ''[[Macbeth]]'', although along with other aspects of the play it is an anachronism, as the [[Macbeth of Scotland|historical Macbeth]] lived in the 11th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The merciless Macdonwald,
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him, from the Western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper entitled "A Description of the Power of Irishmen", written early in the 16th century, the Irish forces of [[Leinster]] are numbered at 522 horse, five battalions of gallowglass (gallóglaigh) and 1,432 [[Kern (soldier)|kerne]], and those of the other provinces were in like proportion. [[MacCarthy Mór|Mac Cárthaigh Mór]] commanded 40 horse, two battalions of gallowglass, and 2,000 kerne; the [[Earl of Desmond]] 400 horse, three battalions of gallowglass, and 3,000 kerne, besides a battalion of crossbowmen and gunners, the smaller chieftains supplying each their quota of men.

[[Image:Galloglass-circa-1521.jpg|thumb|300px|Irish gallowglass and [[Kern (soldier)|kern]]. Drawing by [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1521. This is now thought to have been derived from a 1518 written account by Laurent Vital, rather than a drawing from life.]]

In 1517, "when the reformacion of the countrye was taken in hand", it was reported that the Irish forces in [[Thomond]] were 750 horse, 2,324 kerne, and six "batayles" of gallowglass, the latter including 60 to 80 footmen harnessed with spears; each of these had a man to bear his harness, some of whom themselves carried spears or bows.

Every kerne had a bow, a "skieve" or quiver, three spears, a sword, and a skene&lt;ref&gt;[[Sgian-dubh]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Irish ''scian'' or Scottish Gaelic ''sgian''), each two of them having a lad to carry their weapons. The horsemen had two horses apiece, some three, the second bearing the "knave" or his attendant.

The 16th century in Ireland saw an escalation in military conflict, caused by the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. Gallowglass fighters were joined by native Irish mercenaries called ''[[buanadha]]'' (literally "quartered men") and by newer Scottish mercenaries known as "[[redshanks]]". The flow of mercenaries into Ireland was such a threat to English occupation that [[Queen Elizabeth I]] took steps against them in 1571—around 700 of them were executed after the first of the [[Desmond Rebellions]].

Despite the increased use of firearms in Irish warfare, gallowglasses remained an important part of [[Hugh Ó Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh Ó Neill]]'s forces in the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. After the combined Irish defeat at the [[Battle of Kinsale]] in 1601, recruitment of gallowglasses waned, although Scottish Highland mercenaries continued to come to Ireland until the 1640s (notably [[Alasdair Mac Colla]]). They fought under the Irish general [[Owen Roe O'Neill|Eoin Roe O'Neill]] at the [[Battle of Benburb]] when O'Neill had an overwhelming victory in 1646. The gallowglasses of the [[MacCarthy Reagh|Mac Cárthaigh Riabhaigh]] are recorded as having attacked [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]] in [[County Cork]] as late as 1645.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Images of gallowglasses fighting as mercenaries in European mainland armies were sketched by [[Dürer]] in 1521 and later by French and Dutch artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22907123|title=A history of Ireland|last=1931-1996.|first=Somerset Fry, Plantagenet,|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|others=Somerset Fry, Fiona.|isbn=0415048885|location=London|oclc=22907123}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gallowglasses served in the [[Dutch Blue Guards]], [[Swiss Guard]], the French [[Garde Écossaise|Scottish Guard]], and the forces of King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] in his invasion of [[Livonia]] during the [[Thirty Years War]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[Milford, County Donegal|Milford]] or Millford, historically called Ballynagalloglagh (from Irish: Baile na nGallóglach), is a small town and townland in [[County Donegal]], Ireland. The Irish Baile na nGallóglach literally means "town of the gallóglach". A battle between the Irish (helped by gallóglaigh) and the English took place on a hill in the townland and this is where the name comes from.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20677">A '''green-collar worker''' is a worker who is employed in the environmental sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest.  [http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html "Working Man's Blues:  Why do we call manual laborers blue collar?"] [[Slate.com]], 01 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental green-collar workers (or [[green job]]s) satisfy the demand for [[green development]]. Generally, they implement environmentally conscious design, policy, and technology to improve [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[sustainability]]. Formal environmental regulations as well as informal social expectations are pushing many firms to seek professionals with expertise with environmental, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], and clean [[renewable energy]] issues. They often seek to make their output more sustainable, and thus more favorable to public opinion, governmental regulation, and the Earth's [[ecology]].

Green collar workers include professionals such as [[conservation movement]] workers, environmental consultants, council environmental services/[[waste management]]/[[recycling]] managers/officers, environmental or biological systems engineers, [[green building]] [[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, holistic [[passive solar building design]]ers, [[solar energy]] and [[wind energy]] engineers and installers, nuclear engineers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C_Westinghouse_gets_set_for_UK_reactor_construction_0509081.html|title=Westinghouse gets set for UK construction|website=www.world-nuclear-news.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401209_pf.html Going Nuclear: A Green Makes the Case], The Washington Post, April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3651881.stm France closes its last coal mine], BBC, April 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/06/60minutes/main2655782.shtml France: Vive Les Nukes], "60 Minutes," CBS, April 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8120563/ Hot idea: Fight warming with nuclear power], MSNBC, July 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolo.org/|title=Environmentalists For Nuclear - International home page homepage (EFN)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ecolo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[green vehicle]] engineers, "green business" owners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/445/index.html| title = Green Collar Jobs| publisher = [[NOW on PBS]]|date = 2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[green vehicle]],  organic farmers, environmental lawyers, ecology educators, and [[ecotechnology]] workers, and sales staff working with these services or products.  Green collar workers also include vocational or trade-level workers: [[electrician]]s who install [[solar panel]]s, [[plumber]]s who install solar water heaters, recycling centre/MRF attendants, process managers and collectors, construction workers who build energy-efficient [[green building]]s and [[wind power]] farms, construction workers who weatherize buildings to make them more energy efficient, or other workers involved in clean, [[renewable]], [[sustainable]] [[future energy development]].

There is a growing movement to incorporate social responsibility within the green industries. A sustainable green economy simultaneously values the importance of [[natural resources]] and inclusive, equitable, and healthy opportunities for all communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.greenforall.org/about-us/our-mission| title = Our Mission| publisher = [[Green For All]]|accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the current world economic crisis, many experts now argue that a massive push to develop renewable sources of energy could create millions of new jobs and help the economy recover while simultaneously improving the environment, increasing labour conditions in poor economies, and strengthening energy and [[food security]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Al Gore Repower America ==
{{Main|Alliance for climate protection}}
[[Al Gore]] states that economists across the spectrum — including [[Martin Feldstein]] and [[Lawrence Summers]] — agree that large and rapid investments in a jobs-intensive infrastructure initiative is the best way to revive the economy in a quick and sustainable way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Al|last=Gore|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/opinion/09gore.html?ex=1383886800&amp;en=d122cebad6bb8596&amp;ei=5124|title=The Climate for Change|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for American Progress ==
A report from the Center for American Progress concludes that a $100 billion federal investment in clean energy technologies over 2009 and 2010 would yield 2 million new U.S. jobs, cutting the unemployment rate by 1.3% and put the nation on a path toward a low-carbon economy. The report, prepared by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], proposes $50 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy systems; $46 billion in direct government spending for public building retrofits, mass transit, freight rail, smart electrical grid systems, and renewable energy systems; and $4 billion for federal loan guarantees to help finance building retrofits and renewable energy projects. The  Center believes that clean energy investments would yield about 300,000 more jobs than if the same funds were distributed among U.S. taxpayers. The clean energy investments would also have the added benefits of lower home energy bills and reduced prices for non-renewable energy sources, due to the reduced consumption of those energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11979| title = EERE Network News|publisher = [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|EERE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwatch Institute/UNEP==
Global efforts to tackle [[climate change]] could result in millions of "green" jobs over the coming decades, according to a 2008 study prepared by the [[Worldwatch Institute]] with funding from the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).  The study found that the global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from $1.37 trillion per year at present to $2.74 trillion by 2020, with half of that market in [[efficient energy use]]. In terms of  energy supply, the [[renewable energy industry]] will be particularly important. Some 2.3 million people have found [[renewable energy]] jobs in recent years, and projected investments of $630 billion by 2030 would translate into at least 20 million additional jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=545&amp;ArticleID=5929&amp;l=en|title = Landmark New Report Says Emerging Green Economy Could Create Tens of Millions of New "Green Jobs"| publisher = [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]]|date = 2008-09-24|accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Conference of Mayors==
Also in 2008, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released a report that finds the U.S. economy currently generates more than 750,000 green jobs, while over the next 30 years, an emphasis on [[clean energy]] could result in a five-fold increase, to more than 4.2 million jobs. Engineering, legal, research, and consulting jobs currently dominate the green jobs in the United States and could grow by 1.4 million by 2038, while renewable electricity production will create 1.23 million jobs, alternative transportation fuels will add 1.5 million jobs, and building retrofits will create another 81,000 jobs. The report notes that most of today's jobs are in metropolitan areas, led by New York City; Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usmayors.org/pressreleases/uploads/greenjobkeyfinds.pdf| title = 2008 Green Jobs Report|author =[[United States Conference of Mayors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|300px|right|The Vattenfall study found Nuclear, Hydro, and Wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]
The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full life cycle emissions of Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind which the utility uses to produce electricity.  The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per KW-Hr of produced power.  This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study).  The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of any of their electricity sources.&lt;ref&gt;nuclearinfo.net.

"Green collar" is used in the [[Cannabis]] culture to refer to a person who finds acceptance or enjoyment of cannabis culture and cannabis products. The term is a play on the traditional uses of the terms "white collar" and "blue collar," notably, to indicate that there is broad acceptance and enjoyment of cannabis culture that transcends socioeconomic stratifications.

'''Guhu-Samane''', also known as ''Bia, Mid-Waria, Muri, Paiawa, Tahari'', is a divergent [[Trans–New Guinea languages|Trans–New Guinea]] language that is related to the [[Binanderean languages|Binanderean family]] in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] (2005).

==Dialects==
Smallhorn (2011:131) gives the following dialects.
*Kipu (most widely spoken)
*Bapi
*Garaina
*Sekare
*Sinaba
The dialect differences are principally lexical, but two voiced [[obstruent]]s also show regular variants. The coronal obstruent is realized as /dz/ upriver in Bapi and Garaina, /d/ downriver to Asama, and /j/ farther downriver in Papua. The voiced bilabial is realized as /b/ inland but as /w/ at the coast (Sinaba and Paiawa) (Handman 2015:102).

The '''History Commons''' is a [[web site]] and organization that documents events and issues of great social and political significance, focusing primarily on events and issues from the 1970s to the present day. The History Commons operates under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4267|publisher=Creativecommons.org |accessdate= 2009-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally sponsored by The Global Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Center |url=http://www.globalvision.org |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703223644/http://www.globalvision.org/ |archivedate=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[501(c)(3)]] organization, and is now operated by the Center for Grassroots Oversight, itself a 501(c)3 organization.&lt;ref name="About the History Commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/aboutsite.jsp |title=About this Site |publisher=History Commons |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was previously named '''Center for Cooperative Research''', and was located at cooperativeresearch.org.&lt;ref name="Timeline of Tragedy"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Ridgeway |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2004/04/13/timeline-of-tragedy/ |title=Timeline of Tragedy|publisher=Village Voice |date=2004-04-13 |accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and purpose==
According to the History Commons "About" page, the purpose of the website is: "To provide a means for members of civil society to monitor the activities of powerful entities, such as governments, large corporations, and wealthy and influential individuals." And: "The Web site is a tool for [[Open-source journalism|open-content participatory journalism]]. It allows people to investigate important issues by providing a space where people can collaborate on the documentation of past and current events, as well as the entities associated with those events. The Web site can be used to investigate topics at the local, regional, or global level. The data is displayed on the Web site in the form of dynamic timelines and entity profiles, and is exportable into [[XML]] so it can be shared with others for non-commercial purposes." &lt;ref name="About the History Commons" /&gt; However, the data export feature was non-functional as of April 2008 and has not been fixed since.&lt;ref name="Broken XML export"&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/phorum5/read.php?1,1524 ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016055446/http://www.historycommons.org/phorum5/read.php?1%2C1524 |date=October 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Conceptual Summary" posted on the History Commons blog elaborates on this theme: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The History Commons is a free and open space where you can collaborate with others to chronicle history, monitor powerful private interests, and conduct oversight of governments. ... The History Commons ... is people-powered and people-driven, as opposed to being driven by powerful entities that represent a very narrow band of society. Contributors to HC work together to build an online documented version of the historical record. It is a socially and politically significant exercise because it has the potential to create a version of the historical narrative that is written by a wider swath of society, and therefore serves a broader scope of interests. It is a narrative that is less subject to control by the dominant sectors of society. Contributors participate for a variety of reasons. In most cases they are people who have an acute interest in politics and who have a perspective on history and current events that is in conflict with the narrative that is broadcast by powerful interests such as governments and the major media networks. They write because they want to create a written record of alternative narratives that checks the power of these interests. This is a key element of the History Commons' 'people-driven' nature, where the diverse contributions of its users make it possible to produce a record that transcends particular ideological and social agendas.&lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Timelines are the main feature and research tool of the website: 32 timelines have been published as of June 2012, profiling more than 19,700 events and more than 18,000 entities, e.g. individuals, governments/agencies, businesses and organizations.&lt;ref name="History Commons Timelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/timelines.jsp |title=History Commons |publisher=History Commons |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other timelines are in the planning and development stage.&lt;ref name="History Commons New Topic Listing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqtimeline.com/hctopics/index.html |title=History Commons New Topic Listing |publisher=Iraqtimeline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "timeline," though accurate, is something of a misnomer. The content (dated summaries of events) is organized into chronological timelines, but the term "project" is somewhat more descriptive as many timelines/projects have a broad scope due to the complexity of the topic focus, and consist of multiple, subsidiary, cross-referenced timelines. The homepage of each project displays a table of contents, with links to subsidiary timelines and actual individual entries. The timelines are dynamic: By clicking on the title of an event summary, a "scalable context timeline" is produced, the scope of which can be narrowed or broadened depending on the proximity of other events or entities in relation to that particular event summary. Timelines can also be rendered by clicking on reference links or tags in an event summary, or by searching names, keywords or dates; this returns a timeline including the relevant event summaries. Each event summary cites at least one authoritative source, e.g. governments, organizations, mainstream media, scholars, investigative journalists and other recognized experts. All projects are works in progress; the goal is to provide the most current, comprehensive and detailed overview of each project's subject, and the related time periods, events and entities.

Project content is written, edited, and posted by independent volunteer contributors who are responsible for their work. In July 2008, History Commons project manager Michael Tuck wrote in an article for [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman Watchdog]], "Contributors own their content; the Commons provides a searchable information base where disparate material can be brought together in a single repository." &lt;ref name="The History Commons - an online tool for journalists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=showcase.view&amp;showcaseid=0086/ |title=The History Commons - an online tool for journalists |publisher=Niemanwatchdog.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Wikipedia]], the History Commons is a database that the public can edit and add content to. Some important differences are that the ability to do so is limited to registered users, and that entries/edits go through an editorial peer-review process before being published. According to a History Commons "Conceptual Summary", 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are three steps to the review process. After an entry is submitted, it is reviewed for content to ensure that it is well-written and well-sourced. Sources are checked to ensure that what is in the entry accurately reflects the source material without resorting to plagiarism. An entry approved for content is then submitted for copyediting, using the HC style manual as a guide. If the event is rejected during the first step, it is sent back to the user, who reads over the comments and then resubmits the entry. If it is approved, another user, who is in charge of managing the user-defined timeline that the event was submitted to, then makes a decision whether or not the verified event should be added to the timeline. Each event is thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and proper [[grammar]] and [[spelling]]. &lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historycommons.wordpress.com/conceptual-summary-of-project/ |title=Conceptual Summary of Project &amp;#124; HistoryCommons |publisher=Historycommons.wordpress.com |date=2005-03-16 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Featured timelines==

==History==
The History Commons website was originally developed and operated by the now-defunct Center for Cooperative Research (CCR),&lt;ref name="Timeline of Tragedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Center for Cooperative Research"&gt;[http://glo.org/pre2009/archives/node/1133.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded in 2001 by Derek Mitchell, a California-based social entrepreneur. Along with software developer Michael Bevin, Mitchell helped develop the History Commons web application after it became apparent that a static HTML-based Web site was not enough to manage its rapidly expanding content. In June 2002, environmental activist [[Paul Thompson (9/11 researcher)|Paul Thompson]] joined CCR, bringing with him a copious amount of research on the [[September 11 attacks]]. Thompson eventually used the material he contributed to the website for his 2004 book, [[The Terror Timeline]]. Due to the quality of the research, Thompson was invited by Rep. [[Cynthia McKinney]] to testify at a Congressional hearing on the failings and flaws of the [[9/11 Commission]] [[Criticism of the 9/11 Commission|report]], and he did so in 2005.&lt;ref name="September 11 Commission Report Results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/event/135385 |title=September 11 Commission Report Results, Pt. 1 - C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=2005-07-22 |accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell, Thompson, and other researchers steadily expanded the website's projects and timelines. In 2007, the Center for Grassroots Oversight (CGO) took over operation of the website, renaming it to the History Commons. The current version of the History Commons Web application is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and runs on [[Apache Tomcat]]. The data is stored in a [[MySQL]] database accessed through JDO. The presentation layer is done in [[Java Server Page|JSP]] using a templating system called Bricks." &lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project"/&gt;

==Features==
===Users===
Users of the History Commons can read through the 33 major projects listed on the Timelines page, or any of the subsidiary timelines listed in each project's table of contents.&lt;ref name="History Commons Timelines"/&gt; The History Commons Web application can also create dynamic timelines by clicking on an event summary title or tag, or by searching a keyword or entity name. The History Commons Web application also generates a "context timeline" based on a particular event, which shows the summary for that event along with associated summaries describing similar or related events. Context timelines are scalable, so a user can focus his or her search as narrowly or as widely as desired. The History Commons Conceptual Summary states: "[T]he user is able to conduct a finely tuned search for specific information regarding a specific entity or event, or can launch a more broad-based search for information of wider interest." &lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project" /&gt;

===Contributors===
Those choosing to contribute material can begin contributing by creating an account with the History Commons and then submitting specific entries on a topic of their choice. Each submitted entry is required to have at least one source, usually a news article, a government or [[non-governmental organization]] document, or a book, and is peer-reviewed by other contributors and project managers before being published to the database for public viewing.&lt;ref name="About the History Commons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project" /&gt; The site provides a detailed style manual &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Contribution and Style Manual | url=http://www.historycommons.org/stylemanual.jsp|publisher=Historycommons.org |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a walkthrough tutorial &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Entries for Dummies' | url=http://www.historycommons.org/entries4dummies.jsp|publisher=Historycommons.org |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid prospective contributors.

==Commentary on the website==
Numerous individuals have given feedback on the History Commons, often praising it for its uniqueness and usefulness.

In October 2010, Salon commentator [[Glenn Greenwald]] called the History Commons's Watergate project a "richly documented summary of those events." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/10/24/assange_2/singleton/|title='The Nixonian henchmen of today: at the NYT'|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Salon.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423143204/http://www.salon.com/2010/10/24/assange_2/singleton/|archive-date=2012-04-23|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 e-mail to the site, author [[Philip Shenon]], a veteran [[New York Times]] reporter and author of ''The Commission'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Commission'' is published by Twelve {{ISBN|978-0-446-58075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book about the [[9/11 Commission]], wrote: "Your timeline has been invaluable to me over the years. I'm certainly aware of - and flattered by - your citations from my book." &lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project" /&gt;

[[Craig Unger]], author  of ''House of Bush, House of Saud'' &lt;ref&gt;''House of Bush, House of Saud'' is published by Scribner {{ISBN|978-0-7432-5339-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Fall of the House of Bush'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Fall of the House of Bush'' is published by Scribner {{ISBN|978-0-7432-8075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "For serious research, it's hard to think of a more valuable resource than the timelines assembled by History Commons. The material they provide is a welcome antidote to the misinformation and disinformation that has been coming out of Washington in recent years and they are essential tools in assembling a counter-narrative that more honestly addresses the crises we face." In his acknowledgements to ''House of Bush, House of Saud,'' Unger wrote: "The Center for Cooperative Research is another valuable Internet tool. Because I made a practice of citing original sources, it does not appear in my notes nearly as often as it might. However, its timelines about 911 and related issues often helped me find exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend it to anyone doing research on 9/11 and I encourage its support."

Author [[Peter Lance]] wrote, in the acknowledgements of his book ''Cover-Up'': "As mentioned throughout, I was blessed in this state of my research with access to Paul Thompson's remarkable timelines from the Center for Cooperative Research each citation in that database is supported by a news story from the mainstream media. ... Any research, reporter, or scholar with an interest in the war on terror would consider the Cooperative Research timelines a bonanza of open source information." &lt;ref&gt;''Cover-up'' is published by Harper {{ISBN|978-0-06-079511-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Village Voice]] correspondent [[James Ridgeway]] wrote in April 2004: "Paul Thompson ... is one of a handful of freelance, unpaid, amateur sleuths who have become a 9/11 Information Central—what amounts to an intelligence apparatus aimed at pinning down what the Bush administration knew and didn't know about 9/11, before and after the attacks. The results of this sleuthing often find their way to the 9/11 families, and in particular, to the by now mythic [[Jersey Girls]], as the leaders of the survivors' families have come to be called. The researchers are in many ways similar to the team [[Scott Armstrong (journalist)|Scott Armstrong]], the former [[Washington Post]] reporter, recruited in the mid 1980s to uncover the roots of Reagan's secret [[Iran-Contra]] deals. ... At the hub of the 9-11 research is [Paul] Thompson's intricate timeline. ... Still other timelines delve into official 'lies' from 1979 forward. ... [Derek] Mitchell's aim is to keep the entries as neutrally written and as well sourced as he can." &lt;ref name="Timeline of Tragedy" /&gt; In his 2005 book, ''The Five Unanswered Questions of 9/11'', Ridgeway referred to Thompson's book, ''The Terror Timeline'', as "still the most comprehensive summary of the events related to the 9/11 attacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridgeway|first=James|title=The Five Unanswered Questions of 9/11|year=2005|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1583227121|page=8|edition=1st print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the book contained only a significant fraction of the total amount of information contained in The Complete 9/11 Timeline at CooperativeResearch.org, and a great deal of material has since been added.

[[New York Magazine]] correspondent Mark Jacobson wrote in 2006, "[The History Commons'] 9/11 timeline has become the undisputed gold standard of truth research ..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ground Zero Grassy Knoll | url=http://nymag.com/news/features/16464/index2.html|publisher=Nymag.com |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minneapolis City Pages reporter Steve Perry wrote in 2003 that the History Commons is "endlessly informative." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bush Administration's Top 40 Lies about War and Terrorism | url=http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0730-06.htm|publisher=Commondreams.org |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Erlacher, the director of Austria's [[Elevate Festival]], wrote in an e-mail to the site: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The History Commons is one of the most important and technologically advanced projects of civil journalism there is today. The website of the project is an enormous resource for researchers. Because of the excellent possibilities to tag entities and to group them in timetables, people can easily read and filter information, which is usually presented out of context. The History Commons is a project which helps connect the dots and sheds light on several inconsistencies in official narratives of some of the most important stories of our time. The Elevate Festival was very proud to present the project for the first time in Europe in 2008 and we will continue to support it.&lt;ref name="Conceptual Summary of Project" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elevate Festival | url=http://www.elevate.at|publisher=Elevate.at |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Matthew Hurst wrote on his Data Mining blog in 2008: "The site is a cooperative approach to history and presents data in timelines. ... I like this vertical approach to wiki data as it has the potential to focus both expertise and data structures, making the data more valuable in a number of dimensions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Commons | url=http://datamining.typepad.com/data_mining/2008/04/history-commons.html|publisher=Datamining.typepad.com |accessdate=2009-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[David Ray Griffin]] wrote in the acknowledgements of his book ''The New Pearl Harbor Revisited

&lt;blockquote&gt;In acknowledging the tremendous amount of help and support I received in writing this book, I wish to begin by mentioning the indispensable source for 9/11-related stories published in the mainstream press: The Complete 9/11 Timeline at History Commons (formerly known as Cooperative Research). ... [I]t has surely become, through the continuing work of [Paul] Thompson and his colleagues, the greatest feat of annotated, investigative journal indexing ever achieved on a volunteer basis. Having served as the source of about half of my references in ''The New Pearl Harbor'', this timeline has been equally indispensable for ''The New Pearl Harbor Revisited''.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Pearl Harbor Revisited'' is published by Olive Branch Press {{ISBN|978-1-56656-729-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Culture of Benin}}

[[File:Marche ouando porto-novo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Signs in French at a market in Porto Novo.]]

'''Benin''' is a diverse country linguistically. A total of 55 languages are spoken in [[Benin]], with 50 being indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=BJ|title=Benin |work=[[Ethnologue]]|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, [[French language|French]] is the [[official language]], and all the [[indigenous languages|indigenous]] languages are considered [[national language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} LaClerc, Jacques [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/afrique/benin.htm Bénin" dans ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde''], Québec, TLFQ, Université Laval, 1 Feb 2010 (accessed 2 Nov 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Beninese languages, [[Fon language|Fon]] (a [[Gbe language]]) and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are the most important in the south of the country. In the north there are half a dozen regionally important languages, including [[Bariba language|Bariba]] (once counted as a [[Gur language]]) and [[Fulfulde]].

Education for the deaf in Benin uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]].

The [[multilingual]] character of Beninese society is characterized by the number of languages spoken, ethno-linguistic diversity, stratification of language use (whereby French is used officially and other languages used in other spheres of activity), and by the fact that many Beninese are [[polyglot]]s.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;

==French language in Benin==
The official language of Benin varies by the population, about 4 million people. It is important to know to get an administrative position or work in the cities in general, and speaking French is a mark of prestige. According to a study by Amadou Sanni and Mahouton Atodjinou in 2012, it is estimated that Benin will be completely Francophone by 2060. The authors note that, in 2002, 43 percent of men spoke the language compared to 25.8 percent of women. In 2002, more than half of the residents of [[Cotonou]] spoke French.&lt;ref name="UZ5DE1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=La langue française dans le monde, Édition 2014.|url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/|page=7|work=Francophonie.org|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; French was introduced during the [[French Dahomey|colonial period]] and retained as the official language upon independence. Today it is an important [[lingua franca]] between diverse ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=oridev&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oridev.org/lescotonois/langue/diformes.htm |title=Les formes de français à Cotonou |work=Oridev.org| language=French| accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constitution grants freedom of expression, all printed media outlets are in French and not the indigenous languages. Benin is a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la francophonie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francophonie.org/Benin.html Benin] ''[[La Francophonie]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The region of Benin Gi-Mono is a member of the International Association of Francophone regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regions-francophones.com|title=Regions Francophones|work=Association Internationale des Regions Francophones|language=French|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique variety of French called ''français d'Afrique'' has developed in the streets and markets of Cotonou. Grammatical structures are typically borrowed from the speaker's first language. It is especially the conjugation rules that have been changed the most, especially the less common forms like the literary style. It has an almost [[wikt:argotic|argotic]] character.&lt;ref name=oridev/&gt;

==National languages==
[[File:Nigeria Benin Cameroon languages.png|thumb|left|Language map of Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon]]
[[Fon language|Fon]] is the most widely spoken indigenous language, spoken by 24% of the population. It is the first language of more than 17% of Benin's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elan-afrique.org/quelles-actions-menees-page/benin |title=Benin Description|work=Elan Afrique|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language is mainly spoken in the [[Atlantique Department|Atlantique]], [[Littoral Department|Littoral]], [[Collines Department|Collines]] and [[Zou Department]]s.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houngnikpo|first1=Mathurin|last2=Decalo|first2=Samuel|title=Historical Dictionary of Benin|date=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0810871718|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important languages are [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]],  [[Bariba language|Bariba]], [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Dendi language|Dendi]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; Benin implemented a National Literacy and Adult Education Policy, which allowed adult speakers of national languages to use their languages for cultural advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/BJ-language.htm|title=The Languages Spoken in Benin|work=Study Country|publisher=EU Business School|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the capital of [[Porto Novo]], the two main ethnoliguistic groups are Yoruba and [[Gouin language|Gouin]], with the smaller population of Wemi, Seto, Tori, Xwala, Defi, and Tofin speakers. Yoruba newspapers from neighboring Nigeria are popular.&lt;ref name=urban/&gt;

==Foreign languages==
[[English language|English]] is studied as a foreign language in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Country_Specific/benin_EDoc.html Facts About the Republic of Benin: Official Document] [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high demand for English teachers in Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collin|first1=Simon|title=The Guide to English Language Teaching Yearbook 2005|year=2005|publisher=Modern English Publishing|isbn=190454908X|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is emerging as an important language of trade in Benin due to it being the national tongue of Benin's regionally powerful neighbor [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=urban&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Fiona|title=The Languages of Urban Africa|year=2011|publisher=Continuum Publishing|isbn=1441158138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of [[scandals]] in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[journalism]] during the 21st century.

==Financial scams==
===City Slickers, ''Daily Mirror'' (1999-2000)===
Two financial journalists working on the City Slickers section of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' were convicted in 2005 for buying, tipping and then selling shares between 1999 and 2000, breaching the [[Financial Services Act 1986|Financial Services Act]]. Investigations revealed James Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul made at least £41,000 from those wrongdoings. The investigation also revealed that [[Piers Morgan]], editor of the newspaper, actually encouraged this behaviour. James Hipwell and Anil Bhoyrul were fired from the ''Daily Mirror'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4507448.stm City Slickers guilty of tip scam], ''Bbc.co.uk'', 7 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflicts==
===James Forlong, Sky News (2003)===
In April 2003, the [[Sky News]] TV network carried a report from James Forlong aboard the [[United Kingdom|British]] nuclear [[submarine]] [[HMS Splendid|HMS ''Splendid'']], purportedly showing the live firing of a [[cruise missile]] at sea in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iraq War]]. The report included scenes of the crew members giving instructions related to the launch of the missile, and included a sequence in which a crew member pressed a large red button marked with the word "FIRE", accompanied by a sequence of a missile breaking the surface of the water and launching into the air. The report was a fabrication, with the crew acting along for the benefit of the cameras. The ''Sky News'' team did not accompany the submarine when it left port, and the scenes were actually recorded whilst the vessel was docked. The shot of the missile breaking the surface had been obtained from [[stock footage]].

The faked report was revealed because a [[BBC]] film crew did accompany the vessel to sea. The BBC crew filmed a real cruise missile launch for the BBC TV series ''Fighting the War''. The BBC footage showed how, with modern computerised launching systems, a missile is not launched by pressing a red button, but is actually launched with a left [[Computer mouse|mouse]] click. Following the BBC's accusations, Forlong and his producer were suspended; the next day, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Forlong had resigned following an internal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Deans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/18/iraqandthemedia.tvnews |title=Sky News reporter quits over bogus Iraq story &amp;#124; Media |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up article, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Matt Wells speculated on the fake's long-term effects on Sky News's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = The backfiring missile |work = [[The Guardian]] |date = July 21, 2003 |url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1002105,00.html |accessdate=2008-10-11 |location=London |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, Forlong was found dead by his wife, having committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3168220.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; War reporter found dead |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-06 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Sky News was fined £50,000 by the [[Independent Television Commission]] for breaching accuracy regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sky fined £50,000 over war report |work = [[BBC News]] |date = December 16, 2003 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3324281.stm |accessdate = 2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adnan Hajj, Reuters (2006) ===
[[Reuters]] pulled 920 photographs of the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] from [[freelance]] photographer Adnan Hajj in August 2006, after it was exposed that several high-profile photographs had been altered heavily in [[Adobe Photoshop]]; see [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]]. The manipulations exaggerated the damage done by Israeli [[bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 6, 2006 |url=http://editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950988&amp;imw=Y |title=Smoke and Mirrors: Reuters Dismisses Photog Over Doctored Beirut Picture |publisher=[[Editor and Publisher]] |accessdate=2006-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908091324/http://editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950988&amp;imw=Y |archivedate=2006-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters "killed" the 'photograph' and admitted that the photographer had altered it, saying "photo editing software was improperly used on this image. A corrected version will immediately follow this advisory. We are sorry for any inconvenience."&lt;ref name=ynet0806&gt;{{cite web|date=August 6, 2006|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286966,00.html|title=Reuters admits altering Beirut photo|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|accessdate=2006-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moira Whittle, Reuters' Head of PR, said: "Reuters takes such matters extremely seriously as it is strictly against company editorial policy to alter pictures."&lt;ref name=ynet0806/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5254838.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Reuters drops Beirut photographer |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2006-08-08 |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Ramsay, Sky News (2016) ===
Sky News's Chief Correspondent, Stuart Ramsay, was accused by the Romanian authorities of faking a TV report in which alleged gun traffickers were filmed near the Romanian-Ukrainian border saying that they were willing to sell weapons to the highest bidder, including terrorists. The Romanian [[Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism]] (''Direcţia de Investigare a Infracţiunilor de Criminalitate Organizată şi Terorism'', DIICOT) quickly arrested the alleged gun traffickers from the TV report; it concluded that they were authorized hunters and the rifles seen in the report were also registered semi-automatic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diicot.ro/index.php/arhiva/1853-press-release-11-08-2016-eng |title=Press release 11.08.2016 [ENG&amp;#93; |website=Diicot.ro |date= |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky News and Stuart Ramsay stuck to the original story, claiming the footage was real and that the gun traffickers did operate near the Romanian-Ukrainian border. All the individuals involved in the filming of the TV report, including Ramsay, are now under investigation by DIICOT.

The Romanian Prime Minister [[Dacian Ciolos]] criticized the TV report, claiming it to be inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 11, 2016 |title=Dacian Ciolos @ Sky News TV Report |url=http://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2016/08/11/ciolos-despre-reportajul-sky-news-este-inadmisibil-nu-poti-sa-denigrezi-o-tara-fara-sa-ai-dovezi-17-40-00 |website=Agerpres.ro |accessdate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying techniques==
===Phone hacking, ''News of the World'' (2006–)===
{{main article|News of the World phone hacking affair}}

In 2006, a UK tabloid newspaper phone-hacking scandal arose involving the defunct ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper and other British titles published by [[News International]], a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's [[News Corp]]. Reporters and managers working at the newspapers were accused of 'hacking' the phone voicemail inboxes of celebrities, notable public figures (such as the British [[Royal Family]]), and even the victims of crimes (including [[Milly Dowler]]) and their families, in order to gather material for stories. There were also allegations of police bribery and other misdemeanours.

The resulting public outcry led to several high-profile resignations. Advertiser boycotts led to the News of the World being shuttered, publishing its final edition on 10 July 2011, after 168 years of publication. News Corporation was also to cancel its proposed takeover of the British satellite broadcaster [[BSkyB]]. The then prime minister, [[David Cameron]], announced a public inquiry would look into the complaints made against the News of the World. This became known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], after the judge presiding over it, [[Lord Justice Leveson]]. A number of arrests and convictions followed, most notably that of the former ''News of the World'' managing editor [[Andy Coulson]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]].

==Cover-ups==
===Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal===
{{main article|Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal}}
In September and October 2012, almost a year after his death, claims were widely publicised that [[Jimmy Savile]] had committed sexual abuse, his alleged victims ranging from [[Puberty|prepubescent]] girls and boys to adults. The investigations undertaken jointly by the police and the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] (NSPCC), ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'' reported allegations covering a period of fifty years, including 214 alleged acts by Savile which, though uncorroborated, have been formally recorded as crimes, some involving children as young as eight. The report states "within the recorded crimes there are 126 indecent acts and 34 rape/penetration offences."

After his death on 29 October 2011, [[Meirion Jones]] and [[Liz Mackean]] from the BBC programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' began to investigate reports that he had sexually abused children. They found evidence to support the allegations. The ''Newsnight'' report was scheduled for broadcast on BBC on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women, and ''Newsnight'' was in a position to break the story in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC releases Pollard report into axed Jimmy Savile Newsnight investigation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/19/bbc-report-jimmy-savile-newsnight|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Newsnight'' spokesman said, "Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9073142/BBC-buried-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-to-save-its-reputation.html |author=Singh, Anita |title=BBC 'buried Savile sex abuse claims to save its reputation' |work=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Journalism Awards==
In 2012, the British Journalism Awards was created by UK media magazine ''[[Press Gazette]]'' in response to the latest scandals and to value great contributions to journalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awards.pressgazette.co.uk/about-british-journalism-awards/ About the British Journalism Awards], ''Pressgazette.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Long Meiyi''' ({{zh|c=龙美伊}}) is a woman from [[Guizhou]] province in [[China]] who alleged she was raped by mining magnate Zhou Shili. Long's allegations made domestic and international headlines after she and her parents began appealing to [[Beijing]] for justice and complaining of corruption in the courts. A significant factor in the case's popularity is that Long's mother and stepfather are government officials in China, who have generally found themselves on the other side of the politicised legal system that she now claims is obstructing the justice she seeks.

Long's case caused a sensation in the Chinese [[blogosphere]] as it was revealed that her stepfather, Tian Wancang, was responsible for Liupanshui's "stability preservation" efforts, which means that in addition to police and other security groups, he ran the ''letters and complaints'' system that is supposed to provide an avenue for disgruntled citizens while simultaneously focusing on gathering intelligence about those citizens.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

==Background==
When Long was 19, she met Zhou Shili at a Beijing [[night club]]. It was 26 December 2008. Long says that Zhou then tried to curry favour with her in hopes of gaining access to her stepfather, Tian Wancang, the vice-mayor of [[Liupanshui]], a city of approximately 3 million people.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;John Garnaut,  [https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/08/kafka_in_beijing Kafka in Beijing], Foreign Policy, 8 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou is the head of [[Qingli Group]], which owns a number of mines in China, and he is also a standing committee member of the provincial China People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory body that provides him with access to top people in the government.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;John Garnaut, [http://www.smh.com.au/world/cracks-in-the-armour-as-voices-refuse-to-quieten-20120914-25xin.html Cracks in the armour as voices refuse to quieten], Sydney Morning Herald, September 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Long went with Zhou to meet her parents in [[Guiyang]], after which, her mother told her to cut off contact with him. On 8 January 2009, Long says she attempted to end the relationship with Zhou while at their hotel. She says Zhou became angry and proceeded to rape her. Zhou denies the allegations of rape, insisting that their sexual relations were consensual.&lt;ref name="Epoch"&gt;Matthew Robertson and Ariel Tian, [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/daughter-of-chinese-vice-mayor-seeks-justice-for-alleged-rape-287173.html Daughter of Chinese Vice Mayor Seeks Justice for Alleged Rape], The Epoch Times, 2 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gong Jinxing and Wang Zhiqiu, [http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2011-07/20/nw.D110000renmrb_20110720_5-04.htm Whole Family of Stability Maintenance Deputy Mayor Petitioning is Not True (Seek Proof: Uncover the True Situation Behind the Hubbub)], People's Daily, 20 July&lt;/ref&gt;

At the center of Long's rape allegations is the Chinese concept of "[[guanxi]]," a complex term referring to relationships based on reciprocity. According to Long, Zhou wanted more guanxi in Guizhou and saw her as foothold to help him build his way up to get the needed relationships to open a mining operation there. When Long tried to break off the short relationship, she says he felt it was a violation of guanxi; because he had given her gifts and paid for their trip, he felt entitled to more efforts from her to help him make contacts. The rape, she says, was partially retaliatory in nature.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

==Appeals==
Long took her case to the police, and after being disappointed in the justice system, began appealing through official channels, eventually going to Beijing to try her luck with the central government. She was repeatedly detained and sent back to Guizhou, only to return again later.

'''Luis Felipe''' (born May 11, 1961), also known as "'''King Blood'''" is the [[Entrepreneur|founder]] of the [[New York City|New York]] chapter of the organized crime gang known as the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Almighty Latin Kings and Queens Nation]]. Born in [[Havana, Cuba]], Felipe was a Cuban who came to the [[United States]] in the 1980 [[Mariel boatlift|Mariel Boatlift]]. Six years later, in 1986, he founded the New York chapter of the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/the-side/richardson-report/federal-prison-reform-033109 Federal Prison Reform- Super Jail and Solitary Confinement Policy] Esquire, March 2nd 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he was convicted of ordering multiple murders from prison by writing to members of the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] on the outside. [[Judge John S. Martin Jr.]] sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] plus 45 years.

Additionally, the judge added some extraordinary conditions. Surprising even [[prosecutors]], Judge Martin said Felipe must serve the sentence in [[solitary confinement]]. He forbade him to write or be visited by anyone except his lawyer and close relatives, of whom Felipe has none. Finally, the judge said that he himself, rather than the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], would control the [[Legal case|case]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3D71631F935A15753C1A961958260 Testing the Limits of Punishment; Unusually Severe Life Sentence vs. Society's Need for Safety] NY Times, October 26, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maltese''' ({{lang-mt|Maltin}}, {{lang-it|Maltesi}}) are an [[ethnic group]] indigenous to [[Malta]], and identified with the [[Maltese language]]. Malta is an island in the middle of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Included within the ethnic group defined by the Maltese people are the ''Gozitans'' ({{lang-mt|Għawdxin}}) who inhabit Malta's sister island, [[Gozo]].

==History==
{{main|History of Malta|Immigration to Malta}}

The current Maltese people, characterised by the use of the [[Maltese language]] and by [[Roman Catholicism]], are the descendants&amp;nbsp;– through much mixing and hybridisation&amp;nbsp;– of colonists from Sicily and Calabria who repopulated the [[Maltese islands]] in the beginning of the second millennium after a two-century lapse of depopulation that followed the Arab [[Siege of Melite (870)|conquest]] by the [[Aghlabids]] in AD 870.&lt;ref name="gozo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islandofgozo.org/history.htm |publisher=IslandofGozo.org|title=Gozo|date=7 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822215525/http://www.islandofgozo.org/history.htm |archivedate = 22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| title=So who are the ‘real’ Maltese|quote=There’s a gap between 800 and 1200 where there is no record of civilisation. It doesn’t mean the place was completely uninhabited. There may have been a few people living here and there, but not much……..The Arab influence on the Maltese language is not a result of Arab rule in Malta, Prof. Felice said. The influence is probably indirect, since the Arabs raided the island and left no-one behind, except for a few people. There are no records of civilisation of any kind at the time. The kind of Arabic used in the Maltese language is most likely derived from the language spoken by those that repopulated the island from Sicily in the early second millennium; it is known as Siculo-Arab.  The Maltese are mostly descendants of these people.|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140914/local/So-who-are-the-real-Maltese-.535578}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A genetic study by Capelli et al. indicates that Malta was barely inhabited at the turn of the tenth century and was likely to have been repopulated by settlers from Sicily and Calabria who spoke [[Siculo-Arabic]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book| title=Genetic Origin of Contemporary Maltese People|quote=Repopulation is likely to have occurred by a clan or clans (possibly of Arab or Arab-like speaking people) from neighbouring Sicily and Calabria. Possibly, they could have mixed with minute numbers of residual inhabitants, with a constant input of immigrants from neighbouring countries and later, even from afar. There seems to be little input from North Africa.|url= http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20070805/opinion/genetic-origin-of-contemporary-maltese.9032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Previous inhabitants of the islands&amp;nbsp;– Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines&amp;nbsp;– did not leave many traces, as most nameplaces were lost and replaced. 
The [[Normans]] conquered the island in 1091 and completely re-Christianised them by 1249.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The origin of the Maltese surnames|quote=Ibn Khaldun puts the expulsion of Islam from the Maltese Islands to the year 1249. It is not clear what actually happened then, except that the Maltese language, derived from Arabic, certainly survived. Either the number of Christians was far larger than Giliberto had indicated, and they themselves already spoke Maltese, or a large proportion of the Muslims themselves accepted baptism and stayed behind. Henri Bresc has written that there are indications of further Muslim political activity on Malta during the last Suabian years. Anyhow there is no doubt that by the beginning of Angevin times no professed Muslim Maltese remained either as free persons or even as serfs on the island.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This re-Christianisation created the conditions for the evolution of the [[Maltese language]] from the now extinct [[Siculo-Arabic]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|author1=Brincat, 2005|title= Maltese - an unusual formula |quote= Originally Maltese was an Arabic dialect but it was immediately exposed to Latinisation because the Normans conquered the islands in 1090, while Christianisation, which was complete by 1250, cut off the dialect from contact with Classical Arabic. Consequently Maltese developed on its own, slowly but steadily absorbing new words from Sicilian and Italian according to the needs of the developing community.|url=http://macmillandictionaries.com/MED-Magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences on the population after this have been fiercely debated among historians and geneticists. The origins question is complicated by numerous factors, including Malta's turbulent history of invasions and conquests, with long periods of depopulation followed by periods of immigration to Malta and intermarriage with the Maltese by foreigners from the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]], [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Southern European]] countries that ruled Malta. The many demographic influences on the island include:
* The exile to Malta of the entire male population of the town of [[Celano]] (Italy) in 1223
* The stationing of [[Swabia]]n and [[Sicily#people|Sicilian Italian]] [[garrison|troops]] on Malta in 1240
* The removal of all remaining [[Arabs]] from Malta in 1224&lt;ref name="time"&gt;Debattista, Martin; [http://www.aboutmalta.com/history/time-Line.htm Timeline of Malta History]; retrieved on [2008-05-14]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The arrival of several thousands [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]] (i.e. Catalans, Valencians, Majorcans and proper Aragonese, from current Spain) soldiers in 1283 to 1425.
* Further waves of European repopulation throughout the 13th century&lt;ref&gt;''Constantiae Imperatricis et Reginae Siciliae Diplomata: 1195-1198'', ed. T.K.Slzer (Vienna, 1983), 237-240.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The settlement in Malta of [[Nobility of Malta|noble families]] from Sicily (Italy) and the Crown of [[Aragon]] (now mostly part of Spain) between 1372 and 1450
* The arrival of several thousand [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] sailors, soldiers and slaves with the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]]
* The introduction of several thousand Sicilian laborers in 1551 and again in 1566
* The emigration of some 891 [[Italian people|Italian]] exiles to Malta during the [[Risorgimento]] in 1849
* The posting of some 22,000 [[British people|British]] servicemen in Malta from 1807 to 1979 (only a small number of whom remained in the islands),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/melitahistoricac/CC06.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:29:59 Joseph M.

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Malta}}
The culture of Malta is a reflection of various cultures that have come into contact with the [[Maltese Islands]] throughout the centuries, including neighbouring [[Mediterranean]] cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled [[Malta]] for long periods of time prior to its [[Independence Day (Malta)|independence]] in 1964.

The culture of modern Malta has been described as a "rich pattern of traditions, beliefs and practices," which is the result of "a long process of adaptation, assimilation and cross fertilization of beliefs and usages drawn from various conflicting sources."  It has been subjected to the same complex, historic processes that gave rise to the linguistic and ethnic admixture that defines who the people of Malta and Gozo are today.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cassar Pullicino, "Determining the Semitic Element in Maltese Folklore", in ''Studies in Maltese Folklore'', Malta University Press (1992), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
[[File:Il-Kantilena.png|thumb|right|''[[Il-Kantilena]]'' by [[Pietru Caxaro]], the oldest text in [[Maltese language]], 15th century]]
{{Main|Languages of Malta|Maltese language}}
Maltese people speak the [[Maltese language]], a unique hybrid vernacular basically [[Semitic language|Semitic]] but with an imposing Romance (Italian) superstratum, and written in the [[Latin alphabet]] in its standard form. The language is descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]], an extinct [[Arabic dialects|dialect of Arabic]] that was spoken in [[Sicily]] by indigenous people who were at that time divided in religion into continuing Greek-rite Christians and Muslims whose recent ancestors were Sicilian converts from Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm |title=MED Magazine |date=9 May 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=12 January 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509033627/http://www.macmillandictionary.com/MED-magazine/February2005/27-LI-Maltese.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of Malta's history, the language has adopted massive amounts of vocabulary from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], to a much lesser degree, borrowings from English (anglicisms being more common in colloquial Maltese than in the literary language), and a few dozen French loanwords. A large number of superficially Arabic words and idioms are actually loan translations (calques) from Sicilian and Italian which would make little or no sense to speakers of other Arabic-derived languages.

Maltese became an official language of Malta in 1934, replacing Italian and joining English. There are an estimated 371,900 speakers in Malta of the language, with statistics citing that 100% of the people are able to speak Maltese, 88% English, 66% Italian and 17% French, showing a greater degree of linguistic capabilities than most other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Europeans and their Languages|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact [[multilingualism]] is a common phenomenon in Malta, with English, Maltese and on occasion Italian, used in everyday life. Whilst Maltese is the [[national language]], it has been suggested that with the ascendancy of English a [[language shift]] may begin;&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, "Malta: Country Profile", ''Euromosaic Study'' (September 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/euromosaic/mal_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919160121/http://www.ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/euromosaic/mal_en.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-19 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; though a survey dating to 2005 suggested that the percentage speaking Maltese as their mother tongue within Malta remained at 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf|format=PDF|title=EUROPEANS AND LANGUAGES|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=12 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128095746/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_237.en.pdf|archivedate=28 January 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Malta}}
The Constitution of Malta provides for [[freedom of religion]] but establishes [[Roman Catholicism]] as the [[state religion]]. The original Maltese population were Christians of the Byzantine (Greek) rite, like the older Christian communities of Sicily. Consequently the most ancient layer of liturgical vocabulary in Maltese consists of Greek and Arabic words (the latter used in worship by the Arabic-speaking Sicilians of Byzantine rite during the Muslim occupation). The Roman rite (with Latin as the liturgical language) was imposed throughout the islands in the early fourteenth century, though the Greek Catholic church was re-established after 1530 by the [[Knights of Saint John]] for their Rhodian and other Greek followers.

Malta is described in the [[Book of Acts]] ({{Bibleref|Acts|27:39-42}} and {{Bibleref|Acts|28:1-11}}) as the place where [[Paul the Apostle]] was shipwrecked on his way to Rome, awaiting trial. [[Freedom House]] and the ''[[World Factbook]]'' report that 98% of the Maltese are Catholic (mostly Roman-rite, with a Byzantine-rite minority), making the nation one of the most Catholic countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/country/MT.htm |title=Catholic Church in Malta |publisher=GCatholic.org |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emigration ==
{{main|Emigration from Malta}}
[[File:Malta - Floriana - Valletta Waterfront - Laguna Marina - Child Migrants' Memorial 03 ies.jpg|thumb|Child Migrants' Memorial at the [[Valletta Waterfront]], commemorating the 310 Maltese child migrants who travelled to Australia between 1950 and 1965.]]

Malta has long been a country of emigration, with big Maltese communities in English-speaking countries abroad as well as in France.
Mass emigration picked up in the 19th century, reaching its peak in the decades after World War II. Migration was initially to north African countries (particularly [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]]); later Maltese migrants headed towards the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is little trace left of the Franco-Maltese communities in north Africa, most of them having been displaced, after the rise of independence movements, to places like France (especially [[Marseille]] and the Riviera), the United Kingdom or Australia. The Franco-Maltese are culturally distinct from the Maltese from Malta, in that the former have remained attached to the use of the Italian language (often, but not always, alongside Maltese) as well as speaking French. Although migration has ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance there are still important Maltese communities in [[Maltese Australian|Australia]], Canada, the [[Maltese American|United States]] and the [[Maltese in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. 
Since Malta joined the EU in 2004 [[expatriate]] communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in [[Maltese in Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]].

The '''National Museum of Women in the Arts''' (NMWA), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is "the only major [[museum]] in the world solely dedicated" to celebrating women's achievements in the visual, performing, and literary arts.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/about|title=About|publisher= National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and [[Wilhelmina Holladay]]. Since opening its doors in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/about/our-history|title=Our History - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Frida Kahlo]], and [[Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun]]. The museum occupies the old [[Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)|Masonic Temple]], a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art.  It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art.  The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions.  Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by [[Clara Peeters]] that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist.  They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.

The National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection.  After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition American Women Artists, 1830–1930.  To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] to write ''Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra'' inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert.  In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people.

===Building===
{{Main|Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)}}
In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark {{convert|78810|sqft}} former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works.  After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility {{convert|84110|sqft}}.

===Wilhelmina Cole Holladay===
{{main|Wilhelmina Cole Holladay}}
[[Wilhelmina Cole Holladay]] is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.

Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at [[Elmira College]] in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the [[University of Paris]].  She is listed in ''[[Who's Who of American Women]]'', ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'', ''[[Who's Who in the World]]'', and she holds many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from the United States and the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the [[National Arts Club]] in New York City.

===New York Avenue Sculpture Project===
{{see also|Les Trois Grâces|Nana on a Dolphin}}
By 2015, a selection of sculptures will be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museums efforts are in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on," due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.

[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]'s works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into "sculpture islands," as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director [[Susan Fisher Sterling]]. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt; The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 – March 9, 2014, was [[Chakaia Booker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/chakaia-booker-evocative-dynamic-works-in-the-new-york-avenue-sculpture-project/|date=March 7, 2012|title=Chakaia Booker: Evocative, Dynamic Works in the New York Avenue Sculpture Project|author=Orin Zahra|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others.&lt;ref name="Pressphalle"&gt;{{cite web | author=Michelle Cragle | year=2010 | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts Announces Sculpture Project | work=Press Center | publisher=Niki Charitable Art Foundation | url=http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306070929/http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | archivedate=2010-03-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
[[File:Young Girl with a Sheaf.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Claudel]], ''Young Girl with a Sheaf'', ca. 1890]]

The collection currently contains more than 4,500 works in a variety of styles and media, spanning from the 16th century to present day. Among the earliest works is [[Lavinia Fontana]]’s Portrait of a Noblewoman, ca. 1580. There are also a number of special collections, including 18th century botanical prints, works by British and Irish women silversmiths from the 17th–19th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/collection/|title=Collection Highlights - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 1,000 unique and limited edition artists’ books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/library/artistbook.asp|title=Library &amp; Archives - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 1,000 artists are represented, including [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Rosa Bonheur]], [[Chakaia Booker]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Lola Alvarez Bravo]], [[Rosalba Carriera]], [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Camille Claudel]], [[Louisa Courtauld]], [[Petah Coyne]], [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]], [[Elaine de Kooning]], [[Lesley Dill]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sonia Gechtoff]], [[Marguerite Gérard]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Justine Kurland]], [[Bettye Lane]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Hung Liu]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Maria Martinez]], [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Gabriele Münter]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Sarah Miriam Peale]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Jaune Quick-to-See Smith]], [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Elisabetta Sirani]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Lilly Martin Spencer]], [[Alma Thomas]], [[Suzanne Valadon]], and [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]].

== Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center ==
The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/learn/library-archives|title=Library &amp; Archives - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.

Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work.

In spring 2007, the LRC launched "[[Clara database|Clara: Database of Women Artists]]," a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.

==Exhibitions==
Beginning in 1987 with ''American Women Artists, 1830–1930'', NMWA has presented more than 200 exhibitions. A selection of the most prominent exhibitions includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nmwa.org/exhibition/|title=Exhibitions - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition History (1987–2013)|url=http://www.nmwa.org/sites/default/files/shared/nmwa_exhibition_history_2013_2.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1961">'''Nihon Ishi Gakkai''' ({{lang|ja|日本医史学会}}), Japanese Society for the History of Medicine, JSHM) is a juridical corporation (''shadan hōjin'') established in 1892 by the physician [[Fujikawa Yū]] and several colleagues in order to promote the study, research and communication of the [[History of Medicine|history of  medicine]] and allied sciences in all of its aspects. The secretariat of the society is housed in the Departement of Medical History, [[Juntendo University]] ([[Tokyo]]).

The Japanese Society for the History of Medicine publishes the ''Nihon Ishigaku Zasshi – Journal of the Japanese Society for the History of Medicine''.&lt;ref&gt;Until 1941 ''Chūgai Iji Shimpō'' ( {{lang|ja|中外医事新報}})&lt;/ref&gt; It offers two scientific awards, the ''Fujikawa-Yū-Award''&lt;ref&gt;Fujikawa Yū (1865-1940), one of the leading pioneers of medical history in Japan and co-founder of the JSMH&lt;/ref&gt; (the former Scientific Promotion Award)  and the ''Yakazu-Award''.&lt;ref&gt;Established by the physician [[Yakazu Dōmei]] (2905-2002) who played a leading role in the revival of traditional Japanese medicine (TJM).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">The biological activity of a '''pesticide''', be it chemical or biological in nature, is determined by its [[active ingredient]] (AI - also called the ''active substance''). [[Pesticide]] products very rarely consist of pure technical material. The AI is usually formulated with other materials and this is the product as sold, but it may be further diluted in use. Formulations improves the properties of a chemical for handling, storage, application and may substantially influence effectiveness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, DA (1998) ''Chemistry and technology of agricultural formulations''. Kluwer Academic, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Formulation terminology follows a 2-letter convention: (''e.g.'' GR: granules) listed by [[CropLife International]] (formerly GIFAP then GCPF) in the ''Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types'' (Monograph 2); see: [http://www.croplife.org/view_document.aspx?docId=1281  download page] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}. Some manufacturers do not follow these industry standards, which can cause confusion for users.

==Water-miscible formulations==
[[File:Pesticide formulations.jpg|thumb|400px]]

By far the most frequently used products are formulations for mixing with water then applying as sprays.
Water miscible, older formulations include:
* EC	Emulsifiable concentrate
* WP	[[Wettable powder]]
* SL	Soluble (liquid) concentrate
* SP	Soluble powder

Newer, non-powdery formulations with reduced or no use of hazardous solvents and improved stability include:
* SC	Suspension concentrate
* CS	Capsule suspensions
* WG	Water dispersible granules

{{clear}}

==Other formulations==
Other common formulations include granules (GR) and dusts (DP), although for improved safety the latter have been replaced by microgranules (MG ''e.g''. for [[rice]] farmers in [[Japan]]).  Specialist formulations are available for [[ultra-low volume]] spraying, fogging, fumigation, ''etc''. Very occasionally, some pesticides (''e.g''. malathion) may be sold as technical material (TC - which is mostly AI, but also contains small quantities of, usually non-active, by-products of the manufacturing process).

A particularly efficient form of pesticide dose transfer is [[seed treatment]] and specific formulations have been developed for this purpose.  A number of pesticide [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] formulations are available for [[rodent]] pest control, ''etc''.

In reality many formulation codes are used: AB, AE, AL, AP, BB, BR, CB, CF, CG, CL, CP, CS, DC, DL, DP, DS, DT, EC, ED, EG, EO, ES, EW, FD, FG, FK, FP, FR, FS, FT, FU, FW, GA, GB, GE, GF, GG, GL, GP, GR, GS, GW, HN, KK, KL, KN, KP, LA, LS, LV, MC, ME, MG, MV, OD, OF, OL, OP, PA, PB, PC, PO, PR, PS, RB, SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, SG, SL, SO, SP, SS, ST, SU, TB, TC, TK, TP, UL, VP, WG, WP, WS, WT, XX, ZC, ZE and ZW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dropdata.org/IPARC_guide/Formulation_codes.pdf Formulation Codes] from dropdata.org, run by iparc.org.uk, The International Pesticide Application Research Consortium (IPARC), Department of Biology, Imperial College, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, [[prostitution]] in [[Albania]] was virtually unknown. The migration from rural areas to the cities, and economic problems that followed the collapse caused some women to turn to prostitution.&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Work in Albania – an Overview|url=http://swannet.org/node/1041|website=SWAN|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en|date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Street prostitution]] occurs near the centre of the capital, [[Tirana]], mainly by [[Romani people|Roma]] men and women.&lt;ref name="swan" /&gt; Some students work as prostitutes from hotels or motels in Tirana and other big cities. [[Brothel]]s also found in the cities.&lt;ref name="swan" /&gt;

The [[NGO]] ''Aksion Plus'' works with sex workers for advocacy, education and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aksion Plus|url=http://swannet.org/en/members/aksion-plus|website=SWAN|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania outlaws prostitution and related activities:&lt;ref name="legislationline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal codes|url=http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/6355/file/Albania_CC_1995_am2015_en.pdf|website=Legislationline|accessdate=14 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Article 113 Prostitution - Criminalised both the buying and selling of sex
* Article 114 Exploitation of prostitution - "Encouragement, mediation, or receipt of compensation for exercising prostitution"
* Article 115 Use of premises for prostitution - "Managing, utilizing, financing, renting the premises for purposes of prostitution"

==Sex trafficking==
Albania is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Albanian women and children are subjected to sex trafficking within the country, especially during tourist season. Traffickers use false promises such as marriage or employment offers to force victims into sex trafficking. Traffickers increasingly use social media to recruit victims. Albanian victims are subjected to sex trafficking in countries across [[Europe]], particularly [[Kosovo]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Foreign from Eastern European countries, [[Philippines]], and [[Nigeria]] were subjected to sex trafficking in Albania. [[Middle East]]ern, [[Central Asia]]n, and African migrants transit Albania to reach [[Western Europe]] and are vulnerable to trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271130.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 110(a) and 128(b) of the criminal code prohibit sex and labour trafficking and prescribe penalties of eight to 15 years imprisonment. Twenty-one of suspects in 2016 were investigated for child trafficking and 48 for adult trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; 

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Albania as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

Sex workers report they are often abused, harassed and suffer extortion by the police.&lt;ref name="sierraloaded" /&gt;

In 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in [[Sierra Leone]] in what was called the "[[Province of Freedom]]". It intended to resettle some of the "Black Poor of London," mostly African Americans freed by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. About 290 free black men, 41 black women and 60 white prostitutes from [[London]] reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Leone Company|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/REsierra.htm|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|ten-year civil war]] in Sierra Leone, there has been an increase in [[child prostitution]], especially among children who are struggling to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/af/8402.htm |title=Sierra Leone|publisher=State.gov|date=2002-03-04|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has happened in spite of the fact that child prostitution is illegal in the country.&lt;ref name="Trafficking in Persons Report"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trafficking in Persons Report|work=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|date= |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/123365.pdf |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Sierra Leone}}
Sierra Leone is a source and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Victims originate largely from rural provinces and are recruited to urban and mining centers for exploitation in sex trafficking. At times, sex trafficking occurs on beaches and in nightclubs. Trafficking victims are also exploited in fishing and agriculture and subjected to sex trafficking through customary practices, such as forced marriages. Traffickers typically operate individually, convincing parents to hand over their children and promising to provide an education or better life but instead exploiting the children in trafficking. Sierra Leonean girls are increasingly exploited in [[Guinea]]. Traffickers have exploited boys and girls from Sierra Leone to reportedly work as “cultural dancers”—and possibly also for sexual exploitation—in The [[Gambia]]. Sierra Leonean adults voluntarily migrate to other [[West Africa]]n countries, including [[Mauritania]] and Guinea, as well as to the Middle East and Europe, where some are subjected to [[forced prostitution]]. As in previous years, Sierra Leonean women are subjected to trafficking in [[Kuwait]] and [[Lebanon]]. Children from neighboring West African countries have been exploited in prostitution in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Leone 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271275.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 anti-trafficking law criminalizes all forms of human trafficking and prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 50 million leones ($6,710) for sex trafficking. In addition, two other laws prescribe penalties for sex trafficking offenses that differ from the anti-trafficking law. The Child Rights Act imposes a penalty for the prostitution of a child by a third party of 30 million leones ($4,030) and/or two years imprisonment, which is neither sufficiently stringent nor commensurate with penalties for rape. The Sexual Offences Act criminalizes forced prostitution and child prostitution with penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Sierra Leone as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sierra Leone 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282742.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3745">The '''RTÉ Board''' is an eight-member body which makes policy and guiding corporate direction for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], Ireland's state public broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/about/authority.html About RTÉ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422215548/http://www.rte.ie/about/authority.html |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Board, then known as the '''RTÉ Authority''', was established as the '''Radio Éireann Authority''' under the [[Broadcasting Authority Act 1960]]. The Authority is actually the legal entity known as ''Radio Telefís Éireann'' and the body which has legal responsibility to run the services authorised under the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960-2002. However, in reality actual management of the services is delegated to the [[Director-General of RTÉ|Director-General]] and the staff of the Authority who together comprise RTÉ. The Authority met monthly and acted as RTÉ's [[board of directors]], making general policy and overseeing the operations of RTÉ on a [[non-executive director|non-executive]] basis.

The RTÉ Authority was appointed by the [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]].  The [[RTÉ Executive]] reported to the Authority via the Director-General.

Under the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]], the RTÉ Authority lost the "Authority" moniker and is simply referred to as the Board, and loses its self-regulatory function to the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]. The Board consists of 12 members - six nominated by the Minister, four nominated by the Minister on the advice of the [[Houses of the Oireachtas]] [[Joint Committee]] with responsibility for broadcasting, one [[worker director]] and the Director-General. [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2008/2908/b29b08s.pdf]

A new Authority, the final authority, was appointed on 24 February 2009 on a six-month interim basis, until the 2008 Bill was enacted.[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0224/rteauthority.html]. The new Board of RTÉ and the four nominees of the [[Joint Committee]] with responsibility for broadcasting for the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]] members will be appointed in early 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/mediazone/pressreleases/title-1387-en.html&lt;/ref&gt; by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The [[RTÉ Executive]] would now report to the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Major+changes+heralded+in+broadcasting+as+new+laws+enacted.htm |title=Major changes heralded in broadcasting as new laws enacted |publisher=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources |date=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720074418/http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press%2BReleases/Major%2Bchanges%2Bheralded%2Bin%2Bbroadcasting%2Bas%2Bnew%2Blaws%2Benacted.htm |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQfnyu6JGs4

In an interview, she said that she argues in the book (among other things) that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/the-fight-for-a-fair-and-free-internet/253027/ |title=The Fight for a Fair and Free Internet |first=Rebecca J. |last=Rosen |date=February 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:We cannot assume that the Internet will evolve automatically in a direction that is going to be compatible with democracy. It depends on ''how'' the technology is structured, governed, and used. Governments and corporations are working actively to shape the Internet to fit their own needs. The most insidious situations arise when both government and corporations combine their efforts to exercise power over the same people at the same time, in largely unconstrained and unaccountable ways. This is why I argue that if we the people do not wake up and fight for the protection of our own rights and interests on the Internet, we should not be surprised to wake up one day to find that they have been programmed, legislated, and sold away.

'''Seal hunting''', or '''sealing''', is the personal or commercial hunting of [[Pinniped|seals]]. Seal hunting is currently practiced in nine countries and one region of Denmark: United States (above the Arctic Circle in Alaska), Canada, Namibia, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Finland, Sweden, and Greenland. Most of the world's seal hunting takes place in Canada and Greenland. 

[[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] (DFO) regulates the seal hunt in Canada. It sets quotas (total allowable catch – TAC), monitors the hunt, studies the seal population, works with the Canadian Sealers' Association to train sealers on new regulations, and promotes sealing through its website and spokespeople. The DFO set harvest quotas of over 90,000 seals in 2007; 275,000 in 2008; 280,000 in 2009; and 330,000 in 2010.&lt;ref name=faq-canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Canada's Seal Harvest |publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181704/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm|archivedate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual kills in recent years have been less than the quotas: 82,800 in 2007; 217,800 in 2008; 72,400 in 2009; and 67,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/seal_harp_%202009-eng.pdf|title=Current Status of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals, ''Pagophilus groenlandicus''|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=March 2010|author=Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat|journal=Science Advisory Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Norway claimed that 29,000 harp seals were killed, Russia claimed that 5,479 seals were killed, and Greenland claimed that 90,000 seals were killed in their respective seal hunts.

[[Harp seal]] populations in the northwest Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s as a result of Canada's annual kill rates, which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/2009%20seal%20sealing.pdf|title=Canada's Commercial Sea Slaughter 2009|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare|last=Fink|first=Sheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal. In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year's quota had been reached. Because it was thought that the competitive element might cause sealers to cut corners, new regulations were introduced that limited the catch to 400 seals per day, and 2000 per boat total. A 2007 population survey conducted by the DFO estimated the population at 5.5 million. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

It is illegal in Canada to hunt newborn harp seals ([[whitecoats]]) and young [[hooded seal]]s (bluebacks). When the seal pups begin to molt their downy white fur at the age of 12–14 days, they are called "[[ragged-jacket]]" and can be commercially hunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/world/canada/work/protect_seals/research/seal_myths_and_facts.html|title=Myths and Facts: The Truth about Canada's Commercial Seal Hunt |publisher=Human Society International: Canada|date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After molting, the seals are called "beaters", named for the way they beat the water with their flippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A20625-2004Apr17?language=printer |title=Activists Decry Growth Of Canadian Seal Hunt |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2004-04-18 |accessdate=2009-05-26|first=DeNeen L.|last= Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hunt remains highly controversial, attracting significant media coverage and protests each year.&lt;ref name=EBindustry&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=harp seal (mammal): The sealing industry|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255712/harp-seal/274188/The-sealing-industry|first=Serge|last=Lariviere}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images from past hunts have become iconic symbols for [[Conservationism|conservation]], [[animal welfare]], and [[animal rights]] advocates. In 2009, Russia banned the hunting of harp seals less than one year old.

==History==
The term seal is used to refer to a diverse group of animals.  In science, they are grouped together in the [[Pinnipeds]], which also includes the [[walrus]], not popularly thought of as a seal, and not considered here.  The two main families of seals are the [[Otariidae]] (the eared seals; includes [[sea lion]]s, and [[fur seal]]s), and [[Phocidae]] (the earless seals); animals in the family Phocidae are sometimes referred to as hair seals, and are much more adept in the water than the eared seals, though they have a more difficult time getting around on land. The fur seal yields a valuable fur; the hair seal has no fur, but oil can be obtained from its fat and leather from its hide.&lt;ref name=ea /&gt;
Seals have been used for their pelts, their flesh, and their fat, which was often used as [[oil lamp|lamp fuel]], [[lubricant]]s, [[cooking oil]], a constituent of soap, the liquid base for [[red ochre]] paint, and for processing materials such as leather and [[jute]].

===Traditional seal hunting===
[[File:Eskimo Seal Hunting.jpg|thumb|[[Inuit]] seal hunting]]
Archeological evidence indicates the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations]] People in Canada have been hunting seals for at least 4,000 years. Traditionally, when an [[Inuit]] boy killed his first seal or [[caribou]], a feast was held. The [[Seal meat|meat]] was an important source of fat, protein, vitamin A, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and iron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=17514649 |title=Nutritional composition of blubber and meat of hooded seal and harp seal|last=Brunborg |first=Linn Anne|last2=Julshamn |first2=Kare|last3= Nortvedt|first3= Ragnar|last4=Frøyland|first4= Livar |journal=Food Chemistry|pages=524–531|volume=96|year=2006|accessdate=2011-03-03|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pelts were prized for their warmth. The Inuit diet is rich in fish, whale, and seal.

There were approximately 150,000 circumpolar Inuit in 2005 in Greenland, Alaska, Russia, and Canada.&lt;ref name=Ejesiak /&gt; According to Kirt Ejesiak, former secretary and chief of staff to then-Premier of Nunavut, Paul Okalik and the first Inuk from Nunavut to attend Harvard, for the c. 46,000 Canadian Inuit, the seal was not "just a source of cash through fur sales, but the keystone of their culture. Although Inuit harvest and hunt many species that inhabit the desert tundra and ice platforms, the seal is their mainstay. The Inuktitut vocabulary designates specific objects made from seal bone, sinew, fat and fur used as tools, games, thread, cords, fuel, clothing, boats, and tents. There are also words referring to seasons, topography, place names, legends, and kinship relationships based on the seal. One region of Canada's north is inhabited by the [[Netsilik Inuit|''Netsilingmiut'']], or "people of the seal."&lt;ref name=Ejesiak&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/05/08/animal_rights_vs_inuit_rights/ |title=Animal rights vs. Inuit rights |first=Kirt |last=Ejesiak |date=8 May 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010 |publisher=Boston Globe |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104032832/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/05/08/animal_rights_vs_inuit_rights/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WenzelControversy" /&gt; The title of Ejesiak's article acknowledged the pivotal 1991 publication entitled ''Animal Rights, Human Rights'' by George Wenzel, a McGill University geographer and anthropologist who worked more than two decades with the Clyde Inuit of Baffin Island. Wenzel's "scholarly examination" of "the impact of the animal rights movement upon the culture and economy of the Canadian Inuit" was among the first to reveal how animal rights groups, "well-meaning people in the dominant society through misunderstanding and ignorance can inflict destruction" on a vulnerable minority.&lt;ref name=AINA&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rick |last=Riewe|volume= 45|number=2|year=1992|title=Riview of Animal Rights, Human Rights: Ecology, Economy and Ideology in the Canadian Arctic by George Wenzel|format=

Inuit seal hunting accounts for the majority of the seal hunt, but just three percent of the hunt in southern Canada; it is excluded from the [[European Commission]]'s call in 2006 for a ban on the import, export and sale of all harp and hooded seal products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/Environ/060906222345.cyu8d8wj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416235153/http://www.eubusiness.com/Environ/060906222345.cyu8d8wj|archivedate=2008-04-16 |title=Euro MPs call for ban on seal products|publisher= EUbusiness|date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ringed seal]]s were once the main staple for food, and have been used for clothing, boots, fuel for lamps, as delicacy, containers, [[igloo]] windows, and in harnesses for [[huskies]]. Though no longer used to this extent, ringed seals are still an important food and clothing source for the people of [[Nunavut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Vlessides|chapter=Marine Mammals|postscript=|title=Nunavut Handbook}} cited in {{cite web|url=http://inuitarteskimoart.com/artists/About-Seals.html |title=Eskimo Art, Inuit Art, Canadian Native Artwork, Canadian Aboriginal Artwork |publisher=ABoriginArt Inc |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''nayiq'' by the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik]] people, the ringed seal is also hunted and eaten in [[Alaska]].

Seals were also hunted in northwest Europe and the [[Baltic Sea]] more than 10,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Early modern era===
[[File:Reimerswaal ¿ Zeehondenjacht.jpg|thumb|Seal hunting in [[Verdronken Land van Reimerswaal|Reimerswaal]]]]

The first commercial hunting of seals by Europeans, is said to have occurred in 1515, when a cargo of fur seal skins from Uruguay was sent to Spain for sale in the markets of [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=tas-history /&gt;

====Newfoundland====
[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] were the first regions to experience large scale sealing. Migratory fishermen began the hunting from as early as the 1500s. Large-scale commercial seal hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to [[Dock (maritime)|shore installations]], known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of seal meat as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for commercial gain.&lt;ref name="Seal Fishery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/seal_hunt_history1.php|title=Sealing History|publisher=The Seal Fishery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 18th century English hunters began to range further afield - 1723 marked the first time that hunters armed with [[firearm]]s ventured forth in boats to increase their haul. This soon became a sophisticated commercial operation; the seals were transported back to England, where the seal's meat, fur and oil were sold separately. From 1749, the import of seal oil to England was being recorded annually, and was used as a lighting oil, for cooking, in the manufacture of [[soap]] and for the treating of [[leather]].&lt;ref name="Seal Fishery"/&gt;

====South Atlantic====
It was in the [[Atlantic Ocean#South Atlantic|South Seas]] that sealing became a major enterprise from the late 18th century. [[Samuel Enderby]], along with [[Alexander Champion (businessman)|Alexander Champion]] and [[John St Barbe]] organized the first commercial expedition to the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] in 1776, initially with the primary aim of [[whaling]], although sealing began to play a prominent part in the operation as well. More expeditions were sent in 1777 and 1778 before political and economic troubles hampered the trade for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (1978), p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 1788, the 270 ton ship ''Emilia'', owned by [[Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons]] and commanded by Captain James Shields, departed London. The ship went west around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]] to become the first ship of any nation to conduct operations in the [[Southern Ocean]]. ''Emilia'' returned to London on 12 March 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of [[Whale oil|sperm oil]].&lt;ref name=Quarterly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UINZAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Quarterly Review, Volume 63, London:John Murray, 1839, page 321].&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1784, the British had fifteen ships in the southern fishery, all from [[London]]. By 1790 this port alone had sixty vessels employed in the trade. Between 1793 and 1799 there was an average of sixty vessels in the trade. The average increased to seventy-two in the years between 1800 and 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Stackpole (1972), p.282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Commander Thomas Melvill to Chas. Enderby &amp; sons in London detailing this catch. [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]] Sydney.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cook-1777.PNG|thumb|left|[[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia island]] became a centre for the sealing industry from the late 18th century, shortly after it was mapped by Captain [[James Cook]] in 1777.]]
The sealing industry extended further south to the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia island]], first mapped by Captain [[James Cook]] in {{HMS|Resolution|Cook|6}} on 17 January 1775. During the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, South Georgia was inhabited by English and [[Yankee]] sealers, who used to live there for considerable periods of time and sometimes overwintered. In 1778, English sealers brought back from the Island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and the [[Magellan Strait]] area as many as 40,000 seal skins and 2,800&amp;nbsp;tons of [[elephant seal]] oil. More [[fur seals]] from the island were taken in 1786 by the English sealing vessel ''Lord Hawkesbury'', and by 1791, 102 vessels, manned by 3000 sealers, were hunting seals south of the equator. The first commercial visit to the South Sandwich Islands was made in 1816 by another English ship, the ''Ann''.

The sealers pursued their trade in a most unsustainable manner, promptly reducing the [[fur seal]] population to near extermination. As a result, sealing activities on South Georgia had three marked peaks in 1786–1802, 1814–23, and 1869–1913 respectively, decreasing in between and gradually shifting to [[elephant seal]]s taken for oil.

====Pacific====
Commercial sealing in [[Australasia]] appears to have started with the London-based Massachusetts-born [[Eber Bunker]], master of the ''[[William and Ann (1759)|William and Ann]]'', who announced his intention in November 1791 to visit and hunt in New Zealand's [[Dusky Sound]].&lt;ref name=entwisle&gt;{{cite book|last=Entwisle|first=Peter|title=Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770–1848|year=1998|publisher=Port Daniel Press|location=Dunedin, NZ|isbn=9780473055912|pages=10–11, 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10–11|date=December 2012}} Captain [[William Raven]] of the ''[[Britannia (1783 whaler)|Britannia]]'' stationed a party at Dusky from 1792 to 1793, but the discovery in 1798-1799 of [[Bass Strait]], between mainland Australia and Van Diemen's Land (later known as [[Tasmania]]) saw the sealers' focus shift there in 1798, when a gang including Daniel Cooper landed from the ''Nautilus'' on [[Cape Barren Island]].&lt;ref name=mcnab1907&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=McNab|title=Murihiku|location=Invercargill, NZ|year=1907|pages=70–71, 78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Bass Strait over-exploited by 1802, commercial attention returned to southern New Zealand waters, where [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] and [[Foveaux Strait]] were explored, exploited and charted from 1803 to 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Entwisle pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the sealing-industry focus shifted to the sub-Antarctic [[Antipodes Islands]], 1805–1807, the [[Auckland Islands]] from 1806, the southeast coast of New Zealand's [[South Island]], [[Otago Harbour]] and [[Solander Island]] by 1809, before focusing further to the south at the newly discovered [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] (discovered in January 1810) and [[Macquarie Island]] (discovered in July 1810) from 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Entwisle pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = Reed| isbn = 9780589009595| last = Kerr| first = Ian S.| title = Campbell Island: a history| year =  1976|location=Wellington, NZ}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher = Antarctic Division, Department of External Affairs| last = Cumpston| first = John Stanley| title = Macquarie Island| year = 1968|location= Canberra, Australia}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period sealers were active on the southern coast of mainland Australia, for example at [[Kangaroo Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cumpston|first=J.S.|title=Kangaroo Island, 1800–1836|year=1970|publisher=Roebuck Society|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; This whole development has been called{{by whom|date=September 2014}} the first sealing boom; it sparked the [[Sealers' War]] (1810-&amp;nbsp;) in southern New Zealand.

By about 1815 sealing in the Pacific had faded in importance. A brief revival occurred from 1823, but this proved very short-lived.&lt;ref name=mcnab1907 /&gt; Although highly profitable at times and affording New South Wales one of its earliest trade staples, sealing's unregulated character saw its self-destruction. Notable traders from Britain and based in Australia included [[Simeon Lord]], [[Henry Kable]], [[James Underwood (carpenter)|James Underwood]] and [[Robert Campbell (1769–1846)|Robert Campbell]]. Plummers of London and the Whitneys of New York also became involved.&lt;ref name=entwisle /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edmund|last= Fanning|title=Voyages Round the World|location= New York, |publisher=Collins and Hannay|year=1833|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PuUUAAAAMAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rJgvAAAAMAAJ|first=D.R. |last=Hainsworth|title= The Sydney Traders, Simeon Lord and his Contemporaries 1788–1821|location= Melbourne|publisher=Cassell Australia|year= 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last= Steven|title= Merchant Campbell 1769–1846 a Study in the Colonial Trade|location=Melbourne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1830 most Pacific seal stocks had been seriously depleted, and [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's Register of Shipping]] only showed one full-time sealing vessel on its books.&lt;ref name=tas-history&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/fahan_mi_shipwrecks/infohut/sealing.htm | title = History of World Fur Sealing | last=Roberts | first=Glynn |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the North Pacific, the later 1800s saw large harvests of fur seals. These harvests decreased along with fur-seal populations.

===Industrial era===
[[File:Sealhunt 550.jpg|thumb|Seal hunting in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the 1880s.]]

Growing from the international [[Grand Banks]] fishery, the Newfoundland hunt initially used small [[schooner]]s. Kill rates averaged 451,000 in the 1830s, and rose to 546,000 annually during the first half of the next decade, which led to a marked decline in the harp seal population that in turn adversely impacted profits in the sealing industry.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/sail_seal.html |title=The Sailing Seal Fishery: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland| first=J.K.|last= Hiller |year=2001|work= Society, Economy and Culture |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sealing reached its peak in [[Newfoundland]] in the 1860s, with the introduction of more powerful and reliable [[steamship]]s that were capable of much larger range and storing capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Chesley Sanger, "Sail versus Steam: Post 1863 Technological and Spatial Adaptation in the Newfoundland Seal Fishery," ''Newfoundland and Labrador Studies,'' Fall 2008, Vol. 23 Issue 2, pp 139–169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Ryan, ''The Ice Hunters: A History of Newfoundland Sealing to 1914'' (St. John's: Breakwater Books, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Annual catches exceeded the 400,000 mark from the 1870s and smaller sealers were steadily pushed out of the market.

The first modern sealing ship was the [[USS Bear (1874)|SS ''Bear'']], built in [[Dundee]], Scotland in 1874 as a steamer for [[seal hunt|sealing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Government Printing Office|last=United States.

At the time of her arrival in St. John's, there were 300 vessels outfitted each season to hunt seals, but most were small [[schooners]] or old sailing [[barque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Shannon, ''The Ice Hunters: A History of Newfoundland Sealing to 1914'' (1994) Breakwater Books Ltd. {{ISBN|1-55081-095-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new sealing ships represented by ''Bear'' radically transformed the Eastern North Atlantic seal fishery as they replaced the hundreds of smaller sealing vessels owned by merchants in [[outports]] around Newfoundland with large and expensive steamships owned by large British and Newfoundland companies based in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/sealing_disaster.html |title="1914 Sealing Disaster", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage'&amp;#39; |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owned at first by the Scottish firm W. Grieve and Sons, she was acquired in 1880 by R. Steele Junior.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyds Register'' 1875-1883&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous sealing ship of the era was the ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'', originally built in 1884 for the Dundee whaling and sealing fleet. She was ideally suited to the polar regions and worked for 10 years in the annual seal fishery in the [[Labrador Sea]]. Large and expensive ships required major capital investments from British and Newfoundland firms, and shifted the industry from merchants in small [[outports]] to companies based in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]]. By the late 19th century, the sealing industry in Newfoundland was second in importance only to [[cod fishing in Newfoundland|cod fishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/JF00/sealtimeline.asp |title=Atlantic Canada Seal Hunt – Sealing through the years|journal= Canadian Geographic Magazine |publisher=Canadian Geographic Enterprises|date=January–February 2000 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seal hunt provided critical winter wages for fishermen, but was dangerous work marked by sealing disasters that claimed hundreds of lives, such as the 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster involving the [[SS Southern Cross (1886)|SS ''Southern Cross'']], the [[SS Newfoundland|SS ''Newfoundland'']], and SS ''Stephano''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/sealing_disaster.html |title=1914 Sealing Disaster|work= Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage|first=Jenny|last= Higgins|publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland |year= 2007|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rugged hulls and experienced crews of Newfoundland sealing vessels often led sealers such as ''Bear'' and ''Terra Nova'' to be hired for arctic exploration and one sealer ''Algerine'' was hired to recover ''Titanic'' bodies in 1912. After [[World War II]], the Newfoundland hunt was dominated by large Norwegian sealing vessels until the late 20th century, when the much diminished hunt shifted to smaller motor fishing vessels, based from outports around Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, the commercial seal hunt dividend contributed about $6 million to the Newfoundland GDP, a fraction of the industry's former importance.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Environmental protection===
[[Image:Choris, Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|The Russian ''Rurik'', near [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island]] in the [[Bering sea]]. Sealing in the Bering sea led to a diplomatic dispute between the US and Britain in the 1880s, which brought about the first legislative attempts to limit the environmental damage done by the sealers. Drawing by [[Louis Choris]] in 1817.]]

The end of the 19th century was marked by the [[Bering Sea Controversy]] between the United States and Great Britain over the management of fur seal harvests.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt; In 1867 the United States government purchased from Russia all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands, including the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas. By [[Acts of Congress]], the killing of seals was strictly regulated on the Pribiloff islands and in "the waters adjacent thereto". Beginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain British and Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing).&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, the ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, the [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII "The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]]; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.

[[File:Hülgevaatlus, postipaat Helge.JPG|thumb|left|While people living in Estonian coastal areas used to hunt seals, this has changed a lot within the last half century. Within the last decade [[ecotourism]] has also emerged, and nowadays seal watching tours are being organized.]]
The issue was taken to arbitration, which concluded in favour of Britain on all points in 1893. Since the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited.

This marked the first attempt at establishing regulations on the sealing industry for environmental purposes.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; However, these regulations failed because the mother seals fed outside the protected area and remained vulnerable.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=Seals and Sealing|author=George Archibald Clark|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint commission of scientists from Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.  However further joint tribunals did not enact new legal restrictions, and then Japan also embarked upon pelagic sealing.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

Finally, the [[North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911|North Pacific Fur Seal Convention]] severely curtailed the sealing industry. Signed on July 7, 1911 by the United States, [[Great Britain]], Japan, and Russia, the treaty was designed to manage the commercial harvest of fur bearing mammals. It outlawed open-water seal hunting and acknowledged the United States' [[jurisdiction]] in managing the on-shore hunting of seals for commercial purposes.  It was the first international treaty to address wildlife preservation issues.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/events/fursealtreaty/welcome.html#treaty|title=North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty of 1911|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was dissolved with the onset of hostilities between the signatories in [[World War II]]. However, the treaty set precedent for future national and [[international laws]] and treaties, including the [[Fur Seal Act of 1966]] and the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;

Today, commercial sealing is conducted by only five nations: Canada, Greenland, Namibia, Norway, and Russia. The United States, which had been heavily involved in the sealing industry, now maintains a complete ban on the commercial hunting of marine mammals, with the exception of indigenous peoples who are allowed to hunt a small number of seals each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/editorials/editorial_031217_1.html |title=Joe, What You Say Just Ain't So |publisher=Sea Shepherd |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment and method==
[[File:Hakapik.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[hakapik]]'']]

In the Canadian commercial seal hunt, the majority of the hunters initiate the kill using a firearm. Ninety percent of sealers on the ice floes of the Front (east of Newfoundland), where the majority of non-native seal hunting occurs, use firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealsandsealing.net/welfare.php?page=3&amp;id=1 |publisher=Seals and Sealing Network|title= Animal Welfare in Canada |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older and more traditional method of killing seals is with a ''[[hakapik]]'': a heavy wooden club with a hammer head and metal hook on the end. The ''hakapik'' is used because of its efficiency; the animal can be killed quickly without damage to its pelt. The hammer head is used to crush the seals' thin skulls, while the hook is used to move the carcasses.
Canadian sealing regulations describe the dimensions of the clubs and the ''[[hakapik]]s'', and caliber of the rifles and minimum bullet velocity, that can be used. They state: "Every person who strikes a seal with a club or hakapik shall strike the seal on the forehead until its skull has been crushed," and that "No person shall commence to skin or bleed a seal until the seal is dead," which occurs when it "has a glassy-eyed, staring appearance and exhibits no blinking reflex when its eye is touched while it is in a relaxed condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/regu/sor93-56/ |title=Marine Mammal Regulations, SOR/93-56 |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160525/http://www.canlii.org/ca/regu/sor93-56/ |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reportedly, in one study, three out of eight times, the animal was not rendered either dead or unconscious by shooting, and the hunters would then kill the seal using a hakapik or other club of a type that is sanctioned by the governing authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/610|title=Animal Welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals – Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare |date=2007-12-19 |work= |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |journal=EFSA Journal |accessdate=2010-08-20 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2007.610 | }} [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.610 PDF file]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
In Canada, the season for the commercial hunt of [[harp seal]] is from November 15 to May 15.&lt;ref name="Canada0305"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/reports-rapports/mgtplan-plangest2003/mgtplan-plangest2003_e.htm|archivedate=2008-06-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620053344/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/reports-rapports/mgtplan-plangest2003/mgtplan-plangest2003_e.htm|title=Seals and Sealing in Canada|publisher=Fisheries and Aquaculture Management Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Inuit hunt seals commercially year-round, most sealing in southern Canada occurs in late March in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], and during the first or second week of April off Newfoundland, in an area known as the Front. This peak spring period is often mistakenly referred to as the "Canadian Seal Hunt", when in fact seal hunting also happens throughout the year all over the Canadian Arctic.&lt;ref name=faq-canada /&gt;

In 2003, the three-year harp seal quota granted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada was increased to a maximum of 975,000 animals per three years, with a maximum of 350,000 animals in any two consecutive years.&lt;ref name = "Canada0305" /&gt; In 2006, 325,000 harp seals, as well as 10,000 hooded seals and 10,400 [[grey seal]]s were killed. An additional 10,000 animals were allocated for hunting by aboriginal peoples. As of 2012, the population in Canada of the Northwest Atlantic harp seals is approximately 7.3 million animals, over three times what it was in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dfo-mpo.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/facts-faits/facts-faitsb-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Although around 70% of Canadian seals killed are taken on the Front,&lt;ref name = "faq-canada" /&gt; private monitors focus on the St. Lawrence hunt, because of its more convenient location.&lt;ref name="pmid12240525"/&gt; The 2006 St. Lawrence leg of the hunt was officially closed on Apr. 3, 2006; sealers had already exceeded the quota by 1,000 animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/03/seal-quota060403.html |title=Seal hunt haul 1,000 over quota|publisher= CBC News|date=2006-04-03 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2007, the Newfoundland and Labrador government launched a seal hunt website to counter "misinformation about the sealing industry that is [published] by international animal rights organizations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinews:Newfoundland government launches seal hunt website]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warm winters in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence have led to thinner and more unstable ice there. In 2007, Canada's [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|federal fisheries ministry]] reported that while the pups are born on the ice as usual, the ice floes have started to break up before the pups learn to swim, causing the pups to drown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17736236/ |title=Seal hunt might be on ice due to lack of it |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-27 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada reduced the 2007 quota by 20%, because overflights showed large numbers of seal pups were lost to thin and melting ice.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite news|title= Warming Thins Herd for Canada's Seal Hunt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/03/AR2007040301754.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2007-04-04

The 2010 hunt was cut short because demand for seal pelts was down. Only one local pelt buyer, NuTan Furs, offered to purchase pelts; and it committed to purchase less than 15,000 pelts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michel|last=Comte |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/canadas-seal-hunt-to-close-early-after-low-harvest-20100415-sh9q.html |title=Canada's seal hunt to close early after low harvest |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelt prices were about C$21/pelt in 2010, which is about twice the 2009 price and about 64% of the 2007 price. The reduced demand is attributable mainly to the 2009 ban on imports of seal products into the European Union.

The 2010 winter was unusually warm, with little ice forming in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in February and March, when harp seals give birth to their pups on ice floes. Around the Gulf, harp seals arrived in late winter to give birth on near-shore ice and even on beaches rather than on their usual whelping grounds: sturdy sea ice. Also, seal pups born elsewhere began floating to shore on small, shrinking pieces of ice. Many others stayed too far north, out of reach of all but the most determined hunters. Environment Canada, the weather forecasting agency, reported the ice was at the lowest level on record.&lt;ref name=Austen&gt;{{cite news|title=Despite Few Hunters, Seal Pups Face Threats|first=Ian |last=Austen|date=2010-04-01|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/world/americas/02seal.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the government of Greenland states that approximately 170,000 seals are killed in Greenland annually,&lt;ref name="nanook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources and Industry |publisher=Government of Greenland |url=http://uk.nanoq.gl/Emner/About/Resources_and_industry.aspx |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223085319/http://uk.nanoq.gl/Emner/About/Resources_and_industry.aspx |archivedate=2012-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Government of Canada estimates the kill to be 20,000 to 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/zone/underwater_sous-marin/hseal/seal-phoque_e.htm |title=The Harp Seal |publisher=Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207145022/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/zone/underwater_sous-marin/hseal/seal-phoque_e.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, the government of Greenland banned imports of Canadian seal skins, citing fears Canadian seals are brutally beaten to death. The boycott may be an effort to distance Greenland's own seal hunt from Canada's, and spare themselves negative press in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060109-100956-1841r|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516165809/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2006/01/09/greenland_bans_canadian_sealskins/1841/|archivedate=2008-05-16 |title=Greenland bans Canadian sealskins |publisher=United Press International |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was rescinded in May 2006, with the Greenland Home Rule Government noting the seal hunt in Canada has sensible regulations on hunting methods, drawn up in close cooperation with biologists, veterinarians, weapons experts and seal hunters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} It further noted seal-hunting in Canada is subject to strict and extensive control measures, to ensure the use of effective and humane killing methods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In Greenland, seal hunting is conducted with rifles – the seals are shot in the head from a small open boat while they sit on an ice floe. The boat rushes up to the seal and hooks the carcass out of the water (where it falls within a few seconds) before it sinks. The economy of certain rural Greenlandic villages, such as [[Aappilattoq, Kujalleq|Aappilattoq]], are highly dependent upon such seal hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Carroll|first=Etain|title=Greenland &amp; the Arctic|year=2005|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Victoria|isbn=9781740590952|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Namibia is the only country in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] culling seals. Although the protection and the sustainable use of natural resources is part of Namibia's constitution, it claims to conduct the second largest seal harvest in the world,&lt;ref name="nam2006"/&gt; mainly because of the huge amount of fish seals are estimated to consume. While a government-initiated study found seal colonies consume more fish than the entire fishing industry can catch,&lt;ref name="nam2007"/&gt; animal protection society Seal Alert South Africa estimated less than 0.3% losses to commercial fisheries.&lt;ref name="nam2010-2"/&gt;

Harvesting is done from July to November&lt;ref name="nam2010-2"/&gt; on two places, [[Cape Cross]] and [[Atlas Bay]], and in the past at [[Wolf Bay]].&lt;ref name="nam2007"/&gt; These two colonies together account for 75% of the [[brown fur seal|cape fur seal]] population of the country.&lt;ref name="nam2006"/&gt;

[[Cape Cross Seal Reserve|Cape Cross]] is a tourism resort and the largest cape fur colony in Namibia. The Department of Tourism has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Cape%20Cross%20National%20Park.pdf|title=Cape Cross National Park|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927064907/http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Cape%20Cross%20National%20Park.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Cape Cross Seal Reserve was established to protect the largest breeding colony of Cape fur seals in the world". In season, the resort is closed and sealed off during the culling in the early morning hours, journalists are not allowed to enter.&lt;ref name="nam2009"/&gt; Namibia’s [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|SPCA]] is allowed to observe the culling from 2010 onwards.&lt;ref name="nam2010"/&gt;

Namibia's Ministry of Fisheries announced a three-year rolling quota for the seal harvest, although different quotas per year are sometimes reported.&lt;ref name="nam2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nam2009"/&gt; The {{As of|2010|alt=latest}} quota announced was in 2009, valid until 2011.&lt;ref name="nam2010"/&gt; The quotas are usually not filled by the concession holders.&lt;ref name="nam2010-2"/&gt;

In 2009, an unusual bid to end seal culling in Namibia was attempted when Seal Alert tried to raise money to purchase the only buyer of Namibian seals, Australian-based Hatem Yavuz, [[lock, stock, and barrel]] for US$14.2 million.&lt;ref name="nam2009"/&gt; The project did not materialise. Also, the Government of Namibia offered the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) an opportunity to buy out the two sealers in Namibia to finally end the culling. The offer was rejected.&lt;ref name="nam2006"/&gt;

In 2011, South African activists launched a boycott of Namibian tourism and Namibian products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/thesealsofnam/get-involved/the-boycott|title=The Boycott|work=The Seals of Nam}}{{self-published inline|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the cull.

The Norwegian sealing season runs from January to September. The hunt involves "seal catching" by seagoing sealing boats on the Arctic [[ice shelf]], and "seal hunting" on the coast and islands of mainland Norway. The latter is carried out by small groups of licensed hunters shooting seals from land and using small boats to retrieve the catch.

In 2005, Norway allowed foreign nationals to take part in the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odin.dep.no/fkd/english/news/news/047041-990012/dok-bn.html |title=Fact sheet on Norwegian coastal seals |publisher=Fiskeri- og kystdepartementet|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, 17,037 seals (including 13,390 harp and 3,647 hooded seals) were harvested.&lt;ref name=stat /&gt; In 2007, the [[Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs]] stated up to 13.5 million [[Norwegian krone]] (about US$2.6 million) would be given in funding to vessels in the 2007 Norwegian seal hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/fkd/aktuelt/Nyheter/2007/Selfangsten-i-2007-.html?id=455371 |title=Selfangsten i 2007|publisher= [[Government of Norway]]|date=2007-02-27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Regulations=====
All Norwegian sealing vessels are required to carry a qualified veterinary inspector on board.&lt;ref name="norwegianembassy"&gt;{{cite web|author=the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |url=http://www.norway.org/policy/environment/sealing/sealing.htm |title=Norwegian Sealing |publisher=Norwegian Embassy in the United States|date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2009-05-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075512/http://www.norway.org/policy/environment/sealing/sealing.htm |archivedate =2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian sealers are required to pass a shooting test each year before the season starts, using the same weapon and ammunition as they would on the ice. Likewise, they have to pass a ''hakapik'' test.&lt;ref name="Selfangstsforskrift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/for/sf/fi/ti-20030211-0151-0.html#1 |title=Forskrift om utøvelse av selfangst i Vesterisen og Østisen |publisher=Lovdata|date=2003-02-11 |accessdate=2009-05-07|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult seals more than one year old must be shot in the head with expanding bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The ''hakapik'' shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the short end of the ''hakapik'', before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its [[sternum]]. The killing and bleeding must be done on the ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the ''hakapik'', but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.&lt;ref name="Selfangstsforskrift"/&gt;

Seals in the water and seals with young may not be killed, and the use of traps, artificial lighting, airplanes, or helicopters is forbidden.&lt;ref name="Selfangstsforskrift"/&gt;

The ''hakapik'' may only be used by certified seal-catchers (fangstmenn) operating in the [[pack ice]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and not by coastal seal hunters. All coastal seal hunters must be pre-approved by the [[Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries]] and have to pass a large game hunting test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/cgi-wift/ldles?doc=/sf/sf/sf-19960506-0414.html#10 |title=For 1996-05-06 nr 414: Forskrift om forvaltning av sel på norskekysten |publisher=Lovdata|accessdate=2009-05-07}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2007 in [[Arkhangelsk]], the Norwegian GC Rieber Skinn AS proposed a joint Russian–Norwegian seal hunting project. The campaign was carried out from one hunt boat supplied by GS Rieber Skinn AS in 2007, lasted two weeks, and brought in 40 000 [[roubles]] per Russian hunter. GS Rieber skinn AS declared a plan to order 20 boats and donate them to the [[Pomor]].&lt;ref name="Barents"&gt;{{cite web|last=Istomina |first=Ludmila |url=http://www.barents.no/rieber-skinn-as-has-proposed-to-the-pomors.538786-43497.html |title=Rieber Skinn AS has proposed to the Pomors |publisher=The Norwegian Barents Secretariat |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719232558/http://www.barents.no/rieber-skinn-as-has-proposed-to-the-pomors.538786-43497.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CG Rieber Skinn AS, in 2007, established a daughter company in Arkhangelsk, called GC Rieber Skinn Pomor'e Lic. (GC Rieber Skinn Pomorje).

The Norwegian company Polardrift AS, in 2007, had plans to establish a company in Russia, and operate under Russian flag, in close cooperation with GC Rieber Skinn Pomor'e.

Plans for the 2008 season included both helicopter-based hunts, mainly to take [[whitecoat]]s, and boat-based hunts, mainly targeting beaters.&lt;ref name="GofN"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/Upload/FKD/Vedlegg/Kvoteavtaler/2008/russland/vedlegg%208%20sel%20notxtsistev.pdf |title=Report of the Working Group on Seals |journal=The 36th Session of the Joint Norwegian – Russian Fisheries Commission, St Petersburg, Russia, 22–26 October 2007 |publisher=[[Government of Norway]] |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411094208/http://www.regjeringen.no/Upload/FKD/Vedlegg/Kvoteavtaler/2008/russland/vedlegg%208%20sel%20notxtsistev.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2009, Russia's Minister of Natural Resources and Ecology, [[Yuriy Trutnev]], announced a complete [[ban (law)|ban]] on the hunting of [[harp seal]]s younger than one year of age in the [[White Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sulzberger |first=A.

==Sealing debate==
Canada has become the center of the sealing debate because of the comparatively large size of its hunt.

===Cruelty to animals===
According to a 2002 peer-reviewed study done by five Canadian veterinarians and funded by the [[Canadian Veterinary Medical Association]] (CVMA),&lt;ref name=pmid12240525&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://canadianveterinarians.net/documents/animal-welfare-and-the-harp-seal-hunt-in-atlantic-canada|title=Animal welfare and the harp seal hunt in Atlantic Canada|first=Pierre-Yves|last=Daoust|first2=Alice|last2=Crook|first3=Trent K.|last3=Bollinger|first4=Keith G.|last4=Campbell|first5=James|last5=Wong|journal=Canadian Veterinary Journal|year=2002|volume=43|pages=687–694|publisher=Canadian Veterinary Medical Association|pmc=339547|pmid=12240525|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the large majority of seals taken during this hunt (at best, 98% in work reported here) are killed in an acceptably humane manner." These veterinarians found, "During the 2001 season in the Gulf, three (1.9%) of 158 seals brought on board of the sealing vessels and directly observed by Daoust had not been killed, and in one (0.86%) of 116 interactions between seals and sealers observed on videotapes by Daoust and Crook, the seal also did not appear to have been killed before being hooked and brought on board." They thus concluded, "This small proportion of animals that are not killed efficiently justifies continued attention to this industry's activities, preferably by members of the veterinary profession, who are best equipped to assess the humaneness of the killing methods."

In observing four videos taken during the 2001 seal hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the authors of this report state, "A large proportion (87%) of the sealers recorded on the four videotapes failed to palpate the skull or check the corneal reflex before proceeding to hook or bleed the seal or go to another seal."

The Royal Commission on Seals and the Sealing Industry in Canada, also known as the Malouf Commission, concluded in a 1986 report, "Judged by the criteria of rapidity of unconsciousness and particularly the absence of preslaughter stress, the clubbing of seal pups is, when properly performed, at least as humane as, and often more humane than, the killing methods used in commercial slaughterhouses, which are accepted by a majority of the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/200/301/pco-bcp/commissions-ef/malouf1986-ef/malouf1986-eng.htm|title=Royal Commission on Seals and the Sealing Industry in Canada|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the (DFO), "The Marine Mammal Regulations stipulate that seals must be harvested quickly using only high-powered rifles, shotguns firing slugs, clubs or hakapiks.&lt;ref name=faq-canada /&gt;

However, the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/2001_Veterinary%20Report%20Canadian%20Commercial%20seal%20hunt.pdf|title=Canadian Commercial Seal Hunt Prince Edward Island|date=March 2001|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfar|first=Rosemary L.|last=Burdon|first2=John|last2=Gripper|first3=J. Alan|last3=Longair|first4=Ian|last4= Robinson|first5=Debbie|last5=Ruehlmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a study that disputed these findings. This report concludes the Canadian commercial seal hunt results in considerable and unacceptable suffering.

The veterinarians examined 76 seal carcasses and found that in 17% of the cases, there were no detectable lesions of the skull, leading them to conclude the clubbing likely did not result in loss of consciousness. In 25% of the remaining cases, the carcasses had minimal to moderate skull fractures, indicative of a "decreased level of consciousness", but probably not unconsciousness. The remaining 58% of the carcasses examined showed extensive skull fractures.

This veterinary study included examination of video footage of 179 seals hunted in 1998, 1999, and 2000. In these videos, 96 seals were shot, 56 were shot and then clubbed or gaffed, 19 were clubbed or gaffed, and 8 were killed by unknown means. In 79% of these cases, sealers did not check the corneal reflex to ensure that the seals were dead prior to hooking or skinning them. In only 6% of these cases, seals were bled immediately, where struck. The average time from initial strike to bleeding was 66 seconds.

In 2005, IFAW published a comparison of the CVMA-funded study and its own study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/node/6351|title=Canada's Commercial Seal Hunt is Not "Acceptably Humane"|date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this critique, David M. Lavigne, Science Advisor to IFAW, writes, "The Burdon et al. evidence cited above addresses the question of whether seals were likely conscious or unconscious at the time they were skinned, using post-mortem examination of skulls. In marked contrast, the figure cited from Daoust et al.'s report represents the number of seals clubbed or shot that were brought on board sealing vessels while still conscious. That number ignores any and all animal suffering that occurs between the time animals are clubbed or shot until they eventually reach a sealing vessel, usually on the end of a hook or gaff." Another difference between these reports is "Daoust et al.'s direct observations were made under very different conditions than those provided by Burdon et al. Unlike Burdon et al.'s observations, they were made directly from sealing vessels so that the sealers were unavoidably aware that observers were present. As Daoust et al. (p 692) admit, the presence of an observer on a sealing vessel "may have incited sealers to hit the seals skulls more vigorously". Of course, the presence of an observer also has the potential to modify other sealing practices, including checking for a corneal reflex and bleeding animals immediately after clubbing."

In 2005, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) commissioned the Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report. With reference to video evidence, the report states: "Perception of the seal hunt seems to be based largely on emotion, and on visual images that are often difficult even for experienced observers to interpret with certainty. While a hakapik strike on the skull of a seal appears brutal, it is humane if it achieves rapid, irreversible loss of consciousness leading to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/files/IVWGReportAug2005.pdf |author=Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report |format=PDF |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-24|title=Improving Humane Practice in the Canadian Harp Seal Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological feasibility===
In 2013, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans conducted a population survey. The resulting estimate of the harp seal population was 7.3 million animals, over three times what it was in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="dfo-mpo.gc.ca"/&gt; In 2004, the population estimate was similar: 5.9 million (95% CI 4.6 million to 7.2 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas/Csas/status/2005/SAR-AS2005_037_E.pdf |title=Stock Assessment of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arrival of European settlers, a much larger population of harp seals migrated to the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador. Settlers began exploiting the population, with kills peaking in the middle of the 1800s. In the first half of the 1840s, 546,000 seals were killed annually. This led to a population decline that adversely affected the industry.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s an average of over 291,000 seal pups were killed each year. This led to a population decline to less than 2 million seals. Conservationists became alarmed and demanded controls on kill rates. Thus in 1971, Canada instituted a quota system. In the years from 1971 to 1982, an average of 165,627 seals were killed.

In 1983, the European Union banned the import of whitecoat harp seal pup pelts (pelts from pups less than about two weeks of age, when the pups molt). As a result, the market for pelts dropped. The kill rates thus declined in subsequent years to an average of about 52,000 seals from 1983 to 1995. During this time, the harp seal population increased.

After the European Union's ban on whitecoat pelt imports, the Canadian government and sealing industry developed markets for the pelts of beaters. In 1996, the kill rates again increased to over 200,000 each year, except in the year 2000. In 2002 and 2004 to 2006, over 300,000 seal pups were killed each year.

As a result of population concerns, Norway's seal hunt is now controlled by quotas based on recommendations from [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheries.no/marine_stocks/mammals/seals/Marine_stocks_mammals_seals.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930172813/http://www.fisheries.no/marine_stocks/mammals/seals/Marine_stocks_mammals_seals.htm |archivedate=2006-09-30 |title=Sealing in the southeast part of the Barents Sea and at Jan Mayen in the Greenland Sea |date=2009-06-24 |publisher=The Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sealing in Norway has declined in recent years, and the quotas have not been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/05/20/seal-hunt-may-be-dying-out/ |title=Seal hunt may be dying out|publisher=Views and News from Norway |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hunting pressures on the population of harp seals, as ice seals that are dependent on solid sea ice for whelping, the harp seal population is affected by global climate change. The lack of sea ice in recent years has resulted in the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of newborn harp seal pups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11489-lack-of-sea-ice-devastates-seal-populations.html |title=Lack of sea ice devastates seal populations |work=New Scientist |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2011-07-23|first=Debora|last=MacKenzie|publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections to fur===
{{Main|Fur farming|Fur clothing}}
Animal welfare advocates and organizations, such as [[PETA]], object to the use of real fur when many synthetic "faux fur" alternatives are available.

===Economic impact===
According to Canadian authorities, the value of the 2004 seal harvest was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]16.5 million, which significantly contributes to seal manufacturing companies, and for several thousand fishermen and [[First Nations]] peoples. For some sealers, they claim, proceeds from the hunt make up a third of their annual income. Critics, however, say this represents only a tiny fraction of the C$600-million Newfoundland fishing industry. Sealing opponents also say $16.5 million is insignificant, compared to the funding required to regulate and subsidize the hunt. For 1995 and 1996, there are confirmed reports Fisheries and Oceans Canada encouraged maximum utilization of harvested seals through a $0.20 per pound [[meat]] subsidy.&lt;ref name="Tobin1996"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417064011/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/newsrel/1995/hq-ac142_e.htm|archivedate=2008-04-17|date=1995-12-18|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/newsrel/1995/hq-ac142_e.htm|title= Tobin announces 1996 Atlantic Seal Management Plan|publisher=[[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of subsidy totaled $650,000 in 1997, $440,000 in 1998 and $250,000 in 1999. There were no meat subsidies in 2000.&lt;ref name="Canada0305" /&gt; Some critics, such as the McCartneys (see below), have suggested promoting that area as an [[ecotourism]] site would be far more lucrative than the annual harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4769628.stm|title=McCartney calls for seal cull ban | date=2006-03-03 | accessdate=2010-01-04 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a culling method===
In March 2005, Greenpeace asked the DFO to "dispel the myth that seals are hampering the recovery of cod stocks." In doing so, they implied the seal hunt is, at least in part, a [[cull]] designed to increase cod stocks. Cod fishing has traditionally been a key part of the Atlantic fishery, and an important part of the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador. Fisheries and Oceans Canada responded there is no connection between the annual seal harvest and the cod fishery, and that the seal hunt is "established on sound conservation principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/myth_e.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223222149/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/seal-phoque/myth_e.htm|archivedate=2009-02-23|title=Canadian Seal Hunt: Myths and Reality|publisher=Fisheries and Aquaculture Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===

Many animal protection groups encourage people to petition against the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Dauvergne]] and Kate J. Neville, "[http://www.ligi.ubc.ca/sites/liu/files/Publications/PeterDauvergne/Dauvergne_Neville_Mindbombs_EP_Mar_2011.pdf Mindbombs of Right and Wrong: Cycles of Contention in the Activist Campaign to Stop Canada's Seal Hunt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404023210/http://www.ligi.ubc.ca/sites/liu/files/Publications/PeterDauvergne/Dauvergne_Neville_Mindbombs_EP_Mar_2011.pdf |date=April 4, 2015 }}," ''Environmental Politics'' 20 (2) (2011): 192-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Respect for Animals and [[Humane Society International]] believe the hunt will be ended only by the financial pressure of a boycott of Canadian seafood.

Protesters frequently use images of whitecoats, despite Canada's ban on the commercial hunting of suckling pups. The HSUS explains this by saying images of the legally hunted ragged jackets are nearly indistinguishable from those of whitecoats. Also, they state, according to official DFO kill reports, 97% percent of the estimated million harp seals killed in the last four years have been under three months old, and the majority of these are less than one month old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/protect_seals/the_truth.html |title=The Truth about the Canadian Seal Hunt: A Response to the Canadian Department of Fisheries |publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=2009-05-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419074846/http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/protect_seals/the_truth.html|archivedate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2009/03/canada_should_end_seal_slaughter_031909.html|title=Canada Should Follow Russia's Lead; Ban Commercial Seal Slaughter |publisher=Humane Society International |date=2009-03-19 |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2006, seven antisealing activists were arrested in the Gulf of St. Lawrence for violating the terms of their observer permits.

====Inuit impact====
An important distinction between the southern Canadian seal hunt and the [[Inuit]] Canadian hunt is that Canadian Inuit typically hunt [[ringed seal]]s, while the southern Canadian hunt targets the pelt of the [[harp seal]]. Greenlandic Inuit hunt and eat both ringed and harp seals. Unfortunately, protests surrounding the southern seal hunt in Canada have historically damaged the financial well-being of both Canadian and Greenlandic Inuit more than it has the hunting of harp seals.&lt;ref name="WenzelControversy"&gt;Wenzel, George. The Harp-seal Controversy and the Inuit Economy. Spring 1978, http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic31-1-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the strongly emotional nature of the protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of ringed seal fall with any ban on any type of seal product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, the year of the first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which threatened the survival of Inuit in many areas.&lt;ref name="WenzelControversy" /&gt; Several protests in other years have resulted in similar decreases in price.&lt;ref name="WenzelControversy" /&gt;

====Celebrity involvement====
[[File:Jacques-Yves Cousteau.jpg|thumb|upright|Marine ecologist [[Jacques Cousteau]] criticized the seal hunt protest as emotional.]]

Numerous celebrities have opposed the commercial seal hunt. [[Rex Murphy]] has reported celebrities have aided antihunt activists since the mid-20th century; [[Yvette Mimieux]] and [[Loretta Swit]] were recruited to attract the attention of international gossip magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Murphy| first=Rex| author-link=Rex Murphy| title=A winning streak for international ignorance| newspaper=National Post| date=2010-08-21| url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/08/21/rex-murphy-a-winning-streak-for-international-ignorance/| accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities who have aligned themselves against the hunt include [[Richard Dean Anderson]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Juliette Binoche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Independent Online |url=http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=31&amp;art_id=qw1143581761520B253 |title=IOL: Anderson adds her voice to chorus of protests|accessdate=2009-05-07|archivedate=2007-10-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031004855/http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=31&amp;art_id=qw1143581761520B253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Paul McCartney]], [[Heather Mills]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Morrissey]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Robert Kennedy, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=3822bca5-58ba-45f6-91f6-d77fe99291c0 |title=McCartneys won't be charged |newspaper=National Post |date=2006-03-04 |accessdate=2009-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324202025/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=3822bca5-58ba-45f6-91f6-d77fe99291c0 |archivedate=2007-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutger Hauer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-wire.com/news/0313060001.html |title=Sea Shepherd and Seal Defenders Take to the Streets |publisher=World-Wire |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.]], [[Farley Mowat]], [[Linda Blair]], the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=2008-04-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416231231/http://harpseals.org/hunt/press/index.html|url=http://www.harpseals.org/hunt/press/index.html|title= Press Releases &amp; Media Attention about the Canadian Harp seal kill-|work=Seal Hunt in the Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jackie Evancho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackieevancho.com/content/mission-humane|title=Jackie Evancho, Ambassador for Animals|date=2014-10-02|accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Brigitte Bardot traveled to Ottawa to protest the hunt, though the prime minister turned down her request for a meeting. During the same month, Paul and Heather Mills McCartney toured the Gulf of Saint Lawrence's sealing grounds, and spoke out against the seal hunt, including as guests on [[Larry King Live]], where the two debated with [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]], the [[Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador]].

In 1978, marine ecologist [[Jacques Cousteau]] criticized the seal hunt protest: "The harp seal question is entirely emotional. We have to be logical. We have to aim our activity first to the endangered species. Those who are moved by the plight of the harp seal could also be moved by the plight of the pig – the way they are slaughtered is horrible."&lt;ref name="WenzelAnimalRights"&gt;{{Cite book| title= Animal Rights, Human Rights: Ecology, Economy, and Ideology in the Canadian Arctic| last= Wenzel| first= George W.| page= 47| publisher= University of Toronto Press| year= 1991| isbn= 9780802068903| url= https://books.google.com/?id=g1l6pF0teV0C&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy''' ({{lang-pl|Związek Bojowników o Wolność i Demokrację}}, '''ZBoWiD''') was an official [[Poland|Polish]] state-controlled veterans association in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Initially headed by [[Franciszek Jóźwiak]], it was formed on September 2, 1949 out of 11 pre-existing veterans associations. In its early period, and especially during the [[Stalinism|stalinist]] years, the organization was formed mostly of former veterans of the Soviet-sponsored [[Polish People's Army]], communist partisans and former [[concentration camp]] inmates. However, with the advent of a partial political thaw in the 1960s it also started accepting the veterans of other Polish formations that had fought in [[World War II]].

Directly subordinate to [[Polish United Workers' Party|the party]], the society held an important place within the Polish governmental structure: it was the only authority certifying veterans' and combatants' rights and privileges in Poland. In 1970 the ZBoWiD had roughly 330,000 members, in 1986 almost 800,000. Among its leaders were [[Mieczysław Moczar]] and [[Włodzimierz Sokorski]].

In April 1990, ZBoWiD was reformed into the ''[[Związek Kombatantów RP i Byłych Więźniów Politycznych]]'' (''Society of Veterans of the Republic of Poland and Former Political Prisoners'') for members of all Polish military formations including partisan, self-defence units, and the [[Polish Underground State]].

'''The Commonwealth Club''', is a private [[gentlemen's club]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]], [[United States|USA]]. Its present clubhouse was completed in 1891. The defining structure of the [[Commonwealth Club Historic District]], it is located at 401 West Franklin Street. The Commonwealth Club is considered to be one of the finest pieces of architecture in Richmond and was a physical symbol of Richmond's [[New South]] movement.

==Architecture==
After an unsuccessful attempt to acquire plans from local firms, the Board of the Commonwealth Club looked outside of Richmond to develop a style that reflected the momentum of a more national architectural movement. The site proposed for the building, formerly the Palmer House, was located high above the street level. While the board desired a style broadly fashionable, they also desired the building to reflect Richmond as a southern city. The New York City based firm of [[Carrère and Hastings]] was chosen from a group of four firms.

The Commonwealth Club is a unique structure among Richmond buildings. Characterized by its deep red brick, brownstone trim and terra cotta cartouches, the building is a combination of [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial revival]] and [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] styles. The Colonial revival tradition is reflected to promote a heritage for the future and the Richardsonian style reflected the ability of Richmonders to afford an architectural style fashionable on a national level. It is classified by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources as [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]].&lt;ref&gt;DHR Id#: 127-0373-0002&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Three Whales Corruption Scandal''' is a major corruption scandal in [[Russia]] involving several furniture companies and federal [[Politics of Russia|government bodies]] which has unfolded since 2000.

==2000 smuggling investigation ==

Three Whales (Tri kita) is a Moscow furniture shopping complex owned by Sergei Zuev. On August 13, 2000, [[State Customs Committee of Russia|Russian Customs]] inspectors suspended it and seized a furniture consignment supplied by the companies Bastion and Liga Mars, as they allegedly had smuggled 400 tons of furniture into Russia, while Zuev had not paid $5&amp;nbsp;million of Customs duty by falsifying the price and weight of imported goods. On October 20, 2000, Captain Pavel Zaitsev filed a criminal case against Liga Mars initiated on September 7 by the [[Moscow Oblast]] Directorate of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name="kommersant1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=704751 |title=Ъ-Газета – Кит и меч |publisher=Kommersant.ru |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=анпхя пегмхй |url=http://www.newizv.ru/news/2006-07-18/50286/ |title=Мю "Рпеу Йхрюу".

The [[State Customs Committee of Russia|Customs]] inspectors revealed that the Three Whales shop was controlled by Yevgeny Zaostrovtsev, a former chief of now FSB Director [[Nikolai Patrushev]] and the father of [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] General [[Yury Zaostrovtsev]] which at that time was the Head of the Economic Security Department and a Deputy Director of FSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/krono.exe?4954 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160618/http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/krono.exe?4954 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;{{cite web|author=Иван Сас |url=http://www.ng.ru/politics/2006-06-15/1_trikita.html |title=Новые аресты по делу о контрабанде мебели в ТЦ 'Три кита' и 'Гранд' |publisher=Ng.ru |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutor General's Office reaction==

In November 2000, the [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor General]]'s Office under [[Vladimir Ustinov]] halted the investigation and confiscated files related to the case. In December 2000 it charged Captain Pavel Zaitsev with abuse of office and claimed that he allegedly had conducted 12 searches without a prosecutor sanction and had illegally detained two suspects. On September 5, 2002, the [[Moscow City Court]] found Zaitsev not guilty on the charges.

On May 7, 2001, First Deputy Prosecutor General [[Yury Biryukov]] citing lack of evidence signed a directive stopping the smuggling investigation.&lt;ref name="rferl2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/45n/n45n-s00.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 2001 the Prosecutor General's Office also accused Chief of the Customs Investigation Directorate [[Marat Fayzulin]] and Chief of the Customs Inspection Alexander Volkov with abuse of office and extortion of money from Sergei Zuev and an associate of him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kommersant.ru/index-news.html?ext=news&amp;id=27438&amp;id_themes=11&amp;page=1 ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on June 4, 2003 a Moscow court acquitted them.&lt;ref name="kommersant1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/09/33cc2719-2ad5-4a45-a326-72828b9baf64.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043850/http://rfe.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/09/33cc2719-2ad5-4a45-a326-72828b9baf64.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Фото: Василия Шапошникова |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=387025 |title=Ъ-Газета – Таможня устояла на "Трех китах" |publisher=Kommersant.ru |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/russia/2003/06/04/gtk/ |title=Б Пняяхх: Ясд Нопюбдюк Янрпсдмхйнб Црй, Опнундхбьху Он Декс "Рпеу Йхрнб" |publisher=Lenta.ru |date=March 21, 2002 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2001, at a press conference the State Customs Committee claimed that it had discovered a smuggling network allegedly organized by Sergei Zuev. Customs officially charged him with custom duty evasion.&lt;ref name="kommersant1"/&gt;

This situation as a whole was widely considered as an episode of the struggle between [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s "Family" represented by the State Customs Committee chairman [[Mikhail Vanin]], a close ally of [[Alexander Voloshin]] and [[Roman Abramovich]], and security services personnel group, known as ''[[silovik]]i''. Vanin has apparently lost the battle, as he left his position in March 2004 during the government reshuffle initiated by [[Vladimir Putin]], when the Customs Committee was included into the [[Economy Ministry of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=527&amp;id=673129 |title=Customs Policy – Kommersant Moscow |publisher=Kommersant.com |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206203927/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=527&amp;id=673129 |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sptimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=18047 |title=The St. Petersburg Times &amp;#124; The leading English-language newspaper in St. Petersburg – New Siloviki Customs |publisher=Sptimes.ru |date=June 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary commission==

Two deputies of the [[State Duma]] and members of the State Duma Security Committee, [[Yury Shchekochikhin]], a journalist, and [[Alexander Gurov (politician)|Alexander Gurov]], Lieutenant General of Interior Affairs, launched a parliamentary inquiry into the case, approved by the State Duma on March 13, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duma.gov.ru/search/kmpage/80200016/arc3/post/1.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polit.ru/news/2002/02/14/569468.html |title=ПОЛИТ.РУ: Глава думского комитета по безопасности предлагает передать Совету безопасности контроль над всей правоохранительной системой |publisher=Polit.ru |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Сергей Петров |url=http://www.ng.ru/regions/2002-03-15/4_absurdity.html |title=Таможня должна заняться прокуратурой! |publisher=Ng.ru |date=March 15, 2002 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/Anons/arc_2002/0320/1.shtm |title=Три кита на одного Зайцева |publisher=Rg.ru |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duma.gov.ru/search/kmpage/80200016/arc3/news/42.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosecutor General's Office rejected all the accusations of corruption, claiming that the investigation was closed for legitimate reasons. In April 2002 Shchekochikhin, Gurov, and [[Nikolay Kovalyov (politician)|Nikolay Kovalyov]], another State Duma deputy and a former FSB head, asked Vladimir Putin to intervene. At last, the inquiry forced Prosecutor General's Office to resume investigation of the smuggling. A prosecutor from [[Leningrad Oblast]], [[Vladimir Loskutov]], was chosen by President [[Vladimir Putin]] personally to lead the investigation of this affair.&lt;ref name="kommersant1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl2006"/&gt;

Earlier that year on February 18, 2002, in [[Novaya Gazeta]] Shchekochikhin published a detailed article on the smuggling affair and corrupting officials in the Interior Ministry and the Prosecutor-General's Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2002.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2002/12n/n12n-s07.shtml |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215000130/http://2002.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2002/12n/n12n-s07.shtml |archivedate=December 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040720185300/http://www.duma.gov.ru/csecure/arc3/public/48.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this he received a death threat&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/reports/rpw/2003/07/28-160703.asp |title=Russia Report: July 16, 2003 |publisher=Rferl.org |date=July 16, 2003 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/6089.htm |title=JRL #6089 – Foreign Languages, Homeless Kids, Nuclear Materials, Novaya Gazeta, Khakamada, TV6, Felgenhauer, Yanov, Anthem, Potanin, Economic Stats, Afghanistan, Iran, Legal Reform, ORT Review |publisher=Cdi.org |accessdate=October 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193719/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/6089.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=25&amp;issue_id=2201&amp;article_id=19181 |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017111332/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=25&amp;issue_id=2201&amp;article_id=19181 |archivedate=October 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2003, in that newspaper he published another article where he accused Prosecutor's General Office and Biryukov personally in corruption:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2003.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2003/39n/n39n-s00.shtml |accessdate=February 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202004652/http://2003.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2003/39n/n39n-s00.shtml |archivedate=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible victims==

Mr. Vorobiov, Head of Central Operative Customs, who initiated criminal case 27400-22/2000 after finding out about the fictitious Liga Mars company, was assaulted in February 2002.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;

A logistic manager for the stores Grand and Three Whales, Mr. Polyakov, was attacked two weeks later.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;

One day later, an investigator for the [[Federal Customs Service of Russia|Russian Customs Committee]] captain Yuhimenko who followed a lead received a head trauma.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;  On the same day the car of Moscow region's [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Interior Ministry]] investigator Ms. Nenahova was bombed.  Ms. Nenahova worked on the case 12707 against Liga Mars employees.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;  Investigator Pavel Zaitsev and his family received numerous threats throughout the year.&lt;ref name="backs"/&gt;

On May 27, 2003, [[Mikhail Pereverzev]], the president of the Furniture Importers Association and a key witness in the affair, was shot dead in a hospital.&lt;ref name="pereverzev"&gt;[http://www.vremya.ru/2003/96/4/71669.html Кровь на гарнитуре], Valery Chalikov, Victor Paukov, Yekaterina Sashenko, [[Vremya Novostey]], May 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2003, [[Yury Shchekochikhin]] died a few days after he had been hospitalized, according to the Russian officials, from a suddenly developed [[allergy]] of unknown origin, but his relatives were denied an official medical report about the cause of his illness, and were forbidden to take specimens of his tissues to conduct an independent medical investigation.

==2006 arrests and government bodies reshuffle==

The dismissal of [[Alexander Zherikhov]], head of the Federal Custom Service, as well as some other FSB, [[MVD|Interior Ministry]] and Prosecutor General's Office officials in May 2006 is linked by many to  the Three Whales scandal.&lt;ref name="kommersant1"/&gt; On June 2, 2006 [[Prosecutor General of Russia]] [[Vladimir Ustinov]], who had been in the office since 1999, resigned and became [[Justice Minister of Russia]] later that month. A major corruption scandal has unfolded unexpectedly and almost out of public sight. On June 14 Prosecutor General's Office under acting Prosecutor General [[Yury Chaika]] reported that it had reopened the furniture contraband investigation going back to 2000 and arrested [[Sergey Zuev (businessman)|Sergey Zuev]], owner of the Three Whales and Grand furniture retail centers, [[Andrey Latushkin]], Director General of the parent company Alliance-96, [[Andrey Saenko]] and two smugglers, [[Pavel Podsotsky]] and his wife [[Irina Podsotskaya]], Moscow representatives of a [[Latvia]]n firm, were arrested for smuggling and custom duty evasion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kommersant2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/k-vlast/get_page.asp?page_id=20062426-6.HTM{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2006/06/15/kontrabanda-mebelj.html |title=Юпеярнбюмш Онднгпебюелше Б Йнмрпюаюмде Леаекх Дкъ Рж "Цпюмд" Х "Рпх Йхрю" – Бкюдхлхп Тедняемйн – "Йпхлхмюкэмюъ Леаекэ" – Пняяхияйюъ Цюгерю – Б Япедс Ясд, Он Ундюрюиярбс Цемопнйспюрспш, Бшдюк Яюмйжхч Мю Юпеяр Оърепшу Онднгпебюелшу Б Йнмрпюаюмде Леаекх Дкъ Рнпцнбшу Жемрпнб "Цпюмд" Х "Рпх Йхрю".

On June 15, in Shanghai, President [[Vladimir Putin]] told journalists that he had asked Vladimir Loskutov, a prosecutor from [[Leningrad Oblast]] and a former classmate of his, to take on the case, as the President couldn't trust the Moscow offices of law-enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="rferl2006"/&gt;

'''Turks in Russia''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Rusya Türkleri}}}}) are [[Turkish people]] who live in [[Russia]]. The community is largely made up of [[Meskhetian Turks]] and expatriates from [[Turkey]] as well as children of mixed ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Ottoman migration===

The [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union]] in 1926 recorded 8,570 [[Ottoman Turks]] living in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Ottoman Turks are no longer listed separately in the census, as it is presumed that those who were living in Russia in the 1920s have subsequently either been assimilated into Russian society or have left the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Akiner|1983|loc=381}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the Soviet Union was preparing to launch a pressure campaign against Turkey. Vyacheslav Molotov, who was at the time the Minister of Foreign Affairs, made a request of the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow that Turkey surrender three Anatolian provinces (Kars, Ardahan and Artvin).&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus, war against Turkey seemed possible, and Joseph Stalin wanted to commit a genocide to the strategic Turkish population situated in Meskheti, near the Turkish-Georgian border, since during the Russo-Turkish Wars the Turks of the region had been loyal to the Ottoman Empire and were therefore likely to be hostile to Soviet intentions.&lt;sup&gt;[11][12]&lt;/sup&gt; In 1944, the Meskhetian Turks were forcefully deported from Meskheti, Georgia and accused of smuggling, banditry and espionage in collaboration with their kin across the Turkish border.&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;

Soviet authorities issued an official ruling that 17,000 Meskhetian Turks, virtually the entire Turkish population in the Ferghana Valley, be transported to Russia. Another 70,000 Meskhetian Turks from other parts of Uzbekistan soon followed the first wave of migrants and settled mainly in Azerbaijan and Russia.

In the late 1970s, the [[Stavropol]] and [[Krasnodar]] authorities visited various regions of [[Uzbekistan]] to invite and recruit Meskhetian Turks to work in agriculture enterprises in southern [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=168"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[Moscow]] issued a proposal inviting more [[Meskhetian Turks]] to move to villages in southern Russia that had been abandoned by ethnic [[Russians]] who were moving to the cities. However, the [[Meskhetian Turks]] response was that they would only leave Uzbekistan if the move were to be to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goltz|2009|loc=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1989, ethnic [[Uzbeks]] began a series of actions against the Turks; they became the victims of riots in the [[Ferghana valley]] which led to over a hundred deaths. Within days, Decision 503 was announced "inviting" the Turks to occupy the empty farms in southern Russia that they had resisted moving to for years and around 17,000 Meskhetian Turks were evacuated to Russia.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=167"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goltz 2009 loc=125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Goltz|2009|loc=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meskhetian Turks maintain that Moscow had planned the Uzbek riots.&lt;ref name="Goltz 2009 loc=125" /&gt; By the early 1990s, the 70,000 Meskhetian Turks who were still resident in Uzbekistan left for [[Azerbaijan]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] due to fears of continued violence.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=167" /&gt;

===Mainland Turkish migration===

During the 2000s, Russia witnessed increasing numbers of immigrants from [[Turkey]]; the number of Turkish labour migrants grew, on average, by 30–50% per annum.&lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryazantsev|2009|loc=159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, over 130,000 Turkish citizens were working in Russia; most Turkish immigrants are those who married Russians in Turkey and then came to reside in the homeland of their spouse. &lt;ref name="Ryazantsev 2009 loc=159"/&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{see also|Demographics of Russia|Russian Census (2002)}}
According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian Census]], 105,058 people declared themselves as "Turks" and 4,825 stated that they were "Meskhetian Turks"; hence, the census showed that there was a total of 109,883 Turks living in the country.&lt;ref name=2010Census/&gt;

==Discrimination==
Meskhetian Turks in Russia, especially those in [[Krasnodar]], have faced hostility from the local population. The [[Meskhetian Turks]] of Krasnodar have suffered significant human rights violations, including the deprivation of their citizenship. They have been deprived of civil, political and social rights and are prohibited from owning property and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barton|Heffernan|Armstrong|2002|loc=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, many are now leaving the [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar region]] for the [[United States]] as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coşkun|2009|loc=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Ukrainian immigration to Portugal ==
Ukrainians began arriving in Portugal in the late 1990s, and there was a tremendous growth in the early years of the twenty-first century. In the initial phase, between 1999 and 2002, immigration was processed either in an organized manner, based on intermediaries, or through international networks of illegal recruitment of workers, disguised as travel agencies. The earliest immigrants entered the country with [[Visa policy of the Schengen Area|Schengen visas]], valid throughout the [[Schengen Area]], and remained undocumented until they were granted permanent permits.&lt;ref name="ACIDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="less immigrants-DN"&gt;{{cite web|first=Céu|last=Neves|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=2646454|title=Portugal tem menos imigrantes|trans-title=Portugal has fewer immigrants|language=pt|publisher=Diário de Notícias|date=4 July 2012|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017124521/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=2646454|archivedate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secomunidades.pt/vistos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=153&amp;Itemid=97&amp;lang=en|title=Schengen Area And Types of Schengen Visas|publisher=DGACCP|date=2010|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004, following the decline in investment in major public works, the economic recession and improved mechanisms for controlling illegal immigration, many Ukrainians have left the country.&lt;ref name="ACIDI"/&gt;

Since 2009, the decline in the number of immigrants has steepened as a consequence of the economic crisis that has been occurring from 2008 on, and also due to the acquisition of Portuguese nationality by many Ukrainian citizens.&lt;ref name="ACIDI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="less immigrants-DN"/&gt;

Initially, the intention of many Ukrainian immigrants was to remain in Portugal for short periods, and many of them left the country. However, many others ended up opting for a longer stay. Among these, many decided to settle permanently in Portugal, joining or forming their families in the country and seeking recognition of their academic and professional qualifications, aiming access to more skilled and better paid jobs.&lt;ref name="ACIDI"/&gt;

== Ukrainians in Portugal today ==
Although the initial migration flow was motivated by job search and was predominantly masculine, the female component in the Ukrainian community in Portugal has increased substantially during the following years, particularly for reasons related to family reunification. According to Census 2011, women represented 49.2% of the Ukrainian population resident in Portugal, while in 2001 they were only 18.6%.

The Ukrainian population in Portugal is relatively young compared to the native Portuguese population. The average age of Ukrainians residing in Portugal is 34, lower than that of native Portuguese, which is 42.1 years.

The educational levels of individuals of working age (15–64 years) are higher than those of Portuguese nationals. According to Census 2011, 23.3% of Ukrainians in Portugal had completed college education, and only 9.7% had an academic qualification lower than the 9th grade. These values contrast with the education levels of the native Portuguese population, which were 16.6% and 40.6%, respectively.

Also, according to the 2011 Census, 71.1% of the Ukrainian population was economically active and 59.2% were employed, while 47% of the Portuguese nationals were economically active and only 41% had jobs.

Most Ukrainians in Portugal work in low-skill and low wages jobs, particularly on cleaning services, construction, manufacturing industries, transport services, hotels and restaurants. However, according to a recent survey, it was found that some Ukrainian workers have achieved jobs that are more compatible with their academic and professional qualifications.&lt;ref name="ACIDI"/&gt;

In 1975, he received his Ph.D. in criminal justice from University at Albany, SUNY.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
==Career==
Wilbanks taught at Florida International University from 1973 to 1999, and has written over 20 books and 70 journal articles.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=ttu/&gt; In 2001, he returned to Belton to build the Belton High School Athletic Wall of Honor, which honors 72 of the school's athletes and five of its championship teams.&lt;ref name=tdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ttu&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.depts.ttu.edu/english/general_info/awards_financial_aid/undergrad_scholarships_and_awards/tech_comm_awards/wilbanks_scholarship.php |title=William Wilbanks Technical Communication Scholarship |website=Department of English |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Tech University]]'s Department of English awards the William Wilbanks Technical Communication Scholarship to some of its undergraduates who are [[technical communication]] majors, and who have GPAs of 3.0 or higher.&lt;ref name=ttu/&gt;
==Media appearances==
From 1981 to 1997, Wilbanks appeared on television over 30 times as a criminology expert.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; These appearances included four on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' and two on [[CBS]]' ''[[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.shsu.edu/~pin_www/T@S/2001/Wilbanks.html |title=Presentation To Feature Stories About Police Women Killed in Duty |website=SHSU News |publisher=[[Sam Houston State University]] |publication-date=25 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on multiple televised debates in which he argued that [[Prentice Rasheed]], a shopkeeper in Dade County, Florida, should be indicted for setting a booby trap that killed a suspected burglar. Despite this, Rasheed was not indicted by the grand jury.&lt;ref name=sentinel/&gt; After the jury made this decision, Wilbanks said, "People are thinking, if the police don't do the job, then I can do whatever I want. That's bad news. I don't think any of us wants to live in a booby-trapped society. A trap can't discriminate between a burglar, a fireman, a policeman or the Amway lady."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-14/news/mn-29468_1_booby-trap/3 |title=Booby Trap Debate: Protecting Property--What Price? |last=Bearak |first=Barry |website=Los Angeles Times |page=3 |publication-date=14 November 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience''' is a [[history museum]] of the culture, art and history of [[Asian Pacific American]]s located in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Seattle Chinatown-International District|Chinatown-International District]], founded in 1967. It is a [[Smithsonian Institution]] affiliate, and the only pan-Asian Pacific American community-based museum in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625060409/http://affiliations.si.edu/AffilDirectory.Asp?MenuID=11 Smithsonian Affiliates list], Smithsonian Affiliations. Accessed 2015-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Lan | last1=Cao | first2=Himilee | last2=Novas | title=Everything You Need to Know About Asian American History | location=New York | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1996 | page=xvii | isbn=978-0-452-27315-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 it was recognized as one of two dozen [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|affiliated areas]] of the U.S. [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref name=Broom /&gt;

==Collections==
The Wing Luke Museum's collections have over 18,000 items, including artifacts, photographs, documents, books, and [[Oral history|oral histories]].&lt;ref name="research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/research |title=Research &gt; Wing Luke Museum |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the museum's collections are viewable through its online database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Wing Luke Museum Governor Gary Locke Library and Community Heritage Center |publisher= Wing Luke Museum |url= http://db.wingluke.org/ |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an oral history lab inside the museum for staff and public use.&lt;ref name="oralhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/oral-history-program-1 |title=Oral History Program &gt; Wing Luke Museum |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The Wing houses temporary and permanent exhibitions related to [[Asian American]] history, art, and cultures.&lt;ref name="wlabout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/about |title=About Us &gt; Wing Luke Museum |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum represents over 26 ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="seattlefoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/WingLukeAsianMuseum.aspx |title=Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience |publisher=Seattle Foundation |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum uses a community-based exhibition model to create exhibits. As part of the community-based process, the museum conducts outreach into communities to find individuals and organizations to partner with. The museum then forms a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) to determine the exhibit's direction. Staff at the museum conduct research, gather materials, and records relevant oral histories under the guidance of the CAC. The CAC also determines the exhibit's overall design and content. This process can take 12 to 18 months.&lt;ref name="process"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/exhibit-process |title=Exhibit Process &gt; Wing Luke Museum  |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/community-advisory-committees |title=Community Advisory Committees &gt; Wing Luke Museum |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Wing Luke Museum received the Institute for Museum and Library Services National Award for Museum Service for its exhibit process.&lt;ref name="process" /&gt; Award-winning exhibits by the museum include Do You Know Bruce?, a 2014 exhibit on [[Bruce Lee]]. The Association of King County Historical Organizations awarded Do You Know Bruce? the 2015 Exhibit Award.&lt;ref name="seattlefoundation" /&gt;

==History==
The museum is named for Seattle City Council member [[Wing Luke]], the first Asian American elected to public office in the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;David Takami, [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=2047 Luke, Wing (1925-1965)], HistoryLink.org Essay 2047, January 25, 1999. Accessed 2015-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke suggested the need for a museum in the Chinatown-International District in the early 1960s to preserve the history of the rapidly changing neighborhood. After Luke died in a small plane crash in 1965, friends and supporters donated money to start the museum he envisioned.  The Wing Luke Memorial Museum, as it was first named, opened in 1967 in a small storefront on 8th Avenue.

Initially the museum focused on Asian [[folk art]], but soon expanded its programming to reflect the diversity of the local community. The museum exhibited work emerging local artists, and by the 1980s pan-Asian exhibits made by community volunteers became central to the museum.

In 1987 the Wing Luke Museum moved to a larger home on 7th Avenue and updated its name to Wing Luke Asian Museum.  It achieved national recognition in the 1990s under the direction of local journalist [[Ron Chew]], a pioneer of the community based model of exhibit development that placed personal experiences at the center of exhibit narratives.  Today the museum continues to present exhibits and programs that promote social justice, multicultural understanding and tolerance.

In 2008 the museum moved to a larger building at 719 South King Street, in the renovated 1910 [[East Kong Yick Building]]. The Museum continued addressing civil rights and social justice issues, while preserving historic spaces within the building including the former [[Family association|Gee How Oak Tin]] Association room, the Freeman SRO Hotel, a Canton Alley family apartment, and the Yick Fung Mercantile.&lt;ref name=broom&gt;{{cite news | last = Broom | first = Jack | title = Visitors to walk through time at new Wing Luke Asian Museum | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date = May 19, 2008 | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004423747_wingimmersion19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.architecturalrecord.construction.com/projects/portfolio/archives/0906wing_luke_asian-1.asp | title=Wing Luke Asian Museum | first=Clifford A. | last=Pearson | magazine=[[Architectural Record]] | publisher=McGraw Hill | date=June 2009 | accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the museum changed its name to the Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience, informally "The Wing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Wing Luke Asian Museum expands name to Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience, with 'The Wing' as its nickname | url=http://wingluke.org/TheWingannouncement.pdf | publisher=Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Broom&gt;Jack Broom, [http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020303292_winglukexml.html National Parks to recognize Wing Luke Museum ], Seattle Times, 2013-02-06.

==Location==

===Building===
The East Kong Yick Building, where the Museum is located, along with the West Kong Yick Building, were funded by 170 Chinese immigrants in 1910. In addition to storefronts, the East Kong Yick Building contained the Freeman Hotel, which was used by Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino immigrants until the 1940s.&lt;ref name="building"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingluke.org/building-architecture |title=Building and Architecture &gt; Wing Luke Museum |publisher=[[Wing Luke Museum]] |accessdate=2015-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's galleries now share the building with re-creations of the [[kongsi|Gee How Oak Tin Association]]'s meeting room, kitchens, and apartments that were inside the hotel. The museum also preserves the contents of a [[general store]], Yick Fung Co., which the owner donated in its entirety.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/Asian_American_and_Pacific_Islander_Heritage/Wing-Luke-Museum-of-the-Asian-Pacific-American-Experience.htm |title=Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage |website=Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighborhood===
The museum is in Seattle's Chinatown-International District next to Canton Alley, historically a residential, commercial, and communal area.&lt;ref name="sdotblog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2014/06/26/alley-activation-creates-new-pedestrian-friendly-venues/ |title=Alley Activation Creates New Pedestrian Friendly Venues |last=Nielsen |first=Peg |website=Seattle Department of Transportation Blog |publisher=Seattle Department of Transportation |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2015-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wing runs Chinatown Discovery Tours, a tour service founded in 1985 that takes visitors to significant sites within the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="CDT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattlechinatowntour.com/contactus.html |title=Chinatown Discovery Tours |publisher=Chinatown Discovery Tours |accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
