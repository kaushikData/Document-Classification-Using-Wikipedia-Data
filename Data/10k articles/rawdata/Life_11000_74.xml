Two police officers in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]] were shot and killed during a traffic stop on May 20, 2010. Police identified and killed two suspects, identified as '''Jerry Kane, Jr.''', and his son, '''Joseph Kane'''. The two were later identified as members of the [[sovereign citizen movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/WN/deadly-arkansas-shooting-sovereign-citizens-jerry-kane-joseph/story?id=11065285 "Deadly Arkansas Shooting By 'Sovereigns' Jerry and Joe Kane Who Shun U.S. Law"], by Dan Harris, ABC News, July 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Footage of the shooting and ensuing shootout with police was shown in a season 5 episode of ''[[World's Wildest Police Videos]]''.

==Details==
Around 11:36&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Central Time Zone|CDT]], West Memphis police officer Bill Evans initiated a traffic stop on a white [[Plymouth Voyager]] minivan that was travelling on [[Interstate 40 (Arkansas)|Interstate 40]] eastbound toward Airport Road.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|last=Watkins |first=Tom |title=2 police officers fatally shot in West Memphis, Arkansas |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/20/arkansas.2.police.killed/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025529/http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/20/arkansas.2.police.killed/index.html |archivedate=May 23, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a spokesperson for the [[Arkansas State Police]], Officer Evans was "running [[drug interdiction]]", and the vehicle had license plates from [[Ohio]]. Sergeant Brandon Paudert provided backup for Evans. Upon Paudert's arrival at the scene, Evans attempted to frisk Jerry Kane.

Suddenly, Kane turned and attacked Evans in a scuffle down an embankment into a ditch. At that moment, Joe Kane emerged from the passenger door of the van and opened fire with an [[AK-47#Variants|AK-47 variant]]. Paudert ran to the rear of Evans' police cruiser and returned fire with three shots from his .40-caliber handgun through the windows and taillight of Evans' cruiser, in an attempt to hit Kane firing from the other side. He then took cover behind the hood of his cruiser which was parked directly behind Evans' cruiser. Paudert fired four more times at Kane, but missed. Kane then fired multiple shots from his AK-47 variant through the hood of the car, striking Paudert in the head with a [[ricochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7366144n|title=60 Minutes Extra: The shootout (Video)|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=May 15, 2011|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Dashboard video from Evans' cruiser was the only video released of the actual shooting as the majority of events took place out of its line of sight. Although Paudert's dashboard camera recorded the initial scuffle and the entire shooting of both officers, only the events recorded before the actual shooting occurred were released to the public from its point of view. The details of Paudert's actions were given in an interview by Paudert's father who had viewed the video.|group="nb"}}

Both officers were fatally wounded; Paudert, 39, died at the scene, and Evans, 38, died at the hospital. The suspects returned to their van and sped away.&lt;ref name="Dallas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartels|first=Chuck|title=2 officers slain on I-40 drug patrol in Arkansas|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-copshot_21tex.ART.State.Edition1.edfc2f2.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=May 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524085626/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-copshot_21tex.ART.State.Edition1.edfc2f2.html|archivedate=May 24, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[FedEx]] driver from [[Houston]] witnessed the shooting and called 911; neither officer could make an "officer down" call.&lt;ref name="WREG"/&gt;

Approximately 2 hours after the incident, [[Crittenden County, Arkansas|Crittenden County]] Sheriff Dick Busby and Chief Enforcement Officer W. A. Wren stopped a minivan believed to be the suspects' at a [[Wal-Mart Supercenter]].&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sovereign Citizens and Law Enforcement|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_y-gLm9Hrw|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers Busby and Wren were wounded in gunfire exchanged with the suspects and were later hospitalized in critical condition.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

Wildlife Officer Michael K. Neal, responding to the brief standoff, rammed the suspect's vehicle, preventing their escape and saving the lives of Busby and Wren. Officer Neal exchanged fire with the Kanes through his windshield using his patrol rifle. Dozens of officers then surrounded the van, and the Kanes were shot to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Sovereign' Citizen Kane|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/sovereign-citizen-kane|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his heroics, Officer Neal was awarded Law Enforcement Officer of the Year by the NRA.

==Perpetrators==
The day after the shootings, Arkansas State Police identified the suspects as 45-year-old Jerry R. Kane, Jr., and his 16-year-old son Joseph T. Kane. Jerry Kane had expressed sentiment against federal and local government online, and was accused of doing the same in person. Kane served three days in jail near [[Carrizozo, New Mexico]] for driving without a license and concealing his identity. He posted a $1,500 bond. After that incident, he complained of a "Nazi checkpoint". Based on a 2004 conversation with Jerry Kane, [[Clark County, Ohio|Clark County]] Sheriff Gene Kelly expressed concern that Kane would pose a dangerous threat to law enforcement officers. According to Kelly, Kane had complained about being "enslaved" by a judge who had sentenced him to serve six days of community service for driving with an expired license plate and no seat belt. 
{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

According to a New York Times article on the incident, Joseph Kane was home schooled and by age 9, could recite the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and carried a toy gun everywhere he went.  According to Sherriff Kelly "the child had been taught not to trust law enforcement."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Insurance analyst J. J. MacNab observed that Kane ran a debt evasion business, traveling the country speaking on methods to "forestalling foreclosures".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Who Shot Police Had Antigovernment Views|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/us/22arkansas.html|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|date=May 22, 2010|page=A8|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Kane also posted $10,000 bond (which a judge later ordered forfeited) on charges of forgery and attempted grand theft of a motor vehicle filed in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]].

Although Kane was arrested in New Mexico, he was never extradited to Ohio.&lt;ref name="WREG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Noll|first=Scott|title=West Memphis Cop Killer Was Wanted Man|url=http://www.wreg.com/wreg-accused-cop-killer-was-wanted-man-story,0,2728847.story|publisher=WREG|accessdate=December 15, 2010|date=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3D Virtual Creature Evolution''', abbreviated to 3DVCE, is an artificial evolution simulation program created by Lee Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Speciation  Through Selection and Drift | last1=Graham | first1=Lee | last2=Oppacher | first2=Franz | publisher=ACTA Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is currently down. Its purpose is to visualize and research common themes in [[body plan]]s and strategies to achieve a [[fitness function]] of the [[Artificial life|artificial organisms]] generated and maintained by the system in their given environment. The program was inspired by [[Karl Sims|Karl Sims’]] 1994 artificial evolution program, Evolved Virtual Creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving Virtual Creatures | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf | book-title=SIGGRAPH ‘94 Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/alife94.pdf | book-title=Artificial Life IV Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is run through volunteers who download the program from the home website and return information from completed simulations. It is currently only available on [[Windows]] and in some cases [[Linux]].

==Settings==
3DVCE uses [[evolutionary algorithms]] to simulate evolution. The user sets the body plan restrictions (maximum number of segment types, branching segments’ length and depth limits, and size limits) and whether fitness score is scaled in relation to size. Limb interpenetration is also an option. Reproduction / population settings include the size of each population and their run time (how long each individual has to attain a fitness score), percentage of individuals who get to reproduce (tournament size), what percentage sexually or asexually reproduce, and selection type is then determined. Crossover rate determines what percentage of an individual is created via crossover of parents and mutation. Mutation rate in body and brain is then determined. Specific mathematical operations and values can be attributed to the creature’s brain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Simulating Biped Jumping Behavior using Evolutionary Algorithm | author=Heryadi, Yaya | ISSN=1978-774X | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitness function is then determined. Artificial organisms’ fitness score is determined by how well they achieve their fitness goal within their evaluation time. Fitness functions include distance traveled, maximum height, average height, “TOG” (determined by amount of time creature is in contact with ground), and “Sphere” (determined by creature’s ability to catch and hold spheres). These goals are not individualized and can be set to specific strengths (from zero, as not having an influence on fitness, to one, or having maximum influence) to determine the fitness goal. What generations the fitness function applies to can also be set. The environment, or “Terrain”, is then determined. This includes a flat plain, bumpy terrain (in which a hill is generated around creature that constantly inclines as distance is traveled from the creature’s spawning point), water (a low gravity simulator, non-functional), and “spheres” (spheres are generated above creature to catch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ottawaskeptics.org/topics/skepticism/132-tam-6-highlights | title=TAM 6 Highlights: 3DVCE-Lee Graham | publisher=Ottawa Skeptics | author=Barry Green | date=June 28, 2008 | accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation==
Everything in the simulation is viewed from a [[First person (video games)|first person viewpoint]]. After settings are determined, the first generation is generated from randomly created individuals. All creatures appear at the same spawning point and are made of segments or rectangular prisms connected to others at joints. Colors are assigned to segment types randomly. Segment type is determined by the size and joints a segment has. Colors indicate nothing else than that. These first generation creatures move randomly, with no influence from the fitness goal. Creatures with the largest fitness value reproduce and the following generation is based on this reproduction. Eventually, patterns in the population form and fitness increases even further. Fitness function can be changed during the simulation to simulate environmental changes and individual runs can be duplicated to simulate different lineages or [[Speciation (genetic algorithm)|speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants/ | title=Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants: Video games are reshaping how we perform and promote science | author=Morgan, Abbie | publisher=SEED Magazine | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~dubroe/journalism/evolution.pdf | title=Evolution Mutates Beyond Biology | author=Dubrofsky, Elan | publisher=UBC | year=2008 | accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3DVCE is not only for evolutionary research. Objects can also be spawned for graphics and simulated physics tests. This includes pre-installed blocks, spheres, grenades, and structures that can either be thrown from camera or generated at a spawning point. Artificial gravity can also be manipulated. Random and archived creatures can also be re-spawned to manipulate or view. Lee Graham has also included a [[TARDIS]] in the simulation, which when moved into can teleport the camera back to the original spawning point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openviv.com/video/07AU7p_cytQ/blue-strand-evolved-virtual-creature | title=Blue Strand: Evolved Virtual Creatures | publisher=Penviv | accessdate=April 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creatures==
[[Image:Evolved Virtual Creature (Rolling Ribbon).png|thumb | right | 300px | An example of a Rolling Ribbon creature on a flat terrain]]
[[Convergent evolution]] occurs often in 3DVCE, as similar structures and behaviors of the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical "wings", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the air. Rolling Ribbons and Springs are very similar to the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.

Many other types of creatures also form that do not necessarily fit the four main groups previously described by Lee Graham. Tall stick-like creatures also evolve to attain maximum height. Some users have been able to fix the water simulator to evolve creatures that swim. Many other creatures evolve that share traits of multiple groups. There are currently over 220 creatures archived on the main website, which can be found on YouTube by visiting the "Creature Mann" channel.

''''Abdullāh ibn 'Ibādh al-Tamimi''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله بن اباض التميمي}}, d. 708) was a [[Tabi‘un|Tabi'i]], a jurist and one of the best students of [[Ibn Abbas]],{{fact|date=July 2018}} who narrated [[hadith]]s from [[Aisha]] and a large number of the [[Sahaba]] who witnessed the [[Battle of Badr]].{{fact|date=July 2018}} He and [[Jābir ibn Zayd]] were [[imam|imams]] in the [[tafsir]] and sciences of [[Hadith]].{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Lineage==
{{unreferencedsect|date=July 2018}}
Abdullah ibn Ibadh belongs to the tribe of Bani Murra who are descendants of Murra ibn Ubayd ibn Tamim, and thus he belongs to the tribe of [[Bani Tamim]], one of the largest in the Arabian peninsula.

==Biography==
Ibn Ibadh grew up during the reign of [[Muawiyah I]], the first ruler of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], and died during the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hawley]], ''Oman'', pg. 199. Jubilee edition. [[Kensington]]: [[Stacey International]], 1995. {{ISBN|0905743636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ibadi]] school of thought is attributed to ibn Ibadh, although there is some recent research&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, V. J. (2015) [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec3.12164 Ibāḍism: History, Doctrines, and Recent Scholarship]. Religion Compass, 9: 297–307&lt;/ref&gt; that qualifies this attribution.

'''Afonso I'''&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;Or also ''Affonso'' (Archaic [[Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonso'' ([[Portuguese-Galician languages|Portuguese-Galician]]) or ''Alphonsus'' ([[Latin]] version), sometimes rendered in English as ''Alphonzo'' or ''Alphonse'', depending on the Spanish or French influence.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-pt|ɐˈfõsu|eu}}; 25 July 1106 / 1109 or August 1109 / 1111{{snd}}6 December 1185), nicknamed '''the Conqueror''' ({{lang-pt|O Conquistador}}), '''the Founder''' ({{lang|pt|O Fundador}}) or '''the Great''' ({{lang|pt|O Grande}}) by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], and  ''El-Bortukali'' [in Arabic {{lang|ar|البرتقالي}}] ("the Portuguese") and ''Ibn-Arrink'' [in Arabic {{lang|ar|ابن الرَّنك}} or {{lang|ar|ابن الرَنْق}}] ("son of Henry", "Henriques") by the [[Moors]] whom he fought, was the first [[King of Portugal]]. He achieved the independence of the southern part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia]], the County of Portugal, from Galicia's overlord, the [[King of León]], in 1139, establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', an objective that he pursued until his death in 1185, after forty-six years of wars against the Moors.

==Youth==
Afonso was the son of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and [[Teresa of León, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]], the natural daughter of King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]]. According to [[Fernão Lopes]]' ''Crónica de Portugal de 1419,'' the future Portuguese king was born in [[Guimarães]], which was at the time the most important political center of his parents. This was accepted by most Portuguese scholarship until in 1990 Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed Coimbra, the center of the county of Coimbra and another political center of Afonso's progenitors, as his birthplace, which caused outrage in Guimarães and a polemic between this historian and [[José Hermano Saraiva]]. Almeida Fernandes later proposed [[Viseu]] as the birthplace of Afonso basing himself on the ''[[Chronica Gothorum]]'', which states Afonso was born in 1109, a position followed by [[José Mattoso]] in his biography of the king.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=26-27
}}  Abel Estefânio has suggested a different date and thesis, proposing 1106 as the birth date and the region of [[Tierra de Campos]] or even [[Sahagún]] as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts Henry and Teresa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estefânio|first=Abel|date=July 2010|title=A data de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/estefanio8002.html|journal=Medievalista|volume= 8|language=PT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estefânio|first=Abel|date=January 2016|title=De novo a data e o local de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA19/estefanio1906.html|journal=Medievalista|volume= 19|language=PT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair reigned jointly as count and countess of Portugal until Henry's death on 22 May 1112 during the siege of [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]],{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=34}} after which Teresa reigned alone.&lt;ref name="Gerli"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QlpKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA676&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=afonso+i+of+portugal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sWxOTr0U1v&amp;sig=HbyK45MU-hykot9JlUwI7jRwtTU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgeahUKEwi_xp_5zPvGAhUFWz4KHWWAAh8#v=onepage&amp;q=afonso%20i%20of%20portugal&amp;f=false Gerli, E. Michael. ''Medieval Iberia'', Routledge, 2013] {{ISBN|9781136771613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known who was the tutor of Afonso. Later traditions, probably started with João Soares Coelho (a bastard descendant of Egas Moniz through a female line) in the mid-13th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the ''Crónica de Portugal de 1419'', asserted he had been [[Egas Moniz o Aio|Egas Moniz de Ribadouro]], possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouro. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate according to José Mattoso that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz's oldest brother, [[Ermígio Moniz]], who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the "dapifer" and "[[Mayor of the Palace|majordomus]]" of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=João Soares Coelho e a gesta de Egas Moniz. In Portugal Medieval: Novas Interpretações|last=Mattoso|first=José|publisher=Imprensa Nacional - Casa da Moeda|year=1985|isbn=|location=Lisboa|pages=409–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=D. Afonso Henriques|last=Mattoso|first=José|publisher=Temas e Debates|year=2007|isbn=978-972-759-911-0|location=Lisboa|pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to pursue a larger share in the Leonese inheritance, his mother Teresa joined forces with [[Fernando Pérez de Trava]], the most powerful count in [[kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]].&lt;ref name="Gerli" /&gt; The Portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal and rallied around Afonso.  The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archbishop of Braga]] was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]], [[Diego Gelmírez]], who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. In symmetry with his [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|cousin]] he made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral of Zamora]] in 1125, with the permission of his mother.  After the military campaign of Alfonso VII against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen.

== Sole count ==
In 1128, near [[Guimarães]] at the [[Battle of São Mamede]], Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover, Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portucale.&lt;ref name=Gerli/&gt; Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portucale into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county's church and nobles. The battle was mostly ignored by the Leonese [[suzerain]] who was occupied at the time with a revolt in Castille. He was also, most likely, waiting for the reaction of the Galician families. After Teresa's death in 1131, [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Afonso VII of León and Castille]] proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin.  On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the [[writ]] in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal or Prince of the Portuguese, an act informally allowed by Afonso VII, as it was thought to be Afonso Henriques's right by blood, as one of two grandsons of the [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Emperor of Hispania]].

Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was (possibly unanimously) proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula, although the first reference to his royal title dates from 1140. The first assembly of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] convened at [[Lamego]] (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history.

== Kingship ==
[[File:D. Afonso Henriques (Quinta da Regaleira).png|left|thumb|287x287px|19th-century depiction of King Afonso I Henriques of Portugal, on the ceiling of the Kings' Room, [[Quinta da Regaleira]], [[Sintra]], Portugal.]]
Complete independence from Alfonso VII of León's [[suzerainty]], however, was not a thing he just could achieve militarily. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope]]. Afonso wed [[Mafalda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal|Mafalda of Savoy]], daughter of [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]], and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of León, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him. 
[[Image:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|339x339px|King Afonso I at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] (Oil on Canvas by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga)]]
In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of [[Alcobaça Monastery]], to which he called the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]] of his uncle [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. In 1143, he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of León, Afonso declared himself the direct [[wikt:liege|liege man]] of the papacy. Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] (see [[Conquest of Santarém]]) and [[Lisbon]] in 1147 (see [[Siege of Lisbon]]).&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I.|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.

Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of León (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce of Aragon|Dulce]], sister of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and Infanta of Aragon. Finally after winning the [[Battle of Valdevez]], the [[Treaty of Zamora (1143)]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of León that Portugal was a sovereign kingdom.

In 1169 the now old Dom Afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]] by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of León [[Ferdinand II of León|Fernando II]] also his son-in-law. From this time onward, the Portuguese king never rode a horse again, but it is not certain this was because of the disability: according to the later Portuguese chronistic tradition, this happened because Afonso would have to surrender himself again to Fernando II of León or risk war between the two kingdoms if he rode a horse. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the [[Minho River]]) in the previous years.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
[[Image:BatalhaOurique.jpg|thumb|left|341x341px|Afonso at the [[Battle of Ourique]] witnessing the Miracle of the Cross (dated 1793 by Domigos Sequeira)]]

In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] were compensated. With consistent effort by several parties, such as the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archpishop of Braga]] [[Paio Mendes]], in the papal court, the [[papal bull]] ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]'' was promulgated accepting the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively. In it [[Pope Alexander III]]  also acknowledged Afonso as King and Portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a kingdom.

In 1184, the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] rallied a great [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] force to retaliate against the Portuguese raids done since the end of a five-year truce in 1178 and besieged [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], which was defended by the heir [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]]. The Almohad siege failed when news arrived the archbishop of Compostela had come to the defense of the city and Fernando II of León himself with his army. The Almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp, with the Almohad caliph being injured in the process (according to one version, because of a [[crossbow]] bolt) and dying on the way back to [[Seville]]. Afonso died shortly after, probably out of a sudden cause of death, on 6 December 1185. The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There are mythical stories that it took 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge. It is also told, despite his honourable character, that he had a temper. Several chronicles give the example of a papal legate that brought a message from the [[Pope Paschal II]] refusing to acknowledge Afonso's claim as King: either after committing or saying a small offense against him or after being simply read the letter, Afonso almost killed, in his rage, the papal representative, taking several portucalense nobles and soldiers to physically restrain the young would-be king.

[[Image:AfonsoHenriques-Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Afonso Henriques in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]].]]
In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal) and the [[University of Granada]] (Spain). The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony (''Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico'' - [[IPPAR]]) halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation's heart and public thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dossiers.publico.pt/shownews.asp?id=1263265&amp;idCanal=1806 ''IPPAR: direcção nacional diz que não foi consultada sobre abertura do túmulo de D.

In 1146,{{efn|Although the ''Annales D. Alfonsi Portugallensium Regis'', record that the wedding of Alfonso and Mafalda was celebrated in 1145, it was not until a year later, in May 1146, when they both appear in royal charters. Historian José Mattoso refers to another source, ''Noticia sobre a Conquista de Santarém'' (News on the [[Conquest of Santarém]]), which states that the city was taken on 15 May 1147, less than a year after their marriage. Since at that time no wedding ceremony could be performed during [[Lent]], Mattoso suggests that the marriage could have taken place in March or April of 1146, possibly on Easter Sunday which fell on 31 March of that year.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=220}}}} Afonso married [[Matilda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal|Mafalda]], daughter of [[Amadeus III, Count of Savoy]] and [[Mahaut of Albon]], both appearing together for the first time in May of that year confirming royal charters.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=220}} They had the following issue:{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=226–227}}

* Henry (5 March 1147 – 1155{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=60}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=71}} named after his  paternal grandfather, [[Henry, Count of Portugal]], he died when he was only eight years old.  Despite being just a child  he represented his father at a council in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] at the age of three;{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=226}}
* [[Urraca of Portugal|Urraca]] (1148–1211{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=226}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=79}}), married King [[Ferdinand II of León]] and was the mother of King [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]]. The marriage was subsequently annulled in 1171 or 1172 and she retired in [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], one of the villas that she had received as part of her [[Las arras#Origins and representation|''arras'']],  and later at the Monastery of Santa María in [[Wamba, Valladolid]] where she was buried.;{{Sfn|Arco y Garay|1954|p=168}}
* [[Theresa of Portugal, Countess of Flanders|Teresa]] (1151–1218{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=226}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=80}}), [[Countess of Flanders|Countess consort of Flanders]] due to her marriage to [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip I]]{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=372–373}} and [[List of Burgundian consorts|Duchess consort of Burgundy]] through her second marriage to [[Odo III, Duke of Burgundy|Odo III]];{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=79}}
* [[Mafalda of Portugal (daughter of Afonso Henriques)|Mafalda]](1153{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=226}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=71}}{{snd}}after 1162). In January 1160, her father and [[Ramón Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], negotiated the marriage of Mafalda to Alfonso, future King [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=60}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=78}} who at that time was three or four years old. After the death of Ramón Berenguer IV in the summer of 1162, King Ferdinand II of León convinced his widow, Queen  [[Petronilla of Aragón|Petronilla]], to cancel the infante's wedding plans with Mafalda and for Alfonso to marry instead [[Sancha of Castile, Queen of Aragon|Sancha,]] daughter of [[Alfonso VII of León]] and his second wife Queen [[Richeza of Poland, Queen of Castile|Richeza of Poland]].{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=287–288, 290}} Mafalda died in her childhood at an unrecorded date.
* Sancho, the future King [[Sancho I of Portugal]] (11 November 1154{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=71}}{{snd}}26 March 1211). He was baptised with the name of Martin for having been born on the [[Martin of Tours|saint's]] feast day.;{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=226}}
* John (1156–25 August 1164);{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=227}} and
* Sancha (1157–14 February 1166/67), born ten days before the death of her mother, Sancha died before reaching the age of ten{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp =227, 383}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=71}} on the 14th of February according to the death registry at the Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra) where she was buried.{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=60}}

Before his marriage to Mafalda, King Afonso fathered his first son with Chamoa Gómez,{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=71}} daughter of Count [[Gómez Núñez]] and Elvira Pérez, sister of [[Fernando Pérez de Traba|Fernando]] and [[Bermudo Pérez de Traba]]:{{Sfn|Calderón Medina|2008|p=42, n. 11}}{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=98, 228, 320}}

* [[Fernando Afonso of Portugal|Afonso]] (1140–1207). Born around 1140,{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=228}} according to recent investigations, he is the same person as the one often called '''Fernando Afonso''' who was the [[Alférez|''alferes-mor'']] of the king and later Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. His presence in the court is first recorded in 1159. In 1169 he succeeded as alferes-mor his half-brother, Pedro Pais da Maia, the legitimate son of his mother and Paio Soares da Maia.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=227–229}}{{Sfn|Calderón Medina|2008|pp=42–43, and notes}}

The extramarital offspring by Elvira Gálter were:
* [[Urraca Afonso, Lady of Aveiro|Urraca Afonso]].{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|pp=28, 64}} In 1185, her father gave her [[Avô]], stipulating that this villa was to be inherited only by the children that she had with her husband Pedro Afonso de Ribadouro (also known as Pedro Afonso Viegas), grandson of [[Egas Moniz, Aio|Egas Moniz]],{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=64}} which could indicate another previous or subsequent marriage. In 1187, she exchanged with her half-brother, King Sancho, this villa for [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]]. She died after 1216, the year she made a donation to the Monastery of Tarouca. {{Sfn|Sotto Mayor Pizarro|1997|p=457, n. 9 and 10, Vol. I}}
* Teresa Afonso. In some genealogies she appears as the daughter of Elvira Gálter,{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|pp=28, 63}} and in others as the daughter of Chamoa Gómez. Her first marriage was with Sancho Nunes de Barbosa with whom she had a daughter, Urraca Sanches, who married Gonçalo Mendes de Sousa, the father of Mendo Gonçalves de Sousa known as "Sousão".{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=63}} Her second husband was Fernando Martins Bravo, Lord of [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragança]] and [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]], with no issue from this marriage.{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=63}}

King Afonso was also the father of:
* [[Pedro Afonso, Master of Aviz|Pedro Afonso]] (died after 1183), Lord of [[Arega]] and Pedrógão, mayor of [[Abrantes]] in 1179, ''alferes'' of King Afonso I between 1181 and 1183, and Master of the [[Order of Aviz]].{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=103, 229, 388}}{{Sfn|Caetano de Souza|1735|p=28}}

'''Ahmad Shah''' ([[nom de guerre]] '''Mohammad Ismail'''; {{Circa|1970}} – {{Circa|April 2008}}) was a local (to the [[Kunar Province]] of [[Afghanistan]]) who commanded a group of fighters operating in eastern Afghanistan and was linked to [[Gulbadin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name=Ed_Darack_Victory_Point&gt;{{cite book|last=Darack|first=Ed|title=[[Victory Point (Book)|Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers – The Marine Corps' Battle for Freedom in Afghanistan]]|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2010|isbn=978-0-425-23259-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shah1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darack.com/sawtalosar/shah-1.php|title=Photograph of Ahmad Shah|last=Unknown Photographer|publisher=Darack.com|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shah2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darack.com/sawtalosar/shah-2.php|title=Photograph of Ahmad Shah|last=Unknown Photographer|publisher=Darack.com|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shah3"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darack.com/sawtalosar/shah-3.php|title=Photograph of Ahmad Shah|last=Unknown Photographer|publisher=Darack.com|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shah4"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darack.com/sawtalosar/shah-4.php|title=Photograph of Ahmad Shah|last=Unknown Photographer|publisher=Darack.com|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="armytimes_070618w"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naylor|first=Sean D.|title=Surviving SEAL tells story of deadly mission|work=[[Army Times]]|date=18 June 2007|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2007/06/navy_sealbook_070618w|accessdate=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad Shah was from the [[Kuz Kunar|Kuz Kunar District]] of [[Nangarhar Province]]. His full name was "Ahmad Shah Dara-I-Nur" meaning "Ahmad Shah of the Valley of the Enlightened Ones".&lt;ref name=Ed_Darack_Victory_Point/&gt; While he was not part of the Taliban, he sought allegiance with them.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs reliable source as many accounts  contradict.|date=January 2014}} He was most closely associated with [[Gulbadin Hekmatyar]]. He led a small armed group of Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) fighters who ambushed a team of four [[U.S. Navy SEALs]] and then shot down an [[MH-47 Chinook|MH-47]] helicopter dispatched as part of a quick reaction force for the SEALs, killing a total of 19 U.S. special operations personnel during [[Operation Red Wings]] in late June 2005.&lt;ref name="Ed_Darack_Victory_Point"/&gt; In the fire fight with the four SEALs his group had an estimated 35 casualties&lt;ref name="Shah5"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |title=Operation Red Wings |last=Unknown |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114090628/http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |archivedate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of a last stand by the four SEALs.  The Marine Battalion that conceived and planned [[Operation Red Wings]], the [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment]] developed the operation to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the [[Pech District]] of the [[Kunar Province]] with a focus on Shah. Through [[Human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] and [[signals intelligence]] they determined Ahmad Shah had a force of 10 to 20 fighters. Shah and the fighters under his command exacted heavy casualties to the Navy SEALs and Marines.&lt;ref name=Ed_Darack_Victory_Point/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ed_Darack_Marine_Corps_Gazette/&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGirk|first=Tim|title=How the Shepherd Saved the SEAL- Page 2, "5 to 1 ratio" |work=Time Magazine|date=11 July 2005|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1081394-2,00.html|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to the SEAL ambush and MH-47 shootdown, Shah and his men escaped to [[Pakistan]], where they produced a video from footage they shot of the ambush that included weapons and implements captured from the SEALs. In late July 2005, Shah and his men returned to the Kunar Province, and began attacking United States, Coalition, and Government of Afghanistan entities.&lt;ref name="Ed_Darack_Victory_Point"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ed_Darack_Marine_Corps_Gazette&gt;{{citation|author=Darack, Ed|url=http://www.marinecorpsgazette-digital.com/marinecorpsgazette/201101/?pg=65#pg65|title=Operation Red Wings: What Really Happened?|journal=Marine Corps Gazette (January 2011)|publisher=Marinecorpsgazette-digital.com|date=14 December 2010|pages=62–65|accessdate=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119111355/http://www.marinecorpsgazette-digital.com/marinecorpsgazette/201101/?pg=65#pg65|archive-date=19 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad Shah's cell was destroyed during [[Operation Whalers]], which was planned and executed by the [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment]]. Operation Whalers, like [[Operation Red Wings]], was planned to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia activity in the region to further support ongoing stabilization efforts to ensure a safe voting environment for the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|18 September 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections]]. After Operation Whalers, Shah was unable to stage attacks in Afghanistan again.&lt;ref name="Ed_Darack_Victory_Point"/&gt;

Shah reportedly fought against the [[Taliban]] and [[al Qaeda]] in 2001. He eventually switched sides and later became a facilitator for foreign fighters traversing and operating in the challenging terrain of the northeast.&lt;ref name="longwarjournal"&gt;{{cite web|date=17 April 2008|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/04/_commander_ismail_im.php|title=Bara bin Malek Front commander killed in Pakistani shootout|publisher=long war journal|accessdate=10 December 2008|last=Matt Dupee| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226171446/http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/04/_commander_ismail_im.php| archivedate= 26 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shah was killed during a shootout with [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], in April 2008, after failing to stop at a security checkpoint whilst transporting a kidnapped trader.&lt;ref name="cbsnews"&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/infamous-taliban-leader-killed-in-pakistan/&lt;/ref&gt; An official from [[Kunar Province]] stated that Shah had been the "most wanted terrorist in Kunar province."&lt;ref name="cbsnews"/&gt;

An '''alternative lifestyle''' is a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] diverse in respect to [[mainstream]] ones, or generally perceived to be outside the cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]. ''Lifestyle'' is a [[media culture]] term derived from the concept of [[style in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, J. M. ''Introduction'', in [[Adorno]] ''[[Culture industry]]'' p.35 quotation: {{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and ‘different’ commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative ‘life-styles’.&lt;br&gt;
‘Life-styles’, the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually, but not always, it implies an affinity or identification within some matching [[subculture]] (e.g. [[hippies]], [[Goth subculture|goths]] and [[Punk subculture|punks]]). Some people with alternative lifestyles mix elements from various subcultures ([[grunge]] musicians were often influenced by a mixture of the [[punk subculture|punk]], [[acid rock|hippie]], [[emo]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subcultures).

Not all minority lifestyles are held{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to be "alternative", so the term tends to apply to newer forms of lifestyle, often based upon enlarged freedoms (especially in the sphere of social styles), or a decision to substitute another approach, or to not follow the usual expected path in most societies.

== History ==

A [[Stanford University]] cooperative house, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160730005004/http://web.stanford.edu/group/synergy/ Synergy], was founded in 1972 with the theme of "exploring alternative lifestyles."

'''Astronaut training''' describes the complex process of preparing [[astronauts]] for their space missions before, during and after the flight, which includes medical tests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/hhp/medical-examination-requirements|title=Medical Examination Requirements (MER) for Former Astronauts|last=Lewis|first=Robert|date=2017-12-08|work=NASA|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, physical training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kale|first=Sneha R|last2=Master|first2=Hiral S|last3=Verma|first3=Chhaya V|last4=Shetye|first4=Jaimala|last5=Surkar|first5=Swati|last6=Mehta|first6=Amita|date=2013|title=Exercise Training for Astronauts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5958/j.0973-5674.7.2.017|journal=Indian Journal of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy - An International Journal|volume=7|issue=2|pages=82|doi=10.5958/j.0973-5674.7.2.017|issn=0973-5666}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) training, procedure training, rehabilitation process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oddsson|first=Lars IE|last2=Karlsson|first2=Robin|last3=Konrad|first3=Janusz|last4=Ince|first4=Serdar|last5=Williams|first5=Steve R|last6=Zemkova|first6=Erika|date=2007-07-10|title=A rehabilitation tool for functional balance using altered gravity and virtual reality|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1936992/|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|volume=4|pages=25|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-25|issn=1743-0003|pmc=1936992|pmid=17623080}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as training on experiments they will accomplish during their stay in space.

The training is geared to the special conditions and environments astronauts will be confronted with during launch, in space, and during landing. All phases of the flight&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=NASA, Space Science, and Western Europe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137340931.0010|work=NASA in the World|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137340931|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; must be considered during training to ensure safety to, and functionality of the astronauts, as well as to ensure a successful completion of the mission. The [[List of Apollo astronauts|Apollo astronauts]] that walked on the [[Moon]] also received training for [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ap-geotrips.html geology fieldwork] on the [[Lunar surface]].

== Purpose of training ==

=== Launch and landing ===

The effects of launching and landing has various effects on astronauts, with the most significant effects that occur being [[space motion sickness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heer|first=Martina|last2=Paloski|first2=William H.|date=2006-10-30|title=Space motion sickness: incidence, etiology, and countermeasures|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16935570|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic &amp; Clinical|volume=129|issue=1-2|pages=77–79|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2006.07.014|issn=1566-0702|pmid=16935570}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[orthostatic intolerance]], and [[cardiovascular events]].

Space motion sickness is an event that can occur within minutes of being in changing gravity environments (i.e. from 1g on Earth prior to launch to more than 1g during launch, and then from microgravity in space to hypergravity during re-entry and again to 1g after landing). The symptoms range from drowsiness and headaches, to nausea and vomiting. There are three general categories of space motion sickness:

* Mild: One to several transient symptoms, no operational impact
* Moderate: Several symptoms of persistent nature, minimal operational impact
* Severe: Several symptoms of persistent nature, significant impact on performance

About three-fourths of astronauts experience  
space motion sickness, with effects rarely exceeding two days. There is a risk for post-flight motion sickness, however this is only significant following long-duration space missions.

Post-flight, following exposure to microgravity, the [[vestibular system]], located in the inner ear is disrupted because of the microgravity-induced unresponsiveness of the [[otolith]]s which are small calcareous concretions that sense body postures and are responsible for ensuring proper balance. In most cases, this leads to some postflight postural illusions.

Cardiovascular events represent important factors during the three phases of a space mission. They can be divided in:
* Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases: these are typically ''selected-out'' during astronaut selection, but if they are present in an astronaut they can worsen over the course of the spaceflight.
* Cardiovascular events and changes occurring during spaceflight: these are due to body fluids shift and redistribution, heart rhythm disturbances and decrease in maximal exercise capacity in the micro gravity environment. These effects can potentially lead the crew to be severely incapacitated upon return to a gravitational environment and thus unable to egress a spacecraft without assistance.
* Orthostatic intolerance leading to syncope during post-flight stand test.

=== On-orbit operations ===

{{further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}

Astronauts are trained in preparation for the conditions of launch as well as the harsh environment of space. This training aims to prepare the crew for events falling under two broad categories: events relating to operation of the spacecraft (internal events), and events relating to the [[space environment]] (external events).

==== Internal events ====

[[File:Ozzythewise ColumbusModule 260212.jpg|thumb|right|An internal view of ESA's Columbus module training mockup, located at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany. Astronauts must familiarize themselves with all the spacecraft components during their training.]]

During training, astronauts are familiarized with the engineering systems of the spacecraft including [[spacecraft propulsion]], [[spacecraft thermal control]], and [[life support system]]s. In addition to this, astronauts receive training in [[orbital mechanics]], scientific experimentation, [[earth observation]], and [[astronomy]]. This training is particularly important for missions when an astronaut will encounter multiple systems (for example on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS)). Training is performed in order to prepare astronauts for events that may pose a hazard to their health, the health of the crew, or the successful completion of the mission. These types of events may be: failure of a critical life support system, capsule depressurization, fire, and other life-threatening events.  In addition to the need to train for hazardous events, astronauts will also need to train to ensure the successful completion of their mission. This could be in the form of [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241286792_Preparing_for_space_-_EVA_training_at_the_European_Astronaut_Centre training for EVA], scientific experimentation, or [http://www.nastarcenter.com/aerospace-training/space/pilots-and-crew spacecraft piloting].

==== External events ====

External events refers more broadly to the ability to live and work in the extreme environment of space. This includes adaptation to microgravity (or [[weightlessness]]), isolation, confinement, and [[radiation]]. The difficulty associated with living and working in microgravity include [[spatial disorientation]], motion sickness, and [[vertigo]]. During long-duration missions, astronauts will often experience isolation and confinement. This has been known to limit performance of astronaut crews and hence training aims to prepare astronauts for such challenges.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;NASA. Long Duration Psychology. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/long-duration/long.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term effects of radiation on crews is still largely unknown. However, it is theorized that astronauts on a trip to Mars will likely receive more than 1000x the radiation dosage of a typical person on earth.&lt;ref name ="Durante:2008"&gt;DURANTE, M and FA CUCINOTTA. 2008. Heavy Ion Carcinogenesis and Human Space Exploration. Nature Rev Cancer, 2 May, pp.465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, present and future training must incorporate systems and processes for protecting astronauts against radiation.

=== Science experiments ===

Scientific experimentation has historically been an important element of human spaceflight, and is the primary focus of the International Space Station. Training on how to successfully carry out these experiments is an important part of astronaut training, as it maximizes the scientific return of the mission. Once on-orbit, communication between astronauts and scientists on the ground can be limited, and time is strictly apportioned between different mission activities. It is vital that astronauts are familiar with their assigned experiments in order to complete them in a timely manner, with as little intervention from the ground as possible.

For missions to the ISS, each astronaut is required to become proficient at one hundred or more experiments. During training, the scientists responsible for the experiments do not have direct contact with the astronauts who will be carrying them out. Instead, scientists instruct trainers who in turn prepare the astronauts for carrying out the experiment. Much of this training is done at the European Astronaut Center.

For human experiments, the scientists describe their experiments to the astronauts who then choose whether to participate on board the ISS. For these experiments, the astronauts will be tested before, during, and after the mission to establish a baseline and determine when the astronaut returned to the baseline.

== Training by region ==

=== United States ===

At NASA, following the selection phase, the so-called "AsCans" (Astronaut candidates) have to undergo up to two years of training/indoctrination period to become fully qualified astronauts. 
Initially, all AsCans must go through basic training to learn both technical and soft skills. There are 16 different technical courses in:

* Life support systems
* Orbital mechanics
* [[Payload (air and space craft)|Payload]] deployment
* Earth observations
* [[Space physiology]] and [[Space medicine|medicine]]

[[File:Nasa astronaut training at NBL.jpg|thumb|right|Astronauts train in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas]]

[[File:Ozzythewise AstronautsJSC 260212.jpg|thumb|left|The Crew of STS-135 practices rendezvous and docking with the ISS in the Systems Engineering Simulator at the Johnson Space Center on June 28, 2011 in Houston, Texas.]]

AsCans initially go through Basic Training, where they are trained on [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]], and ISS systems, flight safety and operations, as well as land or water survival. Pilot AsCans will receive training on NASA's [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 Trainer Jet]]. Furthermore, because modern space exploration is done by a consortium of different countries and is a very publicly visible area, astronauts received professional and cultural training, as well as language courses (specifically in [[Russian language|Russian]]).&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010"&gt;SEEDHOUSE, Erik. 2010. Prepare for Launch: The Astronaut Training Process. New York City, NY: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Following completion of Basic Training candidates proceed to NASA's Advanced Training. AsCans are trained on life-sized models to get a feel of what they will be doing in space. This was done both through the use of the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]] while it was still operational and is done through simulation mock-ups. The shuttle training aircraft was exclusively used by the commander and pilot astronauts for landing practices until the retirement of the Shuttle, while advanced simulation system facilities are used by all the candidates to learn how to work and successfully fulfill their tasks in the space environment. Simulators and EVA training facilities help candidates to best prepare their different mission operations. In particular, [[vacuum chamber]]s, [[parabolic flight]]s, and [[Neutral Buoyancy Simulator|neutral buoyancy facilities]] (NBF) allow candidates to get acclimated to the [[Micro-g environment|micro gravity]] environment, particularly for EVA. [[Virtual reality]] is also becoming increasingly used as a tool to immerse AsCans into the space environment.&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="NASA:2004"&gt;NASA. 2004. Astronauts in Training. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_Astronauts_in_Training.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The final phase is the Intensive Training. It starts at about three months prior to launch and serves to prepare the candidates specifically for the mission they have been assigned to. Flight-specific integrated simulations are designed to provide a dynamic testing ground for mission rules and flight procedures. The final Intensive Training joint crew/flight controller training is carried out in parallel with ''mission planning.'' This phase is where candidates will undergo mission specific operational training, as well as experience with their assigned experiments. Crew medical officer training is also included to effectively intervene with proactive and reactive actions in case of medical issues.&lt;ref name="Seedhouse:2010"/&gt;

=== Europe ===

Astronaut training in Europe is carried out by the [[European Astronaut Centre]] (EAC), headquartered in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. European training has three phases: Basic training, Advanced training, and Increment Specific Training.

[[File:Ozzythewise SoyuzCapsule 04032012.jpg|thumb|right|Soyuz capsule simulator located at the EAC in Cologne, Germany. ESA astronauts will simulate operations in the capsule at the EAC.]]

For all ESA selected astronauts, Basic Training begins at the EAC headquarters. This section of the training cycle has four separate training blocks that last 16 months. Astronauts will receive an orientation on the major spacefaring nations, their space agencies, and all major manned and unmanned space programs. Training in this phase also looks into applicable laws and policies of the space sector. Technical (including  engineering, [[astrodynamics]], propulsion, orbital mechanics, etc.) and scientific (including [[human physiology]], [[biology]], earth observation, and astronomy) basics are introduced, to ensure that all new astronauts have the required base level of knowledge. Training is done on ISS operations and facilities, including an introduction to all major operating systems on board the ISS that are required for its functionality as a manned space research laboratory. This phase also covers in-depth systems operations for all spacecraft that service the ISS (e.g. Soyuz, [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]], Automatic Transfer Vehicle ([[Automatic Transfer Vehicle|ATV]]), and the H-II Transfer Vehicle ([[H-II Transfer Vehicle|HTV]])), as well as ground control and launch facility training. This training phase also focuses on skills such as [[Robotics|robotic operations]], [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous and docking]], Russian language courses, human behavior and performance, and finally a [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] open water scuba diving course. This scuba course provides basic EVA training at ESA's NBF before moving onto the larger NASA training facility at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]].

Advanced Training includes a much more in-depth look into the ISS, including learning how to service and operate all systems. Enhanced science training is also implemented at this time to ensure all astronauts can perform science experiments on board the ISS. This phase takes around one year to complete and training is completed across the ISS partner network, no longer only at the EAC. It is only upon completion of this phase that astronauts are assignment to a spaceflight.

Increment-Specific Training starts only after an astronaut has been assigned to a flight. This phase lasts 18 months and prepares them for their role on their assigned mission. During this phase crew members as well as backup crews will train together. The crew tasks on the ISS are individually tailored, with consideration to the astronaut's particular experience and professional background. There are three different user levels for all on-board equipment (i.e. user level, operator level, and specialist level). A crew member can be a specialist on systems while also only being an operator or user on others, hence why the training program is individually tailored. Increment Specific Training also includes training to deal with off-nominal situations. Astronauts will also learn how to run the experiments that are specifically scheduled for their assigned missions.

=== Russia ===

[[Image:GCTC.jpg|thumb|right|The grounds of the Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center]]

Training for [[cosmonaut]]s falls into three phases: General Space Training, Group Training, and Crew Training.&lt;ref name=RuSpace&gt;http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/training.html&lt;/ref&gt; General Space Training lasts about two years and consists of classes, survival training, and a final exam which determines whether a cosmonaut will be a test or research cosmonaut.  The next year is devoted to Group Training where cosmonauts specialize in the Soyuz or ISS as well as professional skills. The final phases, the Crew Training phase, lasts a year and a half and is dedicated to detailed vehicle operations procedures, ISS training, and [[English language]].

Training primarily takes place at the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]]. The center facilities have full size mockups of all major Soviet and Russian spacecraft including the ISS. As with the ISS astronauts, cosmonauts train in the USA, Germany, Japan, and [[Canada]] for specific training in the various ISS modules.

=== Japan ===

The Japanese human spaceflight program has historically focused on training astronauts for Space Shuttle missions. As such, training previously took place at NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, and followed that of NASA astronauts and other international participants in the Space Shuttle program.

[[Image:Tsukuba Space Center-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[H-II rocket]] outside the Tsukuba Space Center where training of JAXA astronauts takes place]]

Since the development of domestic training facilities at the [[Tsukuba Space Center]], training has increasingly taken place in Japan. With Japan’s participation in the ISS, the training of Japanese astronauts follows a similar structure to that of other ISS partners. Astronauts carry out 1.5 years of Basic Training mainly at Tsukuba, followed by 1.5–2 years of Advanced Training at Tsukuba and ISS partner sites. Training for any international ISS astronauts involving the [[Kibo module]] will also be carried out at Tsukuba Space Center.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2011"&gt;JAXA. 2011. Basic Training for International Space Station Astronaut Candidates. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://iss.jaxa.jp/astro/ascan/ascan01_e.html &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Training is followed by Increment-Specific Training, which, along with any Kibo training, will be carried out at Tsukuba. EVA training for Kibo takes place in the Weightless Environment Test System (WETS). WETS is a Neutral Buoyancy Facility featuring a full-scale mock-up of the Kibo module on the ISS.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2012"&gt;JAXA. 2012. Tsukuba Space Center Overview. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.jaxa.jp/about/centers/tksc/index_e.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsukuba Space Center also includes medical facilities for assessing suitability of candidates, an isolation chamber for simulating some of the mental and emotional stressors of long duration spaceflight, and a hypobaric chamber for training in hull breach or Life Support System failure scenarios resulting in a reduction or loss of air pressure.&lt;ref name="JAXA:2008"&gt;ESA. 2008. Cercasi.astronauti. [online]. [Accessed 20 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.esa.int/esaKIDSit/SEMGY11YUFF_LifeinSpace_1.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===

Although official detail of the selection process for the [[Shenzhou program]] is not available, what is known is that candidates are chosen by the [[Chinese National Space Administration]] from the Chinese air force and must be between 25 and 30 years of age, with a minimum of 800 hours flying time, and a degree-level education. Candidates must be between 160&amp;nbsp;cm and 172&amp;nbsp;cm in height, and between 50&amp;nbsp;kg and 70&amp;nbsp;kg in weight.&lt;ref name="SinoDefense:2011"&gt;SINO DEFENSE. 2011. Chinese Astronaut Corps. [online]. [Accessed 25 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/astronaut/astronaut-corps.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126222238/http://www.sinodefence.com/astronaut/astronaut-corps.asp |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For China's Shenzhou astronauts, training begins with a year-long program of education in the basics of spaceflight. During this period, candidates are also introduced to human physiology and psychology. The second phase of training, lasting nearly 3 years involves extensive training in piloting the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou vehicle]] in nominal and emergency modes. The third and final stage of training is mission specific training, and lasts approximately 10 months. During this phase of training, astronauts are trained in the high fidelity Shenzhou trainer, as well as the Neutral Buoyancy Facility located at the [[Astronaut Center of China]] (ACC), in [[Beijing]]. As well as time spent in the Neutral Buoyancy Facility (NBF), training for EVA takes place in a high vacuum, low temperature chamber that simulates the environmental conditions of space. At all stages of training, astronauts undergo physical conditioning, including time in a human centrifuge located at the ACC, and a program of micro gravity flights, carried out in Russia.&lt;ref name="Morring:2009"&gt;MORRING, F. 2009. Astronaut Training. Aviation Week and Space Technology, pp.48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

The Indian human space flight program still awaits a formal go ahead. Once cleared the mission is expected to take two Indians in a Soyuz-type orbital vehicle into [[low earth orbit]]. The training for these astronauts should be based on the lessons learned from training India’s only [[Rakesh Sharma|Cosmonaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma]] (''See [[Salyut 7|Salyut-7 1984]]'') and through India’s international co-operation with NASA and Roscosmos. This would allow India to gain insights from their rich experiences in human spaceflight. There also lies a possibility that India may go proceed through its human spaceflight program individually, necessitating the Indian Space Research Organisation ([[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]]) to develop its own training program. For astronaut training, India is deciding a place which is at a distance of 8 to 10 km from Kempegowda international airport. This land is under the ownership of ISRO. Astronaut training and biomedical engineering centers will be built on it. Though India’s first man mission training will take place in USA or in Russia, this place can be used for future training. Moreover, center will have chambers for radiation regulation, thermal cycling and centrifugal for the acceleration training. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/india-human-spaceflight-announcement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Future training ==

=== Suborbital astronaut training ===

While it is likely that the first generation of non-government spaceflight astronauts will perform suborbital trajectories, currently some companies like [[Virgin Galactic]] and [[Xcor Aerospace]] are developing their own proprietary suborbital astronaut training programs, however the first official Suborbital Astronaut Training program of the 21st century was a joint effort between the two government agencies, the Ecuadorian Air Force and the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2005"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force Official document on ASA/T program. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp8/FAE-ESAA.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; developed the ASA/T (Advanced Suborbital Astronaut Training) program with a duration up to 16 months, it started in 2005 and completed in 2007 focusing in command and research duties during short duration missions with suborbital trajectories up to 180 kilometers. This program had one Ecuadorian citizen graduate in 2007,&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2007"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force presented with ASA/T program completion brief. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp8/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAE-ESAA ASA/T astronaut training:2008"&gt;Ecuadorian Air Force presented with space program brief. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp9/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAF-EXA:2010"&gt;IAF EXA entry: Ecuadorian Space Agency. [online]. [Accessed October 1, 2015]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.iafastro.org/societes/ecuadorian-civilian-space-agency-exa/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; recently the [[Ecuadorian Space Agency]] has made a call&lt;ref name="EXA Call for astronaut training:2014"&gt;EXA call for astronaut candidates. [online]. [Accessed October 1, 2015]. &lt;http://www.exa.ec/bp61/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for a new class of ASA/T training candidates, accordingly to the EXA, they will focus on renting commercial suborbital vehicles in order to perform manned space research&lt;ref name="Ecuadorian manned space research"&gt;Ecuadorian Space Program Manned Space Research - 61th International Astronautical Congress 2010 - HUMAN SPACE ENDEAVOURS SYMPOSIUM (B3)Overview Session (Present and Near-Term Human Space Flight Programs) (1). &lt;https://www.academia.edu/771672/THE_ECUADORIAN_CIVILIAN_SPACE_PROGRAM_NEAR-FUTURE_MANNED_RESEARCH_MISSIONS_IN_A_LOW_COST_ENTRY_LEVEL_SPACE_PROGRAM&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Commercial astronaut|Commercial astronauts]]===

[[File:Ozzythewise HumanCentrifuge 04032012.jpg|thumb|right|Human centrifuge at DLR in Cologne, Germany used for human physiological tests. The high accelerations experienced during suborbital flights may necessitate testing or even training on human centrifuges to determine if participants are fit for space flight]]

Looking ahead, the emergence of commercial space tourism will necessitate new standards for flight participants that currently do not exist. These standards will be to ensure that medical screenings are done properly in order to ensure safe and successful flights. This type of medical screening will differ from space agency astronaut selection and training because the goal is not to fly the highest performing individual, but merely to ensure a safe flight for the passengers under the rigors of space travel. The main considerations for this type of travel will be:

* What type and extent of training is sufficient?
* Who will qualify space tourists as fit for travel?
* How will new regulations comply with existing medical boards?
* What selection-out criteria need to be employed to reduce dangers to space tourists?

Medical regulations for commercial space flight might mitigate commercial space company risk by selecting only those capable of passing standard medical criteria, as opposed to allowing anyone who can purchase a ticket to fly. The first generation of commercial space flight will likely be [[Suborbital flight|suborbital trajectories]] which invoke significant acceleration changes, causing cardiovascular and pulmonary issues. Because of this any future medical criteria for commercial spaceflight participants needs to focus specifically on the detrimental effects of rapidly changing gravitational levels, and which individuals will be capable of tolerating this.

[[Bioastronautics]] and [[Aeronomy|upper-atmospheric research]] have been conducted by [https://projectpossum.org/ Project PoSSUM] scientist-astronaut candidates since 2015. As of October 2018, the program has attracted members from 37 different countries and published research on mesospheric dynamics and human performance in space suits, microgravity, and post-landing environments. 

Current research on fitness training and strategies for commercial astronauts conducted by [https://www.astrowright.com/ Astrowright Spaceflight Consulting], the first commercial firm to offer dedicated fitness training for [[space tourists]], suggests that conventional fitness training is inadequate to support safe movement in [[microgravity]], and that training utilizing reduced points of stability should be emphasized.&lt;ref name="McGee B.W.:2012"&gt;MCGEE, B.W. et al. 2012. A Qualitative Assessment of Preflight Fitness Training Strategies and Methods [online]. [Accessed 29 May 2013]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.boulder.swri.edu/NSRC2012/Site1//PDF/McGee-O.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-duration missions to the Moon, asteroids, or Mars ===

[[File:Astronaut during virtual reality training.jpg|thumb|left|Astronaut during virtual reality training]]

Astronauts for long term missions such as those to the [[Moon]], an [[asteroid]], or even to [[Mars]] need to carry out multiple tasks and duties, because on such missions the astronauts will need to function largely autonomously, and will need to be proficient in many different areas. For these types of missions, the training to prepare astronauts will likely include training as [[physician|doctors]], [[scientists]], engineers, [[technicians]], [[Aviator|pilots]], and [[geologists]]. In addition there will be a focus on the psychological aspects of long-duration missions where crew is largely isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kelly | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Kelly (astronaut) |  others = With Margaret Lazarus Dean | title = Endurance: A Year in Space, A Lifetime of Discovery | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Penguin Random House | year = 2017 | page = 50 | isbn = 9781524731595 | quote = Unlike the early days of spaceflight, when piloting skill was what mattered, twenty-first-century astronauts are chosen for our ability to perform a lot of different jobs and to get along well with others, especially in stressful and cramped circumstances for long periods of time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently a six-month mission to the ISS requires up to five years of astronaut training. This level of training is to be expected and likely to be expanded upon for future space exploration missions. It may also include in-flight training aspects. It may be possible that the ISS will be used as a long-duration astronaut training facility in the future.

A powerful tool for astronaut training will be the continuing use of analog environments, including NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations ([[NEEMO|NOAA NEEMO]]), NASA's Desert Research and Technology Studies ([[Desert RATS]]), [[Envihab]] (planned), [[Flight Analog Research Unit]], Haughton-Mars Project ([[Haughton-Mars Project|HMP]]), or even the ISS (in-flight). In fact, at NEEMO a total of 15 mission astronauts (known as [[aquanauts]]) have been trained for future missions to asteroids.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz:2011"&gt;MOSKOWITZ, Clara. 2011. Astronauts Set to Become Aquanauts for Undersea 'Asteroid' Mission. [online]. [Accessed 26 February 2012]. Available from World Wide Web: &lt;http://www.space.com/13007-nasa-astronauts-undersea-asteroid-mission.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of virtual reality will also continue to be used as a means of training astronauts in a cost effective manner, particularly for operations such as extra-vehicular activity ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]).
[[File:Robonaut2 onboard ISS.jpg|thumb|right|Robonaut2 onboard ISS]]
These missions are not completely independent without the presence of robots. This opens up a new avenue towards [[Human robot interaction|Human-Robot Interaction]] which has to be thoroughly understood and practised to develop a harmonious relationship between astronauts and robots. These robots would aid the astronauts from being their personal assistants to next generation of extreme environment explorers. Currently there is a robot on the ISS aiding the astronauts in their mammoth tasks with a human touch. Intercultural and human robot interaction training is the need of the hour for long duration missions.

Training also has to be evolved for [[moon landing]] to [[Manned mission to Mars]]. Factors like crew dynamics, crew size, and crew activities play a crucial role as these missions would last from 1 year to Moon to 3 years on Mars. The training required for such missions has to be versatile and easy to learn, adapt, and improvise.

'''Bichirs''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɪ|ʃ|ɪər}} and the '''[[reedfish]]''' comprise '''Polypteridae''', a family of archaic-looking [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]] and the only family in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Polypteriformes'''.&lt;ref name= "Helfman"&gt;Helfman GS, Collette BB, Facey DE, Bowen BW. 2009. The Diversity of Fishes. West Sussex, UK: Blackwell Publishing. 720 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

All species occur in freshwater habitats in tropical Africa and the [[Nile]] River system, mainly swampy, shallow [[floodplain]]s and [[estuary|estuaries]].

Bichirs are considered the [[sister group]] to all other extant ray-finned fishes.&lt;ref name="Suzuki2010a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = D. | last2 = Brandley | first2 = M.

==Anatomy==
Bichirs are elongated fish with a unique series of dorsal finlets which vary in number from seven to 18, instead of a single dorsal fin. Each of the dorsal finlets has bifid (double-edged) tips, and are the only fins with spines; the rest of the fins are composed of soft rays. The body is covered in thick, bonelike, and rhombic ([[ganoid]]) scales. Their [[jaw]] structure more closely resembles that of the [[tetrapod]]s than that of the [[teleost]] fishes. Bichirs have a number of other primitive characteristics, including fleshy pectoral fins superficially similar to those of [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fishes]].&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= Wiley, Edward G.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 75–76|isbn= 978-0-12-547665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have a pair of slit-like [[spiracle]]s on the top of their heads that are used to breathe air,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Jeffrey|date=2014|title=Spiracular air breathing in polypterid fishes and its implications for aerial respiration in stem tetrapods|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4022|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=3022|via=Nature|pmid=24451680|doi=10.1038/ncomms4022}}&lt;/ref&gt; two gular plates, and paired ventral [[lung]]s (the left lung shorter than the right).&lt;ref&gt;Berra, Tim M. (2001). Freshwater Fish Distribution. San Diego: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-093156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four pairs of gill arches are present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accessscience.com/content/Polypteriformes/536700 AccessScience | Encyclopedia Article | Polypteriformes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bichirs have a maximum body length ranging from {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} to over {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} depending on specific species and morphology.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

==Diet==
Bichirs are nocturnal and feed on small vertebrates, crustaceans, and insects.&lt;ref name=EoF/&gt;

==Air breathing== 
[[Image:Polypterus ornatipinnis.png|thumb|''[[Polypterus ornatipinnis]]'']]
Bichirs &lt;!--and reedfish --&gt;possess paired [[lungs]] which connect to the esophagus via a [[glottis]]. They are facultative air-breathers, requiring access to surface air to breathe in poorly oxygenated water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their lungs are highly vascularized to facilitate gas exchange. Deoxygenated arterial blood is brought to the lungs by paired pulmonary arteries, which branch from the fourth efferent branchial arteries (artery from the fourth [[gill]] arch), and oxygenated blood leaves the lungs in pulmonary veins. Unlike most [[lungfish]] and [[tetrapods]], their lungs are smooth sacs instead of alveolated tissue. Bichirs&lt;!-- and reedfish --&gt; are unique in that they breathe using recoil aspiration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Graham, J.B. 1997. Air-breathing Fishes: Evolution, diversity, and adaptation. San Diego: Academic Press. 299 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Bichirs appear to prefer breathing air via their spiracles when undisturbed or in extremely shallow waters where they are unable to incline their body enough to breathe air through their mouth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Bichirs as aquarium specimens==
Bichirs are popular subjects of public and large hobby [[aquarium|aquaria]]. They are sometimes called dragon bichir or dragon fin in pet shops for a more appealing name due to their dragon-like appearance. Though predatory, they are otherwise peaceful, preferring to lie on the bottom, and make good tankmates with other species large enough to not be prey. &lt;!--Some aquarists{{Who|date=February 2011}} note that [[Loricariidae|Loricariid]] catfish and common [[Plecostomus]] may attack bichirs and suck on their skin.--&gt; Bichirs in captivity have life expectancies up to 10 years.

'''Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart'''&lt;!-- spelling of his first name varies from story to story, as does the hyphenation of his surname, but the above is the most common spelling, and is used in most reference books and on the BBC's Doctor Who website --&gt;, generally referred to simply as '''the Brigadier''', is a [[fictional character]] in the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', created by writers [[Mervyn Haisman]] and [[Henry Lincoln]] and played by [[Nicholas Courtney]].&lt;ref name="new_novels"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rowe |first=Josiah |date=8 December 2014 |title=Lethbridge-Stewart novel series announced |url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2014/12/lethbridge-stewart-novels-081214132212.html |newspaper=[[Doctor Who News Page]] |accessdate=9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the founders of [[UNIT]] (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, later Unified Intelligence Taskforce), an international organization that defends Earth from [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] threats, and serves as commander of the British contingent.  Presented at first as reluctant to accept the continuing aid of the Doctor, over time the Brigadier became one of the Doctor's greatest friends and his principal ally in defending the Earth.

As one of the series' most prominent recurring characters over its fifty-year history, the Brigadier appeared in 23 stories during the original run of ''Doctor Who'', first appearing in the 1968 serial ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' opposite the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]). The character made frequent appearances on the series following the introduction of the [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]) in 1970's ''[[Spearhead from Space]]''.  His final appearance in the program was in 1989's ''[[Battlefield (Doctor Who)|Battlefield]]'' opposite the [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]). Nearly 20 years later, Courtney reprised the role in the spin-off programme ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Swift |title=Russell T.

That year, ''Doctor Who'' later paid tribute to Courtney by announcing the Brigadier had died with a line of dialogue in "[[The Wedding of River Song]]". Later still, a Cyberman avatar of the Brigadier also appears, and achieves some closure with the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), in "[[Death in Heaven]]" (2014).

The 2012 episode "[[The Power of Three (Doctor Who)|The Power of Three]]" introduced the Brigadier's daughter, new UNIT chief [[List of UNIT personnel#Kate Stewart|Kate Stewart]] ([[Jemma Redgrave]]). The character was originally created in the unlicensed video spin-off ''[[Downtime (Doctor Who)|Downtime]]'' in 1995, in which the Brigadier also appeared. Kate becomes a recurring character making appearances alongside the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]).

==Character history==

Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart's ancestry goes back to Scotland, according to dialogue in ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]'' (1975). He first encounters the [[Second Doctor]] in ''[[The Web of Fear]]'' (1968), when Lethbridge-Stewart is a colonel in the [[Scots Guards]] commanding a [[British Army]] detachment sent to investigate the Yeti in the [[London Underground]]. By his next appearance in ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' (1968), he had been promoted to [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] and was working with UNIT. When the Doctor was [[Third Doctor|forcibly regenerated and exiled to Earth]], Lethbridge-Stewart gave him a position as UNIT's scientific advisor after he helped defeat the [[Auton]] invasion. Other military members of UNIT included [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]], [[Sergeant Benton]] and Royal Navy Lieutenant [[Harry Sullivan (Doctor Who)|Harry Sullivan]].

Most of the [[Third Doctor]] stories were set on Earth and feature UNIT and the Brigadier heavily. While not as ubiquitous in the following years, he appeared alongside every subsequent Doctor in the original television series run, excluding the [[Sixth Doctor]] with whom he appeared only in the 30th anniversary special, ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' in 1993.  Although Lethbridge-Stewart first met the Doctor in his second incarnation, he also met and worked with the [[First Doctor]] in the opening serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 10)|10th anniversary season]], ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' and again in the 20th anniversary special, ''[[The Five Doctors]]''. He eventually retired from the military to teach [[mathematics]] at an English [[public school (England)|public school]] in 1976, as seen in ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983). The Brigadier and the Sixth Doctor, as well as later incarnations of the Doctor, have been paired in numerous spin-off productions (see [[#Other appearances|Other appearances]]).

As one of the most popular [[recurring character|recurring]] [[List of Doctor Who supporting characters|supporting characters in the television series]], the Brigadier is often listed among the Doctor's [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s.&lt;ref name="A Celebration"&gt;{{cite book

Lethbridge-Stewart's last appearance in a ''Doctor Who'' television episode was in 1989, in the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''[[Battlefield (Doctor Who)|Battlefield]]''. Called out of retirement to deal with an other-dimensional invasion of armoured knights led by [[Morgan Le Fay|Morgaine]], he found himself once again at the Doctor's side. Lethbridge-Stewart served as his world's champion as he faced down and killed the demonic [[List of Doctor Who villains#Destroyer|Destroyer of Worlds]] armed only with his service [[revolver]] and a load of [[silver]]-tipped bullets. (''Battlefield'' was stated to be a few years into [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]]'s future but not a specific date. The [[Virgin New Adventures]] books place it in 1997.)

Little was shown of Lethbridge-Stewart's life outside UNIT in the television series. ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' referred to a relationship with a woman called Doris. By ''Battlefield'', he was married to her (played by [[Angela Douglas]]). It was Courtney's own belief that the Brigadier had been in a previous marriage to a woman named Fiona, and that he and Doris were having an affair; his first marriage ended due to his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Briggs|Briggs, Nick]], "Marching in Time," ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]''. #228, 2 August 1995, [[Marvel UK|Marvel Comics UK Ltd.]] p. 37 (interview with N. Courtney). See also the ''Spearhead From Space'' DVD commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lethbridge-Stewart never appeared in the revived series, the character is still alive during the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s tenure. In the spin-off programme ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]'', [[Sarah Jane Smith]] says to "give [her] love to the Brig". In the Tenth Doctor episode "[[The Poison Sky]]", the Doctor mentions that he could use the help of "the Brigadier". He is then told that "Sir Alistair" is "stranded in Peru", indicating that the Brigadier has been [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] by this time. The first film footage from the classic era to appear in the revived era was his photograph displayed in the slow pan across [[Sarah Jane Smith]]'s attic in the opening scene of ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''’ première, ''[[Invasion of the Bane]]''.

In 2008, Courtney again reprised the role in a ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story, ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]'', and confirmed his knighthood repeatedly: Major Kilburne and Sarah Jane each address him as "Sir Alistair" and he later introduces himself fully as "Brigadier Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart" to Mrs. Wormwood. This episode refers back to the Peru mission as there is mention of him being de-briefed about it. Sarah Jane asks Lethbridge-Stewart to assist her in accessing UNIT's "Black Archive", a top secret alien artefact facility first alluded to by Douglas Cavendish to Sir Alistair's daughter in ''[[Dæmos Rising]]''. Sarah Jane prefers to avoid seeking official clearance, to avoid awkward questions about [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]], her artificially-grown son. In his old age, the Brigadier has developed a dislike for the new way UNIT works and often refers to events that happened in "his day". He walks with a walking stick now, but is seen driving a [[Bentley T-series]] to UNIT's "Black Archive". His wife (presumably Doris) is mentioned in this episode. The Brigadier assists Sarah Jane and Rani in escaping UNIT and later confronts a [[Bane (Sarah Jane Adventures)|Bane]] disguised as a UNIT officer, shooting him dead with a gun hidden within his cane.

In ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]'', [[Clyde Langer]] tells Peter Dalton that the Brigadier cannot make it to the wedding because he is back in Peru. It had been intended by the production team that Lethbridge-Stewart would indeed appear in the story and meet the [[Tenth Doctor]], but Courtney was recovering from a stroke and unable to take part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nicholas-courtney-actor-known-for-his-longrunning-role-as-the-brigadier-in-doctor-who-2226111.html|title=Nicholas Courtney: Actor known for his long-running role as the Brigadier in Doctor Who|first=Michael|last=McManus|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is reported to be in Peru for a third time in ''[[Death of the Doctor]]'' (2010). Clyde describes him as being Sarah Jane's oldest friend; Sarah Jane met both the Doctor and Sir Alistair in the first episode of the Third Doctor serial, ''[[The Time Warrior]]'' (1974).

In 2009, Courtney reprised the role for a final time in the short film ''Liberty Hall'', an extra for ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]''{{'}}s DVD release. The film is a seven-minute [[mockumentary]] where a fictional journalist interviews the Brigadier about his life. The Brigadier discusses his marriages with Fiona and Doris, and mentions his daughter Kate and grandson Gordon (referencing ''Downtime''). He states that his most recent encounter with the Doctor took place in 2000, when he was on unofficial UNIT business in Malebolgia in the United States (referencing the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Minuet in Hell]]''). He concludes, "So, now I've hung up my uniform for good... unless I hear that a blue police box has been found somewhere, and then, don't you worry, I'll be ready!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhoreviews.co.uk/6F.htm|work=doctorwhoreviews.co.uk|title=Doctor Who – Mawdryn Undead|last=Wolverson|first=E. G.|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, the Brigadier becomes ill and is moved into a nursing home.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Wedding of River Song]]"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's "[[The Wedding of River Song]]", the [[Eleventh Doctor]] rings the nursing home to have the Brigadier made ready for a trip; a nurse regretfully informs him that the Brigadier died peacefully "a few months ago" and had spoken well of him often, insisting a glass always be kept ready for him in case he turned up. The Doctor is visibly shattered by the news, which forces him to realise that he can't avoid his predestined death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dowel;|first=Ben|title=Doctor Who tribute to Brigadier actor Nicholas Courtney|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/30/doctor-who-tribute-brigadier-actor|accessdate=1 October 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014 episode "[[Death in Heaven]]", Missy (the regenerated female Master) resurrects the Earth's dead as flight-capable Cybermen. The Brigadier's daughter Kate is apparently killed falling from a plane during a Cybermen attack. Overcoming his programming, the converted [[Danny Pink]] commands the Cybermen to sacrifice themselves to thwart Missy's plan. The Doctor prepares to execute Missy, but is preempted by a lone surviving Cyberman, who seemingly vaporizes her with a forearm-mounted ray-gun. Finding that the Cyberman has rescued Kate, the Doctor realizes it is the converted Brigadier, saying "Of course! Earth's darkest hour, and mine. Where else would you be?" Overcome with emotion, the Doctor salutes him – something Kate said her father had always wanted – and the Brigadier fires his leg jets and flies away. What happens to him afterward is left unknown.

In the 2017 Christmas special "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]", the [[First Doctor|First]] and Twelfth Doctors unwittingly intervene when Testimony, an organization in the far future that collect memories from those about to die, retrieve a captain in the First World War from the moment before his death, the temporal anomaly of the two Doctors resisting their imminent regenerations disrupting Testimony's efforts to return the captain to his scheduled death. The Doctors are able to bend the rules and return the captain to a point a couple of hours after he was taken out of time, in time for his life to be saved by the [[Christmas truce]]. Before he returns to time, the captain reveals that his name is Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, suggesting that he is a relative of the Brigadier. (It is confirmed that the character is one of the Brigadier's grandfathers.)

==Other appearances==
The Brigadier and the Sixth Doctor were paired in the two-part charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'' and the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio play, ''[[The Spectre of Lanyon Moor]]''. The Sixth Doctor also meets the Brigadier in the novel ''[[Business Unusual]]'', also purporting to be the first meeting of the two characters, subsequently working together in ''[[The Shadow in the Glass]]'' to track down the newly discovered [[Fourth Reich]]; in the short story "Brief Encounter: A Wee Deoch an..?", written by Sixth Doctor actor [[Colin Baker]] and published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special]]'', 1991, they cross paths but neither realises it. The Brigadier has also appeared with the [[Eighth Doctor]] in the novel ''The Eight Doctors'' by Terrance Dicks (set after the events of the TV Movie and during moments of The Doctors' past lives) in audio plays and the novels ''[[The Dying Days]]'' and ''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]''. The [[Tenth Doctor]] met the Brigadier in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic ''The Warkeeper's Crown''.

The Brigadier and his family have made several appearances in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. The spin-off UNIT videos ''[[Downtime (Doctor Who)|Downtime]]'' and ''[[Dæmos Rising]]'' feature Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, the Brigadier's daughter from his marriage to his first wife, Fiona (first named in the [[Virgin Missing Adventures|Missing Adventure]] ''[[The Scales of Injustice]]'' by [[Gary Russell]]). Also appearing was Kate's young son, Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. Kate also played her UNIT role in the fiftieth anniversary episode, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" (2013).

The novels also gave Lethbridge-Stewart another offspring. While on duty in [[Sierra Leone]] as a young lieutenant, Lethbridge-Stewart met and was intimate with a local girl named Mariatu, the daughter of a village chief, and unknown to Lethbridge-Stewart, she had a son. This was first hinted at in [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s novelisation of his 1988 serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', which featured quotes from a fictional history of UNIT (''The Zen Military'') written by a Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart (Mariatu's granddaughter) in 2006. In the 1992 [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]] novel ''[[Transit (Doctor Who)|Transit]]'' (also by Aaronovitch, and set in the 22nd Century), the Seventh Doctor meets the adopted daughter of General Yembe Lethbridge-Stewart, one of Mariatu's descendants. This daughter, also named [[Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart]], went on to become a recurring character in the New Adventures.

The novels have also fleshed out the Brigadier's ancestry, establishing that he comes from a long-standing military family. In the New Adventures novel ''[[The Dying Days]]'' by [[Lance Parkin]], he talks about three ancestors who reached the rank of [[General officer|general]]. One, William Lethbridge-Stewart, was in the retinue of [[James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. The other two fought at [[Battle of Naseby|Naseby]] and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. ''The Scales of Injustice'' names the latter as Major-General Fergus Lethbridge-Stewart. The Brigadier also says in ''The Dying Days'' that his father died in [[World War II]], fighting alongside [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Field-Marshal Montgomery]] in [[Africa]].

The [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[The Wages of Sin (Doctor Who)|The Wages of Sin]]'' by [[David A. McIntee]] established that the Brigadier had an ancestor named Alastair Lethbridge-Stewart who worked for the British Government in 1916. ''[[Deadly Reunion (Doctor Who)|Deadly Reunion]]'' by [[Terrance Dicks]] and [[Barry Letts]] establishes that the Brigadier was a [[Second Lieutenant]] serving in Army Intelligence in 1944, although this makes the Brigadier older than other stories would suggest.

In the novels, Lethbridge-Stewart emerged from retirement again during the events of ''The Dying Days'' where he dealt with an invasion of [[Ice Warrior]]s from [[Mars]] in 1997. At the end of that novel he was promoted to General. Lethbridge-Stewart was subsequently rejuvenated with alien technology in ''[[Happy Endings (Doctor Who)|Happy Endings]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]], taking place in 2010. The rejuvenated Lethbridge-Stewart, widowed as a result of an accident at sea but back with the military, next appeared in the [[BBC Books]] [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'', also by Cornell, where he still held the rank of General but preferred to be called "the Brigadier". According to ''[[The King of Terror]]'' by Keith Topping, Lethbridge-Stewart eventually passes away in the early 2050s.

Courtney played the Brigadier in two [[BBC Radio 4]] ''Doctor Who'' plays set during the Third Doctor's era, ''[[The Paradise of Death]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Ghosts of N-Space]]'' (1996), alongside Pertwee and [[Elisabeth Sladen]] as [[Sarah Jane Smith]]. For Big Finish, he has played the part of Lethbridge-Stewart in several plays, with ''[[Minuet in Hell]]'' revealing that he played a role in the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and also that he does covert work for the UN as a plausibly deniable agent. He also played an alternate universe version of the Brigadier in the ''[[Doctor Who Unbound]]'' play ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (Doctor Who audio)|Sympathy for the Devil]]'', opposite [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as the Doctor and [[David Tennant]] (later cast as the [[Tenth Doctor]]) as Colonel Brimmecombe-Wood. At the conclusion of ''Sympathy'', the alternate Brigadier- referred to as 'Alistair'- joins Warner's Doctor as his companion, but after an unspecified amount of time travelling together, they part ways in the later audio ''[[Masters of War (audio drama)|Masters of War]]'', when the two arrive on Skaro and force the Daleks and the Thals to join forces to fight off an invasion by a race known as the Quatch, Alistair remaining once the Quatch are defeated to help the two sides maintain their new truce.

Courtney also voiced the Brigadier in the 2001 [[webcast]] ''[[Death Comes to Time]]''.

In December 2004, Big Finish released the first of a series of [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce#Audio plays|UNIT-based audio plays]], where General Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart acted as a consultant to a new generation of officers and by series' end became UNIT's new Scientific Advisor.  If the events in this series are to be reconciled with the books, these plays would seem to take place between the events of ''The Dying Days'' and ''Happy Endings'', as this version of Lethbridge-Stewart does not seem to be rejuvenated. Also, the public does not believe in existence of aliens, which would appear to place it before the events of "[[The Christmas Invasion]]".

In the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip story ''Warkeeper's Crown'' (DWM #378–380), Lethbridge-Stewart made a reappearance alongside the [[Tenth Doctor]] after being kidnapped by Warlords as a tactical commander. He was an old officer stationed at Sandhurst.

A series of novels featuring the young Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart has been published by [[Candy Jar Books]] since 2015. The novels are licensed by the literary estate of co-creator Mervyn Haisman and endorsed by Henry Lincoln.

==References outside of ''Doctor Who''==
The character also appears briefly in a cameo role at the end of writer [[Paul Cornell]]'s [[novelisation]] of the 1997 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] science-fiction serial ''[[The Uninvited (TV series)|The Uninvited]]''. Although the character is not named in the book, the description is that of Lethbridge-Stewart and Cornell later admitted that this was indeed his intention.

[[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' featured an organisation called W.H.O. (the Weird Happenings Organisation) run by a Brigadier [[Alysande Stuart]]. Her twin brother [[Alistaire Stuart|Alistaire]] was WHO's "scientific advisor" (the role the Doctor had in UNIT). A character named "Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart" had earlier appeared in three panels of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #218, supervising the arrest of the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in [[Edinburgh]], where he also calls out to a "Sergeant-Major [[Sergeant Benton|Benton]]" at one point.

The [[Sherlock Holmes]] novel ''Waters of Death'' by [[Kel Richards]] features a naval commander called Ralph Lethbridge-Stewart, alongside Captain [[Harry Sullivan (Doctor Who)|Harry Sullivan]] and Lieutenant Philip [[Sergeant Benton|Benton]]. It is set in the same fictional location as the ''Doctor Who'' story ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]''.

An unnamed army brigadier, who looks and acts very similar to Lethbridge-Stewart, appears in the comic strip ''[[Caballistics, Inc.]]''. He first appeared in the story ''Going Underground'', where he is in charge of the army's response following a demon invasion of the [[London Underground]]; a member of his SAS team refers to "bloody [[Yeti (Doctor Who)|robot yetis]]" having been down there once. He shows up again in the story ''Ashes'', in charge of the military response to a devastating attack on Glasgow. This character is one of several references to both the ''Doctor Who'' universe and other sci-fi/horror properties in ''Caballistics''.

Although unnamed, two characters strongly resembling Lethbridge-Stewart and Sergeant Benton (who was specifically named) appear in the [[John M. Ford]] ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[How Much for Just the Planet?]]'' at a rather treacherous golf course on the planet Direidi.

Similarly to Alysande Stuart, the comic book ''[[Jack Staff]]'' includes Commander Liz Stewart of S.M.I.L.E. (Secret Military Intelligence Lethal Executive).

The Brigadier briefly appears in [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]]'s ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', supporting Britain's involvement in an alternate [[Vietnam War]].

The Brigadier was referenced in name in the [[ABC Family]] show ''[[The Middleman (TV series)|the Middleman]]''. In the episode "The Clotharian Contamination Protocol," Wendy and The Middleman go to check out a returned [[Voyager program|Voyager probe]]. However, a nearby [[NASA]] listening station team also arrives.  Using their random IDs, and due to the quick thinking of the Middleman, they are intimidated into leaving. As they go, the Middleman calls out the other team's lead, "Mr... Lethbridge-Stewart, if that is your real name!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10266">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Iraq]]'''.

It was commonly used by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]]; and has been since his removal from office. After the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, U.S. administrator, [[L. Paul Bremer]], suspended capital punishment on June 10, declaring that "the former regime used certain provisions of the penal code as a means of oppression, in violation of internationally acknowledged human rights."&lt;ref name="AIUSAreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGNAU200903209818&amp;lang=e|title=Scores face execution in Iraq six years after invasion|date=2009-03-20|publisher=[[Amnesty International USA]]|accessdate=2009-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513021829/http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGNAU200903209818&amp;lang=e|archive-date=2009-05-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2004, capital punishment was reinstated in Iraq.&lt;ref name="AIUSAreport"/&gt; Iraqi law states that no person over the age of 70 can be executed, despite people like [[Tariq Aziz]], sentenced to death at the age of 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/12/4/105110.shtml?s=i | title = Saddam May Escape Hangman's Noose | work = NewsMax.com |date= 2006-12-04 | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an automatic right to appeal on all such sentences. Iraqi Law requires execution within 30 days of all legal avenues being exhausted. The last legal step, before the execution proceeds, is for the condemned to be handed a ''red card''. This is completed by an official of the court with details of the judgment and a notice that execution is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/29/news/saddam.php | title = Iraq is preparing for Saddam's hanging | work = [[International Herald Tribune]] |date= 2006-12-29 | accessdate = 2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, three murderers were the first people to be executed since the restoration. Then on March 9, 2006, an official of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council confirmed that Iraqi authorities had executed the first [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgent]]s by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiwar.com/ips/conley.php?articleid=8855 Capital Punishment in Iraq Seen Simply As Death, Not Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

27 people, including one woman, were executed by the Iraqi government on September 6, 2006, for high crimes against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/06/iraq.main/index.html | title = Iraq has months to avert collapse | work = [[CNN]] |date= 2006-09-06 | accessdate = 2006-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2012, 34 people were executed in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41019&lt;/ref&gt; Early in October 2013, 42 people convicted of terrorism charges were hanged over the course of two days. By that date a total of 132 people had been executed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://jordantimes.com/iraq-hangs-42-convicted-on-terrorism-charges |title=Iraq hangs 42 convicted on terrorism charges |publisher=The Jordan Times |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012075025/http://jordantimes.com/iraq-hangs-42-convicted-on-terrorism-charges |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Iraqi Prime Minister [[Haider al-Abadi|Haider Al-Abadi]] ordered the execution of all terrorists condemned in the country following the [[July 2016 Baghdad bombings|Baghdad suicide truck bombing]] which killed over 250 people at a mall in [[Karrada]], [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.neweurope.eu/article/pm-iraq-orders-immediate-execution-convicted-terrorists/ | title = PM of Iraq orders immediate execution of convicted terrorists | publisher = neweurope.eu | accessdate =8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq carried out at least 88 executions in 2016, and at least 125 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Death sentences and executions in 2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/ |publisher=  amnesty.org|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] in [[Mosul]] in 2017, Iraq tried and sentenced captured terrorists to death in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41110412&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable executions==
{{main|Execution of Saddam Hussein}}
Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for [[crimes against humanity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/05/dujail.saddam/index.html |title=Saddam Hussein sentenced to death by hanging |publisher=CNN.com |date=2006-11-05 |accessdate=2006-11-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113081326/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/05/dujail.saddam/index.html |archivedate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 5, 2006, and was executed on December 30, 2006 at approximately 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time. During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken, a successful example of a [[Hanging|long drop hanging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272610730.shtml | title = Saddam Hussein Hanging Video Shows Defiance, Taunts and Glee | work = [[National Ledger]] | date = 2007-01-01 | accessdate = 2007-01-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070120132227/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272610730.shtml | archive-date = 2007-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], the head of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's security agency, and [[Awad Hamed al-Bandar]], former chief judge, were executed on January 15, 2007, also by the long drop method, but Barzan was decapitated by the rope at the end of his fall indicating that the drop was too long, relative to his body weight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bostonherald.com/international/view.bg?articleid=177248&amp;format=&amp;page=1 AP: Saddam’s half brother and ex-official hanged]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, former vice-president [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] had been sentenced to life in prison on November 5, 2006, but the sentence was changed to death by hanging on February 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6354205.stm Top Saddam aide sentenced to hang] February 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth and final man to be executed for the 1982 crimes against humanity on March 20, 2007.

At the Anfal genocide trial, Saddam's cousin [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]] (aka Chemical Ali), former defense minister [[Sultan Hashim Ahmed]] al-Tay, and former deputy Hussein Rashid Mohammed were sentenced to hang for their role in the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] against the Kurds on June 24, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19394865/ Iraq's "Chemical Ali" sentenced to death], ''MSNBC.com'', June 24, 2007.

On July 14, 2011, Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tay and two of Saddam's half-brothers -- [[Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] and [[Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti]] (both condemned to death on March 11, 2009 for the role in the executions of 42 traders who were accused of manipulating food prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/03/11/saddam-aziz.html | work=CBC News | title=Saddam's deputy PM Tariq Aziz gets 15-year prison sentence | date=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) -- were handed over to the Iraqi authorities for execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/15/us-iraq-usa-prison-idUSTRE76E2CR20110715?feedType=RSS&amp;amp|title=U.S. turns Saddam's half-brothers over to Iraq|accessdate=17 July 2011|work=Reuters|date=15 July 2011|first=Khalid|last=al-Ansary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir Cloudesley Shovell''' (c. November 1650 – 22 October or 23 October 1707) was an [[England|English]] naval officer. As a junior officer he saw action at the [[Battle of Solebay]] and then at the [[Battle of Texel]] during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]. As a captain he fought at the [[Battle of Bantry Bay]] during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]].

As a flag officer Shovell commanded a division at the [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of Barfleur]] during the [[Nine Years' War]] and during the battle distinguished himself by being the first to break through the enemy's line. Along with Admiral [[Henry Killigrew (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Killigrew]] and Admiral [[Ralph Delaval]], Shovell was put in joint command of the fleet shortly afterwards.

During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] Shovell commanded a squadron which served under Admiral [[George Rooke]] at the [[capture of Gibraltar]] and the [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Battle of Málaga]]. Working in conjunction with a landing force under the [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Earl of Peterborough]] his forces undertook the siege and [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|capture of Barcelona]]. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Navy while at Lisbon the following year. He also commanded the naval element of a combined [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|attack on Toulon]], base of the main French fleet, in coordination with the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] army under [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in the summer of 1707. His life was brought to an end in a [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707|disastrous shipwreck in the Isles of Scilly]] later that year. He also served as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Rochester (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochester]] from 1695 to 1701 and from 1705 until his death in 1707.

==Early career==
[[File:De Velde, Battle Of Solebay.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Sole Bay]], 28 May 1672.]]

Born in [[Cockthorpe, Norfolk|Cockthorpe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shovell1714.crayfordhistory.co.uk/online-exhibition/lord-manor-of-crayford/ |title=Sir Cloudesley Shovell - Lord of the Manor of Crayford|accessdate= 2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of John Shovell, a [[Norfolk]] gentleman, and Anne Shovell (née Jenkinson), Shovell was born into a family 'of property and distinction'&lt;ref&gt;Le Fevre and Harding, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; which, although not poor, was by no means wealthy.&lt;ref name=royalnavalmuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_cloudesley_shovell.htm |title=Biography: Cloudesley Shovell |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |date= |accessdate=24 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709011100/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_cloudesley_shovell.htm |archivedate=9 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusual first name of Cloudesley derives from the surname of his maternal grandmother Lucy Cloudisley, who was the daughter of Thomas Cloudisley.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25470|title=Cloudesley Shovell |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to sea as a [[cabin boy]] in the care of a paternal relative, Admiral [[Christopher Myngs|Sir Christopher Myngs]], in 1663. After Myngs' death he remained at sea in the care of Admiral [[John Narborough|Sir John Narborough]]. Promoted to [[midshipman]] on 22 January 1672, he was assigned to the [[first-rate]] [[HMS Prince (1670)|HMS ''Royal Prince'']], flagship of the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], and saw action when a combined British and French fleet was surprised and attacked by the Dutch, led by Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], at the [[Battle of Solebay]] off the Suffolk coast in May 1672, during the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Promoted to [[master's mate]] on 17 September 1672, Shovell transferred to the [[third-rate]] [[HMS Fairfax (1660)|HMS ''Fairfax'']] later that month and then moved to the third-rate [[HMS Henrietta (1654)|HMS ''Henrietta'']] in November 1672. He saw action again when a combined British and French fleet attempting to land troops in the Netherlands was repelled by a smaller Dutch force, again led by Admiral de Ruyter, at the [[Battle of Texel]] in August 1673.&lt;ref name=royalnavalmuseum/&gt; Promoted to [[lieutenant]] on 25 September 1673, he transferred to the third-rate [[HMS Harwich (1674)|HMS ''Harwich'']] in 1675 and took part in an action against the pirate stronghold at [[Tripoli]]. Shovell led a surprise attack on the pirates, sinking a number of their ships in January 1676. For this action he received the sum of £80 from Narborough. Two months later he undertook a second raid against the pirates, for which he was awarded a gold medal from [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. In a letter from the Admiralty, [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded the King's satisfaction with Shovell’s actions; he transferred to the third-rate [[HMS Plymouth (1653)|HMS ''Plymouth'']] in May 1677 and was sent to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

[[File:Bataille de Bantry Bay (1689).png|thumb|left|[[Battle of Bantry Bay]], 11 May 1689.]]
Promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] 17 September 1677, Shovell was given command of the [[fifth-rate]] [[HMS Sapphire (1675)|HMS ''Sapphire'']]. He transferred to the fourth-rate [[HMS Phoenix (1671)|HMS ''Phoenix'']] in April 1679 and returned to HMS ''Sapphire'' in May 1679 before transferring to the fifth-rate [[HMS Nonsuch (1668)|HMS ''Nonsuch'']] in July 1680. He returned to HMS ''Sapphire'' again in September 1680 and then transferred to the sixth-rate [[HMS James Galley|HMS ''James Galley'']] in April 1681, to the third-rate [[HMS Anne (1678)|HMS ''Anne'']] in April 1687 and to the fourth-rate [[HMS Dover (1654)|HMS ''Dover'']] in April 1688. Throughout this period Shovell was engaged in the defence of [[Tangier]] from [[Salé]] raiders.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

Shovell transferred to the command of the third-rate [[HMS Edgar (1668)|HMS ''Edgar'']] in April 1689 and saw action at the [[Battle of Bantry Bay]] in May 1689, when a French fleet tried to land troops in Southern Ireland to fight [[William III of England|Prince William of Orange]] during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]]. After the battle, Commodore [[John Ashby (Royal Navy officer)|John Ashby]] and Shovell were [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. He transferred to the third-rate [[HMS Monck (1659)|HMS ''Monck'']] in October 1689 and ordered to patrol the area between Ireland and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. In June 1690 he was commodore of a small squadron, which convoyed King William across [[St George's Channel]] to [[Carrickfergus]].&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

==Senior command==
[[File:Paton, Battle of Barfleur.jpg|thumb|[[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of Barfleur]], 19 May 1692.]]
Promoted to [[rear-admiral]] on 3 June 1690, Shovell hoisted his flag in the first-rate [[HMS Prince (1670)|HMS ''Royal William'']]. He provided naval support for [[Percy Kirke]]'s [[Capture of Waterford]] in July 1690. He commanded a division of the Red squadron at the [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue]] in May 1692, in which [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Russell's]] Anglo-Dutch fleet intercepted and defeated the French fleet under [[Anne Hilarion de Tourville|Tourville]], on its way along the Channel to provide an escort for an invasion of England. At [[Action at Barfleur|Barfleur]] Shovell's flagship was the first ship to break through the enemy's line, and in the latter stages of the battle he organised a fireship attack. He received a wound in the thigh during the action, which later incapacitated him during preparations for the attack which destroyed the French ships that had taken refuge at [[Action at La Hogue (1692)|La Hogue]]. Along with Admirals [[Henry Killigrew (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Killigrew]] and [[Ralph Delaval]], Shovell was put in joint command of the fleet in January 1693. After the [[Battle of the Smyrna Convoy|disastrous attack]] on the [[Smyrna]] convoy off [[Lagos, Portugal]], in June 1693, all three admirals were dismissed from their joint command. Promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 16 April 1694, Shovell commanded a squadron on expeditions to [[Dieppe]] and [[Dunkirk]], later in the year.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

Shovell set up residence with his wife at May Place in [[Crayford]] in 1694 and was elected [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Rochester (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochester]] in 1695.&lt;ref name=parl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/shovell-sir-clowdesley-1650-1707|title=Shovell, Sir Clowdesley (1650-1707), of Soho Square, London and May Place, Crayford, Kent|publisher= History of Parliament|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was responsible for the restoration of St.&amp;nbsp;Paulinus' Church in Crayford and was a great benefactor to [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], providing at his own expense the fine decorated plaster ceilings in the Guildhall and the market bell, clock and decorated brick facade for the Butchers' Market (now the Corn Exchange).&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Thomas, E.O., ''Slade Green and the Crayford Marshes'', Bexley Education and Leisure Services Directorate, 2001, {{ISBN|0-902541-55-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medway.gov.uk/leisurecultureandsport/localhistoryandarchives/museums/guildhallmuseum.aspx|title=Guilfhall Museum|publisher=Medway Council|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Commissioner of the Sewers, responsible for the upkeep of the embankments of the [[River Thames|Thames]] between [[Deptford]] and [[Gravesend]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; He did not stand for re-election to Parliament in December 1701.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;

==War of the Spanish Succession==
[[File:May Place, Crayford.jpg|thumb|May Place, [[Crayford]] where Shovell lived]]
Promoted to full [[admiral]] on 6 May 1702, Shovell brought home the spoils of the French and Spanish fleets, which had been captured by Admiral [[George Rooke]] at the [[Battle of Vigo Bay|Battle of Vigo]] at an early stage of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], arriving in England in late 1702. After commanding a fleet dispatched to take troops to [[Lisbon]] in Spring 1703, he commanded a squadron which served under Rooke at the [[capture of Gibraltar]] in August 1704 and also repulsed the French fleet at the [[Battle of Málaga (1704)|Battle of Málaga]] later that month. He was appointed a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral (an office vested at that time in [[Prince George of Denmark]]) in December 1704, appointed [[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom|Rear-Admiral of England]] on 26 December 1704 and promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] on 13 January 1705.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=parl/&gt;

He was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester again in 1705.&lt;ref name=parl/&gt; Working in conjunction with a landing force under the [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Earl of Peterborough]] his forces undertook the siege and [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|capture of Barcelona]] in September 1705. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Navy while at Lisbon in November 1706.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt; He commanded the naval element of a combined [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|attack on Toulon]], base of the main French fleet, in coordination with the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] army under [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in the summer of 1707. The allies failed to capture the city, but bombardment by Shovell's forces panicked the French into scuttling their own fleet. Shovell was subsequently ordered to bring his fleet home in late October 1707.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

==Death in the Scilly naval disaster==

[[File:Cloudesleyshovellmemorial.jpg|thumb|Shovell's monument in [[Westminster Abbey]] by [[Grinling Gibbons]]]]
While returning with the fleet to England after the campaign at Toulon, Shovell's flagship, the second-rate [[HMS Association (1697)|HMS ''Association'']], struck the rocks near the Isles of Scilly at 8&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 October (2 November, by the [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]]) 1707. HMS ''Association'' went down in three or four minutes, with none of the 800&amp;nbsp;men that were on board saved, according to sailors watching on the first-rate [[HMS Charles (1668)|HMS ''St George'']]. Four large ships, HMS ''Association'', the third-rate [[HMS Eagle (1679)|HMS ''Eagle'']], the fourth-rate [[HMS Romney (1694)|HMS ''Romney'']] and the [[fire ship]] [[HMS Firebrand (1694)|HMS ''Firebrand'']] all sank.&lt;ref name="Sobel, p. 6"&gt;Sobel, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

With nearly 2,000 sailors lost that night, the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707|Scilly naval disaster]] was recorded as one of the greatest [[sea|maritime]] [[List of disasters in Great Britain and Ireland by death toll|disasters in British history]].&lt;ref name="Sobel, p. 6"/&gt; The cause of the disaster has often been represented as the [[navigator]]s' inability accurately to calculate their [[longitude]], although no public discussion of the events specifically raising the question of longitude is known, prior to a pamphlet published on the eve of Parliament's vote on the [[Longitude Act]], seven years later.&lt;ref name=sobel11&gt;Sobel, p. 11–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last= Dunn|date=27 October 2014|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/longitude/2014/10/27/1707-isles-of-scilly-disaster-part-2/ |title=The 1707 Isles of Scilly Disaster – Part 2|publisher= Board of Longitude Project, [[Royal Museums Greenwich]]|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shovell's body and those of both his stepsons were all found in [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly#Porthellick Cove|Porthellick Cove]] on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], almost {{convert|7|mi|km}} from where his ship was wrecked. It was possible that Shovell left his flagship in one of its boats along with his two stepsons and the captain of HMS ''Association'', Edmund Loades, and that they were drowned while trying to get to shore.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

Shovell's body was identified by the [[purser]] of the third-rate [[HMS Warspite (1758)|HMS ''Arundel'']] who knew the admiral well. It was identified by "a black mole under his left ear, also by the first joint of one of his forefingers being broken inwards. He had likewise a shot in his right arm, another in his left thigh".&lt;ref name=cooke&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooke|first=James|title=Shipwreck of Sir Cloudesley Shovel|publisher=Society of Antiquaries|year=1883|url=http://www.hmssurprise.org/shipwreck-sir-cloudesley-shovell|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shovell was temporarily buried on the beach at Porthellick Cove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.submerged.co.uk/association.php| title=Sir Clowdisley Shovell and The Association|publisher=Submerged|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By order of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] the body was later exhumed and brought back in the fourth-rate [[HMS Salisbury (1707)|HMS ''Salisbury'']] to [[Plymouth]], where it was embalmed by [[James Yonge (surgeon)|Dr James Yonge]]. It was later carried in state to London. During the journey from the [[West Country]], large crowds turned out to pay their respects. He was interred in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 22 December 1707: his large marble monument in the [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials#South Choir Aisle|south choir aisle]] was sculpted by [[Grinling Gibbons]].&lt;ref name="westminster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/sir-clowdisley-shovell|title=Sir Clowdisley Shovell's tomb and memorial in Westminster Abbey|publisher=Westminster Abbey|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, his two stepsons were buried in [[Old Town, Isles of Scilly|Old Town]] Church on St Mary’s.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;

Local legend has it that Shovell was alive, at least barely, when he reached the shore of Scilly at Porthellick Cove but was murdered by a woman for the sake of his priceless [[emerald]] ring, which had been given to him by a close friend, Captain [[James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley|James Lord Dursley]]. At that time, the Scillies had a wild and lawless reputation. It is claimed that the murder came to light only some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, confessed to a clergyman to having killed the admiral and produced the stolen ring, which was sent back to Dursley.&lt;ref name="royalnavalmuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sobel11/&gt; Several historians doubt the murder story as there is no indication that the ring was recovered and the legend stems from a romantic and unverifiable deathbed confession.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, p. 333–336&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend alleges that a common sailor on the flagship tried to warn Shovell that the fleet was off course but Shovell had him hanged at the yardarm for inciting [[mutiny]]. The story first appeared in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native, who recognized the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the admiral.&lt;ref name=cooke/&gt; While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel's location and feared for its fate (such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by [[Samuel Pepys]] in 1684), the story has been repeatedly discredited by naval scholars, who noted the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents, its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins.&lt;ref name=cooke/&gt; After his death Shovell became a popular British hero.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, p. 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1691 Shovell married Elizabeth, Lady Narborough (née Hill), the widow of his former commander, Rear Admiral Sir [[John Narborough]]. Through her, he had two stepsons (Sir John Narborough, 1st Baronet, and James Narborough) who both entered naval careers and died aged 23 and 22, at the sinking of HMS ''Association'' in October 1707.&lt;ref name=cooke/&gt; Shovell and his wife also had two daughters: Elizabeth and Anne. Elizabeth married [[Robert Marsham, 1st Baron Romney|Lord Romney]], whilst Anne married [[John Blackwood (art dealer)|John Blackwood]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

Apart from that, rough [[set theory]] may be used for encoding knowledge in the weights better and also [[genetic algorithms]] may be used to optimize the search solutions better. Symbolic reasoning methods may also be incorporated (see [[hybrid intelligent system]]). (Also see  [[expert system]],  [[neural network]], [[clinical decision support system]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Cruel and unusual punishment''' is a phrase describing [[punishment]] that is considered unacceptable due to the [[suffering]], [[pain]], or [[humiliation]] it inflicts on the person subjected to it.

There are generally tests that can serve as a guide to what cruel and unusual punishment is according to various legal textbooks in accordance with the law.  These are:
#overall acceptance in society,
#severity (the punishment fits the crime), and
#if the punishment is arbitrary.

==History==
These exact words were first used in the [[England|English]] [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown.... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later also adopted in the United States by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (ratified 1791) and in the [[British Leeward Islands]] (1798). Very similar words, "No one shall be subjected to [[torture]] or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment", appear in Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 10, 1948. The right under a different formulation is also found in [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (1950) and in Article 7 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966). The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) also contains this fundamental right in [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] and it is to be found in Article 4 (quoting the European Convention verbatim) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] (2000). It is also found in Article 16 of the [[Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (1984), and in Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Poland]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Poland/Chapter 2|Constitution of Poland, Chapter 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the [[Marshall Islands]], in the sixth section of its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] (Article 2), prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment", which it defines as: the [[death penalty]]; torture; "inhuman and degrading treatment"; and "[[excessive fines]] or deprivations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ Constitution of the Marshall Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102080552/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ |date=2011-01-02 }}, art.II, s.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted." The general principles the [[United States Supreme Court]] relied on to decide whether or not a particular punishment was cruel and unusual were determined by [[William J. Brennan|Justice William Brennan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Palmer, Jr. |first= Louis J. |title= Organ Transplants from Executed Prisoners: An Argument for the Creation of Death Sentence Organ Removal Statutes |page= 80 |publisher= Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub |date=July 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7864-0673-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CCZ2SlSBRbQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=cruel+and+unusual+punishment+less+severe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p5tD3Dg1Ij&amp;sig=7FT7JEB55ZpJZWs7RmLMYWQS6Qo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I6AHT5z1IcStsgbq7K2DDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment%20less%20severe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|408|238|1972}}, Justice Brennan wrote, "There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'."
* The "essential predicate" is "that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity," especially [[torture]].
* "A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion." (''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' temporarily suspended [[capital punishment]] for this reason.)
* "A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society."
* "A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary."

And he added: "The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide means by which a court can determine whether a challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is "cruel and unusual." The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes."

Continuing, he wrote that he expected that no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a "cumulative" analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way the United States Supreme Court "set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [,if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |author=the International Justice Project |title=Seminal Cases - Brief Bank &amp; General Resources - the International Justice Project |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802122705/http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital punishment==

There is great discussion as to whether [[capital punishment]] is cruel and unusual. Common arguments are that capital punishment is more expensive when factoring in [[appeal]]s versus [[life in prison]], and that the government has been wrong before on death penalty cases (therefore, the government could be wrong again, and the government ought not have the authority to end a life). These two arguments alone may or may not qualify under the tests the government puts forth, which could also be considered arbitrary itself, especially if society is not informed enough on these considerable facts. For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often deliberately cruel and painful. Severe historical execution methods include the [[breaking wheel]], [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], [[mazzatello]], [[boiling to death]], [[death by burning]], [[execution by drowning]], death by starvation, [[immurement]], [[flaying]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[execution by elephant]], [[keelhauling]], [[stoning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[scaphism]], [[slow slicing]], [[blood eagle]], [[bamboo torture]] and [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Michael Portillo]] on the show ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' argued that in ensuring an execution is not of a cruel and unusual nature, the following criteria must be met:
* Death should be quick and painless to prevent suffering for the person being executed.
* [[Medical education]] should be provided to the [[executioner]] to prevent suffering caused by error.
* The death should not be gory (to prevent suffering for those carrying out the execution).
* No co-operation should be required from the person being executed, to prevent inaction, distress, and/or suffering caused by the prisoner being required to participate in his own execution.

The show argued that [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] appears to meet the criteria, by way of applying a combination of the gases [[argon]] and [[nitrogen]], as the person being executed would not feel any physical pain but would experience a euphoric state. It was further argued that these gases could be applied cheaply and efficiently by restraining the prisoner by way of [[physical restraints]] and mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/executions/lethal_injection/|title=BBC - Horizon - How to Kill a Human Being|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''discharge''' is a type of sentence where no punishment is imposed, and which (by law in some Commonwealth realms, and arguably in others) vitiates the court's guilty verdict, thus resulting in a non-conviction. 

An '''absolute discharge''' is an unconditional discharge where the Court finds that a crime has technically been committed, but that any punishment of the defendant would be inappropriate, and the case is closed.  In some jurisdictions, an absolute discharge means there is no conviction on the defendant's record, despite the plea of the defendant.

A '''conditional discharge''' is an order made by a criminal court whereby an offender will not be sentenced for an offence unless a further offence is committed within a stated period. Once the stated period has elapsed and no further offence is committed then the conviction may be removed from the defendant's record.

==Australia==
In Australia, offenders can be discharged with or without being convicted, and with or without being placed on a good behaviour bond (or other conditions). These sentencing options vary from state to state. Note that defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime.

== Canada ==
In [[Canada]], a conditional discharge is a [[sentence (law)|sentence]] passed in criminal court in which an individual is found guilty of an offence but is deemed not to have been convicted. Although a discharge is not considered a conviction, a record of an absolute or conditional discharge is kept by [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] (CPIC) and by the charging police agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C33.htm#cond |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231203343/http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/C33.htm |archivedate=2011-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is purged from the individual's police record after a period of time: one year in the case of an absolute discharge, three years for a conditional one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cr-cj/pp-er-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Criminal Records Act]] states that, except in exceptional circumstances, if the discharge is conditional, no record may be disclosed after three years. While no conviction occurs, the offender is required to fulfill certain conditions as part of the sentence. The offender is put on [[probation]] for a period of up to three years. If the offender fails to meet the conditions of the probation, or commits another criminal offence during the probation period, they may be returned to court where the discharge is cancelled and receive a criminal conviction and sentence on the original offence, and for breach of probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpss.jus.gov.on.ca/english/corr_serv/comm_corr/probation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conditions of the discharge are met it becomes an absolute discharge.

A court may grant a conditional or absolute discharge only for offences with no minimum penalty, and a maximum penalty of less than fourteen years.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, offenders can be "convicted and discharged" (gets a criminal record, but no other punishment) or "discharged without conviction" (no punishment and no criminal record). Note that defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime. This is usually done in cases where the negative impact of a conviction far outweigh the crime committed. For example, if a high-end businessman is caught in possession of a small quantity of [[marijuana]], due to the small nature of the crime compared to the effects a conviction (even without a sentence) would have, he may be discharged without conviction.

== United Kingdom ==

===England and Wales===
In [[England and Wales]], a conditional discharge is a sentence vitiating the finding of guilt, in which the offender receives no punishment provided that, in a period set by the court (not more than three years), no further offence is committed. If an offence is committed in that time, then the offender may also be re-sentenced for the offence for which a conditional discharge was given. Pursuant section 14 of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm#14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522020716/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm |archivedate=2007-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and R v Patel [2006] EWCA Crim 2689&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2006/2689.html R v Patel (2006) EWCA Crim 2689 on Bailii]&lt;/ref&gt; the conditional discharge does not constitute a conviction unless the individual breaches the conditional discharge and is re-sentenced.

Absolute discharge is a lesser sentence imposed by a court, in which no penalty is imposed at all. Exceptionally, however, a court occasionally grants an absolute discharge for a very serious offence. (The signalman in the [[Thirsk rail crash (1892)|Thirsk rail crash]], who was found guilty of manslaughter, is an example of this.) This usually signifies that while a crime may technically have been committed, the imposition of any punishment would, in the opinion of the judge or magistrates, be inappropriate.

In both cases, the passing of a discharge does not prevent the court from ordering the defendant to pay compensation to a victim, to pay a contribution towards the prosecution's costs, or to be disqualified from driving. A court may grant a discharge only if it is "inexpedient to inflict punishment", and may not do so for certain firearms offences or [[Mandatory sentencing#Three strikes law|"three strikes"]] offenders. The law on discharges is set out in sections 12 to 15 of the [[Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm#12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910033611/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00006--c.htm |archivedate=2006-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 9,734 offenders were given absolute discharges (0.7% of sentences) and 87,722 offenders were given conditional discharges (6% of sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discharges |url=http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/sentencing/discharges.htm |publisher=Sentencing Council |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928091207/http://sentencingcouncil.judiciary.gov.uk/sentencing/discharges.htm |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===

In [[Scots law]], there is no conditional discharge similar to that in England and Wales, although [[admonition]] has a similar effect with a conviction recorded although there is no punishment. However, section 246 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]] provides that in dealing with cases other than where the sentence is fixed by law (e.g. murder)

*In cases on [[indictment]], if it appears to the court, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate it may instead of sentencing him make an order discharging him absolutely.
*In summary cases, where the court is satisfied that the person committed the offence, and it is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate may without proceeding to conviction make an order discharging him absolutely.

Section 247 further provides that an absolute discharge shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of laying it before a court as a previous conviction in subsequent proceedings for another offence, and shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any enactment which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability. However, courts can consider previous absolute discharges in the same way as they consider previous convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950046_en_19#pt11-pb9-l1g246 Sections 246 and 247 of the 1995 Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625185149/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/ukpga_19950046_en_19#pt11-pb9-l1g246 |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The concept of absolute or conditional discharge does not exist, as such, in United States law. However, different jurisdictions within the United States have a variety of analogues. The most direct is the [[suspended sentence]] or sentencing to "time served", meaning time spent in custody until sentencing. Many or most states also have alternative forms of adjudication for which a defendant may apply. These measures are typically available only to first offenders facing non-felony charges, and typically exclude certain types of charges, depending on the state. Such possibilities often include a guilty plea followed by a special form of probation, upon successful completion of which the public record of the case is sealed and the offender's criminal record expunged.

'''Elvira Fernández de Córdoba y Manrique''' (died 1524) was a Spanish noblewoman, the only surviving daughter of [[Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba]], a Spanish general involved with the [[Italian Wars]] and [[viceroy of Naples]] from 1503 to 1507.

In 1518 she married a cousin, Luis Fernández de Córdoba.

Elvira Fernández de Córdoba y [[Manrique de Lara|Manrique]] died quite young in childbirth in 1524, and her husband Luis, also quite young, in Rome, Italy, in 1526.

'''Enguerrand III de Boves, Lord of Coucy''' (c.1182&amp;ndash;1242) was the eldest son and successor of [[Ralph I, Lord of Coucy]] (c. 1134 – 1191) and Alix de Dreux.&lt;ref name="Pollock145"&gt;M. A. Pollock, ''Scotland, England and France After the Loss of Normandy, 1204-1296: Auld Amitie''. Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2015. pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  He succeeded as Lord of [[Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique|Coucy]] (''sieur de Couci'') in 1191, and held it until his death; he was also lord of [[Marle, Aisne|Marle]] and [[Boves, Somme|Boves]].

==Biography==
Enguerrand III was born in Marle, [[Picardy]], France.  He became one of the most ambitious and powerful of all the French nobles, called by one historian "the greatest baron in all Picardy",&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brown, ''The Wars of Scotland, 1214-1371''. Edinburgh University Press, 2004. pg. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and earning himself his epithet, ''Enguerrand le Grand'', or Enguerrand "the Great".

Enguerrand had an illustrious military career, helping King [[Philip II of France]] reduce the French territories of the King of England. Enguerrand campaigned in [[Anjou]] in 1205, and in 1214, fought in the French victory over an Anglo-German alliance at the [[Battle of Bouvines]]. His arms at [[Bouvines]] were blazoned: ''Barry of six vair and gules.'' He was a notable member of the French force which invaded the [[Kingdom of England]] (1216–1217) to depose [[John of England|King John]]. He also participated in the [[Albigensian Crusade]].

After the death of King [[Louis VIII of France]], Enguerrand was chief among the nobles who resisted the regency of [[Blanche of Castile]] for her son [[Louis IX of France]], although he eventually returned to the royal favour. Enguerrand made his mark on the Picardy landscape by constructing [[Château de Coucy|Coucy Castle]].  

Enguerrand is said by tradition to have started the famous rhyme associated with his successors:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|''Je suis ni roi, ni prince aussi: Je suis le seigneur de Coucy!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''
|Neither king nor prince am I: I am the Lord of Coucy!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Relations==
Through his mother Alix de Dreux, Enguerrand III was related to King [[Louis IX of France]]. Enguerrand also married into the family of King [[Henry III of England]], taking as his second wife the latter king's cousin, who was the granddaughter of King [[Henry II of England]]. He married three times.

His first wife was Beatrice de Vignory,&lt;ref name="Pollock145" /&gt; widow of [[List of counts of Roucy#House of Montdidier|John I, Count of Roucy]] (1196–1200). They married in 1201. There are no known children from this marriage.

His second wife was Matilda (or Richenza) of Bavaria (1172–1209),&lt;ref name="Pollock145" /&gt; a daughter of [[Henry the Lion]], Duke of Bavaria and Saxony, by his second wife, [[Matilda of England]], daughter of King Henry II. Matilda of Bavaria was thus also the niece of King [[Richard the Lion-hearted]]. This marriage took place in 1204. There are no known children from this marriage.

His third wife was [[Marie de Montmirail]] ([[:fr:Marie_de_Montmirail|fr]]), daughter of [[Jean de Montmirail|Jean de Montmirail, Lord of Condé]] .&lt;ref&gt;('''FR''')Dominique Barthélemy (1984) ''Les deux âges de la seigneurie banale''.
 Publications de la Sorbonne. p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 12th century, Enguerrand built the original [[Château de Condé]] in [[Condé-en-Brie|Condé]], Picardy, constructed as a "keep" which had 2 meters thick walls and towering chimneys. Enguerrand and Marie had five children:
* [[Raoul II, Lord of Coucy]], married [[Philippe of Dammartin]], the daughter of [[Simon, Count of Ponthieu|Simon of Dammartin, Count of Ponthieu]].&lt;ref name="Pollock145" /&gt;
* [[Enguerrand IV, Lord of Coucy]], married 1) Margaret of Gueldres, daughter of [[Otto II, Count of Guelders]], and 2) Joan of Flanders, daughter of [[Robert III, Count of Flanders]].&lt;ref name="Pollock145" /&gt;
* John de Coucy, Lord of Amboise (d.1245)&lt;ref name="Pollock145" /&gt;
* [[Marie de Coucy]], married King [[Alexander II of Scotland]].
* Alix de Coucy, married Arnold III, Count of Guînes (1233-1283).  Their son, [[Enguerrand V, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand V]], inherited the title [[Lords of Coucy|Lord of Coucy]], after his uncles passed away.&lt;ref&gt;Du Chesne, A. (1631) ''Preuves de l’Histoire des maisons de Guines, d’Ardres, Gand et Coucy''. Paris, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1242, Enguerrand III died by falling off of his horse onto his sword at [[Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique|Coucy]], Picardy. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Raoul II.

[[File:Pairwise coevolution.svg|right|thumb|'''Pairwise coevolution'''
When [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] received an [[Angraecum sesquipedale|orchid]] from [[Madagascar]] whose [[nectary]] was one and a half feet long, he surmised that there must be a [[pollinator]] [[moth]] with a [[proboscis]] long enough to reach the nectar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kritsky | first1 = G | year = 1991 | title = Darwin's Madagascan Hawk Moth prediction | url = | journal = American Entomologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 206–209 | doi=10.1093/ae/37.4.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its attempt to get the nectar, the moth would have [[pollen]] rubbed onto its head, and the next orchid visited would then be pollinated. In 1903, such a moth was discovered: ''[[Xanthopan morganii]]''. This was an example of an evolutionary [[prediction]]. However, because species coevolve within large networks of multispecies ecological interactions, this example of [[pairwise coevolution]] is more the exception than the rule.]]
'''Evolving digital ecological networks''' are webs of interacting, [[self-replication|self-replicating]], and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s (i.e., [[digital organism]]s) that experience the same major [[ecology|ecological interactions]] as [[biological organism]]s (e.g., [[Competition (biology)|competition]], [[predation]], [[parasitism]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological [[Biological network|networks]] can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism [[phenotype]]s. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of [[Boolean logic|logical computations]] (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed [[behavior (biology)|behaviors]] that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logic-defined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within [[evolutionary ecology]] (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).

==Overview==
In nature, species do not evolve in isolation but in large networks of interacting species. One of the main goals in evolutionary ecology is to disentangle the evolutionary mechanisms that shape and are shaped by [[Biological interaction|patterns of interaction]] between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Post DM, Palkovacs EP | title = Eco-evolutionary feedbacks in community and ecosystem ecology: interactions between the ecological theatre and the evolutionary play | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 364 | issue = 1523 | pages = 1629–40 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19414476 | pmc = 2690506 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2009.0012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=webOfLife&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JN | title = The coevolving web of life | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 173 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–40 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19119876 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/595752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoener TW | title = The newest synthesis: understanding the interplay of evolutionary and ecological dynamics | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6016 | pages = 426–9 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21273479 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1193954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly important question concerns how [[coevolution]], the reciprocal evolutionary change in local populations of interacting species driven by [[natural selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JN | title = The evolution of species interactions | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5423 | pages = 2116–8 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10381869 | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5423.2116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is shaped by the architecture of [[food web]]s, plant-animal [[mutualistic network]]s, and [[host-parasite interaction|host-parasite communities]]. The concept of diffuse coevolution, where adaptation is in response to a suite of biotic interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janzen DH | year = 1990 | title = When is it coevolution? | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 611–612 | doi=10.2307/2408229}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first step towards a framework unifying relevant theories in community ecology and coevolution. Understanding how individual interactions within networks influence coevolution, and conversely how coevolution influences the overall structure of networks, requires an appreciation for how pair-wise interactions change due to their broader community contexts as well as how this community context shapes selective pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox LR | year = 1988 | title = Diffuse coevolution within complex communities | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 906–907 | doi=10.2307/1941243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thompson JN | date = 1994 | title = The coevolutionary process | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, research is now focusing on how reciprocal selection influences and is embedded within the structure of multispecies interactive webs, not only on particular species in isolation.&lt;ref name=webOfLife/&gt;

Coevolution in a community context can be addressed [[theoretical ecology|theoretically]] via [[mathematical model]]ing and simulation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoder JB, Nuismer SL | title = When does coevolution promote diversification? | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 176 | issue = 6 | pages = 802–17 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20950142 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/657048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilman RT, Nuismer SL, Jhwueng DC | title = Coevolution in multidimensional trait space favours escape from parasites and pathogens | journal = Nature | volume = 483 | issue = 7389 | pages = 328–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22388815 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature10853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by looking at ancient footprints of [[evolutionary history of life|evolutionary history]] via ecological patterns that persist and are observable today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rezende EL, Lavabre JE, Guimarães PR, Jordano P, Bascompte J | title = Non-random coextinctions in phylogenetically structured mutualistic networks | journal = Nature | volume = 448 | issue = 7156 | pages = 925–8 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17713534 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature05956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gómez JM, Verdú M, Perfectti F | title = Ecological interactions are evolutionarily conserved across the entire tree of life | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7300 | pages = 918–21 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20520609 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature09113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by performing laboratory experiments with [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="Bohannan BJM 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohannan BJ, Lenski RE | year = 2000 | title = Linking genetic change to community evolution: insights from studies of bacteria and bacteriophage | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 362–377 | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the long time scales involved and the substantial effort that is necessary to isolate and quantify samples, the latter approach of testing biological evolution in the lab has been successful over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenski RE, Travisano M | title = Dynamics of adaptation and diversification: a 10,000-generation experiment with bacterial populations | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 15 | pages = 6808–14 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 8041701 | pmc = 44287 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studying the evolution of interspecific interactions, which involves dealing with more complex webs of multiple interacting species, has proven to be a much more difficult challenge. A meta-analysis of [[bacteriophage|host-phage]] interaction networks, carried out by Weitz and his team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores CO, Meyer JR, Valverde S, Farr L, Weitz JS | title = Statistical structure of host-phage interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 28 | pages = E288-97 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21709225 | pmc = 3136311 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1101595108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a striking statistical structure to the patterns of infection and resistance across a wide variety of environments and methods from which the hosts and phage were obtained. However, the ecological mechanisms and evolutionary processes responsible have yet to be unraveled.

Digital ecological networks enable the direct, comprehensive, and real time observation of evolving ecological interactions between antagonistic and/or mutualistic digital organisms that are difficult to study in nature. Research using self-replicating computer programs can help us understand how coevolution shapes the emergence and diversification of coevolving species interaction networks and, in turn, how changes in the overall structure of the web (e.g., through extinction of taxa or the introduction of invasive species) affect the evolution of a given species. Studying the evolution of species interaction networks in these artificial evolving systems also contributes to the development of the field, while overcoming limitations evolutionary biologists may face. For example, laboratory studies have shown that historical contingency can enable or impede the outcome of the interactions between bacteria and phage, depending on the order in which mutations occur: the phage often, but not always, evolve the ability to infect a novel host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer JR, Dobias DT, Weitz JS, Barrick JE, Quick RT, Lenski RE | title = Repeatability and contingency in the evolution of a key innovation in phage lambda | journal = Science | volume = 335 | issue = 6067 | pages = 428–32 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22282803 | pmc = 3306806 | doi = 10.1126/science.1214449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in order to obtain [[statistical power]] for predicting such outcomes of the coevolutionary process, experiments require a high level of replication. This [[stochastic]] nature of the evolutionary process was exemplified by Stephen Jay Gould's inquiry ("''What would happen if the tape of the history of life were rewound and replayed?''"&lt;ref&gt;Gould SJ (1990) Wonderful life: the Burgess Shale and the nature of history. W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;) Because of their ease in scalability and [[Replication (statistics)|replication]], evolving digital ecological networks open the door to experiments that incorporate this approach of ''replaying the tape of life''. Such experiments allow researchers to quantify the role of historical contingency and repeatability in network evolution, enabling predictions about the architecture and dynamics of large networks of interacting species.

The inclusion of ecological interactions in digital systems enables new research avenues: investigations using self-replicating computer programs complement laboratory efforts by broadening the breadth of viable experiments focused on the emergence and diversification of coevolving interactions in complex communities. This cross-disciplinary research program provides fertile grounds for new collaborations between computer scientists and evolutionary biologists.

==History==

===Coreworld===

The field of digital life was inspired by the rampant [[computer virus]]es of the 1980s. These viruses were self-replicating computer programs that spread from one computer to another, but they did not evolve. [[Steen Rasmussen]] was the first to include the possibility of mutation in self-replicating computer programs by extending the once-popular [[Core War]] game, where programs competed in a digital battle ground for the computer's resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rasmussen S, Knudsen C, Feldberg R, Hindsholm M | year = 1990 | title = The coreworld: emergence and evolution of cooperative structures in a computational chemistry | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(90)90070-6 | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 111–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rasmussen observed some interesting evolution, mutations in this early [[genetic programming]] language produced many unstable organisms, thus prohibiting scientific experiments. Just one year later, [[Thomas S. Ray]] developed an alternative system, [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]], and performed the first successful experiments with evolving populations of self-replicating computer programs.&lt;ref name=Tierra&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ray TS | year = 1992 | chapter = An approach to the synthesis of life. | veditors = Langton CG, Taylor C, Farmer JD, Rasmussen S | title = Proceedings of Artificial Life | volume = II | pages = 371-408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tierra===

Thomas S. Ray created a genetic language similar to earlier digital systems, but added several key features that made it more suitable for evolution in his [[artificial life]] system, Tierra. Primarily, he prevented instructions from writing beyond the ''privately'' allocated [[computer memory|memory space]], thus limiting the potential for organisms writing over others.&lt;ref name=Tierra /&gt; The only [[evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]] in Tierra was for rapid self-replication. Over the course of evolution, this pressure led to shorter and shorter genomes, reducing the time spent copying instructions during replication. Some individuals even started executing the replication [[source code|code]] in other organisms, allowing those [[cheating (biology)|"cheaters"]], which were originally referred to as parasites in Ray's work, to further shrink their genetic programs. This form of cheating was the first evolved ecological interaction between organisms in artificial life software. Ray's cheaters pre-dated the formal study of evolving ecological interactions using Tierra-like digital evolution platforms by 20 years.

===Avida===

In 1993, [[Chris Adami|Christoph Adami]], [[Charles Ofria]], and C. Titus Brown created the artificial life platform [[Avida]]&lt;ref name=Avida&gt;[http://avida.devosoft.org/download/ Avida download page] ([https://www.webcitation.org/68kLnHVkF WebCite archive])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilke /&gt; at [[Caltech|the California Institute of Technology]]. They added the ability for digital organisms to obtain bonus [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] for performing computational tasks, like adding two numbers together. In Avida, researchers can define the available tasks and set the consequences for organisms upon successful calculation.&lt;ref name=wilke&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ofria C, Wilke CO | title = Avida: a software platform for research in computational evolutionary biology | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–229 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15107231 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1162/106454604773563612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When organisms are rewarded with additional CPU cycles, their replication rate increases. Since Avida was designed specifically as a scientific tool, it allows users to collect a comprehensive suite of data about evolving populations. Due to its flexibility and data tracking abilities, Avida has become the most widely used digital system for studying evolution. The Devolab&lt;ref name=Devolab&gt;[http://devolab.msu.edu/ Devolab]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[BEACON Center]] currently continues development of Avida.

[[File:Self-replication.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Self-replication of a digital organism.'''
The circular genome of a digital organism, on the left, consists of a set of instructions (represented here as letters). Some of these instructions are involved in the copy process and others in completing computational tasks. The experimenter determines the probability of mutations. Copy mutations occur when an instruction is copied incorrectly, and is instead replaced by a random instruction in the forming offspring's genome (as can be seen in the offspring, on the right). Other types of mutations, such as [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]] are also implemented. Initially, all three of the parent's hardware ''[[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]'' are in the same location, at the instruction represented here by ''r''. As execution begins, the instruction pointer (indicated by an ''i'') advances. The first few instructions allocate space for the [[offspring]], and then move the write-head pointer (indicated by a ''w'') into that space. The flow pointer (indicated by an ''f'') is used to move the other pointers to genetically specified locations. The remainder of the process of self replication is carried out by a set of instructions at the end of the genome, commonly referred to as the copy-loop. When execution reaches the copy-loop, the flow pointer is used to keep the flow of execution inside of a loop that advances the read and write heads and copies instructions from the parent genome (read-head) to the offspring genome (write-head). Arcs inside the circular genome represent the [[control flow|execution flow]], showing most of the [[instruction cycle|CPU cycles]] being used during the copying process. After genome replication is complete, the parent organism divides off its offspring, which must now fend for itself within the Avida world. This animation was generated using [[Avida|Avida-ED]], which is available under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].&lt;ref name=Avida/&gt;]]

==Implementation==

===Digital organisms===

Digital organisms in Avida are self-replicating computer programs with a genome composed of assembly-like instructions. The genetic programming language in Avida contains instructions for manipulating values in [[processor register|registers]] and [[stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] as well as for [[control flow]] and mathematical operations. Each digital organism contains [[virtual machine|virtual hardware]] on which its genome is executed. To reproduce, digital organisms must copy their genome instruction by instruction into a new region of [[computer memory|memory]] through a potentially [[Noisy channel coding theorem|noisy channel]] that may lead to errors (i.e., [[mutation]]s). While most mutations are detrimental, [[mutant]]s will occasionally have higher fitness than their parents, thereby providing the basis for [[natural selection]] with all of the necessary components for [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]]. Digital organisms can acquire random [[Boolean algebra|binary numbers]] from the environment and are able to manipulate them using their genetic instructions, including the logic instruction ''[[NAND logic|NAND]]''. With only this instruction, digital organisms can compute any other task by stringing together various operations because NAND is a universal logic function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenski RE, Ofria C, Collier TC, Adami C | title = Genome complexity, robustness and genetic interactions in digital organisms | journal = Nature | volume = 400 | issue = 6745 | pages = 661–4 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10458160 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/23245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the output of processing random numbers from the environment corresponds to the result of a particular [[Boolean algebra|logic task]], then that task is incorporated into the set of tasks the organism performs, which in turn, defines part of its [[phenotype]].

===Digital interactions===

Interactions between digital organisms occur through phenotypic matching, which, in the case of task-based phenotypes, results from the performance of overlapping logic functions. Different mechanisms for mapping phenotypic matching to interactions can be implemented, depending on the antagonistic or mutualistic nature of the interaction.

[[Image:Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions.svg|500px|thumb|'''Logical computations, i.e. tasks, partially define phenotypes, and phenotypic matching leads to ecological interactions'''
Digital organisms process [[Binary numeral system|binary numbers]] taken from the environment using the instructions that constitute their [[genome]]s. When the output of processing those numbers equals the result of applying a [[Boolean algebra|logic function]], the digital organism is said to have performed that task. The combination of tasks performed by a digital organism partially defines its phenotype. The center of the figure depicts the output of applying eight [[Truth table|logical operators]] (tasks) on the two input numbers above. On the left and right, five hypothetical [[Host (biology)|host]] (green) and [[Parasitism|parasite]] (red) phenotypes are represented as columns (on the top) and as circles (below). On the top, each column depicts a phenotype and each row represents a task. Tasks performed by each phenotype are filled. In the lower part, the interaction networks between hosts and parasites are illustrated, which result from phenotypic matching: a parasite infects a host (indicated by a line) if it performs at least one task that is also performed by the host. Inset numbers indicate the identity of phenotypes represented on the top. Arrows represent the temporal direction of the [[coevolution|coevolutionary process]]: from the earliest phenotype to the most recent one. The order of tasks (from top to bottom) indicates the time needed for a digital organism to perform that task over the course of the evolutionary trajectory. Depending on the pattern of tasks performed by the digital organisms, a [[modularity|modular]] (left) or [[nestedness|nested]] (right) interaction network can emerge.]]

====Host-parasite interactions====

In [[parasitism|host-parasite interactions]], the parasite organisms benefits at the expense of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside [[host (biology)|hosts]] and execute parasitic [[thread (computing)|threads]] using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Zaman, L., Devangam, S, Ofria, C. (2011). Rapid host-parasite coevolution drives the production and maintenance of diversity in digital organisms. Proceedings of the 13th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation (GECCO), 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. [[infectious disease|Infection]] occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton A, Antonovics J, Brockhurst MA | title = Inverse-gene-for-gene infection genetics and coevolutionary dynamics | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = E230-42 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19852618 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1086/645087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite virulence gene (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and [[Gene-for-gene relationship|gene-for-gene]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agrawal A, Lively CM | year = 2002 | title = Infection genetics: gene-for-gene versus matching-alleles models an all points in between | url = | journal = Evolutionary Ecology Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 79–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be implemented.

In traditional infection genetic models, host resistance and pathogen infectivity have associated costs. These costs are an important part of theory about why defense genes do not always fix rapidly within populations.&lt;ref name="Bohannan BJM 2000"/&gt; Costs are also present in digital host-parasite interactions: performing more or more complex tasks implies larger genomes and hence slower reproduction. Tasks may also allow organisms access to resources present in the abiotic environment, and the environment can be carefully manipulated to control the relative costs or benefits of resistance.

By keeping track of task-based phenotypes as well as tracking information about successful infections in the [[community (ecology)|community]], researchers are able to perfectly reconstruct the interaction networks of digital coevolving hosts and parasites. The structure of these networks is a result of the interplay between ecological processes, mainly host abundance, and coevolutionary dynamics, which lead to changes in host specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poulin R | title = Network analysis shining light on parasite ecology and diversity | journal = Trends in Parasitology | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 492–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20561821 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pt.2010.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avida host-parasite coevolution web.ogv|thumb| 500px|'''Evolving host-parasite webs.'''
Starting from a host phenotype (green node) and a parasite phenotype (red node), a complex network of interactions (arrows) between hosts and parasites emerges from the coevolutionary process. Nodes representing new host and parasite phenotypes appear and disappear over evolutionary time. The abundance of individuals expressing each phenotype changes continuously (indicated by node size) altering interaction patterns, and thus influencing subsequent coevolutionary dynamics. Interactions between a host phenotype and a parasite phenotype are depicted as arrows pointing in opposite directions: the thickness of red arrows indicates the fraction of [[infectious disease|infections]] that a particular parasite is responsible for inflicting on the indicated host phenotype, while the thickness of the green arrows indicates the fraction of all of the hosts a particular parasite phenotype infects that is accounted for by the indicated host phenotype. Often asymmetry between the thicknesses of arrow-pairs leads to red arrows dominating the picture. At these times, most parasite phenotypes are infecting only a small fraction of hosts expressing a given phenotype. Instead, the majority of those hosts are being infected by parasites with other phenotypes.

====Mutualistic interactions====

Interactions in which both species obtain mutual benefit, such as those between flowering plants and pollinators, and birds and fleshy fruits, can be implemented in evolving digital experiments by following the same task matching approach used for host-parasite interactions, but using free-living organisms instead of parasitic threads. For example, one way to set up a plant-pollinator type of interaction is to use an environment containing two mutually exclusive resources: one designated for "plant" organisms and one for "pollinator" organisms. Similar to parasites attempting infection, if tasks overlap between a pollinator and a plant it visits, pollination is successful and both organisms obtain extra CPU cycles. Thus, these digital organisms obtain mutual benefit when they perform at least one common task, and more common tasks lead to larger mutual benefits. While this is one specific way to enable mutualistic interactions, many others are possible in Avida. Interactions that begin as parasitic may even evolve to be mutualistic under the right conditions. In most cases, coevolution will result in concurrent interactions between multiple phenotypes. Thus, observed networks of mutualistic interactions can inform our understanding about the outcomes and processes of coevolution in complex communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guimarães PR, Jordano P, Thompson JN | title = Evolution and coevolution in mutualistic networks | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 877–85 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21749596 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01649.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Predator-prey interactions====

While [[host-parasite coevolution|host-parasite]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] interactions are determined by task-based phenotypes, [[predation|predator-prey]] interactions are determined by behavior. Predators are digital organisms that have evolved from ancestral prey phenotypes to locate, attack, and consume organisms. When a predator executes an attack instruction (acquired through mutation), it kills a neighboring organism. When predators kill prey, they gain resources required for reproduction (e.g., CPU cycles) proportional to the level accumulated by the consumed prey. [[natural selection|Selection]] favors behavioral strategies in prey that enable them to avoid being eaten. At the same time, selection favors predators with behavioral strategies that improve their food finding and prey attacking abilities. The resulting diversity in the continuously evolving behavioral phenotypes creates dynamic predator-prey interaction networks in which selective forces are constantly changing as a consequence of the emergence of new, and loss of old, behaviors. Because predators and prey move around in and use information about their environment, these experiments are typically carried out using [[spatial ecology|spatially structured populations]]. On the other hand, host-parasite and mutualistic coevolution are often done in well-mixed environments, though the choice of the environment is at the discretion of the experimenter.

==Research directions==
{{essay|section|date=October 2014}}
Understanding how [[biodiversity]] is organized in [[ecosystem|natural ecosystems]] requires going beyond the study of pairs of interacting species. Using digital organisms, one can find generalities about the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping the web of interactions among species, as well as the coevolutionary processes embedded within these networks. By tracing the evolution of digital communities and their ecological networks, researchers obtain perfect ''[[fossil|fossil records]]'' of how the number and patterns of links among interacting phenotypes evolved.

The stability-diversity debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCann KS | title = The diversity-stability debate | journal = Nature | volume = 405 | issue = 6783 | pages = 228–33 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10821283 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/35012234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Until recently, this debate has focused on one component of biodiversity: species diversity. However, newer research has begun dealing with another component of biodiversity: diversity in species interactions. Mathematical models show that a mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics and that the loss of one interaction type may critically destabilize ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougi A, Kondoh M | title = Diversity of interaction types and ecological community stability | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6092 | pages = 349–51 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22822151 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1220529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies with digital organisms can shed light on this debate from an empirical perspective because the types of interactions included can be manipulated and the stability of the resulting evolving digital ecological network can be measured.

Equally addressable using evolving digital ecological networks are many of the open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities. For example, do [[coevolution|coevolutionary dynamics]] change as communities become richer? Is there any limit to their richness? Is the evolution of interactions between multispecies networks [[contingency (philosophy)|historically contingent]]? Why do some ecological scenarios lead to predictable network structures and others do not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thébault E, Fontaine C | title = Stability of ecological communities and the architecture of mutualistic and trophic networks | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5993 | pages = 853–6 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20705861 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1188321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Do [[adaptationism#Genetic constraints|genetic constraints]] play a large role in the evolution of ecological networks? These are only a few of many open questions concerning the coevolution of ecological interactions in multispecies communities.

These and many related questions require researchers to look across the [[evolutionary history of life|evolutionary history]] of ecological network formation. For natural systems, those data are very difficult to collect. With digital organisms, watching both the coevolutionary process and ecological network formation is possible in real time. Data on the abundance of interacting phenotypes are recorded without error, hence the evolutionary implications of ecological processes can be explored in-depth.

The study of self-replicating and evolving computer programs offers a tantalizing glimpse into the evolution of interactions among organisms that do not share any ancestry with biochemical life of Earth. This comes with potential caveats in translating predictions of evolving digital networks to biological ones because mechanistic details differ substantially between interacting digital organisms and interacting biological organisms. Nevertheless, these digital networks contain the necessary components for ongoing coevolutionary dynamics in large webs of interacting organisms. In spite of the differences between biological and digital evolution, the study of evolving digital ecological networks can lead to a more predictive understanding of natural dynamics. Because the general operational processes (e.g., Darwinian evolution, mutualism, parasitism) do not differ, studies utilizing digital networks can uncover rules operating on and within ecological networks. Together with microbial experiments, they create opportunities for furthering the understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes among interacting species.

'''''Experiment''''' was launched in 1802 and was immediately taken up by the British [[East India Company]] (EIC), as an "extra ship" on a multi-voyage charter. She made three voyages for the EIC and disappeared without a trace while homeward bound on her fourth voyage in the same storm that claimed two other [[East Indiamen]].

'''EIC voyage #1 (1803-1804):''' Captain James Carnegie acquired a [[letter of marque]] on 15 October 1803. He sailed from [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]] on 10 February 1803, bound for [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. ''Experiment'' reached [[Anjouan|Johanna]] on 13 May and arrived at Bombay on 7 June. Homeward bound, she reached [[Saint Helena|St Helena]] on 14 November and [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on 18 January 1804, before arriving at Blackwall on 15 February.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

'''EIC voyage #2 (1804-1805):''' Captain Peter Campbell acquired a letter of marque on 4 May 1804. He sailed from Portsmouth on 9 June 1804. ''Experiment'' reached Madeira on 5 July and arrived at Bombay on 11 December.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

At Bombay ''Experiment'' took on part of a cargo of tea that {{ship||Brunswick|1792 EIC ship|2}} had brought. ''Brunswick'' had had to put into Bombay for repairs while homeward bound from China. The EIC's Court of Directors decided to transship her cargo and send her back to China after the repairs had been completed.

On her homeward journey ''Experiment'' reached [[Thalassery|Tellicherry]] on 23 February 1805, [[Anchuthengu|Anjengo]] on 6 March, and St Helena on 23 June. She arrived at Blackwall on 18 September.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

'''EIC voyage #3 (1806-1807):''' Captain James Normand acquired a letter of marque on 26 March 1806. He sailed from Portsmouth on 14 May 1806, bound for Bombay. ''Experiment'' reached False Bay on 6 August and arrived at Bombay on 6 October. Homeward bound, she was at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 February 1807 and St Helena on 9 March, and arrived at the Downs on 28 May.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

'''EIC voyage #4 (1807-Loss):''' Captain John Logan acquired a letter of marque on 21 August 1807. He sailed from Portsmouth on 17 September 1807, bound for Madras and Bengal. The homeward bound fleet left Bengal on 25 October 1808.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735024?urlappend=%3Bseq=162 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №4391.]&lt;/ref&gt; She, {{ship||Glory|1802 ship|2}}, and {{ship||Lord Nelson|East Indiaman|2}} parted company with the fleet in a gale between 20 and 23 November,&lt;ref name=reports/&gt; at {{coord|8|30|S|80|00|E}}.

'''Gary Arthur Chapman''' (12 March 1938 &amp;ndash; 23 September 1978) was an Australian freestyle swimmer of the 1950s who won a bronze medal in the 100-metre freestyle at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] in Melbourne.  Although he had set a world record in the 220-yard freestyle, he was surprisingly omitted from the 4×200-metre freestyle relay team which won the gold medal.

Born in [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands]], [[Sydney]], Chapman first came to prominence in the 1952 Australian Championships, at the age of 14, when he cut 2.9 seconds off the 440-yard freestyle Australian record.  In 1954, he sliced 12.8 seconds off the 880-yard record in qualifying for the Australian team at the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1954 Empire Games]] in Vancouver, where he won gold in the 440-yard freestyle and bronze in the 1650-yard freestyle. He also claimed gold in the 4×220-yard freestyle relay.  In his era, the 220 and 880-yard freestyle were not contested as individual events.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

Due to the rise of fellow Australian [[Murray Rose]] in distance freestyle swimming, Chapman switched to competing in the 110&amp;nbsp;yd and 220-yard freestyle events in a bid to increase his chances of success at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne.  Prior to the games, he defeated teammate [[Jon Henricks]] twice in the 220-yard freestyle, setting a world record on one of those occasions.

Due to the 200-metre freestyle not being an Olympic event, Chapman was forced to concentrate on the 100-metre freestyle. He won the bronze medal in 100-metre freestyle, finishing behind Henricks and another Australian, [[John Devitt]].  As the 220-yard freestyle world record, Chapman was snubbed by the selectors in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay, only swimming in the qualifying heats, but being replaced by [[Kevin O'Halloran]] in the final, where the Australians won the gold medal in a world record time.  Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not entitled to gold medals.

Chapman continued in the sport despite this until the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958 Empire Games]] in [[Cardiff]], where he was edged out for gold in the 110-yard freestyle by Devitt, and managed to come only fifth in the 440-yard freestyle behind fellow Australian [[John Konrads]]. Chapman collected gold medals in the 4×220-yard freestyle and 4×110-yard medley relays.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ch/gary-chapman-1.html Gary Chapman]. sports-reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman retired after the 1958 Games. In 1978 he and a friend died after a boat belonging to him capsized near [[Little Bay, New South Wales]], in the south of Sydney. Their bodies were never recovered.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130447b.htm Chapman, Gary Arthur (1938–1978)]. Australian Dictionary of Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Crane''''' was a [[Royal Navy]] [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|''Cruizer'' class brig-sloop]] launched in 1809.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.301.&lt;/ref&gt; She had a completely and unusually uneventful five-year career before she foundered in 1814.

She was commissioned in September 1809 under Cmdr. James Stuart for the Irish station.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Stuart captured two American vessels, the ''Asia'' of Boston and the ''Washington'' of [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]], on their way home from [[Archangel (Russian city)|Archangel]]. He brought the crews into [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], in the [[Azores]], and released them to John B. Dabney, the American consul, who repatriated them. It is not at all clear why Stuart had detained the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Abdo (2005), p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1811 Commander William Haydon took temporary command and sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 29 September 1812.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; Her next captain was Commander Thomas Forrest. In December 1813 Commander Robert Standly became her captain.

On 4 April 1814 ''Crane'' chased the American privateer ''Chasseur'', of 14 guns and 135 men, off St Kitts, but was unable to capture her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015005785830?urlappend=%3Bseq=313 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' (20 May 1814).]&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Crane'' was lost, presumed foundered with all hands, in September 1814 while ''en route'' from Bermuda to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett (1986), p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oba '''Idewu Ojulari''' (died c 1835) reigned as [[Oba of Lagos]] from 1829 to about 1834/5.  His father was Oba [[Osinlokun]] and his siblings were [[Kosoko]] (who was Oba from 1845 to 1851) and Opo Olu, a wealthy and powerful female slave holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760-1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253348845|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idewu Ojulari's ritual suicide==
Idewu Ojulari became Oba after his father Osilokun died in 1829. However, Idewu Ojulari's reign was unpopular and at the behest of the [[Oba of Benin]], to whom the people of Lagos had petitioned, Idewu Ojulari committed suicide. Notably, Lagos had hitherto been under Benin suzerainty up until the reign of Oba Kosoko who was dethroned by British forces in 1851. Thereafter, Oba Akitoye and his successor, Oba Dosunmu, rebuffed payment of annual tributes to Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=The Lagos Consulate, 1851-1861|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0333240545|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryder|first1=Alan Frederick Charles|title=Benin and the Europeans: 1485-1897|publisher=Humanities Press, 1969 - Benin|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Kristin Mann]], Idewu Ojulari's unpopularity may have been caused by the economic downturn in the slave trade following the prosperous years of Osinlokun's reign. His chiefs reportedly communicated their displeasure with Idewu to the Oba of Benin, who sent him a skull, a sword, and a message that "the people of Lagos would no longer recognize him as their King". Idewu Ojulari, recognizing the skull as an invitation to take poison and in the sword a call to battle, he committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760-1900|publisher=Indiana University Press, 2007|isbn=9780253348845|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelligent Word Recognition''', or IWR, is the recognition of unconstrained handwritten words. IWR recognizes entire handwritten words or phrases instead of character-by-character, like its predecessor, [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR).   IWR technology matches handwritten or printed words to a user-defined dictionary, significantly reducing character errors encountered in typical character-based recognition engines.  

New technology on the market utilizes IWR, [[Optical character recognition|OCR]], and [[Intelligent character recognition|ICR]] together, which opens many doors for the processing of documents, either constrained (hand printed or machine printed) or unconstrained (freeform cursive).  IWR also eliminates a large percentage of the manual [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] of handwritten documents that, in the past, could only be keyed by a human, creating an automated workflow.

When cursive handwriting is in play, for each word analyzed, the system breaks down the words into a sequence of graphemes, or subparts of letters.  These various curves, shapes and lines make up letters and IWR considers these various shape and groupings in order to calculate a confidence value associated with the word in question.

IWR is not meant to replace [[Intelligent character recognition|ICR]] and [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] engines which work well with printed data; however, IWR reduces the number of character errors associated with these engines, and it is ideal for processing real-world documents that contain mostly freeform, hard-to-recognize data, inherently unsuitable for them.

[[File:JohnPaterson.jpg|thumb|right|John ("Jock") Paterson, businessman and influential politician.]]

'''John ("Jock") Paterson''' (1822 – 1880) was a prominent politician and successful businessman of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], and had a great influence on the development of [[Port Elizabeth]] where he was based. He ran newspapers, established the [[Grey High School|Grey Institute]] and played a significant role in founding South Africa's [[Standard Bank (historic)|Standard Bank]]. As a politician he was somewhat less successful, playing a role in the failed separatist movement for a [[Eastern Cape Separatist League|British ruled Eastern Cape]] in the 1870s and backing [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Carnarvon]]’s ill-fated confederation plan.

== Early life and business ventures ==

Born and raised in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], Paterson studied at Marischal university college and emigrated to [[Port Elizabeth]] in 1841 to take up a position as a school master. Later he successfully persuaded [[Sir George Grey]], then the [[Governor of the Cape Colony]], to take an interest in his proposals for new boys schools and Grey made land and funding available to Paterson for their founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greyhighschool.com/index.php/Our-School/History-of-Grey/|title=History of Grey Highschool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911095229/http://www.greyhighschool.com/index.php/Our-School/History-of-Grey/|archivedate=11 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a notoriously volatile temperament. On 7 May 1845, he secretly started his first business, the ''[[Eastern Province Herald]]'' newspaper, with his partner John R. Phillip as the official owner. As he was still contracted by the state this was an illegal activity so his involvement remained clandestine. After the two men fought, Paterson stopped publication in 1850 and started a new newspaper, the ''[[Eastern Province News]]'' which he soon renamed to the original name in 1854. He later sold the newspaper in 1857 to his friend [[Robert Godlonton]] who owned the ''[[Grahamstown Journal]]'', though he continued to use the paper as a platform for his opinions. Philip meanwhile had opened the competing ''[[Port Elizabeth Mercury]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstide.co.za/content.asp?PageID=422|title=History of the Eastern Cape Herald Newspaper and John Paterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paterson was however already a successful businessman. He had made a series of property investments on the outskirts of the expanding town of Port Elizabeth, and a range of other business enterprises. He also briefly served as the Consular Agent for the United States in Port Elizabeth, and gained much American business for his trading firm though this. 
He had a lifelong interest in boys schools, and founded several in his life, including [[Grey High School]], an elite school for boys in [[Port Elizabeth]] that he founded in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonpad.com/2009/06/the-worlds-top-10-banks/|title=The Worlds Top Banks.

== Political career ==

Paterson's temperament led him to be intensely drawn to politics, from relatively early on. His early activity involved lobbying for increased European immigration, and the widespread anti-convict agitation of 1849.

=== First Parliamentary term and Eastern Cape separatism (1854-1858)===
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
In 1854 he was elected to the first Cape Parliament as one of the two members for [[Port Elizabeth]] (together with [[Henry Fancourt White]]). From the beginning of his political career he made the secession of the eastern part of the Cape Colony a priority. He felt very strongly that the [[Xhosa people]] of the eastern Cape frontier were a severe threat to the colonists' safety and that this threat was not helped by the Cape government's relaxed attitude to the frontier.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 1:pp 142, 227 }} The Cape Town parliament at the time was also dominated by liberals such as [[Saul Solomon]] who prevented the settlers of the eastern Cape from cheaply exploiting African labour. Deprived of cheap African labour, Paterson then moved a resolution to import indentured "coolie labour" from Asia to work the farms instead, but the government blocked that motion too.
Altogether, Paterson felt that the distant and overly-tolerant Cape government was "...the root of all the troubles with the kaffirs...".{{sfn|Walker|1929|p=381}}

His proposed solution was a view which he held for the remainder of his life - that the white eastern Cape deserved a greater degree of separation, or to become the seat of the Cape's parliament and government. In this, he differed from the radical members of the "separatist league", who were based further east in Grahamstown, were led by [[Robert Godlonton]], and who proposed absolute and immediate separation. He also angered Godlonton's Grahamstown clique by his blocking of their Kowie harbour proposal, which he saw as potentially taking shipping activity away from Port Elizabeth. The separatist movement began a gradual decline due to a growing fear in the Midlands around Port Elizabeth and Graaff-Reinett that if they attained separation then they would fall under the domination of Grahamstown.

He resigned from politics in 1858 due to his wife's fatal illness.

=== Business interlude (1859-1873)===
In 1859 he made a business trip to Britain where he had a great deal of family and business connections, and he even made a bid for a seat in the British parliament, which he eventually decided against.

In 1862 he founded [[Standard Bank]], now one of the largest banks in southern Africa. However he later suffered several business failures and declared bankruptcy in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/14929/5/005_p040-049.pdf|title=Standard Bank. History}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the Cape attained self-rule (or "[[responsible government]]" as it was known) and an economic boom ensued as the new locally elected government began vast infrastructure projects across the country. Paterson, financially uplifted by the economic boom, re-entered politics.

=== Return to Parliament (1872-1877) ===

==== Separatist League (1872-1874)====
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
Paterson was elected to the Cape Parliament again in 1873. The enormous growth in the economy was fueling a competition between the ports Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, for the expanding inland trade. Paterson therefore returned to his fight for a moderate form of separation - so as to avoid dominance by either Cape Town to the west, or Grahamstown to the east. 
In other developments, he put forward bills for a local government system, and for a division of public money according to customs and land revenue, but both bills were defeated.

Paterson and his political ally [[John Gordon Sprigg]] comprised the core of the opposition to the first Cape government, together with the renegade independent [[John X. Merriman]] (who soon joined the government). Paterson's strongest critic was the liberal [[Saul Solomon]], who ridiculed Paterson's ideas.

Paterson's role in the "[[Eastern Cape Separatist League]]" also brought him into a direct showdown with the strong-willed Prime Minister of the Cape, [[John Molteno]] – a firm proponent of regional and racial unity in the Cape{{sfn|Molteno|1900|p=214}} – who reacted in May 1874 by passing the [[Seven Circles Act]]. This re-drew the borders of the Cape’s subdivisions, abolishing the last legal remnants of the East/West distinction. Together with Molteno's policy of drawing ministers from the Eastern Cape into his government, and the general rising prosperity of the whole country, this effectively crushed the separatist movement. Paterson fought the Bill bitterly, but nonetheless kept his seat in parliament as a member of the opposition once it was passed.{{sfn|Walker|1929|pp=488}} He went on to become the primary critic of the Molteno Ministry over the following years, even when the official head of the opposition [[John X. Merriman]] joined Molteno's unity government.

Not always popular, Paterson's views, and especially the way in which he delivered them, often provoked considerable hostility in parliament.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 2:p 125}} This all too frequently left him isolated and unable to do more than temporarily obstruct government projects.{{sfn|Henry|Siepmann|1963|p=}}

==== Enforcement of Confederation (1874-1877)====

Starting in 1874, the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], having recently federated Canada, began a project to impose the very same system of [[confederation]] on the very different states of southern Africa. This was to consolidate European control of southern Africa and bring about a united policy towards the Black African inhabitants. Lord Carnarvon also expressed an interest in making Paterson the next Cape Prime Minister, in order to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrated History of South Africa''. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}. p.182, ''"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun"''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.75|[[John Molteno]], Cape Prime Minister and Paterson's lifelong political opponent.]]

There was little local enthusiasm for the project, and its timing was particularly unfortunate – coming when the various southern African states were still simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion. However Carnarvon was determined, and appointed [[Henry Bartle Frere]] – an autocratic imperialist with little experience of southern African politics – as governor, with instructions to implement Carnarvon's confederation. [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] turned the confederation idea down flat, saying it was impractical and badly timed, but Paterson saw an opportunity to ensure that his eastern province gained autonomy (albeit within the proposed confederation), and that he himself could win the position of leading it. In a series of letters between him and Carnarvon (''The Confederation Despatch'', 1876), Paterson discreetly offered the [[British Colonial Office]] his support against the Molteno government in exchange for vague promises of a future leadership position. Paterson also made a public call for a British invasion and annexation of the [[Transvaal Republic]], for the future confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofsafrica01theauoft/historyofsafrica01theauoft_djvu.txt|title=The History of South Africa from 1795 to 1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Molteno, by now furious with Paterson for what he saw as a betrayal of the Cape's independence and democracy, made it clear that he was willing to resign but not to endorse confederation, Frere used the authority of the British Colonial Office to suspend the elected Cape government and assumed direct control in 1878 (appointing [[Gordon Sprigg]] as his puppet Prime Minister, instead of Paterson who was at the time considered too divisive a politician for the job). Paterson, disappointed, then travelled to London as a representative of the potential new Eastern Province, while Frere launched his [[Anglo-Zulu war|invasion of Zululand]] in 1879 before being recalled to London to face charges of misconduct.

The confederation scheme was dropped, having by now spawned a trail of wars across southern Africa – including new frontier wars against the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa]] and the [[Pedi people]], the [[Anglo-Zulu war]], the [[Basuto Gun War]] and later the [[First Boer War]].

== Death ==
[[File:Paterson lectures Observer 1878.jpg|thumb|right|Paterson's "pedagogic" approach is alluded to in this 1878 cartoon by the [[The Observer (Cape newspaper)|Port Elizabeth Observer]] (a newspaper that supported him). Paterson is shown lecturing the MPs of parliament on budgeting and finance.]]
Paterson died suspiciously on his way back to the Cape in May 1880 in a bizarre double-shipwreck. He initially twice delayed his departure, missing ships, before he boarded the ship the Union R.M.S. ''American''. The ''American'' was then dramatically wrecked off West Africa, when its propeller-shaft snapped, bent and tore open part of the ship's plating. The passengers evacuated the ship in an ordered way before it sank but, adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, the lifeboats became separated. The passengers were all later found and rescued. However, Paterson's lifeboat was separately picked up by the ''Senegal'' which then ran aground on the coast of Grand Canary Island. In the chaos following this second shipwreck, Paterson was reported to have been struck by a hard object (reportedly the ship's propeller) and killed. He was the only casualty from the two shipwrecks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1897|p= Vol 2:p 124}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pe.org.za/historicalfacts.html|title=Historical Facts|website=www.pe.org.za|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://molegenealogy.blogspot.com/2010/05/shipwreck-reports-for-family-history.html|title=Shipwrecks. The Paterson family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon news of Paterson's death, flags across the Cape were flown at half mast. His obituary in the ''[[Cape Argus]]'', while acknowledging the political controversy and hostility he sometimes caused, paid tribute to his zeal for what he believed to be right, and to his enormous achievements. The village of [[Paterson, Eastern Cape|Paterson]] in the [[Eastern Cape]], South Africa was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.org.za/tour-sa-addo-elephants.html|title=Paterson, Eastern Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Stanley Little commented on Paterson's death and political style in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leaders. 
{{Quote
|text= He never attained to the position to which his ambition led him to aspire, but lost his life, in a sad manner, on his voyage out to the Cape. The American, in which vessel he took his passage, sustained shipwreck, but he escaped in the Senegal, which ship grounded a few days afterwards, and Mr Paterson went to the bottom. He represented Port Elizabeth in the Assembly, and was for some time the leader of the Opposition. He was an able man, but some severe things were said about him, which on the wholesome principle ''de mortuis nil nisi bonum'', I shall not repeat. He was a firm Confederationist, and took the Eastern view of matters in the East versus West controversy. He could speak well, and would have been worth listening to, had it not been for a certain ugly mannerism. His delivery too, was dry and cold, and very trying, and he had moreover, been unsuccessful in his efforts to cure himself of the sing-song tin-kettle brogue of the bourgeoisie Scotchman. Mr Paterson had been a schoolmaster, and in good sooth, he retained a pedagogic style to the last.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''José Melis Guiu''', (February 27, 1920,  – April 7, 2005), known as  '''José Melis''', was a Cuban-American bandleader and television personality.

==Biography==
Melis was born in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. He studied at the Havana Conservatory of Music and a Cuban government scholarship enabled him to continue his education in [[Paris]]. When he was 16, he arrived in the United States, graduated from the [[Juilliard School of Music]] and worked as a lounge pianist. During World War II, while he was serving as the musical director for the USO's New York City branch of the [[USO]], he met [[Jack Paar]], and the two remained friends for years.

In 1954–55, Melis was the pianist when ''[[The Early Show|The Morning Show]]'' on [[CBS]] was hosted by Paar. Then Paar moved from mornings to late night, and from 1957 to 1962, Melis served as the musical director of ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' during Jack Paar's tenure as host. He also wrote the music for Paar's theme song, "IM4U" (lyrics by Sev F. Marino), and he performed with Paar on other shows, including Parr’s ''Startime'' (1960). One of his routines on Paar's shows was the "telephone game," in which Melis would improvise a musical number based on the last four digits of an audience member's telephone number.

Melis also appeared on other TV shows, including [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''[[Toast of the Town]]'', and he portrayed himself in the musical comedy film ''[[Senior Prom (film)|Senior Prom]]'' (1958). He occasionally accompanied [[Frank Sinatra]], and his song "Pasion Orientale" was heard in the [[Judy Garland]] version of ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954). In addition to touring with [[Mel Torme]], he also appeared as a soloist with the [[Boston Pops]] and other symphony orchestras.

Melis was 85 when he died of a respiratory infection in [[Sun City, Arizona]] on April 7, 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11617">[[File:USGompertzCurve.svg|thumb|US period [[life table]] for 2003, showing considerable acceleration rather than deceleration.]]

In [[gerontology]], '''late-life mortality deceleration''' is the phenomenon of [[hazard rate]] increasing at a decreasing rate in late life – rather than increasing exponentially as in the [[Gompertz law]] –  and in some cases plateauing ([[asymptoting]]) at a constant rate. Graphically, on a log-linear [[semi-log plot]] (linear in the ''x''-axis of age, logarithmic in the ''y''-axis of hazard rate), an exponential function becomes linear, and the Gompertz law amounts to the hazard rate increasing linearly with age. Late-life mortality deceleration corresponds to hazard rate increasing more slowly than linearly (on a log-linear graph), instead curving and possibly plateauing.

Late-life mortality deceleration is a well-established phenomenon in insects,&lt;ref name="gg434"&gt;{{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011|loc=p. 434}}&lt;/ref&gt; who often spend much of their life in a constant hazard rate region, but it is much more controversial in mammals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011|loc=pp. 433–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] have found varying conclusions, with some finding short-term periods of mortality deceleration in mice, others not finding such, and baboon studies show no mortality deceleration. An analogous deceleration occurs in [[failure rate]] of manufactured products; this analogy is elaborated in the [[reliability theory of aging and longevity]].&lt;ref name="gg434" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economos, A. C. 1979. "A Non-Gompertzian Paradigm for Mortality Kinetics of Metazoan Animals and Failure Kinetics of Manufactured Products", ''[[Age (journal)|AGE]]'' 2: 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late-life mortality deceleration was first proposed as occurring in human aging, in {{Harv|Gompertz|1825}} (which also introduced the Gompertz law), and observed as occurring in humans in {{Harv|Greenwood|Irwin|1939}}, and has since become one of the pillars of the [[biodemography of human longevity]] – see [[#History|history]]; here "late life" is typically "after 85 years of age". However, a recent paper, {{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011}}, concludes that mortality deceleration is negligible up to the age of 106 in the population studied (beyond this point, reliable data were unavailable) and that the Gompertz law is a good fit, with previous observations of deceleration being spurious, with various causes, including bad data and methodological problems – see [[#Criticism|criticism]].

The primary reference for this article is {{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011}}, which provides a detailed historical overview and discussion, together with current criticism.

== Phenomena ==
Three related terms are used in this context:
;Late-life mortality deceleration
:Hazard rate increasing at a decreasing rate (rather than increasing log-linearly as in the Gompertz law).

;{{visible anchor|Mortality leveling-off}}
:More strongly, hazard rate eventually ''stops'' increasing (or rather, [[asymptote]]s towards a limit), and then proceeds at a constant rate (or rather, approaches a constant rate), yielding (slightly sub-)[[exponential decay]], as in [[radioactive decay]].

;{{visible anchor|Late-life mortality plateau}}
This is used synonymously with "mortality leveling-off", or rather to refer to the region where hazard rate is approximately constant.

== History ==
A brief historical review is given in {{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011|loc=2. Mortality at Advanced Ages: A Historical Review (pp. 433–435)}}; a detailed survey is given in {{Harv|Olshansky|1998}}.

Late-life mortality deceleration was first proposed as occurring in human aging, in {{Harv|Gompertz|1825}}, which also introduced the Gompertz law.&lt;ref name="ggp433"&gt;{{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011|loc=p. 433}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed and quantified in {{Harv|Greenwood|Irwin|1939}}, and reproduced in many later studies. Greenwood and Irwin wrote:
:"the increase of mortality rate with age advances at a slackening rate, that nearly all, perhaps all, methods of graduation of the type of Gompertz’s formula over-state senile mortality"&lt;ref name="gip14"&gt;{{Harv|Greenwood|Irwin|1939|loc=p. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"the possibility that with advancing age the rate of mortality asymptotes to a finite value"&lt;ref name="gip14" /&gt;
:"the limiting values of ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; [one-year probability of death] are 0.439 for women and 0.544 for men"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Greenwood|Irwin|1939|loc=p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these studies, late-life mortality deceleration became one of the pillars of the theory of [[biodemography of human longevity]], and models have incorporated it. It has been criticized at times, and recently has been very seriously criticized; see below.

== Criticism ==
Statistical studies of extreme longevity are difficult for a number of factors. Firstly, because few people live to very old ages, a very large population is required for such studies, ideally all born and living in similar conditions (same country, same birth year). In small countries, a single birth year cohort is insufficiently numerous for statistics, and thus multiple years are often used. Secondly, due to the great ages, accurate records of persons living over 100 years require records dating from the late 19th or early 20th century, when such record-keeping was often not high-quality; further, there is a tendency to exaggerate one's age, which distorts data. Thirdly, granularity is an issue – ideally exact day of birth and death would be used; using only year of birth and death introduces granularity, which adds bias (as discussed below).

{{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011}} examined single birth-year cohorts from the United States [[Death Master File]], using the [[method of extinct generations]], and found that the effect disappeared if various distorting factors were removed. Specifically, they conclude that mortality deceleration is negligible up to the age of 106 in the population studied (beyond this point, reliable data were unavailable) and that the Gompertz law is a good fit, with previous observations of deceleration being spurious, with various causes, discussed below.

=== Why was mortality deceleration observed? ===
Given that mortality deceleration in humans had been observed in various studies, but disappeared on the careful analysis (of single-year cohorts in the US) in {{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011}}, it is natural to ask what causes this discrepancy – why was mortality deceleration observed?

{{Harv|Gavrilov|Gavrilova|2011}} propose several causes; notable, in each instance when such a factor is corrected or diminished, the fit with the Gompertz law becomes better. 

Data quality:
* Age exaggeration
*:There is at times a tendency for old people to exaggerate their ages; this reduces apparent mortality.
Technical:
* Use of probability of death (over an discrete interval of time, usually one year), rather than the hazard rate (force of mortality; instantaneous rate)
*:For those of sufficient age, this appears to divide the death rate by their age, because as people age that one year becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of their life. {{Fix|text=needs expansion}}
*:Probabilities of death can be reconstructed using the [[Sacher formula]], if necessary.
* Use of biased [[estimator]]s of theoretical hazard rate
*:Since the Gompertz law is log-linear, working on a semi-log scale and taking the central [[difference quotient]] of the logarithm yields an unbiased and maximum likelihood estimator (assuming intervals and change in the hazard rate are small), but other methods, such as the "actuarial estimate", yield bias (especially due to concavity of an exponential function on a linear scale).
Methodology:{{Fix|text=some of these are different ways of saying the same thing}}
* Mixing together several birth cohorts with different mortality levels
* Using cross-sectional instead of cohort data
* Crude assumptions, such as uniformity of death over a time interval
*:For example, if hazard rate is high, significantly more deaths should be expected in the first month of the period than the last month (since fewer people survive to the end); assuming that deaths occur evenly throughout the period or in the middle of the period overstates length of life.

== Causes ==
Several causes are proposed for late-life mortality:&lt;ref name="gg434" /&gt;
* Population heterogeneity (first proposed in {{Harv|Beard|1959}}), is by far the most common explanation of mortality deceleration. Even if individual hazard rate follows a Gompertz law, if the population is heterogeneous, the population hazard rate may exhibit late-life deceleration.
* [[Redundancy exhaustion]] – in the [[reliability theory of aging]], an organism's redundancy (reserves) are exhausted at extremely old ages, so every random hit results in death. In more detailed accounts, this only holds in relatively simple organisms – in more complex organisms with various subsystems, deceleration is less present or entirely absent.
* Less risky behavior and more sheltered environment for older people {{Harv|Greenwood|Irwin|1939}}.
* Various evolutionary explanations.

== Modeling ==
Late-life mortality deceleration can be modeled via modifications of the Gompertz law, using various [[logistic function|logistic models]].

== Relevance ==
The rates of late-life mortality are important for pensions. For example, the mortality rates in late life (after age 85) are of particular interest for the [[baby boom]] generation, which will reach this age starting in 2030, and for pensions funding calculations.

Late-life mortality rates are of basic importance for understanding aging, both for organisms generally, and for humans specifically.

New York, NY, USA: The National Archives at New York City.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|America]]n stage and silent film star.

==Personal life==
Taylor was born as '''Loretta Helen Cooney''' in [[New York City]] on April 1, 1883, of Irish extraction, to James and Elizabeth (née Dorsey) Cooney.&lt;ref name="search.ancestry.com"/&gt; She had a younger sister, Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; She married her first husband, Charles Alonzo Taylor (born January 20, 1864, South Hadley, Massachusetts – died March 21, 1942, Glendale, California), on May 1, 1901, aged 18. He was almost two decades her senior. They had two children, [[Dwight Taylor (writer)|Dwight Oliver Taylor]] (January 1, 1903 – December 31, 1986) and Marguerite Courtney (August 13, 1904 – February 8, 1995), but divorced circa 1910.&lt;ref name="search.ancestry.com"/&gt; 

On December 22, 1912, she married [[United Kingdom|British]]-born playwright [[J. Hartley Manners]], who wrote the play ''[[Peg o' My Heart]]'', a successful play and an enduring personal triumph for Taylor, who toured in it extensively throughout the country. The play's success inspired a [[Peg o' My Heart (1922 film)|1922 film version]] starring Taylor and directed by [[King Vidor]]. A six-reel print of the film survives in the Motion Picture Division of the [[Library of Congress]]. The marriage was successful and Taylor remained married to Manners until his death in 1928. By law, Taylor lost her U.S. citizenship by marrying a foreign national. A widow, Taylor reclaimed by naturalization, on September 11, 1930, her United States citizenship (cert #3234876). Her petition notes her "not having acquired any other nationality by affirmative act".&lt;ref name="naturalization"/&gt;

==Stage Work==
{{unsourced|section|date=July 2016}}
Taylor made her Broadway debut in ''The Great John Ganton'' in 1908 and appeared in other stage productions such as ''The Ringmaster'', ''Alias Jimmy Valentine'', ''Seven Sisters'', ''Lola Lola'', and ''The Bird of Paradise''. Taylor also appeared in other productions, including ''One Night in Rome'', ''The Wooing of Eve'' and the special production, ''Laurette Taylor in Scenes From Shakespeare''. In the latter production, she performed scenes from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/laurette-taylor-61942 |publisher=ibdb.com |title=Laurette Taylor |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/laurette-taylor-in-scenes-from-shakespeare-8700 |publisher=ibdb.com |title=Laurette Taylor in Scenes from Shakespeare |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


According to New York Times theatre critic [[Brooks Atkinson]], it was ''The Girl in Waiting'' (1910), which "made her a star."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Broadway|last=Atkinson|first=Brooks|publisher=Macmillan|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=37–38|type=|format=|asin=|asin-tld=|bibcode=|lccn=75-109446|archive-url=|dead-url=|layurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her acting, he wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;By the time she was in her late teens, she had created a highly individual technique of acting that was spontaneous and eloquent; it consisted of variations in tempo, tentative movements that were not quite completed, quizzical glances, absorption in what other actors were saying, and, of course, a warm, expressive voice that always seemed to be addressed directly to the individual theatergoer. 'Luminous' was the word most frequently used about her performances''.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The effect was so seemingly spontaneous that, early in her career, some doubted she was deliberately acting, as "she employed none of the ritualistic mannerisms or extravagances of the conventional acting of her day."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her biggest hit was ''[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/peg-o-my-heart-7544 Peg o' My Heart].'' A simple Cinderella-formula vehicle written for her by her husband Manners, it ran on Broadway from December 20, 1912 to May 1914, setting a new Broadway dramatic-play run record of 607 performances. The play earned her and her husband about $10,000 a week, made Taylor "the most generally worshiped [theatrical] star of her time," and cemented her reputation as a skilled actress. After it closed on Broadway, Taylor starred in the London production until German Zeppelin bombing closed it down in 1915.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

In 1917 she appeared in ''Out There,'' (another vehicle written for her by Manners) playing "an obscure Cockney waif" who, "by patriotism and idealism" managed to become a uniformed Red Cross nurse. "She relieved the suffering of wounded English soldiers by attending to them professionally and by charming them in person." A line from the play - "If I go, will you go?" - became the headline of a highly effective armed forces recruiting poster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 1918, Taylor starred in yet another successful Manners vehicle, ''Happiness'' (she would later reprise the role in the 1924 movie of the same name)''.'' According to Atkinson, the play version was "a sentimental comedy about a Brooklyn errand girl who taught a rich customer the secret of happiness."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Soon after, Taylor toured the nation with a revival of ''Peg o' My Heart'', which reopened on Broadway at the Cort Theater on February 14, 1921, and ran for another 692 performances.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

However, by the 1920s, public taste had become more sophisticated. Taylor had always starred in the kind of simple, formulaic plays which had delighted pre-World War I middle-class audiences, and her popularity waned. ''New York Times''  theatre critic John Corbin wrote that she "had probably the greatest talent, the highest spirit of our times," but that her dated material held her back.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Attempting to change course, Manners then wrote a serious play for her, ''The National Anthem'', a play with "high motives" which "rebuked and renounced the jazz generation." It opened in 1922 and, unsurprisingly, failed. It was the last time Taylor appeared in a play by her husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Few of Taylor's performances survive on celluloid.{{cn|date=July 2016}} 

In 1924, Taylor starred in a film version of ''[[Happiness (1924 film)|Happiness]]'', directed by [[King Vidor]], which told of the adventures of a young shopgirl, "Jenny Wray", who learns that riches do not necessarily lead to happiness. The cast included [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Patrick H. O'Malley, Jr.|Pat O'Malley]]. The same year, Taylor starred in another screen version of Manners' dramatic play, ''One Night In Rome'', in which she played the dual roles of Duchess Mareno/Madame Enigme. Taylor seems to have enjoyed making ''One Night in Rome'' as she kept a personal print of the movie to always show guests at her home, running it over and over again. Taylor's friend [[Noël Coward]] spent a weekend at her home. He was inspired by that visit to write, in just three days, his comedy of manners ''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'' (1925).{{cn|date=July 2016}} 

The play, a comedic dissection of a family whose theatrical excesses drive  their unsuspecting visitors to distraction, was a major hit from the moment of its August 6, 1925 debut. It also caused a serious and permanent rift in the friendship of Taylor and Coward.{{cn|date=July 2016}} She suffered from severe [[alcoholism]] for many years, a condition which sharply limited her appearances from the late 1920s throughout her career.{{cn|date=July 2016}} In 1938, she headed the cast in a revival of ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]'' and did not appear again until her re-emergence in Williams' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' in 1944; her performance received nearly unanimously rapturous reviews and won her the [[New York Drama Critics Award]] for Best Actress of the season.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Motion Pictures==
{{unsourced|section|date=July 2016}}
Taylor planned to make her film debut in ''[[Peg o' My Heart (1922 film)|Peg o' My Heart]]'', but the film version of the hit play was coveted by nearly every screen actress, including [[Mary Pickford]], who made an offer considerably in excess of the highest amount ever paid for the picture rights to a play or a story. The rights to the film were coveted because of the production's established popularity. Almost any actress in the famous role would be assured of a resounding success, however Taylor doggedly clung to the movie rights for her own use, should she ever commit to appearing in a film. It took years for the play to be filmed and released. [[King Vidor]] remembered in his autobiography, ''A Tree Is A Tree'':&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I soon landed a job at the old Metro studio on Romaine Street – the assignment: to direct Laurette Taylor in [[Peg o' My Heart (1922 film)|Peg O' My Heart]]. Although I had never seen Miss Taylor, her name carried with it a certain magic to my young ears."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The play was considerably expanded for the film version, and the final production was an immediate success with audiences. Taylor went on to make another adaptation of one of her stage successes, ''[[Happiness (1924 film)|Happiness]]'', and then a third and final film for MGM, ''[[One Night in Rome]]''.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

She never appeared in another film, although [[David O. Selznick]] did invite her to film a sound test for a role in his 1938 film ''[[The Young in Heart]]'', which Taylor did, but she declined the part and actress [[Minnie Dupree]] was cast. (The sound film test exists and has been shown on TV from time to time). In preparing interviews for what became ''[[Broadway: The Golden Age]]'', Rick McKay kept asking each person "Who influenced you the most" and time and time again, Laurette Taylor's name was mentioned.  McKay ended up devoting an entire section to Taylor, and it includes a section on her 1938 screen test.

==Approach to Acting==
Taylor wrote an essay on acting, titled "The Quality Most Needed", which was included in some of the early editions of the text "Actors on Acting". In it, Taylor muses on the importance of imagination over physical beauty for the actress wishing to truly create art. She sharply criticizes performances where you can ''"see the acting"'', and warns against paying too much attention to the traditions of acting, saying it "cramps creative instinct". To Taylor, the imaginative actress will leave you with a feeling that you can imagine her character's conduct "[i]n any position, aside from the situations involved in the actions of the play". Taylor applauded the imaginative actress who "builds a picture, using all her heart and soul and brain", not for the audience but for herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheilaomalley.com/archives/000827.html Sheila O'Malley website archive], sheilaomalley.com; accessed July 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Taylor died from a [[coronary thrombosis]] on December 7, 1946, at age 63. Her ashes were interred in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City. Her great-granddaughter, Chloe Taylor, is an actress in [[Los Angeles, California]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Legacy==
Writing after Taylor's death, [[Tennessee Williams]] paid tribute to "the great warmth of her heart", saying, "There was a radiance about her art which I can compare only to the greatest lines of poetry, and which gave me the same shock of revelation as if the air about us had been momentarily broken through by light from some clear space beyond us."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/31/specials/williams-taylor.htm Tennessee Williams' tribute to Laurette Taylor], nytimes.com; accessed July 26, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the play ''Laurette'', starring [[Judy Holliday]] and directed by [[José Quintero]], closed out of town in [[Philadelphia]] due to Holliday's battle with breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Holliday Faces Surgery", ''The New York Times'', October 12, 1960, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; For years, film director [[George Cukor]] tried unsuccessfully to launch a film version of Taylor's life. In 1963, a musical adaptation of ''Laurette'' opened on Broadway. The musical, titled ''Jennie'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=3033 Internet Broadway Database: ''Jennie'']&lt;/ref&gt; starred [[Mary Martin]] in the title role. Its book, by [[Arnold Schulman]], is credited as having been suggested by Marguerite Courtney's ''Laurette'', and its score was by [[Howard Dietz]] and [[Arthur Schwartz]]. It ran for only 82 performances, receiving mediocre reviews. A one-act play, ''Opening Night'', appeared briefly off-Broadway in October 1963. [[Peggy Wood]] portrayed Fanny Ellis, a once-famous star who is preparing for a performance in her dressing room. Many thought Fanny was actually Taylor. Wood appeared with Ruth Gates. The play ran for only 47 performances. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the 2004 documentary ''[[Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There]]'', numerous [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veterans cited Taylor's performance in ''Glass Menagerie'' and ''Outward Bound'' as the most memorable stage performances they had ever seen. A rare sound film clip of Taylor in a [[screen test]] made for [[David O. Selznick]]'s studio is included in the documentary. The test, for a role in the film ''[[The Young in Heart]]'', reportedly did not meet the approval of studio executives. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Notable fans===
*Actor/teacher [[Uta Hagen]]'s highly regarded 1991 acting text ''A Challenge for the Actor'' describes Taylor as her "idol" and "an inspiration", seeing her as the ultimate example of an actor working from the inside out. Hagen praised Taylor for saying that her identification with a character wasn't complete until she was "wearing the underpants of the character". Hagen's description of Taylor's acting was that she subjectively developed her actions and words, which "always sprang from her as though for the very first time".&lt;ref&gt;[[Uta Hagen|Hagen, Uta]] 1991. ''A Challenge for the Actor''. New York: Scribner's; {{ISBN|0-684-19040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Actor [[Charles Durning]] described seeing Taylor's acting: "I thought they pulled her off the street. She was ... so natural".&lt;ref name="Broadway video"&gt;{{YouTube|5EExb7iDBe8|Charles Durning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Actor [[Martin Landau]] said Taylor "was almost like this woman had found her way into the theatre, through the stage door, and was sort of wandering around the kitchen".&lt;ref name="Broadway video"/&gt;
*New York Theater Guild Actress [[Peg Entwistle]] (aka the "Hollywood Sign Girl") was a fan from the age of 13, having first seen Taylor in 1921 on Broadway in the revival of ''[[Peg O' My Heart]]''. Entwistle was so influenced by Taylor's performance that she changed her name from Millicent to "Peg" for the rest of her life. Years later, in 1932, Entwistle co-starred with Taylor on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[James Barrie]]'s comedy [[Alice Sit-by-the-Fire]].&lt;ref&gt; Zeruk, James ''Peg Entwistle and the Hollywood Sign Suicide: A Biography'' ([[McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.]], October 25, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-7313-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">'''Margie Pitts Hames''' (December 8, 1933 – July 19, 1994) was an [[Atlanta]] civil rights lawyer who argued the [[abortion rights]] case [[Doe v. Bolton]] before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="education"/&gt;

Hames was born in [[Milton, Tennessee]] to a poor rural family.  As a schoolgirl, Hames encountered a schoolteacher who stated that the only acceptable time for an abortion was "when a black man raped a white woman."&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown-Nagin|first1=Tomika|title=Margie Pitts Hames and the Other Landmark Abortion Rights Case: Recalling a "Swashbuckling" Woman Lawyer|url=http://legalhistoryblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/margie-pitts-hames-and-other-landmark.html|website=Legal History Blog|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Hames graduated from Kittrell High School in [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;{{cite web|title=HAMES, MARGIE PITTS Margie Pitts Hames papers, 1969-1993|url=http://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/hames825/printable|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a [[legal secretary]], Hames began studying law at [[Middle Tennessee State University]]. She later transferred to [[Vanderbilt University]], where she earned bachelor's and law degrees in 1961.&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Margie Hames, 60; Lawyer Argued Case Tied to Roe v. Wade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/22/obituaries/margie-hames-60-lawyer-argued-case-tied-to-roe-v-wade.html|accessdate=February 6, 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=July 22, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Hames entered law practice in Atlanta with the law firm of [[Fisher &amp; Phillips]], specializing in [[labor-management relations]]. In 1969, after the birth of her two children, Hames started volunteer work for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The [[Ford Foundation]] had funded this project with the goal of preventing confrontations between civil rights demonstrators and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Emory"/&gt;

In 1970. the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the Georgia Legal Aid Society hired Hames to contest a 1968 abortion law in Georgia. The plaintiff "Doe" was Sandra Bensing Cano, a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who had been unable to get a legal abortion. The defendant was the Georgia attorney general, Arthur Bolton.&lt;ref name="GA encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Doe v. Bolton (1973)|journal=New Georgia Encyclopedia|date=November 4, 2014|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/doe-v-bolton-1973|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hames was the main lawyer in ''Doe vs Bolton'' when it came before the US Supreme Court along with ''[[Roe vs. Wade]]''. On January 22, 1973, the court overturned the Georgia law.&lt;ref name="GA encyclopedia"/&gt;

In 1971, Hames opened her own law firm. She would eventually served as legal counsel for the Atlanta Surgi Center, the Hillcrest Clinic, the Summit Medical Center, [[Midtown Hospital]], and the Atlanta Center for Reproductive Health.&lt;ref name="Emory"/&gt; She also handled [[civil rights]] claims regarding [[police brutality]], [[employment discrimination]], [[welfare rights]] and education cases.&lt;ref name="blog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emory"/&gt; In 1982, she ran unsuccessfully for the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="education"/&gt;

In 1994, Hames died at age 60 at [[Piedmont Hospital]] in Atlanta after suffering a [[heart attack]] while driving.&lt;ref name="education"/&gt; She is buried in Milton Cemetery in Milton, Tennessee.&lt;ref name="find a grave"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margie Pitts Hames|url=https://findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=75290834|website=Find a Grave|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous==
In 2006, as part of a court challenge, Cano (died September 30, 2014) claimed that Hames lied to her and pressured her into participating in Doe vs Bolton. Before her death, Hames had rejected this coercion claim.&lt;ref name="washington times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wetzstein|first1=Cheryl|title=Sandra Cano, the 'Mary Doe' of landmark abortion case, die|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/1/sandra-cano-mary-doe-landmark-abortion-case-dies|accessdate=February 6, 2016|publisher=Washington Times|date=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[SCOTUS|US Supreme Court]] rejected Cano's challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, Bill. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/10/10/scotus.abortion/index.html "Court won't rethink 'Mary Doe' abortion case"], ''CNN'' (2006-10-10).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musa al-Sadr''' ({{lang-ar|الامام موسى الصدر}}{{lrm}}; {{lang-fa|سید موسى صدر}}{{lrm}}; 4 June 1928 – disappeared in Libya on 31 August 1978) is a [[Lebanese people in Iran|Lebanese-Iranian]]&lt;ref name="Chehabi"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distant Relations: Iran and Lebanon in the Last 500 Years |first1=Hussein |last1=Chehabi | first2=Rula Jurdi |last2=Abisaab| ISBN=978-1860645617|publisher=I.B.Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Distant_Relations.html?id=elHww0W0ZO4C|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] religious leader from a long line of distinguished clerics tracing their ancestry back to [[Jabal Amel]].

Born in the Chaharmardan neighbourhood of [[Qom]], [[Iran]], he underwent both seminary and secular studies in Iran. He belongs to the [[Sadr (name)|Sadr]] family from [[Jabal Amel]] in Lebanon, a branch of [[Moosavi (name)|Musawi family]] tracing to [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa Ibn Jaafar]], the seventh [[Shia Imam]] and ultimately to the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima. Therefore, Musa al-Sadr is often styled with the honorific title ''[[Sayyid]]''. He left Qom for [[Najaf]] to study theology and returned to Iran after the [[1958 Iraqi coup d'état]].

Some years later, Sadr went to [[Tyre, Lebanon]] as the emissary of Ayatollahs [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi|Borujerdi]] and [[Muhsin al-Hakim|Hakim]]. [[Fouad Ajami]] called him a "towering figure in modern Shi'i political thought and praxis".&lt;ref name="Nasr1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed H.|title=Expectation of the Millennium: Shiʻism in History|year=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press, Albany|location=Albany, NY|page=425|url=https://books.google.com.lb/books?id=btmNZgztDrAC&amp;pg=PA425&amp;lpg=PA425&amp;dq#v=onepage}}, chapter 26&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia population of Lebanon]] "a sense of community".&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt; In Lebanon, he founded and revived many organizations including schools, charities, and the [[Amal Movement]].

On 25 August 1978, Sadr and two companions departed for Libya to meet with government officials at the invitation of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. The three were last seen on 31 August. They were never heard from again. Many theories exist around the circumstances of Sadr's disappearance, none of which have been proven. His whereabouts remain unknown to this day.

==Early life and education==

===Family background===
Musa al-Sadr came from a long line of clerics tracing their ancestry back to [[Jabal Amel]].&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

His great-great-grandfather [[Sadr al-Din bin Saleh|S. Salih b. Muhammad Sharafeddin]], a high-ranking cleric, was born in [[Chehour|Shhour]], a village near [[Tyre, Lebanon]]. Following a frantic turn of events related to an anti-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] uprising, he left for Najaf.&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt; Sharafeddin's son, Sadreddin, left Najaf for [[Isfahan]], which was then the most important centre of religious learning in Iran. He returned to Najaf shortly before his death in 1847. The youngest of his five sons, [[Ismail as-Sadr|Ismail]] (''as-Sadr''), was born in Isfahan, in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]]-ruled [[Iran]], and eventually became a leading [[mujtahid]].

The second son of Ismail, also named [[Sadr al-Din al-Sadr|Sadreddin]], was born in [[Ottoman Iraq]] and also decided to settle permanently in Iran. He became Musa al-Sadr's father. While living in Iran, Sadreddin married a daughter of Ayatollah Hussein Tabatabaei Qomi, an Iranian religious leader. She would become Musa al-Sadr's mother.&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

===Early life===
Musa al-Sadr was born in the Cheharmardan neighborhood of [[Qom]], Iran, on 4 June 1928.&lt;ref name=abaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samii|first=Abbas William|title=The Shah's Lebanon policy: the role of SAVAK|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=1997|volume=33|issue=1|pages=66–91|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00263209708701142|accessdate=21 August 2013|doi=10.1080/00263209708701142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ʻAlī Rāhnamā. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=Bmz9y2osH1YC&amp;pg=PA195 ''Pioneers of Islamic Revival''] Palgrave Macmillan, 1994 {{ISBN|978-1856492546}} p 195&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended Hayat Elementary School in Qom where he attended seminary classes informally; he started his official seminary education in 1941. His teachers considered him a "quick learner and remarkably knowledgeable for his young age". After a while he started teaching other students "lower-level" courses. This coincided with the "liberalizing of Iranian politics", the political climate of his time was secular, so that most religious scholars "felt politically and socially marginalized".&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

To have some influence in the "national life" he concluded that he had to become familiar with "modern science and contemporary world". As a result, he started a "full secular education" alongside his seminary studies. He moved to [[Tehran]], where he completed a degree in [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] (''Fiqh'') and political sciences from [[Tehran University]] and learned some English and French.&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt; He then returned to Qom to study theology and [[Islamic philosophy]] under [[Allameh Tabatabaei|Allamah Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai]].&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt;

==In Iraq==
Following the death of his father in 1953, he left Qom for Najaf to study theology under Ayatollah [[Muhsin al-Hakim]] and [[Abul Qasim Khui]].&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt; There he had teachers such as: Ayatollah Hakim, Shaykh Morteza al Yasin, [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei|Ayatollah Abulqasim Khu'i]], Shaykh Hossein Hilli, Shaykh Sadra Badkubahi, and others, some of whom became ''[[Marja'|Marja]]'' after [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi|Ayatollah Borujerdi]]'s death. Musa al-Sadr became a ''[[mujtahid]]'' in Najaf. In 1955 he traveled to Lebanon where he met [[Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din al-Musawi|Abd al-Hossein Sharafeddin]]. He had met him previously in 1936 when his family had hosted Abd al-Husayn in Iran. The same year he left Iran and returned to Najaf and, in the autumn of 1956, he married the daughter of Ayatollah Azizollah Khalili.&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

==Return to Iran==
After the [[14 July Revolution|1958 Iraqi coup d'état]] and the overthrow of the monarchy in Iraq, Sadr returned to Iran. There, he accepted the request of Ali Davani, who was sent by Ayatollah Shariatmadari, and became an editor of ''Darsha'i az maktab-e Eslam'', also known as ''Maktab-e Eslam'', a journal published by the [[Hawza]] of Qom and endorsed by Ayatollah Broujerdi. He began contributing with the third issue, focusing on Islamic economics, "a novel subject at the time".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} His articles in this field were then published as a book. He soon became the journal's "de facto editor-in-chief". He left the journal in December 1959 along with some of its original founders.&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

Musa Sadr also took part in devising a new scheme for ''Hawza'' called "''Tarh-e Moqddamati-ye eslah-e howzeh''", which was then withdrawn, in cooperation with [[Mohammad Beheshti]]. In 1959, Sadr founded a private high school which provided an alternative to the state educational system for "observant parents".&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

==Departure to Lebanon==
[[Image:Musa Al-Sadr and AbdulNaser.jpg|thumb|right|Musa Sadr with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in the 1960s]]

Musa al-Sadr declined Ayatollah Broujerdi's request to go to Italy as his representative and instead left Qom for Najaf. There [[Ayatollah Muhsin al-Hakim]] urged him to accept an invitation&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt; to become the leading Shi'a figure in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], succeeding [[Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Din al-Musawi|Abdul Hussein Sharif Al Din]], who had died in 1957. He left Najaf for Tyre in late 1959,&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt; as the "emissary" of Ayatollah Broujerdi and Ayatollah Hakim.&lt;ref name="Nasr1"/&gt; At the request of some clerics, he later made several trips to Iran delivering several lectures such as "Islam is a Religion of Life" and "The World is Ready to Accept the Call of Islam." The latter included presenting his experiences in Lebanon and emphasizing the need to work "towards the betterment of Muslims."&lt;ref name="Chehabi"/&gt;

In 1967, Imam al-Sadr traveled to [[West Africa]] to get acquainted with the Lebanese community and inspect its affairs and worked to link them to their homeland. He also met with Ivorian President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] and Senegalese President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] and provided symbolic assistance to orphans in [[Senegal]]. Senghor praised the Imam's gesture, pointing out that he is following his activities with great interest, which had a great influence in spreading the feeling of love and faith among the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imamsadr.net/Home/contents1.php?id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadr, who became known as ''Imam Musa'', quickly became one of the most prominent advocates for the Shia population of Lebanon, a group that was both economically and politically disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=NB&gt;{{cite book|pages=16, 32 |author=Nicholas Blanford |title=Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel |publisher=Random House |year=2011 |ISBN=9781400068364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Sadr] worked tirelessly to improve the lot of his community – to give them a voice, to protect them from the ravages of war and inter communal strife," said [[Vali Nasr]].&lt;ref name="Val"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Vali|title=The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future|publisher=W.

In 1969, Imam Musa was appointed the first head of the [[Supreme Islamic Shia Council (in Lebanon)|Supreme Islamic Shia Council]] (SISC) in Lebanon, ({{lang-ar|المجلس الإسلامي الشيعي الأعلى}}) an entity meant to give the Shia more say in government.

For the next four years, Sadr engaged the leadership of Syrian [[Alawites|‘Alawī]]s in an attempt to unify their political power with that of the [[Twelver|Twelver Shia]]. Although controversial, recognition of the ‘Alawī as Shi'a coreligionists came in July 1973 when he and the ‘Alawī religious leadership successfully appointed an ‘Alawī as an official [[mufti]] to the Twelver community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/syria-alawis-and-shiism/|title=Syria's Alawis and Shiism – Martin Kramer on the Middle East|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talhamy9&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talhamy|first=Yvette|title=The Syrian Muslim Brothers and the Syrian-Iranian Relationship|journal=The Middle East Journal|date=Autumn 2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=561–580|doi=10.1353/mej.0.0088|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/mej/summary/v063/63.4.talhamy.html|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He revived the ''Jami'at al-Birr wal-Ihsan'' charity, founded by S. Salih b. Muhammad Sharafeddin and gathered money for The Social Institute (al-Mu'assasa al-Ijtima'iyya), an orphanage in Tyre. In 1963, Sadr established a sewing school and nursery named The Girls' Home (Bayt al-Fatat). The same year, he established The Institute of Islamic Studies (Ma'had al-Dirasat al-Islamiyya). In 1964, Sadr started Burj al-Shimali Technical Institute, whose funding was provided by Shi'a benefactors, bank loans, and the Lebanese Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt; In 1974, he founded, with [[Hussein el-Husseini]], the Movement of the Disinherited ({{lang-ar|حركة المحرومين}}) to press for better economic and social conditions for the Shia. They established a number of schools and medical clinics throughout southern Lebanon, many of which are still in operation today.&lt;ref name="Rihani"/&gt; Sadr attempted to prevent the descent into violence that eventually led to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] by beginning a fast in a mosque in Beirut. There he was visited by Lebanese from all factions – both Muslim and Christian. [[Yasser Arafat]] and Syrian Foreign Minister [[Abd al-Halim Khaddam]], also visited him. Formation of a national unity cabinet resulted from the meeting and Sadr's attempt to establish peace was a temporary success.&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt;

During the war, he aligned himself with the [[Lebanese National Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writers|title=The Imam Musa Sadr|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/musa-sadr/|website=almashriq.hiof.no|publisher=Al Mashriq|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Movement of the Disinherited and in cooperation with [[Mostafa Chamran]]&lt;ref name="Roshan"/&gt; developed an armed wing known as ''Afwāj al-Muqāwamat al-Lubnāniyyah'' ({{lang-ar|أفواج المقاومة اللبنانية}}), better known as [[Amal Movement|Amal]] ({{lang-ar|أمل}} meaning "hope"&lt;ref name="John"/&gt;),&lt;ref name=abaw/&gt; which assembled youth and educated generation of Husaynis and Mousawis families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=The Failure of Political Islam|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674291416|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEGw8S3ovaoC |accessdate=26 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia were the only major community without a militia group in the land of militias; Amal was created by Sadr to protect Shia rights and interests.&lt;ref name="John"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|title=The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199826650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzepS15bgicC&amp;pg=PT178&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjw79rv_KvNAhWhCJoKHZA6ATsQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Musa%20Sadr|accessdate=27 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charisma ===
Musa al-Sadr has been referred to by [[Fouad Ajami]] as a "towering figure in modern Shi'i political thought and praxis."&lt;ref name="Nasr1" /&gt; According to him, even American diplomats effusively described Musa Sadr after meeting him. He supports his claim by referring to a cable sent home by [[George M. Godley]], a U.S. ambassador to Lebanon: "He is without debate one of the most, if not the most, impressive individual I have met in Lebanon. . . . His [[charisma]] is obvious and his apparent sincerity is awe-inspiring".&lt;ref name="The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|date=June 1986|title=The vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A4259316/GPS?sid=wikipedia|journal=The Atlantic|pages=77|accessdate=1 June 2016}}{{subscription required|via=General OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lebanon, he had garnered significant popularity "due to his good rapport with young people."&lt;ref name="abaw" /&gt;

Standing at {{convert|6|ft|6|in|m|order=flip|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Mackey, ''Mirror of the Arab World: Lebanon in Conflict'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company (2008), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; scholar [[Fouad Ajami]] describes Sadr's charisma and magnetism as such: &lt;blockquote&gt;Lebanon has long been a country finicky about the looks, the aura, al haiba of a leader. The Shia in particular have been noted to be a people of some vanity. In the Shia tradition, the Imams were not only morally infallible men (an Imam was said to be masum, not subject to error), but also physically perfect beings. A blind man or a lame man would not have been accepted as an Imam. Musa al Sadr, a handsome man of striking looks, was true to his people's fantasy of what a man of piety and distinction and high birth slated for bigger things should look like. He was, in addition, a dazzling speaker in a culture that exalted the spoken word and those who could express in classical Arabic what was on the minds of others.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad Ajami, The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon'', Cornell University Press (2012), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sayyid Musa winked at traditions with a daring uncommon to men of his clerical calling and background. He was a hit with women, who admired his looks and his elegance and were pleased that they did not have to scurry out of living rooms and meetings when he arrived, as they did with ulama of more conservative outlook. As befitting a man of the religious mantle, he refrained from shaking hands with women, and his aides and companions forewarned Christian women who were to meet him that they should not try to shake hands. But even this prohibition was violated now and them. A woman who admitted being drawn to him, being nearly hypnotized by him, once held out a hand to him, and he took it between his two hands, saying that he was not supposed to do so, and that he was doing what he shouldn't be doing, that he would not do it again.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad Ajami, ''The Vanished Imam: Musa al Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon'', Cornell University Press (2012), pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disappearance==

On 25 August 1978, al-Sadr and two companions, Sheikh Muhammad Yaacoub and journalist Abbas Badreddine, departed for Libya to meet with government officials&lt;ref name=yal3sep&gt;{{cite news

It is widely believed, at least by Lebanese Shia Muslims, that Gaddafi ordered al-Sadr's killing,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic"/&gt; but differing motivations exist. Libya has consistently denied responsibility, claiming that Sadr and his companions left Libya for Italy.&lt;ref name="Norton, Augustus R 2007"&gt;Norton, Augustus R. Hezbollah A Short Story. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, supporters of the missing cleric pointed out that al-Sadr's baggage was found in a Tripoli hotel and there was no evidence of his arrival in Rome.&lt;ref name="Norton, Augustus R 2007"/&gt; Airlines could not confirm that al-Sadr had ever flown to Italy from Libya.&lt;ref name="Norton, Augustus R 2007"/&gt;

al-Sadr's son claimed that he remains secretly in jail in Libya but did not provide proof.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (31 August 2010) [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=118823 "Imam Sadr and companions still alive in captivity of Libya, son tells news agency"] ''The Daily Star'' (Lebanon).&lt;/ref&gt; Sadr's disappearance continues to be a major dispute between Lebanon and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3531276.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Middle East – Court in Lebanon summons Gaddafi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Lebanon|Lebanese Parliament Speaker]] [[Nabih Berri]] claimed that the Libyan regime, and particularly the Libyan leader, was responsible for the disappearance of Imam Musa al-Sadr, as London-based ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', a Saudi-run pan-Arab daily, reported on 27 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asharqalawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issue=10134&amp;article=379828 بري يحمل النظام الليبي ورئيسه مسؤولية «الجريمة المنظمة» في اختطاف موسى الصدر ورفيقيه, أخبار&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asharqalawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issue=10135&amp;article=380047 المجلس الشيعي في لبنان يدعو ليبيا إلى «كشف لغز» اختفاء موسى الصدر, أخبار&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=372294 Libya is responsible for Musa Sadr’s disappearance: paper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306221024/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=372294 |date=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tribute to his continuing popularity is that it is popular in parts of Lebanon to mimic his Persian accent.&lt;ref name="Val" /&gt; The Amal Party remains an important Shia organization in Lebanon and looks to al-Ṣadr as its founder.

[[File:Narbona 1849.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]

'''Narbona''' (1766 – August 30, 1849) was a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] chief who participated in the [[Navajo Wars]]. He was killed in a confrontation with U.S. soldiers on August 30, 1849.

Narbona was one of the wealthiest Navajo of his time due to the number of sheep and horses owned by his extended family group. He was not a "chief" of all of the Navajo as the independent minded Navajo had no central authority. However, he was very influential in the tribe due to the status gained from his wealth, personal reputation, and age during the time he negotiated with the white men.

Narbona became one of the most prominent tribal leaders after the massacre of 24 Navajo leaders in June, 1822 at [[Jemez Pueblo]]. They had been travelling under flag of truce to a peace conference with the New Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 67, 68, Sides, ''Blood and Thunder''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "1821_1847"&gt;[http://www.lapahie.com/Timeline_Mexican_1821_1847.cfm Navajo Timeline 1821-1847]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1835 he led the Navajo to a decisive victory in an ambush of a Mexican expedition in the [[Chuska Mountains]] led by Captain [[Blas de Hinojos]]. The site of the battle, Copper Pass ({{spell-nv|Béésh Łichííʼí Bigiizh}}), is now known as [[Narbona Pass]].&lt;ref name = "1821_1847" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 75-77, Sides, ''Blood and Thunder''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849, Narbona, with several hundred of his warriors, rode to meet a delegation led by Col. [[John M. Washington]] to discuss peace terms between the Navajo and the "New Men", Americans who had driven the Mexicans from what is now the Southwestern United States. The U.S. party was composed of both [[Regular Army (United States)|U.S. Regulars]] and local New Mexican auxiliaries.

After several misunderstandings, translators managed to work out an acceptable list of terms for peace between the two parties. As the peace council broke up, Sadoval, a young Navajo warrior of some distinction, began riding his horse to and fro, exhorting the 200–300 Navajo warriors in attendance to break the new treaty immediately. At this point, a [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] officer claimed that he noticed a horse that belonged to him being ridden by one of the Navajo warriors. Washington, put in the position of backing one of his troopers, demanded that the horse be immediately turned over. The Navajo refused, and the horse and its rider departed.

Washington commanded his troops to unlimber their cannon and prepare to fire if the Navajo refused to return the, now absent, property the Americans said was stolen. The Navajo again denied his request, and the Americans opened fire with cannon as well as rifles.

Narbona was mortally wounded in the fusillade, and according to eyewitnesses, he was scalped by one of the New Mexico militiamen. He was buried by his sons in the traditional Navajo fashion, bound in a "death knotted" blanket and cast into a crevice. Two of his finest horses were slaughtered to ensure he would not walk to the afterlife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8448">'''Oscar''' is a [[therapy cat]] living in the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], U.S. since 2005. He came to public attention in 2007 when he was featured in an article by geriatrician David Dosa in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''. According to Dosa, Oscar appears able to predict the impending death of terminally ill patients by choosing to nap next to people a few hours before they die. Hypotheses for this ability include that Oscar is picking up on the lack of movement in such patients or that he can smell biochemicals released by dying cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Leonard|first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7129952/Cat-predicts-50-deaths-in-RI-nursing-home.html|title=Cat predicts 50 deaths in RI nursing home|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar was also the subject of Dosa's 2010 book, ''Making Rounds With Oscar: The Extraordinary Gift of an Ordinary Cat''.&lt;ref name="apjan312010"/&gt;

==Background==
Oscar is a therapy cat that was one of six cats adopted in 2005 by the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. Steere House, which bills itself as a "pet friendly" facility that allows a variety of pets to visit and reside there, is a 41-bed unit that treats people with end-stage [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and other illnesses, most of whom are generally unaware of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steerehouse.org/Activities/pets|title=Pet therapy|publisher=Steere House website|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar has been described as generally aloof and "not a cat that's friendly to people",&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290840,00.html|title=Oscar the Cat Predicts Nursing Home Deaths|newspaper=Fox News|date=July 26, 2007|accessdate=March 20, 2009|author=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103101404/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290840,00.html|archive-date=2008-11-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes hissing at people when he wanted to be left alone.&lt;ref name=NEJM/&gt;

===Death prediction===
After Oscar had been at Steere House for around six months, staff noticed that Oscar often chose to nap next to residents who died within several hours of his arrival. It seemed to staff as if Oscar were trying to comfort and provide company to people as they died.&lt;ref name=sixsense&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/25/health/webmd/main3097899.shtml|first=Kathleen|last=Doheny|title=Cat's 'Sixth Sense' Predicting Death?|newspaper=CBS News|date=July 25, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJM&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17652647|title=A day in the life of Oscar the cat|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=357|issue=4|pages=328–9|last=Dosa|first=DM|year=2007|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/357/4/328.pdf|doi=10.1056/NEJMp078108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Teno, a physician at Steere House, clarified that "it's not that the cat is consistently there first. But the cat always does manage to make an appearance, and it always seems to be in the last two hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=Lester|last=Haines|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/26/nursing_home_cat/|title=Cat senses impending death|newspaper=The Register|date=July 26, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oscar accurately predicted 25 deaths, staff started calling family members of residents as soon as they discovered him sleeping next to someone in order to notify them and give them an opportunity to say goodbye before the impending death.&lt;ref name=NEJM/&gt; {{asof|January 2010}}, Oscar had accurately predicted approximately 50 patients' deaths.&lt;ref name="apjan312010"&gt;{{cite news|pmc=3603749|title=Just-Released Book Profiles Feline Angel of Death|first=|date=January 31, 2010|language=|author1=Henry, Ray|author2=Associated Press|newspaper=}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=How often does he do this with people who aren't dying?  How often do people die when he is available but doesn't show up?  In other words, what are the specificity and sensitivity (and discriminant validity)?|date=December 2016}}

Oscar made international headlines in 2007 after the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published an article about him by Steere House geriatrician David Dosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=An Angel With Whiskers: Interview with Dr. David Dosa, author of 'Making Rounds With Oscar: The Extraordinary Gift of an Ordinary Cat'|first=Carol|last=Kaufmann|work=AARP Bulletin|date=June 10, 2010|publisher=AARP|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible explanations===
Teno and Dosa hypothesized that Oscar is responding to the smell of chemicals released when someone dies&lt;ref name=sixsense/&gt; or some other odor emitted during death.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;

''CBS News'' consulted several animal specialists who had various hypotheses, such as that Oscar may be smelling some chemical that's released just before death and his attendance in rooms with that odor may be a learned behavior or that he's picking up on the stillness and lack of movement in the room rather than a smell.&lt;ref name=sixsense/&gt;

Some have argued that Oscar does not have an ability to predict death, and that this is a case of [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacGregor |first1=Trish |last2=MacGregor |first2=Rob |title=Sensing the Future: How to Tap Into Your Intuition and Read Signs From the Universe to Predict What's to Come |publisher=Page Street Publishing |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2015}}, it is believed that Oscar has accurately predicted 100 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raven|first1=David|title=Can Oscar the cat predict people's deaths?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/miracle-cat-predicts-deaths-100-5365056|website=mirror|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2010, Oscar was featured in episode 104 of Discovery Channel's show ''[[Weird or What?]]''.
*In 2013, [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Doctor Sleep (novel)|Doctor Sleep]]'' sequel to ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', grown-up Dan Torrance is aided at a hospice by a prescient cat who can sense when people are about to die. King stated in an interview that Oscar served as an inspiration to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2013/02/01/stephen-king-the-shining-doctor-sleep-preview |title=Stephen King unearths origin of 'The Shining' sequel 'Doctor Sleep' |publisher=EW.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205064751/http://shelf-life.ew.com/2013/02/01/stephen-king-the-shining-doctor-sleep-preview/ |archivedate=2013-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scene includes a retiree in a walker in front of the home dropping dead on the sidewalk when the cat walks in front of him and screeches.
*In 2015, Oscar inspired a children's book, ''Oscar il gatto custode'', written by Chiara Valentina Segré and illustrated by Paolo Domeniconi, published by the Italian publisher Camelozampa. The book was then published by Ragged Bears in the UK and by Gibbs-Smith in North America, with the title ''Oscar the guardian cat''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">[[File:Radium (stock horse).jpg|thumb|250px|Radium (1918-1947)]]
'''Radium''' was an outstanding [[Australia]]n bred  [[campdrafting|campdrafter]] and very influential ancestor of [[Australian Stock Horse]]s. He was a bay stallion bred by Donald Beaton of Levedale, [[Gloucester, New South Wales]]. This son of the outstanding campdrafter, Cecil (1899, by Red Gauntlet from Meretha II) from Black Bess by Hukatere (1882) was foaled on 11 November 1918. Beaton took great care in the breeding of his horses requiring horses with ability and stamina, for which he culled heavily.  Radium’s sire, Cecil was so successful that in 1913, his owner, Arch Simpson was asked to leave his champion campdrafter at home in order that other competitors had a chance to win the campdrafting event at Geary’s Flat Bushman’s Carnival. 

Radium was broken in by Archie Grant and Billy Tout when he was a two-year-old, after which he had several trips to the Cooplacurripa area. He began to show his exceptional ability as a stock horse as he developed and matured. Donald Beaton often drove long distances to compete at bushman’s carnivals with Radium tied behind the buggy. Radium would then compete in the campdraft, often winning and if he was going well, round off his success with an exhibition of campdrafting without a bridle. &lt;ref&gt;Starr, Joan. ''The Horse that Calls Australia Home'', Equine Educational, 1996, {{ISBN|1-875381-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circa 1928, Radium was sold to Herb O’Neil, who, as a friend of Donald Beaton, had ridden the horse in competitions for Beaton when he had been unable to get away from his property. Herb O’Neill competed extensively with Radium, winning over a large area of the state. Just prior to the [[Second World War]] (WWII), Radium won a Championship Campdraft at [[Kempsey, New South Wales]] with the next ten placings going to Radium’s sons and daughters. Radium was also highly successful in led contests for the best type of Stock Horse. During WWII, at a Dungog Bushman’s Carnival over 20 horses were competing in the led stock horse class. In this event Radium received the first placing with the remaining four all being his sons.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, Peter. ''Australian Stock Horse - Stallion Pedigree Book, Vol. 1'', Stock Journal Publishers, Adelaide, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radium stood at stud on "Kunderang Station" (now part of [[Oxley Wild Rivers National Park]]) for much of his life and had at least thirteen of his sons appear in Australian Stock Horse pedigrees. Quite a few horses had a double cross or were [[Outcrossing|line-bred]] to this great foundation sire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/guyFawkesHorsesV2App4.pdf Guy Fawkes Horses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321021106/http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/guyFawkesHorsesV2App4.pdf |date=2011-03-21 }} Retrieved on 2009-8-1&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His son, Chan was one of the smartest horses seen in a cattle camp and was a good sire. Another son, Dimray foaled in 1938 was a brilliant campdrafter and when retired to stud, he carried on the Radium tradition of producing top stock horses and campdrafters. It was as a sire that Dimray had a tremendous influence with his son Reality, his grandson Rivoli Ray and his great grandson, Cecil Bruce being Hall of Fame inductees. 

Radium died on 12 November 1947, at 29 years of age, of a genital malignancy. This was the end of the life of a truly great horse, but he was also the foundation of a great line of horses.

'''Rahel Hirsch''' (September 15, 1870 – October 6, 1953) was a German doctor and professor at the [[Charité]] medical school in Berlin. In 1913 she became the first woman in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] to be appointed a professor in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Fraulein Now Professor.

==Biography==
Rahel Hirsch was born on 15 September 1870 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], one of eleven children of [[:de:Mendel Hirsch|Mendel Hirsch]] {{Language icon|de}} (1833–1900). Mendel Hirsch was the director of the girls' school of the Jewish religious community in Frankfurt am Main. Mendel's father, Rahel's paternal grandfather, was the eminent rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].

From 1885 to 1889, Rahel Hirsch studied for her degree in education in [[Wiesbaden]]; she then worked until 1898 as a teacher. After her doctorate she became assistant to [[Friedrich Kraus]] at the [[Charité]].

Since she was Jewish, the takeover by the [[Nazi]]s meant she could no longer practice medicine. In October 1938 she moved to London, where one of her sisters lived. Since her degree was not recognized by the British, she worked as a [[laboratory]] assistant and later as a [[translator]].

She spent her last years plagued by depression, delusions and persecutory fears. She died in a [[mental hospital]] on the outskirts of [[London]] on 6 October 1953 aged 83.

==Legacy==
She is remembered by a sculpture in a square at the Charité, and by the naming after her of a stretch of road in front of the new [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/bezirk/gedenken/rahel_hirsch.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412063044/http://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/bezirk/gedenken/rahel_hirsch.html |archivedate=2013-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/stadtplan/?ADR_ZIP=10557&amp;ADR_STREET=Rahel-Hirsch-Stra%C3%9Fe%20&amp;ADR_INFO=%3Ca%20href=%22http://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte%22%3EBezirksamt%20Mitte%3C/a%3E]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Colvin Cox''' (25 July 1928 – last seen 14 January 1950) was a second-year [[Officer Cadet|cadet]] who disappeared from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]].

In January 1950, he was visited by a young man whose first name may have been George, three times over the course of a week. On the third occasion, Richard Cox and "George" left the grounds of the academy and were never seen again. According to an eyewitness account from another cadet, the two men seemed to have known each other somewhere other than West Point.  Cox is the only West Point cadet to have disappeared without a trace.

==Early life and military career==
Richard Cox was born in [[Mansfield, Ohio]]. After graduating from a public high school there in 1946, he volunteered for service in the [[United States Army]]. He joined the [[United States Constabulary]], a United States Army [[Gendarmerie]] force raised to be a police-type occupation and security force in Allied-occupied Germany.

In May 1947, he began his assignment to the Sixth Constabulary Regiment, based at [[Coburg]] in the [[American occupation zone]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Maihafer, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in the [[Staff (military)#Intelligence / security / information operations (2)|S-2]] (intelligence) section of Headquarters Company. Later in 1947, Cox applied for and received his appointment to [[West Point]], arriving at the [[United States Military Academy Preparatory School]] (then located at [[Stewart International Airport|Stewart Field]] near the academy proper) in January 1948.

Cox entered West Point in May 1948 and did well there. Academically, he was ranked at about 100 out of a class of 550. He joined West Point's athletic team and competed in a national [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] competition only a month before his disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://usconstabulary.com/richard_cox.html |title= Richard Cox, United States Constabulary Coburg, Germany 1947 |date=April 19, 2007 |website=United States Constabulary |publisher=United States Constabulary Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was engaged to be married; he and his fiancé, Betty Timmons, planned to marry after his graduation from West Point.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt;

==Disappearance==
At 4:45&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday, January 7, 1950, a man telephoned Cox's West Point classmate, Peter Hains. Hains was acting as [[Charge of Quarters]] in Cadet Company B-2 (part of the North Barracks) and answered incoming calls for company members. He later said the caller's "tone was rough and patronizing, almost insulting."&lt;ref name=Maihafer-p23&gt;Maihafer, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hains told the man that Cox was not in his room, the man replied, ''"Well, look, when he comes in, tell him to come on down here to the hotel. ... Just tell him George called – he'll know who I am.  We knew each other in Germany.  I'm just up here for a little while, and tell him I'd like to get him a bite to eat."''&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; Hains later stated he could not be completely certain the name given was "George", as he had answered many phone calls while on duty and that one had not seemed noteworthy at the time; Cox never referred to the man by name.&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Brean |first=Herbert |last2=Conant |first2=Luther |date=14 April 1952 |title=The Mystery of the Missing Cadet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage |magazine=Life |publisher=Time Inc. |publication-date=1952-03-14 |pages=149–161 |access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At  5:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a man entered Grant Hall - an area where cadets could meet guests - and asked to see Cox. The cadet on duty telephoned Cox, to tell him he had a visitor. The cadet later described the visitor as slightly under {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and weighing around {{convert|185|lb|kg}}. He was fair-haired, had a fair complexion and wore a belted trench-coat, but no hat. When Cox entered the Hall, he shook hands with the man; the cadet on duty later recalled he seemed glad to see him.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; Cox signed out in the Company B-2 Departure Book, indicating he would have dinner off-campus. However, Cox later admitted to his roommates they did not dine, but drank from a bottle of whiskey while sitting inside the man's parked car.&lt;ref name=Maihafer-p23-6&gt;Maihafer, p.23-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox returned to Cadet Company B-2, signed the Departure Book, took a shower, and slept off the effects of the alcohol. (His two roommates later revealed this.)&lt;ref name=Maihafer-p23-6 /&gt; As a prank, his roommates photographed him, slumped over his desk, asleep.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; At an indeterminate time that evening, Cox altered the military time he had written in the Departure Book, changing "1923" to "1823" to make it look as if he had attended the 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. cadet supper formation.&lt;ref&gt;Maihafer, p.90-1.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he had skipped the formation. This detail was not discovered until two years later, when an agent of the [[U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command]] had the Departure Book examined in a laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Maihafer, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; If the alteration had been discovered when it was fresh in January 1950, Cox could have been charged with violating the [[Cadet Honor Code]] and likely expelled.

The next morning, before attending the Sunday chapel service, Cox mentioned his visitor to his roommates. The man, Cox said, was a former [[United States Army Rangers|US Army Ranger]] who had served in the same unit as him in Germany. Cox said the man liked to brag about killing Germans during the war and had boasted about cutting off their private parts afterward. Another story he told Cox was about having gotten a German girl pregnant, and then murdering her to prevent her from having the baby.&lt;ref&gt;Maihafer, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; That afternoon, Cox signed out a second time to meet the man, returning at about 4.30 pm.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; The following six days were without incident. Cox mentioned his visitor once to his roommates. He remarked that he "hoped he wouldn't have to see the fellow again," giving them the impression he viewed the man with distaste.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt;

On Saturday, January 14, Cox watched a basketball game between the Army and [[Rutgers University]]. Afterwards, he was seen talking to a man thought to be "George," although the cadet who saw the two talking gave a description that differed greatly from the description given by the cadet who had seen the stranger in Grant Hall on January 7.  According to the eyewitness description from January 14, George was "dark haired and rough looking."  Cox returned to his room and mentioned to a roommate he was signing out to dine with his visitor again, although he appeared "not apprehensive, just sort of disgusted."&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; The two men left the grounds of the academy and vanished without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Jerry|title=Mystery Hides Man Who Went To Dinner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BHgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3503%2C278107|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=3 January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=West Point|series=America's Book of Secrets|airdate=2012-03-17|station=H2 Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Investigation==
Cox was supposed to return by 11 p.m. When he did not return, no alarm was raised because cadets occasionally returned late. His continued absence was reported to a superior officer at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., but again no action was taken as cadets had been known to stay out all night despite the punishment this would incur. On Sunday morning, his roommates reported all they knew of the matter to their superior; the [[New York State Police]] and the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] were informed. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] also became involved in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt;

Three days after Cox's disappearance, a public appeal for information was broadcast on nearby radio stations.&lt;ref name= Oblivion&gt;[http://brandypurdy.blogspot.com/2009/05/oblivion-mystery-of-west-point-cadet.html Oblivion: The Mystery of the West Point Cadet, Richard Cox], by Harry J. Maihefer.&lt;/ref&gt;   The grounds of West Point were intensively searched by helicopter and by troops on the ground.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; The [[Lusk Reservoir]] was dragged, the banks of the [[Hudson River]] were searched and a nearby pond was drained.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; The manhunt lasted two months but produced no significant leads. A search of Army records for a soldier who had served with Cox and matched the description of "George", only led to individuals who could not have been at West Point at the time of the disappearance.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; Cox's service in Germany was investigated and revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The theory that he had deliberately deserted from West Point was discounted, as he had left behind in his room $87 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|87|1950}} when adjusted for inflation) and two suits of civilian clothes.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt;

On March 15, 1950, Richard Cox was listed as [[absent without leave]].&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt; He was [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]] in 1957.&lt;ref name= Oblivion /&gt;

== The Jacobs investigation ==
Harry J. Maihafer's book ''Oblivion'' (1996) documents the investigation conducted by Marshall Jacobs of Cadet Cox, who "vanished without a trace" from West Point in January 1950.&lt;ref name="Harry J. Maihafer 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oblivion|date=1996|author=Harry J. Maihafer|publisher=Brassey's Inc|edition=1st | ISBN=1574880438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs, a retired history teacher, began his research on the Cox disappearance in 1985.  The more involved he became the more intrigued Jacobs became with Cox and the prior inconclusive investigations.  It was inconceivable to Jacobs that after 35 years this mystery had not been solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiaasen|first=Carl|title=The Case of the Missing Cadet Tracking The Clues For 38 Years|url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-02-28/news/26242967_1_cadet-west-point-fbi-files|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=28 February 1988|authorlink=Carl Hiaasen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs thoroughly investigated the case, traveling all around the country following up on new leads and revisiting old leads.  He interviewed Cox's family, friends, service pals, and classmates; [[CIA]], [[FBI]], and [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] agents; and West Point and Army officials. He researched West Point's archives and the files from the FBI, CIA, and CID investigations of Cox's disappearance, to which he gained access under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. Jacobs conducted a comprehensive and thorough investigation that took him over eight years to complete.  Among Jacobs' findings was that authorities had been remiss when they had discounted the theory that Richard Cox had disappeared deliberately.&lt;ref name="Harry J. Maihafer 1996"/&gt;  Jacobs came to believe that the presence of 87 dollars in Cox's shared room did not rule out the strong possibility that his visitor had helped him start a new career and life.&lt;ref name="Harry J. Maihafer 1996"/&gt;

When he was ready to reveal his findings Jacobs, admittedly not a writer, contacted Maihafer with hopes they could collaborate on a book. They did and the Jacobs investigation is revealed in the book ''Oblivion.'' The book has a section with photos including the snapshot that Cox's roommates took of him on January 7, 1950 sleeping off the effects of the alcohol he had consumed in his visitor's parked car a very short time earlier.

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL.

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

[[File:Aquila chrysaetos 3 (Martin Mecnarowski).jpg|thumb|In flight in Czech Republic]]
At one time, the '''[[golden eagle]]''' lived in a great majority of temperate [[Europe]], North [[Asia]], [[North America]], North [[Africa]], and [[Japan]]. Although widespread and quite secure in some areas, in many parts of the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas. The total number of individual golden eagles from around the range is estimated to range somewhere between 170,000 and 250,000 while the estimated total number of breeding pairs ranges from 60,000 to 100,000.&lt;ref name= Watson&gt;{{cite book|author=Watson, Jeff |title=The Golden Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj5MNvCkun0C|year=2010|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-1420-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich, T.D.; Beardmore, C.J.; Berlanga, H.; Blancher, P.J.; Bradstreet, M.S.W.; Butcher, G.S.; Demarest, D.W.; Dunn, E.H.; Hunter, W.C.; Inigo-Elias, E.E.; Martell, A.M.; Panjabi, A.O.; Pashley, D.N.; Rosenberg, K.V.; Rustay, C.M.; Wendt, J.S.; Will, T.C.

== Eurasia ==
In Europe, there are an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 breeding pairs. There was a great decline in [[Central Europe]] where they are now essentially restricted to the [[Apennine mountains|Apennine]], [[Alps]], and [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The strongholds in the continent are [[Spain]], which holds an estimated 1,300 breeding pairs, [[Norway]], which holds an estimated 860 to 1,040 breeding pairs and [[European Russia]], which holds an estimated 500 to 1,000 breeding pairs.&lt;ref name= Birdlife&gt;BirdLife International. (2004). ''Birds in Europe: Population estimates, trends and conservational status''. Birdlife International (Bird Conservation Series 12), Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Other European countries with stable and sizable populations include [[Italy]], with an estimated 476–541 pairs, [[Switzerland]], with 300–310 pairs and [[Romania]], with an estimated 85–130 pairs.&lt;ref name= Birdlife/&gt; The following nations are thought to have golden eagle populations that are increasing: [[Bulgaria]] with 150–170 pairs, [[Denmark]] with 1 known breeding pair, [[Finland]] with an estimated 300–350 pairs, [[France]] with approximately 390–460 pairs, [[Hungary]] with 3–5 known pairs, [[Ireland]] with 2 current pairs and [[Poland]] with approximately 35–40 pairs.&lt;ref name= Birdlife/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nankinov, D., A.

Dirección General de Conservación de la Naturaleza-Sociedad Española de Ornitología'', Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the authors of the previous study asserted that the population had increased in 2008 by perhaps 20% in Spain since the last survey in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Del Moral |author2=J. C. |year=2009|title=The Golden Eagle: breeding population in 2008 and census method|journal= Seguimiento de Aves |volume=32|pages=1–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Belarus]], the population has reportedly declined considerably due to trapping, poisoning and the draining and development of upland bogs.&lt;ref name= Ivanovski&gt;Ivanovski, V.V.

Soobshcheniya Pribaltiiskoi Komissii po Izucheniyu Migratsii Ptits Akademiya Nauk Estonskoi SSR 22:130–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The golden eagle is considered Critically Endangered in the [[Czech Republic]], where it was once quite common in the [[Beskids|Beskydy]] and [[Krkonoše|Krkonoše Mountains]] until logging hit the area hard around the time of World War II. All recent breeding attempts by the species in the Czech Republic are believed to have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kren, J. |title=Birds of the Czech Republic |publisher=Christopher Helm |year=2000 |isbn=0713647841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the last comprehensive survey of golden eagles took place in 2003, and found 442 occupied territories.&lt;ref name="MH_1"&gt;Mark Holling and the Rare Breeding Birds Panel [http://www.rbbp.org.uk/downloads/rbbp-report-2003-04.pdf Report for 2003-4] accessed 4 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A less thorough survey in 2007 showed that in addition to large numbers of territories in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]], there were a handful of birds in southern Scotland and northern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Holling |author2=Rare Breeding Birds Panel |year=2010 |title=Rare breeding birds in the United Kingdom in 2007 |journal=British Birds |volume=103 |pages=45–6 |url=http://www.rbbp.org.uk/downloads/rbbp-report-2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population is higher today in Scotland than it was in the 19th century, due to the heavy persecution at that time by sheep farmers, gamekeepers, and collectors.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; There may have been as few as 190 pairs in the 1950s, though this survey may have not been complete.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1969 and 2003 they nested in the [[Lake District]], Cumbria.&lt;ref name="MH_1"/&gt; In [[Ireland]], where it had been extinct due to hunting since 1912, efforts are being made to re-introduce the species. In April 2007, a pair of golden eagles produced the first chick to be hatched in the Republic of Ireland in nearly a century. Forty-six birds were released into the wild in [[Glenveagh National Park]], [[County Donegal]], from 2001 to 2006, with at least three known female fatalities since then. It is intended to release a total of sixty birds, to ensure a viable population. The reintroduced golden eagles at the park produced a pair of fledglings for the first time in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glenveaghnationalpark.ie/LatestNews.html |title=Latest News |publisher=National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden eagle is classified as bird of “High Conservation Concern” in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;BirdWatch Ireland 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer estimates are known from Asia and North Africa. A stronghold population is in mountainous [[Turkey]], where the large population included an estimated 2,000–3,000 breeding pairs persist. In [[Japan]], there is an estimated 175–260 breeding pairs, with a total population of approximately 500 individuals. One study stated that food shortages and decreases in suitable foraging habitat are assumed to be responsible for an observed decline in population size and reproductive success in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ozawa, T.|year= 2008|title=The population of Golden Eagles (''Aquila chrysaetos'') in Toyama Prefecture and their critical condition|journal= Aquila Chrysaetos |volume=22|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Koreas, the golden eagle is known to be rarely observed and, in 2010, only 10 were seen in [[South Korea]] during winter birding censuses. Little is known in terms of population numbers elsewhere in Eurasia, with the IUCN estimating between 100 and 10,000 individuals each in China and in Russia, numbers that suggest the species occurs very sparsely in these massive countries.&lt;ref&gt;Brazil, M. (2009). ''Birds of East Asia: eastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, eastern Russia''. Christopher Helm, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In North Africa, the main occurrence is in [[Morocco]], which is estimated to hold 200 to 500 breeding pairs. There appear to much fewer in other North African countries, with small, scattered populations in [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]], areas where no immature-plumaged eagles were observed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thiollay, J.-M. |title=The decline of raptors in West Africa: long-term assessment and the role of protected areas |journal=Ibis |volume=148 |issue= 2|pages=240–254 |year=2006 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00531.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{very long|section|date=May 2016}}

Almost all threats to golden eagles are attributable, directly or indirectly, to human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, J. C., L. Sileo, and N. J. Thomas. (1995). "Causes of eagle deaths", p. 68 in ''Our living resources''. (LaRoe, E. T., G. S. Farris, C. E. Puckett, P. D. Doran, and M. J. Mac, Eds.) U.S. Department of the Interior, National Biological Services, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Human-sourced threats include: habitat change, persecution, poisoning (often directed at other species) and collisions with man-made objects.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; The most widespread unintentional threat to golden eagles by humans is urbanization and human-population growth which have made areas historically used by eagles unsuitable both in terms of habitat and prey availability. [[Habitat destruction]] in North America had, by the late 19th century, already driven golden eagles from some regions they used to inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henninger, W.F. |year=1906|title= A preliminary list of the birds of Seneca County, Ohio|journal=[[Wilson Bulletin]]|volume=18|issue=2|pages= 47–60|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v018n02/p0047-p0060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Southern California]] and the [[Colorado Front Range]], this has been proved via long-term population and habitat surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, T.

Wildfires that burned more 40,000 hectares of scrublands between 1981 and 1987 in the [[Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area]] affected nesting populations adversely. Nesting success at burned territories in Snake River Canyon declined after major fires.

Where disturbance is regular, breeding failure for golden eagles is significantly more frequent. This was inferred in the 1982 Scottish breeding bird survey when disturbances were heavy in the Highlands.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt; Sheep farmers and egg-collectors are the leading cause of disturbances at the nests. Recreation, forest management and development projects such as road construction, mining or power generation are other potential sources of disturbances. When disturbed by humans at the nest, the parents frequently leave their nest for a period of up to two hours, reduced provisioning rates, endangered eggs or young to predation, as well as overheating, chilling or desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutler, G.W.|author2=Joness, J.L.|year=1981|title=Criteria for Golden Eagle, Ferruginous Hawk and Prairie Falcon nest site protection|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/jrr/v015n01/p00012-p00018.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Raptor Research|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human intrusion within {{convert|750|-|1500|m|abbr=on|ft}} of nests can cause a disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddock, M. &amp; Whitfield, D.P.

The intentional killing of golden eagles has been a conservation hurdle for the species. Golden eagles are intentionally killed usually due to the fear of loss of livestock and game species.  This is despite the findings of virtually every study of losses of stock to golden eagles has revealed that the actual amount of livestock killed by the eagles is negligible and financial restitution from conservation organizations should not be necessary, including those studies funded by the farming organizations or governmental programs seeking to justify the “control” of golden eagles.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt; While illegal in most countries today, hunting, trapping and poisoning may still occur. &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, R. L. (1986). "Current issues concerning the management of Golden Eagles in western U.S.A", pp. 149–156 in ''Birds of prey Bulletin no. 3''. (Chancellor, R. D. and B. U. Meyburg, Eds.) World Working Group on Birds of Prey and Owls, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the golden eagle was given federally protected status in 1963. Occasionally, golden eagles may be caught in trap lines laid out to capture mammalian predators.&lt;ref name="Bortolotti2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bortolotti, G.R. |title=Trap and poison mortality of Golden and Bald Eagles |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1173–9 |year=1984 |jstor=3801778 |doi=10.2307/3801778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted in Scotland, areas were broken down into low disturbance areas (with a low human presence and limited history of persecution), moderate areas (where minor disturbances occur, mainly unintentionally from hill-walkers or rarely intentionally by egg-collectors) or severe disturbance areas (where persecution, heavy disturbance and considerable egg-collecting is believed to still occur). In low disturbance areas, about 45% of nests failed, in moderate disturbance areas about 74% failed and in severe disturbance areas 93% of nesting attempts failed.&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watson, J. |author2= Dennis, R.H. |year=1992|title=Nesting site selection by Golden Eagles ''Aquila chrysaetos'' in Scotland|journal=British Birds|volume= 85|pages= 469–481}}&lt;/ref&gt; 73 out of 147 inaccessible nesting sites in this study (50%) produced fledglings, whereas more accessible nests produced fledglings in only 21 out of 68 nests (31%).&lt;ref name="Dennis" /&gt; 

Poisoning, both intentional and unintentional, is also a threat. The usual targets of carrion-poisoning are species such as coyotes, red fox and gray wolves, which are considered pests that threaten livestock. However, golden eagles are occasionally targeted as well for the same reasons. The main cause of mortality for golden eagles in Britain has been poisoning, 51 eagles have been verified to be killed by poisoning from 1980 to 2008 but the actual number killed is probably higher.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitfield2"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2003.09.003| title = The effects of persecution on age of breeding and territory occupation in golden eagles in Scotland| journal = Biological Conservation| volume = 118| issue = 2| pages = 249–259| year = 2004| last1 = Whitfield | first1 = D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A disproportionate amount of golden eagle poisonings in Scotland from 1981 to 2000 were linked to grouse moors (where grouse are kept for the pleasure of shooting) and were probably caused by gamekeepers deliberately poisoning eagles and foxes to keep their stock of grouse high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00019-3| title = The association of grouse moor in Scotland with the illegal use of poisons to control predators| journal = Biological Conservation| volume = 114| issue = 2| pages = 157–163| year = 2003| last1 = Whitfield | first1 = D.

Death by collisions with man-made structures and objects can be a serious local issue. [[Electrocution]] or collision with [[power lines]] has become an increasingly significant cause of mortality since the early 20th century.

In a few cases, mankind has accidentally benefited golden eagles by logging previously heavily wooded areas. This has been recorded in the 1800s and 1900s in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the [[Eastern United States]], where [[reforestation]] has now made the habitat unsuitable for nesting eagles, and in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], which still holds breeding eagles in desolate areas that have been logged.&lt;ref name="Marr"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marr, N.V.|author2=Knight, R.L.|year=1983|title=Food Habits of Golden Eagles in Eastern Washington|journal=Murrelet|volume=64|issue=3|pages=73–77|doi=10.2307/3535265|jstor=3535265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spottford"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spofford, W.R.|year=1971|title=The breeding status of the Golden Eagle in the Appalachians|journal=American Birds|volume=25|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afforestation]], the commercial planting of non-native woodland, is a serious issue in Scotland, with the largest amount of it occurring in southwestern [[Scotland]], especially in [[Argyll]].

The woodland canopy closes and ground vegetation dies, making these dark and gloomy places until harvesting in 40 to 50 years. More than 50% of land in Scotland at an elevation of {{convert|200|-|600|m|abbr=on|ft}} has been planted as such. Afforestation requires removal of sheep and the fencing out or shooting deer, both important sources of carrion for golden eagles.

== Conservation ==
The golden eagle is not threatened at the species level but efforts need to be taken to prevent extinctions from many northern countries. The primary efforts undertaken to conserve the species have been, in order of prevalence from highest to lowest: conservation education and awareness, policy protection, directed land management, legislation and law enforcement and the provision of indentures.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; In Scotland, only 3 out of 16 regions in Scotland occupied by golden eagles since 1982 have been deemed favorable for conservation status, based upon the extent of local persecution, prey abundance and habitat change.&lt;ref name="Whitfield"&gt;Whitfield, D.P., Fielding, A.H., McLeod, D.R.A. &amp; Haworth, P.F. (2008). ''A conservation framework for the golden eagle: implications for conservation and management in Scotland''. Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report No. 193. Scottish Natural Heritage, Battleby.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom has put in place deterrent legislation to prevent behavior around the nest with the potential to cause harm and acts of willful harm to white-tailed eagles and some have advocated using the same policies for golden eagles.&lt;ref name= Whitfield/&gt; Education in this region mainly is undertaken by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB). To curb the destructive practice of afforestation, some locals have switched to planting native [[Caledonian forest|Caledonian pine forests]] instead, likely resulting in much less harm to the native fauna possibly including golden eagles.&lt;ref&gt;McGrady, M.J., Petty, S.J., &amp; McLeod, D.R.A. (2004). ''Potential impact of new native forests on golden eagles in Scotland''. Scottish Natural Heritage Commissioned Report No. 18. Scottish Natural Heritage, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; While conservation efforts in Scotland have previously included the setting aside [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), these are usually too small to benefit golden eagles. More recently, the United Kingdom government has instead taken from governmental policies enacted in [[Continental Europe]] the idea of [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPAs), which offers strong legal protection of single species. Potentially more than {{convert|7000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} may be set aside in Scotland as SPA for golden eagles.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, D.A., Chambers, A., Cook, S., Buxton, N., Fraser, B., Clement, P., Lewis, P., McLean, L., Baker, H. &amp; Whitehead, S.

On the conservation front, the golden eagle is unintentionally contributing to the conservation crisis of another animal, the [[island fox]], a small insular relative of the [[gray fox]] found only in the [[Channel Islands of California]].  The island fox had evolved without major natural predators but the large breeding population of golden eagles in [[California]] is feeding partially on the foxes, whose already declining population cannot support sustained predation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22781/0 ''Urocyon littoralis'' (California Channel Island Fox, Channel Islands Fox, Island Fox, Island Gray Fox, Island Grey Fox)]. Iucnredlist.org. Retrieved on 2012–08–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in [[North America]], attempts to reintroduce endangered [[whooping crane]]s by mixing them with flocks of sandhill cranes have been largely unsuccessful in part due to natural predators picking off the unnaturally unwary birds. Although the chief predator has been bobcats, golden eagles are one of the other predators that are habitually killing the birds.&lt;ref name="Clegg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=D.H. |first2=K.R. |last2=Clegg |first3=J.C. |last3=Lewis |first4=E. |last4=Spaulding|url=https://sora.unm.edu/node/105543 |title=Golden Eagle predation on experimental Sandhill and Whooping cranes |journal=Condor |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=664–6 |year=1999 |jstor=1370196 |doi=10.2307/1370196}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The golden eagle may be a competitor and, rarely, a predator of the recently reintroduced California condors in central Arizona and southern California, but the pressure exerted by the eagles on condors are seemingly minor, especially in contrast to manmade conservation issues for the species such as lead poisoning from bullets left in hunter-killed ungulate carcasses.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, N.F.R. |author2=Ramey, R.R. |author3=Sibley, F.C. |title=Nest-site biology of the California Condor |journal=Condor |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=228–241 |year=1986 |jstor=1368920 |doi=10.2307/1368920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meretsky"&gt;Meretsky, V.J., Snyder, N.F.R., Beissinger, S.R., Clendenen, D.A. &amp; Wiley, J.W.

''NatureServe Explorer: An Online Encyclopedia of Life'' [web application].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland, the common hen harrier has been the subject of much unfavorable attention due to the fact that it is a habitual predator of the chicks of red grouse, a subspecies considered to be near threatened in the nation. One of the methods to control harrier numbers has been proposed is to encourage a population increase of golden eagles, which may also hunt grouse but are unlikely to cull young grouse and tend to outcompete and sometimes hunt the harriers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson, P.S.|author2= Amar, A.|author3= Hoccom, D.G.|author4= Knott, J.|author5= Wilson, J.D. |title=Resolving the conflict between driven-grouse shooting and conservation of Hen Harriers |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=950–4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01687.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steen Rasmussen''' (born 7 July 1955) is a Danish physicist mainly working in the areas of [[artificial life]] and [[complex systems]]. He is currently a professor in physics and a center director at [[University of Southern Denmark]] as well as an external research professor at the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. His formal training was at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (1985 PhD in physics of complex systems) and [[University of Copenhagen]] (philosophy). He spent 20 years as a researcher at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (1988-2007) the last five years as a leader of the Self-Organized Systems team. He has been part of the [[Santa Fe Institute]] since 1988.

The main scientific effort of Steen Rasmussen over the last ten years has been to explore, understand and construct a transition from nonliving to living materials. Bridging this gap requires an interdisciplinary scientific effort, which is why he has assembled, sponsored and lead research teams in the US, across Europe and in Denmark. He became a scientific team leader in 2002 at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA, and he has since held research leadership positions at the [[Santa Fe Institute]], [[University of Copenhagen]] and [[University of Southern Denmark]]. Since late 2007 he has been the director of the Center for Fundamental Living Technology at [[University of Southern Denmark]].

Steen Rasmussen has for many years been actively engaged in the public discourse regarding science and society and on this background he founded the Initiative for Science, Society and Policy (ISSP) in 2009. ISSP is currently funded by two Danish universities, has a Director, five Science Focus Leaders and a Science Board.

==Plot==
In late 19th-century New Mexico, Samuel Jones reappears hoping to reconcile with his adult daughter Magdalena "Maggie" Gilkeson. She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. 

The [[U.S. Cavalry]] refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a [[Chiricahua]], and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan ("shit for luck") during his wanderings.

It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths. Maggie shoots at the last remaining kidnappers to scare them off. She realizes her father's love for her and finally forgives him.

Then she goes home with her father’s body, her daughters and the other kidnapped girls.

'''Vagus nerve stimulation''' ('''VNS''') is a medical treatment that involves delivering electrical impulses to the [[vagus nerve]]. It is used as an add-on treatment for certain types of intractable [[epilepsy]] and [[treatment-resistant depression]]. Frequent side effects include coughing and shortness of breath.&lt;ref name=Cl2018/&gt; Serious side effects may include trouble talking and [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name=Cl2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Vagus Nerve Stimulation |url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17598-vagus-nerve-stimulation |website=Cleveland Clinic |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
VNS devices are used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant [[major depressive disorder]] (TR-MDD).&lt;ref name=Edwards2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=CA|last2=Kouzani|first2=A|last3=Lee|first3=KH|last4=Ross|first4=EK|title=Neurostimulation Devices for the Treatment of Neurologic Disorders|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=September 2017|volume=92|issue=9|pages=1427–1444|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.05.005|pmid=28870357}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panebianco |first1=M|last2=Rigby |first2=A|last3=Weston |first3=J|last4=Marson |first4=AG |title=Vagus nerve stimulation for partial seizures|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=3 April 2015 |issue=4 |pages=CD002896 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002896.pub2 |pmid=25835947}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt; Specifically it is used for treatment-resistant [[focal epilepsy]].&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015/&gt; As of 2017 the efficacy of VNS for TR-MDD was unclear.&lt;ref name=Edwards2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carreno2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carreno|first1=FR|last2=Frazer|first2=A|title=Vagal Nerve Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Depression|journal=Neurotherapeutics : The Journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics|date=July 2017|volume=14|issue=3|pages=716–727|doi=10.1007/s13311-017-0537-8|pmid=28585221|pmc=5509631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adverse events ==
For the treatment of epilepsy generally the [[Vagus nerve#Structure|left vagus nerve]] is stimulated at mid-cervical region.  The adverse effects of this stimulation include cardiac arrest,&lt;ref&gt;Lenzer, Jeanne (2017) The Danger Within Us  pg.109 {{ISBN|9780316343763}}&lt;/ref&gt; bradycardia,&lt;ref&gt;Han p, frei mg, osorio i. Probable mechanisms of action of vagus nerve stimulation in humans with epilepsy: is a window into the brain [abstract]? epilepsia 1996;37 (5suppl):83s.&lt;/ref&gt; voice alteration and hoarseness, cough, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], pain, [[paresthesias|a tingling sensation]], nausea, and headache;&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015/&gt; [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]] has also been reported as common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howland |first1=RH |title=Vagus Nerve Stimulation |journal=Current Behavioral Neuroscience Reports |date=June 2014 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=64–73 |doi=10.1007/s40473-014-0010-5 |pmid=24834378 |pmc=4017164}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sleepiness.

In [[randomized controlled trial]]s for epilepsy conducted in the United States, one-third of the subjects had some type of an increase in [[seizures]], with 17 percent having greater than a 25 percent increase, some had 100 percent increase or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neurological Devices Panel: Tenth Meeting transcript |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/97/transcpt/3299t1.pdf |publisher=FDA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819110902/http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/97/transcpt/3299t1.pdf|archivedate=August 19, 2000 |date=June 27, 1997|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
As of 2017 little was understood about exactly how vagal nerve stimulation modulates mood and seizure control.&lt;ref name=Edwards2017/&gt;

The [[vagus]] is the tenth [[Cranial nerves|cranial nerve]] and arises from the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]; it carries both [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] fibers. The afferent vagal fibers connect to the nucleus of the [[solitary tract]] which in turn projects connections to other locations in the central nervous system.&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015/&gt;   Proposed mechanisms include an anti-inflammatory effect,&lt;ref name=Cochrane2015/&gt; as well as changes in [[monoamines]].

==Devices and procedures==
The device consists of a generator the size of a matchbox that is implanted under the skin below the person’s [[clavicle|collarbone]]. Lead wires from the generator are tunnelled up to the patient’s neck and wrapped around the left vagus nerve at the carotid sheath, where it delivers electrical impulses to the nerve.&lt;ref name=Edwards2017/&gt;

Implantation of the VNS device is usually done as an out-patient procedure. The procedure goes as follows: an incision is made in the upper left chest and the generator is implanted into a little "pouch" on the left chest under the collarbone. A second incision is made in the neck, so that the surgeon can access the vagus nerve. The surgeon then wraps the leads around the left branch of the vagus nerve, and connects the electrodes to the generator. Once successfully implanted, the generator sends electric impulses to the vagus nerve at regular intervals.  The left vagus nerve is stimulated rather than the right because the right plays a role in cardiac function such that stimulating it could have negative cardiac effects.&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giordano|first1=F|last2=Zicca|first2=A|last3=Barba|first3=C|last4=Guerrini|first4=R|last5=Genitori|first5=L|title=Vagus nerve stimulation: Surgical technique of implantation and revision and related morbidity|journal=Epilepsia|date=April 2017|volume=58 Suppl 1|pages=85–90|doi=10.1111/epi.13678|pmid=28386925}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "dose" administered by the device then needs to be set, which is done via a magnetic wand; the parameters adjusted include current, frequency, pulse width, and duty cycle.&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt;

"Wearable" devices are being tested and developed that involve [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|transcutaneous stimulation]] and do not require surgery. Electrical impulses are targeted at the aurical (ear), at points where branches of the vagus nerve have cutaneous representation; such devices had been tested in clinical trials for treatment resistant major depressive disorder as of 2017.&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="tVNS"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=287–95 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00102 |title=Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS): a new neuromodulation tool in healthy humans? |year=2015 |last1=Leusden |first1=J |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=6 |issue=102 |pmc=4322601 |last2=Sellare |first2=R |last3=Colzato |first3=L |display-authors=2 |pmid=25713547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1997, the US [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s neurological devices panel met to consider approval of an implanted vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) for epilepsy, requested by Cyberonics (which was subsequently renamed to [[LivaNova]]).&lt;ref name=Edwards2017/&gt;

The FDA approved an implanted VNS for TR-MDD in 2005.&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt;

In April 2017, the FDA cleared marketing of a handheld noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator, called "gammaCore" and made by ElectroCore LLC, for episodic [[cluster headaches]], under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act#Automatic Class III Designation (De Novo classification)|de novo pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brauser |first1=Deborah |title=FDA Approves Vagus Nerve Stimulation Device for Cluster Headache |url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/878763 |work=Medscape |date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GammaCore Device Classification under Section 513(f)(2)(de novo) |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/denovo.cfm?ID=DEN150048 |accessdate=6 June 2018 |work=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2018, the FDA cleared a new user for that device for the treatment of migraine pain in adults under a [[510(k)]] based on the [[De novo|de novo clearance]]{{disambiguation needed|date=October 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brauser |first1=Deborah |title=FDA Clears Vagus Nerve Stimulator for Migraine Pain |url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/891930 |work=Medscape |date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GammaCore 510(k) Premarket Notification |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=K173442 |publisher=FDA |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Although the use of VNS for TRD has been endorsed by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the FDA's approval of VNS for TRD remains controversial. According to Dr. A. John Rush, vice chairman for research in the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] at Dallas, results of the VNS pilot study showed that 40 percent of the treated patients displayed at least a 50 percent or greater improvement in their condition, according to the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]].&lt;ref name="DoctorsGuide"&gt;[http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/15131a.htm Doctor's Guide: ''Vagus Nerve Stimulation Successful For Depression'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NeurologyChannel"&gt;[http://www.neurologychannel.com/vagus/ Neurology Channel: Vagus Nerve Stimulation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027154834/http://www.neurologychannel.com/vagus/ |date=October 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other studies concur that VNS is indeed efficacious in treating depression. However, these findings do not take into account improvements over time in patients without the device. In the only randomized controlled trial VNS failed to perform any better when turned on than in otherwise similar implanted patients whose device was not turned on.&lt;ref name="FDA2004"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/04/briefing/4047b1_02_Summary%20of%20Safety%20and%20Effectiveness.pdf FDA Summary of VNS Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the vagus nerve is associated with many different functions and brain regions, clinical research has been done to determine its usefulness in treating other illnesses, including various [[anxiety disorder]]s,&lt;ref name="VNSreview"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.01.004 |pmid=15820552 |title=Vagal nerve stimulation: A review of its applications and potential mechanisms that mediate its clinical effects |year=2005 |last1=Groves |first1=Duncan A. |last2=Brown |first2=Verity J. |journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=493–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Lartigue |first1=G |title=Role of the vagus nerve in the development and treatment of diet-induced obesity |journal=The Journal of Physiology |date=15 October 2016 |volume=594 |issue=20 |pages=5791–5815 |doi=10.1113/JP271538 |pmid=26959077 |pmc=5063945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Göbel|first1=CH|last2=Tronnier|first2=VM|last3=Münte|first3=TF|title=Brain stimulation in obesity|journal=International Journal of Obesity (2005)|volume=41|issue=12|pages=1721–1727|date=30 June 2017|doi=10.1038/ijo.2017.150|pmid=28663570}}&lt;/ref&gt; alcohol addiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herremans SC, Baeken C |title=The current perspective of neuromodulation techniques in the treatment of alcohol addiction: a systematic review |journal=Psychiatria Danubina |volume=24 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S14–20 |date=September 2012 |pmid=22945180 |url=http://www.hdbp.org/psychiatria_danubina/pdf/dnb_vol24%20Suppl%201_no/dnb_vol24%20Suppl%201_no_S14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic [[heart failure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abraham WT, Smith SA |title=Devices in the management of advanced, chronic heart failure |journal=Nature Reviews.

VNS has also been studied in small trials of people with [[neurodevelopmental disorders]], generally who also have had epilepsy, including [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engineer|first1=CT|last2=Hays|first2=SA|last3=Kilgard|first3=MP|title=Vagus nerve stimulation as a potential adjuvant to behavioral therapy for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders|journal=Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders|date=2017|volume=9|pages=20|doi=10.1186/s11689-017-9203-z|pmid=28690686|pmc=5496407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 VNS devices were being developed that were not implanted, but rather transmitted signals through the skin. Electrical impulses are targeted at the aurical (ear), at points where branches of the vagus nerve are close to the surface.&lt;ref name=Carreno2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="tVNS"/&gt;

VNS is being studied as of 2018 as a treatment for [[migraines]] and [[fibromyalgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=RL |last2=Wilson |first2=CG |title=A review of vagus nerve stimulation as a therapeutic intervention |journal=Journal of Inflammation Research |date=2018 |volume=11 |pages=203–213 |doi=10.2147/JIR.S163248 |pmid=29844694 |pmc=5961632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puledda|first1=F|last2=Goadsby|first2=PJ|title=An Update on Non-Pharmacological Neuromodulation for the Acute and Preventive Treatment of Migraine|journal=Headache|date=April 2017|volume=57|issue=4|pages=685–691|doi=10.1111/head.13069|pmid=28295242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
