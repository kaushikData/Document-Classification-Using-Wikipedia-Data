'''ACROSS''' is a Singular Strategic R&amp;D Project led by Treelogic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treelogic.com Treelogic]&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mityc.es Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207090817/http://www7.mityc.es/ |date=2009-12-07 }} through the Plan Avanza I+D initiative. ACROSS carries out [[research and development]]&lt;/ref&gt; activities in the field of [[Robotics]] and [[Cognitive informatics|Cognitive Computing]] over an execution time-frame from 2009 to 2011. ACROSS project involves a number higher than 100 researchers from 13 Spanish entities.

== ACROSS project objectives ==
ACROSS modifies the design of [[social robot]]ics, blocked in providing predefined services, going further by means of [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]]. These systems are able to self-reconfigure and modify their behavior autonomously through the capacity for understanding, learning and software [[Virtual private network|remote access]].

In order to provide an open framework for collaboration between universities, [[research center]]s and the Administration, ACROSS develops Open Source Services available to everybody.

== Three application domains ==
ACROSS works in three [[application domain]]s:

* Autonomous living: robots are used as technological tools to help handicapped person into daily tasks.
* Psycho-Affective Disorders ([[autism]]): robots are used to mitigate [[cognitive disorder]]s.
* Marketing: robots are used to interact with humans in a [[recreation]]al approach.

'''Abu al-Hasan 'Ali''' (died c. 1009) was ruler of Khwarazm from 997 until his death. The second member of the [[Ma'munids|Ma'munid dynasty]], he was the son of [[Ma'mun I ibn Muhammad]].

In 997 Ali took over Khwarazm following his father's death. Little is known of his reign, but his emirate was dependent upon the [[Karakhanids]], rivals of the Ghaznavids.&lt;ref&gt;''The Early Ghaznavids'', C.E. Bosworth, '''The Cambridge History of Iran''', Vol.4, ed. R. N. Frye, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; He died sometime around 1009 and was succeeded by his brother, [[Ma'mun II|Abu al-Abbas Ma'mun]].

'''Ahmed Mohamed Mahmoud''' (c. 1974 &amp;ndash; 4 February 2011) was an Egyptian print reporter for the newspaper [[Al Tawuun]], which is distributed by state-run [[Al-Ahram]]. He was shot by a sniper on the balcony of his office while filming the outbreak between Egyptian protestors and security forces on January 28, 2011 during the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]]. He died six days later in a local [[Cairo]] hospital, and he was the first journalist to die in Egypt  during its [[Arab Spring]] uprising.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;Al-Arian, Laila. February 6, 2011.

Retrieved 27 November 2011 [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/anger-in-egypt/2011/02/201126201341479784.html Al-Jazeera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;Democracy Now.

"Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud" 4 February 2011. Retrieved September 16, 2011. [http://www.cpj.org/killed/2011/ahmad-mohamed-mahmoud.php CPJ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Mahmoud was shot on his office balcony as riot police were throwing tear gas canisters into crowds of protesters. His office was located near central [[Tahrir Square]] which was the central point of fighting between anti-Mubarak and pro-Mubarak forces.&lt;ref&gt;AhlulBayt News Agency. "Egyptian Journalist Ahmed Mahmoud Dies Of Gunshot Wounds; First Reported Journalist Death In Uprising." 5 February 2011. Retrieved 19 November 2011 [http://abna.ir/data.asp?lang=3&amp;id=224460 AhlulBayt News Agency].&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmoud was shot by a sniper while filming the incident on his camera phone. Several witnesses have said a uniformed policeman yelled at Mahmoud to stop filming amidst the violence right before he was shot without any time to react. His co-workers called the ambulance several times as they refused to pick him up because of the nature of his attack. They had to drive him themselves to [[Al Ainy]] Hospital, the largest hospital in Egypt where he would slip into a coma and die of his wounds six days later on February 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;

==Context==
At the end of the thirty years of President [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s leadership, Egypt suffered from economic instability, political corruption, starvation, high unemployment rates, and the presence of a 'youth bulge'.  All of these are seen as reasons for the 2011 protests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J. "Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis." [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276&amp;Itemid=70 Entelequia. Revista Interdisciplinar 13 (2011): 139-169].&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2011 [[World Bank]] figures, Egypt's economy grew at a rate of 4.5 percent which was exceptionally well for a third world country. Egyptian corruption levels according to World Transparency reports were ranked 80th. Though levels of political corruption were high, they were low in comparison to almost all other third world nations. What is believed to be the true reason for the political strife is the youth bulge. Due to rapidly increasing life expectancy and rapidly decreasing infant mortality rate people aged 20–24 had doubled since 1995. Just prior to the beginning of the peaceful protests nearly half of the unemployed were part of this youth cohort aged 20–24. Large numbers of youth have been historically responsible for political conflict. In Egypt reasons such as conflicting ideologies were responsible. Of the nearly 2.5 million youth unemployed, 43 percent had university degrees. This can be seen as why the protests were non-violent and of the 300 deaths nearly all were at the hands of the security forces and none from the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J. [http://cliodynamics.ru/download/Korotayev_Zinkina_Egyptian_Revolution_Entelequia_New.pdf Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis. ''Entelequia. Revista Interdisciplinar'' 13 (2011): 139-169]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Mahmoud was the first reporter killed during the uprising in [[Egypt]] between protestors and [[Mubarak]] forces. The killing of a journalist and then the unresponsiveness of the ambulance has shaken Egypt's journalism community and furthered protests against the current regime. Mahmoud's widow and fellow journalist, Inas Abdel-Alim, is demanding a full on investigation from the government and a trial for the murder of her husband.&lt;ref name="DN" /&gt;

[[Lucas Dolega]], who was the first journalist killed in the Arab Spring uprising during the [[Tunisian uprising]], was also killed while covering a protest. Dolega was on a photojournalism assignment for European PressPhoto Agency (epa) in [[Tunis]].

==Response==
In response to the killing, [[White House]] Press Secretary [[Robert Gibbs]] released a statement saying the White House continues to receive, "very disturbing reports".  He continued saying, "direct negotiations toward orderly transition" should be made for the power in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"EGYPT: Reporter who was shot last week dies at local hospital" LA Times, February 4, 2011 [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/02/white-house-press-secretary-robert-gibbs-said-friday-that-the-obamas-administration-continues-to-receive-very-disturbing-repo.html LA Times] (09/20/11).&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the attack on Mahmoud and others, [[United States]] President [[Barack Obama]] said in a press conference that the attack were "unacceptable", and the [[Egypt]]ian government should "protect the rights of the people".&lt;ref&gt;"Obama Ramps Up Pressure on Mubarak", ABC News, February 5, 2011. [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-05/obama-ramps-up-pressure-on-mubarak/1930672] (09/22/2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
A symbolic funeral was held in Tahrir Square in honor of Mahmoud. An empty casket with an Egyptian flag drapped over was carried through the streets with thousands of attendees following.

'''Andrey Borisovich Soloviev''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Борисович Соловьёв}}) (1953 &amp;ndash; September 27, 1993) was a Russian [[war]] [[photographer]].

He was killed by [[sniper]] fire while covering the battle for [[Sukhumi]] in [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|Abkhazian war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cpj.org/killed/1993/andrei-soloviev.php |title= Andrei Soloviev entry in the registry of killed journalists maintained by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= Committee to Protect Journalists |access-date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soloviev studied at the [[MArchI|Moscow Institute of Architecture]] but never graduated. Instead, he became a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]], joining the [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Itar-TASS]] news agency in 1987. He also worked as a stringer for the [[Associated Press]].

After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]], Andrey Soloviev covered many armed conflicts, including in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], [[Transnistria]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[South Ossetia]]. He also filmed the aftermath of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], the collapse of the regime of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], and was in [[Iraq]] during the [[Gulf War]].

His photographs received numerous awards, including the [[World Press Photo]] prize.

{{Campaignbox Bahraini uprising}}

'''Bahrain's Bloody Thursday''' ({{lang-ar|خميس البحرين الدامي}}) is the name given by protesters in [[Bahrain]] to 17 February 2011, the fourth day of their [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|national uprising]]. [[Public Security Forces|Bahrain security forces]] launched a [[pre-dawn raid]] to clear [[Pearl Roundabout]] in [[Manama]] of the protesters camped there, most of whom were at the time asleep in tents; four were killed and about 300 injured. The event led some to demand even more political reform than they had been before, calling for an end to the [[King of Bahrain|reign]] of King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]].

The clearance was described by witnesses as being brutal and sudden. Clouds of [[Tear Gas|tear gas]] covered the area, and volleys of [[birdshot]] were fired on those who refused to withdraw. Medics, ambulances and a journalist were reportedly attacked as well. Sporadic clashes broke out around Bahrain hours after the raid. During the afternoon the [[National Guard (Bahrain)|National Guard]] and [[Bahrain Defence Force|army]] deployed armoured vehicles, tanks, more than 50&amp;nbsp;armoured personnel carriers and set up checkpoints in the streets around the country. Protesters then took refuge at [[Salmaniya Medical Complex]] and continued their agitations; thousands of them chanted "Down with the king, down with the government."

The [[Cabinet of Bahrain|government]] accused protesters of attacking the security forces, 50 of whom sustained injuries, and insisted that action had been necessary to pull Bahrain back from the "brink of a sectarian abyss".&lt;ref name="AJE LB 17.2.2011"/&gt; But [[Opposition (Bahrain)|opposition parties]] dismissed the government's account as a "silly play",&lt;ref name="Al wasat 19"/&gt; described the raid as a "heinous massacre"{{sfn|BICI report|M. Cherif Bassiouni|Nigel S. Rodley|Philippe Kirsch|2011|p=75}} and submitted their resignations from the [[National Assembly of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|Parliament]].

Internationally, the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]] Ministers of Foreign Affairs expressed their solidarity with government of Bahrain and their support for the measures taken. The [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] on the other hand expressed their deep concern and regret for the violence used against protesters. The [[UK|United Kingdom]] government announced that in light of the unrest it would revoke some arms export licences to Bahrain. A number of international rights groups and independent observers criticised the government crackdown.

Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's disaster plan was activated on the morning of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

About five ambulances reached Pearl Roundabout, where they were confronted by police and army forces; three drivers and nine paramedics were attacked.&lt;ref name="NYT 17.2.2011"/&gt; One of the injured drivers claimed that police had clubbed him and that a senior officer had told him: "If I see you again, I’ll kill you." Another ambulance driver, who was unharmed, said that police removed injured protesters from his vehicle by force&lt;ref name="Guardian 17.2.2011(2)"/&gt; and a military officer&amp;nbsp;– whom he believed to be a Saudi, based on his Arabic dialect&amp;nbsp;– held a gun to his head and warned him to drive away or be shot.&lt;ref name="NYT NK 17.2.2011"/&gt; One ambulance was reportedly confiscated by police, who then took it to an unknown location after beating its driver and other paramedics, who had to walk back to the SMC.&lt;ref name="Al wasat 4"&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ar:الدكتور صادق العكري يسقط جريحا والان في غرفة العمليات ومصادرة سيارة اسعاف | date=17 February 2011 | work=Al-Wasat | url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3086/news/read/527734/1.html | accessdate=11 January 2012 | language=Arabic | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925200031/http://www.alwasatnews.com/3086/news/read/527734/1.html | archivedate=25 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paramedic also said police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, but when the ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion.

===Government accounts===

{{External media | video1 = {{Youtube|KHjppYjB-Dw|Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan on Bahrain TV}} }}

The government account of the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained in defiance of the law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue&lt;ref name="Al wasat 11"/&gt; and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as [[Hezbollah]] flags at the site.&lt;ref name="CNN 18.2.2011"/&gt;

On a state television show, Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan said that fifty&amp;nbsp;police officers had been injured, including two with serious sword wounds and that "one protester drove over police resulting in injuries including cutting-off fingers of a policeman before we could catch him." He also denied policemen prevented ambulances from reaching Pearl Roundabout or attacked any paramedics, but instead: "What happened is that protesters stole an ambulance car, so we were checking on every ambulance that reaches the roundabout."&lt;ref name="Al wasat 18"&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ar:"الداخلية" تسرد الرواية الرسمية لفض اعتصام دوار اللؤلؤة | date=18 February 2011 | work=Al-Wasat | url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3087/news/read/527872/1.html | accessdate=12 January 2012 | language=Arabic | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906083632/http://www.alwasatnews.com/3087/news/read/527872/1.html | archivedate=6 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One doctor working at SMC's [[emergency room|ER]] supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance.&lt;ref name="HRW report2"&gt;{{cite report |title=Targets of Retribution: Attacks against Medics, Injured Protesters, and Health Facilities |page=16 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/bahrain0711webwcover.pdf |date=18 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310051619/https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/bahrain0711webwcover.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, set up by the king to report on the events of February and March, did not see any evidence to support the government's claim that protesters were armed{{sfn|BICI report|M.

The raid culminated in the destruction of the encampment, with flattened tents and protesters' belongings scattered all over the place.&lt;ref name="AJE 17.2.2011"/&gt; Security forces then declared the protest camp to be illegal and installed barbed wire around Pearl Roundabout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Ned Potter | title=Riot Police Storm Bahrain Camp; 4 Reported Dead | date=17 February 2011 | agency=Associated Press | publisher=[[Ynetnews]] | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4029898,00.html | accessdate=19 April 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220174132/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4029898,00.html | archivedate=20 February 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An hour after the attack, a number of protesters tried to return to the roundabout, which was completely controlled by police. Security forces fired a shotgun on one protester directly in the head from a few centimetres away, killing him instantly.

;Dr Sadiq Alekry

Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily offered his services at the roundabout on the evening of 16 February, shortly after he had returned from [[Houston]].&lt;ref name="NYT NK 17.2.2011"/&gt; According to [[Human rights watch]], Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the [[Red Crescent]].&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it;&lt;ref name="Guardian 17.2.2011(3)"/&gt; despite telling them he was a physician,&lt;ref name="NYT NK 17.2.2011"/&gt; police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head and other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 17.2.2011(3)"/&gt;

About 20&amp;nbsp;officers then marched him away from Pearl Roundabout.

In the bus, Alekry's shirt was pulled over his head and, while he was still hand-cuffed, security officers continued kicking and beating him for about an hour, until he fell to the floor. Nevertheless, the beating continued and Alekry reported that a police officer told him: "If you bleed in my chair with your dirty blood I will beat you to death!" When an ambulance arrived, police allowed him and three other detainees to be taken to hospital. He arrived at the SMC at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, with severe injuries to his back, chest and face and underwent facial surgery a few days later.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

==Analysis==

The events at the Pearl Roundabout and Salmaniyya Medical Complex marked a turning point in the Bahraini uprising, according to the media; an analysis by ''[[The Guardian]]'' said it reduced, if not killed, any chance of dialogue.&lt;ref name="Guardian 17.2.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Abdulnabi Alekry]] | title=Bahrain crackdown will make citizens more determined | date=17 February 2011 | publisher=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/17/bahrain-egypt-political-change?INTCMP=SRCH | accessdate=17 January 2012 | location=London | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309184320/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/17/bahrain-egypt-political-change?INTCMP=SRCH | archivedate=9 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The raid expanded the demands of some protesters from asking for reforms which included writing a new [[Constitution of Bahrain|constitution]] to calling for an end to the monarchy.&lt;ref name="guard_downwiththeking"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain Mourners Call for End to Monarchy |date=18 February 2011 |agency=Associated Press |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/18/bahrain-mourners-call-downnfall-monarchy |accessdate=31 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5waOzlomm?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/18/bahrain-mourners-call-downnfall-monarchy |archivedate=18 February 2011 |deadurl=no |location=London |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Bahrain Mirror]]'', the phrase "after Thursday, we stopped the talking; the people want to overthrow the regime" ([[Arabic]]: من بعد الخميس أنهينا الكلام، الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام) became popular in later protests.&lt;ref name="BH Mirror 2.1.2012"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ar:ائتلاف ثورة 14 فبراير سيرة مختصرة |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=[[Bahrain Mirror]] |url=http://www.bahrainmirror.org/article.php?id=2643&amp;cid=117 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414065659/http://www.bahrainmirror.org/article.php?id=2643&amp;cid=117 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 April 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |language=Arabic }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February, a mass rally dubbed the [[March of loyalty to martyrs]] was held in honour of the four protesters who had lost their lives during the day; over 100,000&amp;nbsp;people took part in the protest.&lt;ref name="Independent 22.2.2011"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bahrain king orders release of political prisoners | date = 22 February 2011 | agency = Associated Press | work = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bahrain-king-orders-release-of-political-prisoners-2222371.html | accessdate = 7 July 2012 | location = London | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092113/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bahrain-king-orders-release-of-political-prisoners-2222371.html | archivedate = 27 February 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Al Jazeera English]] documentary ''[[Bahrain: Shouting in the Dark]]'' also features the events of the day.

The '''Barbara Pit massacre''' ({{lang-sl|Pokol v Barbara rovu}}, {{lang-hr|Pokolj u Barbarinom rovu}}), also known as the '''Huda Jama massacre''', was the mass killing of members of the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|NDH Armed Forces]] and the [[Slovene Home Guard]], as well as civilians after the end of [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], in an abandoned coal mine near [[Huda Jama]], [[Slovenia]]. More than a thousand people were killed by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] during May and June 1945, following the [[Bleiburg repatriations]]. The location of the massacre was sealed with concrete barriers and discussion about it was forbidden.

The [[Mass graves in Slovenia|mass grave]] site, one of the largest in Slovenia, was first publicly discussed in 1990, after the fall of [[communism]] in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. A memorial chapel was raised near the entrance to the mine in 1997. Investigation of the Barbara Pit mine ({{lang-sl|Barbara rov}}) began in 2008. It took several months for workers to remove concrete walls built after the war to seal the cave. On 3 March 2009, investigators found 427 [[unidentified decedent|unidentified bodies]] at a ditch in the mine. Another 369 corpses were found on the first five meters of a nearby shaft. The Barbara Pit mine was subsequently visited by the Croatian and Slovenian political leadership to pay tribute to the victims. On 25 October 2017, the Slovenian government announced that the remains of 1,416 victims were exhumed from the site and reburied at the Dobrava memorial park near [[Maribor]].

==Background==
{{Main article|World War II in Yugoslavia|Bleiburg repatriations}}
{{Aftermath of World War II in Yugoslavia}}
[[File:Zajeti ustaši na avstrijsko-slovenski meji.jpg|thumb|[[POW]]s of the [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]] at the town of [[Bleiburg]] in May 1945]]
During World War II, the Barbara Pit mine, a coal mine located 16 kilometers south of the town of [[Celje]], was used by the Germans for coal production. The mine was closed in May 1944.{{sfn|Ferenc|2013|p=11}}

With the collapse of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) in May 1945, its [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Armed Forces]], together with other [[Axis powers|Axis]] troops, started retreating towards Austria in order to surrender to the British forces. The NDH leadership abolished racial laws and intended to seek Western support in fighting Communism. On 6 May they sent a request for collaboration with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which was rejected. The Yugoslav Partisans took control of Zagreb, the capital of NDH, on 8 May.{{sfn|Radelić|2016|pp=9–10}} The retreating columns marched through Slovenia and were accompanied by many civilians. By 14 May, several thousand troops were admitted by the British. On 15 May, the main column reached the town of [[Bleiburg]], where their surrender was rejected and were [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriated]] to the Yugoslav Partisans. Those that were previously taken into British captivity were returned to Yugoslavia between 18 and 31 May, including around 10,000 [[Slovene Home Guard]]s.{{sfn|Ferenc|2013|p=5}}

The prisoners were subjected to forced marches by the Yugoslav authorities. Transit and detention camps were set across Slovenia where a selection was made.{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=203}} The [[OZNA]] (Department of National Security) issued precise instructions on dealing with prisoners of war. An instruction issued on 6 May 1945 by the OZNA stipulates that prisoners are to be "liquidated on the spot":{{sfn|Radelić|2016|p=16}}

{{quote|The stance on captured officers and prisoners complies with earlier instructions. Officers are to be purged without exception, unless you receive notification from the OZNA or Party that an individual is not be liquidated. In general, no mercy is to be shown in purges and liquidation.}}

==Arrival at the Teharje camp==
{{See also|Teharje camp}}
Several thousand Slovene Home Guard POWs were taken by trains from the Austrian border at [[Dravograd]] to [[Maribor]] and from there to the town of Celje. From the town's railway station they were sent through Celje by foot towards the nearby [[Teharje camp]], a prison camp that was administered by the OZNA. During the trip the prisoners were beaten and those that lagged behind were shot.{{sfn|Skubic|2008|pp=169–170}} There were also civilians in the columns.{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=236}} Their valuables were taken from them upon arrival at the camp. German civilians from the [[Kočevje]] region ([[Gottscheers]]) were also brought to Teharje. The Home Guard POWs were separated into three groups: the first group consisted of minors, the second consisted of those that were members of the Home Guard for less than five months, and the third group included others. However, there were exceptions of this rule.{{sfn|Skubic|2008|pp=169–170}} The third group had the harshest treatment at the camp and were often without water and food.{{sfn|Skubic|2008|p=173}} Around 7,000 to 8,000 people passed through the Teharje camp.{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=240}}

Prisoners from the third group were first set for liquidation. Their hands were tied in pair with another inmate and were meant to be transported by trucks to nearby execution sites. The OZNA engaged drivers from across the country to carry out the transports. The drivers were not informed about the details of the action.{{sfn|Skubic|2008|pp=179–180}}

==Massacre==
[[File:Notranjost Barbara rova.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Barbara Pit]]
[[File:Barbara-rov IMG 0877.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Barbara Pit in 2009]]
In late May and June 1945, when the Yugoslav army started emptying its prison camps in Slovenia, prisoners from the Teharje camp and the [[Stari Pisker]] prison were brought by trucks at night to the abandoned Barbara Pit mine in Huda Jama.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|pp=41–43}} Slovene Home Guard POWs that were singled out in [[Slovenj Gradec]], [[Velenje]], [[Kranj]] and Celje were the first ones to arrive on the last week of May. NDH troops were brought on foot.{{sfn|Perme|Žitnik|Žitnik|2000|p=186}} Once arrived, groups of 5–6 prisoners with hands tied with wire were stripped, ordered to kneel above a mine shaft and shot in the head,{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=52}} or were hit with a mine hammer or a pickaxe.{{sfn|Perme|Žitnik|Žitnik|2000|p=186}} In some cases, groups of 20–30 prisoners were tossed into a mine shaft, followed with hand grenades to finish off the victims.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=41}} A number of prisoners were thrown in alive.{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=242}} Once the shafts were filled with corpses, the remaining prisoners were sent in the direction of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje|Zagorje]] in northwest Croatia where they were killed,{{sfn|Ferenc|2013|p=12}} while the bodies were covered with [[Lime (material)|lime]] to speed up decomposition. The mine was then enclosed with 400 cubic meters of concrete and wooden barriers. Those still conscious tried to climb over each other to reach the hatch, but could not escape the sealed mine.{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=242}}

The liquidations were carried out by the 3rd Brigade of the Slovenian KNOJ (People's Defence Corps of Yugoslavia) Division.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=52}} Several thousand people were killed in the massacre.{{sfn|Groen|Márquez-Grant|Janaway|2015|p=171}} Most of the victims were prisoners of war, members of the NDH Armed Forces and [[Slovene Home Guard]], and civilians.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=47}} There are no records of survivors.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=40}}

==Aftermath==
It is estimated that at least 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed following the Bleiburg repatriations.{{sfn|Geiger|2013|p=94}} More than 600 mass grave sites are located in Slovenia,{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=40}} which the Yugoslav authorities concealed and prohibited discussion about the massacres.{{sfn|Bevc|2008|p=47}}

The part of the Barbara Pit mine where the killings took place was hermetically sealed. The rest was put into operation on 1 November 1945 and produced coal until 1992. There is no written data about the massacre in Yugoslav archives.{{sfn|Ferenc|2013|p=11}} One of the earliest mentions of the event is connected to a judicial proceeding from May 1947, when five people were sentenced to death on spying charges, including a 32-year-old pregnant woman who claimed that Yugoslav authorities were beating and killing POWs at Brežice, Košnice and Huda Jama.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=52}}

==Investigation==
[[File:Ambassador´s visit to Huda jama (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[United States Ambassador to Slovenia]] visiting the site in 2013]]
The first official studies of the site began in November 1989 when a criminal report was filled against unknown perpetrators for the killing of an undetermined number of prisoners at Huda Jama. The state prosecution forwarded the report to the Celje Police Department in October 1991. A decade later, in 2001, the Slovenian police began a formal investigation of the graves at Huda Jama. In January 2008, the [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia]] decided to inspect the Barbara Pit. The first of eleven barriers was set 300 meters after the entrance. It was breached on 24 July 2008.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|pp=42–44}} It took workers eight months to remove {{convert|400|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of [[gangue]] and penetrate eleven reinforced concrete partition walls (each {{convert|1|m}} thick) to reach the graves.{{sfn|Juhant|Zalec|2012|p=237}} The first corpse was found on 23 February 2009, 449 meters into the mine, near the 9th barrier. The victim appeared to have survived the slaughter and managed to dig through 7–8 meters of land until he reached an impassable concrete door and ran out of oxygen.{{sfn|Ferenc|Alić|Jamnik|2011|p=75}} On 3 March 2009, investigators found a mass of 427 corpses that were largely mummified due to the lack of oxygen in the mine.{{sfn|Juhant|Zalec|2012|p=237}}{{sfn|Groen|Márquez-Grant|Janaway|2015|p=171}} Hair, skin, ears and nails were still visible on the corpses.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=44}} Excavating a further {{convert|5|m}} into a 45 meter deep mine shaft uncovered another 369 corpses.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=47}}

Andreja Valić, head of the Slovenian Research Centre for National Reconciliation, said upon the discovery of the mass grave that "current information, based on oral testimony, indicate that the slain people could have been Slovenian or Croatian citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloveniatimes.com/enter-the-bloody-history|title=Enter the Bloody History|publisher=The Slovenia Times|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation showed that most of the victims were Croats and Slovenes.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=51}} The researchers found orthopedic equipment and bandages among the corpses, meaning that wounded soldiers were also among the victims.{{sfn|Ferenc|2011|p=47}} Several pigtails plaited from women’s hair were also discovered.{{sfn|Rulitz|2015|p=110}}

[[Jože Dežman]], head of the Commission, said that "this is one of 15 Slovenian [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenicas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.dalje.com/en-world/mass-grave-reveals-over-300-croats-and-slovenes/239872|title=Mass Grave Reveals Over 300 Croats And Slovenes|publisher=Dalje.com|date=4 March 2009|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenian pathologist Jože Balažic commented: "The scenes that we found there indicate that the victims died in agony. All corpses are covered with lime and based on their body position it appears that the victims had been moving for a time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/44844/Default.aspx|title=Kod Laškog od živih zakopanih je 80 posto Hrvata, i kod Čakovca pronađena masovna grobnica – Slobodna Dalmacija|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|accessdate=14 August 2011|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavel Jamnik from the Slovenian Criminal Police Directorate noted that "some victims were probably still conscious when their executioners scattered lime, that is cracked, which means that they moved. Several skeletons are sticking above the surface of the lime and it is obvious that they tried to pull out in agony".{{sfn|Grahek-Ravančić|2009|p=242}} Croatian medical doctors offered their assistance in [[DNA]] analysis of the remains, which could potentially be used to identify Croat victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/45026/Default.aspx|title=Dr. Alujević nudi pomoć Slovencima: Hrvati u Hudoj jami traže svoje pretke – Slobodna Dalmacija|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|accessdate=14 August 2011|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 October 2017, more than eight years since the discovery of the massacre, the Slovenian Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities announced that, based on preliminary data of anthropological and archaeological analysis, a total of 1,416 victims were found in the coal mine. Remains of 769 individuals were exhumed from the site in 2009 and another 647 in 2016. Among them there were 21 women, while the youngest victims were 17 years old. Most of the victims are believed to be members of the military forces of NDH.&lt;ref name=MDSSZ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mddsz.gov.si/nc/si/medijsko_sredisce/novica/article//8280/|title=Pokopane vse žrtve Hude Jame|date=25 October 2017|work=Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 2017, Slovenian anthropologist Petra Leben Seljak said that among the second group, exhumed in 2016, almost all were men older than 20 and younger than 40, while 8 percent were aged between 18 and 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://radio.ognjisce.si/sl/188/slovenija/23292/|title=V rovu svete Barbare v rudniku Huda Jama do zdaj našli 1420 žrtev|date=6 March 2017|work=Radio Ognjišče}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and institutional response==
[[File:Ambassador Hartley Visits Huda Jama (1).jpg|thumb|right|US Ambassador Brent R. Hartley at the Barbara Pit in 2015]]
The first high-ranking official to visit the mass grave after the uncovering on 3 March 2009 was the Slovenian General Prosecutor [[Barbara Brezigar]], who described the scene as "horrific".&lt;ref name="24ur.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/ovadba-po-odkritju-trupel.html|title=FOTO: V rove so jih zmetali še žive|publisher=24ur.com|accessdate=13 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717152255/http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/ovadba-po-odkritju-trupel.html|archivedate=17 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, the site was visited by Slovenian [[Member of European Parliament]] and former Prime Minister [[Lojze Peterle]]. Peterle criticised [[President of Slovenia]] [[Danilo Türk]] for failing to visit the site. When asked to comment on the issue during a visit to the town of [[Trbovlje]] on 8 March, the [[International Woman's Day]], only 10 kilometers away from the mass grave, Türk refused to comment on the issue, qualifying political manipulations with the mass grave as a "second rate topic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/dnevnik/08-03-2009-za_turka_huda_jama_danes_drugorazredna_tema|title=Za Türka Huda Jama danes drugorazredna tema – Mladina|publisher=[[Mladina]]|accessdate=13 August 2011|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nismo-rekli-zlocinu-zlocin.html|title='O drugorazrednih temah ne bom govoril'|publisher=24ur.com|accessdate=13 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717152422/http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nismo-rekli-zlocinu-zlocin.html|archivedate=17 July 2011|deadurl=no|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siol.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siol.net/slovenija/novice/2009/03/peterle_o_hudi_jami.aspx|title=Türk glede Hude Jame: O drugorazrednih temah ne bom govoril|publisher=SiOL.net|date=15 May 1945|accessdate=13 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724071904/http://www.siol.net/slovenija/novice/2009/03/peterle_o_hudi_jami.aspx|archivedate=24 July 2011|deadurl=yes|language=Slovenian|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dismissed the calls to visit the grave as "political manipulation".&lt;ref name="siol.net"/&gt; He subsequently condemned the crime, adding: "as I condemn all executions during and after the (Second World) war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graham Gurrin|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1160708/300-victims-Yugoslavias-communist-regime-mass-grave.html|title=300 victims of Yugoslavia's communist regime found in mass grave|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Türk's statements that these killings must be understood "in the context of World War Two" provoked the Slovenian Minister of Defence [[Ljubica Jelušič]] to maintain that there can be no excuse for not condemning the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=1370704|title=STA: Za Türka Huda Jama danes drugorazredna tema, Jelušičeva za pobijanje ne vidi opravičila (zbirno)|publisher=Sta.si|accessdate=13 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721125811/http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&amp;id=1370704|archivedate=21 July 2011|deadurl=no|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Prime Minister and Speaker of the National Assembly, President Türk laid wreaths at the entrance to the mine on 1 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://siol.net/novice/slovenija/poklon-zrtvam-hude-jame-387637|title=Poklon žrtvam Hude Jame|date=1 November 2009|work=siol.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister [[Jadranka Kosor]] and Interior Minister [[Tomislav Karamarko]] visited the site and offered help in DNA identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/hrvatske-domobrane-ubijali-su-pijucima-864096|title=Hrvatske domobrane ubijali su pijucima|work=[[Večernji list]]|date=9 March 2009|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March, the Croatian government called for a joint Croatian-Slovenian investigation into the grave and the implementation of the 2008 agreement on the marking of military cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/11/content_10987235.htm|title=Croatia calls for joint investigation of WWII-era mass grave_English_Xinhua|publisher=News.xinhuanet.com|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, the Slovenian government helped finance the arrangement of the site and the setup of walking paths, drainage, air ventilation and electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.24ur.com/foto-huda-jama-prekopali-ostanke-800-zrtev-na-prekop-jih-caka-se-2000.html|title=FOTO: Huda jama: prekopali ostanke 800 žrtev, na prekop jih čaka še 2000|date=4 March 2013|work=24ur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
After the fall of communism, a memorial chapel was dedicated at the site in 1997. Shortly after its dedication the chapel was defaced and slogans were scrawled along the walls, including "Death to traitors" and "Death to fascism".{{sfn|Bevc|2008|p=78}}{{sfn|Ferenc|2013|p=13}}

A commemoration was held on 13 June 2015, on the occasion of the massacre's 70th anniversary, that was attended by around 2,000 people. Among them was Slovenian President Borut Pahor, Catholic Church bishops from Croatia and Slovenia, and various delegations of Croatian and Slovenian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.times.si/slovenija/huda-jama-spominska-slovesnost-ob-70-letnici-pobojev--62b978060970b886dc7557e2cbacb591f3e86fea.html|title=Škof Lipovšek: 50 let prisilnega molka o povojnih pobojih|date=13 June 2015|work=times.si}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://narod.hr/eu/foto-koncelebrirana-misa-za-zrtve-hude-jame|title=(FOTO) Koncelebrirana misa za žrtve Hude jame|date=13 June 2015|work=narod.hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2016, 778 of the exhumed victims were transferred to the Dobrava cemetery near Maribor. The commemoration was attended by the Croatian leadership, including Prime Minister [[Andrej Plenković]], President [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] and Speaker [[Božo Petrov]], Church dignitaries, and Slovenian President Borut Pahor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://eblnews.com/news/balkan/wwii-victims-communist-crimes-buried-maribor-42075|title=WWII victims of communist crimes buried in Maribor|date=27 October 2016|work=EBL News}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Croatian government session on the same day, Plenković said that "the burial of victims of post-war communist terror in Huda Jama reminds us of our debt to the victims of totalitarianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vijesti.hrt.hr/358063/pogreb-i-komemoracija-za-zrtve-ekshumirane-iz-hude-jame|title=Pogreb i komemoracija za žrtve ekshumirane iz Barbarina rova|date=27 October 2016|work=[[Croatian Radio Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Becton, Dickinson and Company''' ('''BD''') is an American [[Health technology|medical technology]] company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. Founded in 1897 and [[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]], BD employs nearly 50,000 people in more than 50 countries throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BDX|title=Google Finance:BDX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, 60% of BD sales were generated from non-U.S. markets.

The company's customers include [[health care]] institutions, science researchers, [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and the general public. BD was one of the first companies to sell U.S.-made glass syringes. It was also a pioneer in the production of hypodermic needles. Today, BD is divided into two segments: BD Medical and BD Life Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Becton, Dickinson and Co Stock Report, Standard &amp; Poor's, January 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; BD is ranked #251 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm in October 2014 agreed to acquire [[CareFusion]] for a price of $12.2 billion in cash and stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=5 October 2014| title=Becton Dickinson to buy CareFusion for $12 billion in cash, stock | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/06/us-carefusion-m-a-bectondickinson-idUSKCN0HU0U420141006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 Becton Dickinson agreed to acquire [[C. R. Bard]] for $24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bd-acquire-bard-24-billion-210400916.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
===1897–1947===
BD was founded in 1897 by [[Maxwell Becton|Maxwell W. Becton]] and [[Fairleigh S. Dickinson]], two American businessmen who met on a sales trip. The same year the company made its first sale, a Luer-all-glass [[syringe]] that sold for $2.50. In 1898, BD acquired its first [[patent]] for a medical product. In 1899 the company introduced its first logo which was meant to symbolize guaranteed superior quality of the products provided by BD. In 1904, BD acquired the Philadelphia Surgical Company. This very first acquisition and other early acquisitions significantly expanded the company's manufacturing ability and product offering. Two years later, BD incorporated in the state of [[New Jersey]] and built a manufacturing facility in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], the first in the U.S. created specifically for the production of [[thermometer]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and syringes. In 1924, BD manufactured its first syringe designed specifically for [[insulin]] injection. One year later, BD introduced the BD Yale Luer-Lok Syringe, designed and patented by Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr. It provided a simple and secure method of attaching and removing the needle to and from the syringe. Today, [[Luer taper]] connectors are the standard for syringes in the U.S. In 1947 Joseph Kleiner developed the Evacutainer—a device used to draw blood by vacuum through a needle into a test tube. This product eventually evolved to become the BD [[Vacutainer]] Blood Collection system.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/aboutbd/history/|title=BD Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948–1970===
In 1948, BD faced new leadership as [[Fairleigh Dickinson, Jr.|Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.]] and Henry P. Becton, sons of the founders, took over the company. Their 24-year tenure was a time of rapid development for BD. The company grew within the U.S. as well as internationally. In 1949, it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in [[Columbus, Nebraska]]. In 1961, it established a manufacturing facility in [[Canaan, Connecticut]]. BD also soon expanded to [[Canada]] (1951), [[Mexico]] (1952), [[France]] (1955), and [[Brazil]] (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950, BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954, BD introduced the first completely disposable syringe made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] [[vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]]. One year later, BD entered the [[microbiology]] field through the acquisition of the Baltimore Biological Laboratory. In 1961, the company introduced its disposable BD Plastipak syringe. Under the new leadership the company also went public (1962) and appeared for the first time in the [[Fortune 500]] list (1970).&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1973–1995===
In 1973, BD added another U.S. facility&amp;nbsp;— a research center in [[Durham, North Carolina]] in [[Research Triangle Park]]. The center was established to help the company meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and process methods, and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting [[heparin]]. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company's development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in [[Plymouth]], [[England]] was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]] ([[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|current HQ location]].) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a [[Blood vessel|vascular]] access devices manufacturer. The last three years of the 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe, the BD Safety-Lok (1988), and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD's development. The company opened a central distribution center in [[Temse]], [[Belgium]] (1992) and entered [[India]] and [[China]] (1995). BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following [[Venipuncture|blood-drawing]] procedures, the BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1999–2006===
In 1999, as BD passed more than 100 years of presence in the medical devices industry, BD announced its new [[corporate identity]]. Numerous independent brand names were replaced by a single name: BD. In addition, the company symbol that is used today was introduced. BD also named Edward J. Ludwig as the company's [[president (corporate title)|president]]. Ludwig was also named [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] (2000) and [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board of Directors]] (2002). On February 9, 1999, BD announced the acquisition of Biometric Imaging, Inc. (BMI), a privately held company serving the transfusion medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21195&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=Becton Dickinson and Company Announces the Acquisition of Biometric Imaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2000, BD signed an agreement to acquire Gentest Corporation, a privately held company serving the life sciences market in the areas of drug metabolism and toxicology testing of pharmaceutical candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21347&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=BD Signs Agreement to Acquire Gentest Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, BD also got heavily involved in global health issues announcing a five-year maternal and neonatal tetanus worldwide elimination partnership with [[UNICEF]] (1999), launching the BD Safety Compliance Initiative (2000), and pledging $1 million contribution to the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (2002.) In 2003 and 2004, BD introduced several innovative products: BD FACSAria Cell Sorter—the first entirely new instrument in the next-generation portfolio of flow cytometers (2003), BD Accuspray—a nasal drug delivery system for administering vaccines (2003), BD.id—a patient identification system designed to limit the potential for medical errors in [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] collection (2003), and the world's first "intelligent" [[insulin pump]] and [[Blood glucose monitoring|glucose monitoring]] system, a wireless system consisting of a Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512 Insulin Pump and Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor, co-developed with BD. In the beginning of the 21st century BD also invested in growing its business by acquiring several strategically important companies. In 2001, it acquired the Gentest Corporation, a leading in drug metabolism and toxicology testing company. In 2004, BD completed the acquisition of Atto Bioscience Acquired, a company specializing in [[Optics|optical]] instrumentation, software, and [[reagent]]s for real-time analysis of interactions taking place in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. In 2005 BD entered the field of [[proteomics]] through its acquisition of FFE Weber GmbH, which specialized in the [[separation process|separation]] and [[fractionation]] of complex proteins. 2006 was also an important year to document BD's growth as the company acquired GeneOhm Sciences—a leader in the development of [[Molecule|molecular]] diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of [[bacteria]]l organisms and TriPath Imaging, a [[cancer]] diagnostics company.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

In mid-2007, the firm's Discardit II series of syringes numbered 0607186 was withdrawn from hospitals and other medical services around [[Poland]], about half a year after the discovery of remains of dark dust in some syringes, which were alleged to have been from this series.&lt;ref name="dziennik_BDDiscardit"&gt;{{cite news | first=Leszek | last=Kraskowski | pages= | language = Polish| title= For over half a year, hospitals used tainted syringes | date=2007-08-01 | publisher=Dziennik Online |url= http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=96&amp;amp;ShowArticleId=54999 | access-date=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper Dziennik Online claimed that other series such as 06022444, 0603266, and 0607297 were also suspected of being contaminated.  BD recalled and tested the syringes in question, and revealed sterile particulates in 0.013 percent of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN0640879120070806|title=Reuters: Becton Dickinson expands syringe recall in Poland | date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal proceedings related to the incident started in December 2006.&lt;ref name="dziennik_BDDiscardit" /&gt; According to an article published in Dziennik on Monday, 21 April 2008, the prosecutor's office in Lublin discontinued the inquiry, because the disposable syringes were not dangerous.

===2010 Q-Syte Luer and IV Catheter partial recall===
In February 2010 BD announced a voluntary product recall of certain lots of BD Q-Syte Luer Access Devices and BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter Systems. BD stated that the use of the affected devices may cause an air embolism or leakage of blood and/or therapy, which may result in serious injury or death. The approximately 2.8 million BD Q-Syte and 2.9 million BD Nexiva units containing 5 million BD Q-Syte devices that were recalled were distributed in the United States, Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28, 2009 after BD received complaints of problems due to air entry through a part of the device. BD stated that the cause of the problem was manufacturing deviation and claimed that it corrected the problem. BD announced that it notified customers about the recall by letter and has been working with the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] and worldwide health agencies to coordinate recall activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0815057720100208|title=Reuters: Becton Dickinson recalls intravenous devices | date=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=24486&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=BD+Worldwide&amp;s=&amp;dTitle=&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=|title=BD Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and safety issues ===
In April 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health and Administration fined BD $112,700 for safety violations. They found repeat and serious violations of health and safety law that had resulted in two employees having partial finger amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=31062|title=OSHA finds dozen violations at Becton, Dickinson and Co. in Holdrege after two workers suffer finger amputations|last=|first=|date=April 12, 2016|website=|publisher=OSHA|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Joseph Weston''' (1 November 1947 – circa 3 January 2012) was a British [[rock music|rock]] guitarist, who was a member of [[Fleetwood Mac]] in the early 1970s. He also recorded and performed with a number of other musicians, including [[Graham Bond]], [[Long John Baldry]], [[Murray Head]], [[Sandy Denny]] and [[Danny Kirwan]].

==Early life and career==
Weston was born in [[Plymouth]] in the county of [[Devon]] on 1 November 1947, to a [[Royal Navy]] service family.&lt;ref name="Tel obit"/&gt; In his childhood he learned to play the violin, switching to the guitar at the age of 12, being influenced by the music of [[Blues|American blues]] artists such as [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Muddy Waters]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Weston, 'The Independent', 10 January 2012. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bob-weston-early-70s-guitarist-with-fleetwood-mac-6287377.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moving to London from Devon in the [[Swinging Sixties|mid-1960s]] (he retained a soft [[West Country]] burr to his voice for the rest of his life), in 1967 he became the lead-guitarist with a [[mod (subculture)|mod]]-[[Beat music|beat]] band called The Kinetic, which was based at the time in [[Paris]], playing as a support act to [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Chuck Berry]] gigs in France. The band signed to the French label Disques Vogue and released into the French market a long-player entitled ''Live Your Life'' (1967), with Weston being the band's principal songwriter,&lt;ref&gt;History of 'The Kinetic', 'Rockasteria' website (2018). http://rockasteria.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-kinetic-suddenly-tomorrow-ep-live.html&lt;/ref&gt; and two [[Extended player|EP's]], ''Live Your Life'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'Live Your Life' E.P. on '45 Cat' website, a French historic records catalogue (2018). http://www.45cat.com/record/epl8544&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Suddenly Tomorrow'' (1967). The ''Suddenly Tomorrow'' EP drew notices in the British music press to the act as having commercial potential, but no more recordings appeared, and it disbanded within a couple of years of its formation.&lt;ref&gt;The Kinetic performing 'Suddenly Tomorrow', unidentified television show (1967/68). Published on YouTube 25 September 2011. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pHEKUlaCdM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Kinetic performing 'Live Your Life', unidentified television show (1967), published on YouTube 2 December 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQ09ZJNAdc&lt;/ref&gt;      

After The Kinetic had broken up, having returned to London from Paris, in April 1968 Weston joined the British blues heavy rock band [[Black Cat Bones]], replacing [[Paul Kossoff]] as its lead-guitarist, and played with it until quitting the act at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Career profile of Weston, 'The Musicians' Olympus' website (2018). https://musiciansolympus.blogspot.com/2012/01/bobweston-guitar.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Weston worked as a [[session musician|guitar for hire]], performing and recording with a number of acts of the then in vogue [[British blues]] movement, including [[Graham Bond]] and [[Long John Baldry]], and touring in continental Europe and America.&lt;ref name="Tel obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9003426/Bob-Weston.html |title=Bob Weston |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 he was performing with the [[Southern Rock]] act Ashman Reynolds as its lead guitarist,&lt;ref&gt;Weston performing 'Taking Off' with 'Ashman Reynolds' on [[Beat-Club]] in 1971. Published on YouTube 7 May 2010. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bHhlavflo&lt;/ref&gt; songwriting and playing on its long-player release ''Stop Off'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'Stop Off' L.P., 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/discog/discog.php?pid=584&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleetwood Mac==
In 1972 Weston was resident in [[Ealing]] in West London, when he joined the British [[blues rock]] band [[Fleetwood Mac]] as its co-lead guitarist alongside [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], as a replacement for the recently dropped [[Danny Kirwan]]. The band was aware of Weston's talent having seen him performing when Long John Baldry had regularly shared the same billing at venues with Fleetwood Mac, and when the guitar vacancy had arrived in Fleetwood Mac's line-up Weston was approached by the band with the offer of joining, which he agreed to in September.&lt;ref&gt;Online Q.&amp; A. session with Weston, 6-19 December 1999. http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobweston_qa1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 1973 Fleetwood Mac recorded the long-player ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', Weston playing the record's distinctive [[slide guitar]] on the song "Remember Me", and its [[harmonica]] and [[banjo]] tracks. He also sang a duet with [[Christine McVie]] on the song "Did You Ever Love Me", and wrote the instrumental that closed the album, titled "Caught in the Rain".&lt;ref name="Brunning"&gt;'Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Mask', by Bob Brunning (Pub. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1973 the band recorded its next album titled ''[[Mystery to Me]]''. Weston contributed more distinctive guitar work, such as the slide intro on the song "Why", and co-wrote the song "Forever" with Welch and [[John McVie]]. In retrospect, Weston felt that his contribution to the band's work in this period did not receive the formal recognition that it deserved.&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;The Penguin [http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobweston_qa1.htm Q&amp;A with Bob Weston, December 6–19, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a tour of the [[United States of America]] in 1973, when the band were beginning to gel particularly well in its live performances,&lt;ref&gt;Fleetwood Mac in concert playing 'Believe Me', 1973. Published on YouTube 7 January 2012. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMQZnfRcQiE&lt;/ref&gt; it emerged that Weston had started a clandestine romantic relationship with [[Mick Fleetwood]]'s wife, [[Jenny Boyd]].&lt;ref name="Tel obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunning" /&gt; Fleetwood had got on well before this with Weston, and tried to carry on with the arranged live performance schedule due to the legal and financial penalties that would be incurred by the band for a cancelled tour, but after a gig at [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] in October he informed the band in Weston's absence that he was no longer willing to work with him. In consequence the band collectively agreed to drop Weston from the line-up, Weston being told about the decision by the act's tour manager, with the rest of the tour being abandoned by the remaining members.&lt;ref name="Penguin" /&gt; (It was this situation which gave rise to the "[[Stretch (band)|Bogus Fleetwood Mac]]" saga in which its manager [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]] hired a new group of musicians, passed them off as Fleetwood Mac, and sent them out to complete the tour).&lt;ref name="Brunning" /&gt; 

Weston's involvement in the band had an effect beyond purely the musical, as the spin into which his relationship with Boyd had put it contributed to Bob Welch's departure from its line-up in 1974. This led to a vacancy filled by [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]], who brought to the band a more mainstream rock sound, which would in the late 1970s-1980s lead to its greater popularity and commercial success.&lt;ref name="Brunning" /&gt;

==Later career==
On his return to London in late 1973 from the aborted Fleetwood Mac tour, Weston was approached by [[George Harrison]] about a possible collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Weston, 'The Guardian', 8 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not develop into anything of a practical nature. Weston went on to record and tour in Europe and North America with [[Murray Head]], playing on his second album ''[[Say It Ain't So (album)|Say It Ain't So]]'' (1975), for which he co-wrote the song "Silence Is a Strong Reply". In July 1975 he joined a newly formed band called the [[Steve Marriott]] All Stars, but when Marriott opted to play lead guitar himself, Weston departed in December of the same year,&lt;ref name="Penguin"/&gt; and for the remainder of his career worked primarily as a solo artist or as a session musician. In 1979 he played on Head's third album ''Between Us''. 

In 1979 he wrote and recorded a blues rock album titled ''Nightlight'', which was produced by [[Alan Callan]] at [[Sarm West Studios|Basing Street Studios]] and at [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse Studio]] in London, and commercially released the following year through the French record label AZ International.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'Nightlight' (1980) on 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=116&lt;/ref&gt; However, with popular taste in music having moved on from the early 1970s, and British blues rock having become a small uncommercial niche market,{{cn|date=September 2018}} the record failed to enter the charts. A single, "Silver Arrow", was released, but also failed to sell well enough to chart.

In 1980 he recorded another blues rock album, ''Studio Picks'', at [[Eel Pie Studios]], produced again by Callan, featuring his own material and a cover of [[the Everly Brothers]]' "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]". Mick Fleetwood played drums on one track, "Ford 44", the first time that he and Weston had worked together since the acrimony of 1973. The record was again released by AZ International in 1981, but like ''Nightlight'' it failed to enter the United Kingdom albums chart, and Weston's contract with the label was subsequently terminated.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'Studio Picks' (1981) on 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=117&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Weston made a foray into mainstream pop music with a standalone single, "Desire", released by the French record company Underdog Records, but it also failed to chart and was his last solo commercial record.

With his career as a solo artist having failed to take off, in the 1980s Weston returned to working as a professional [[session musician]], playing live on tour with a variety of acts, working in London studios, and intermittently in Europe and America. He played on [[Dick Morrissey]]'s 1986 [[jazz]] album ''[[Souliloquy]]'', writing one of its songs, and also worked in television music production.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Weston. 'The Independent', 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Weston, 'The Guardian', 8 January 2012. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/08/bob-weston&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the soundtrack for the French cinema film ''[[Robert Kramer|Diesel]]'' (1985), and acted as the musical director for the production of the British television film ''Palmer'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;"Online Q.&amp; A. session with Weston, 6-19 December 1999. http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobweston_qa1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'Palmer' (1991) in IMDb. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1365495/fullcredits&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s he retired from professional music for several years,&lt;ref&gt;Online Q.&amp; A. with Weston, 6-19 December 1999. http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/qa/bobweston_qa1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; returning to it at the end of the decade with a self-produced album called ''There's a Heaven'' (1999), which was engineered at Studio 125 in [[Burgess Hill]] and released independently.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for 'There's a Heaven' on 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website. http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=121&lt;/ref&gt;  

In January 2008 Weston announced that he had started working on recording some new material at Markant Studios in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobweston.com/ |title=Official Home Site |publisher=Bob Weston |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working there he met Frank Baijens, a Dutch singer-songwriter who was recording his album ''Odd Man Out'' at the studio at the same time, and Weston played on one of the album's songs, "Where the Heart Belongs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankbaijens.nl/ |title=Frank Baijens – ODD MAN OUT |publisher=Frankbaijens.nl |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last years Weston was resident in North West London, occasionally playing in impromptu sessions at [[The Duke of Hamilton]] [[public house]] and gigging with a local band called Mad Dog Bites.&lt;ref&gt;Film of Weston at the Duke of Hamilton pub in 2010, 'Something's in the Air by Bob Weston &amp; Friends', published on YouTube 6 January 2012. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH-BXKUbu5I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Mad Dog Bites' in performance at the Hampstead Christmas Festival, 2011. Published on YouTube 1 December 2011. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoyBcvqQY8k&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death== 
Weston, who lived alone in his final years, was found dead in his flat by police officers in [[Brent Cross]] in London on 3 January 2012, who had gained entry to the property after his friends had reported concerns over not hearing from him unexpectedly for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/293830/Fleetwood-Mac-star-dies |title=Fleetwood Mac star dies &amp;#124; Showbiz &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Daily Express |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=6 January 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Career profile of Bob Weston, 'Fleetwood Mac.net' website (2018). http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/fwm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=35&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported to have died on an unknown date from the effects of a [[gastrointestinal bleeding|gastrointestinal haemorrhage]] caused by [[cirrhosis]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist dies', 'Variety', 6 January 2012. https://variety.com/2012/music/news/ex-fleetwood-mac-guitarist-bob-weston-dies-1118048238/&lt;/ref&gt; He was 64 years old.&lt;ref name="Tel obit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobweston.com/ |title=Bob Weston 1947–2012 |accessdate=6 January 2012 |publisher=Bob Weston official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chelydridae''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[turtle]]s that has seven extinct and two extant [[genera]]. The extant genera are the snapping turtles ''[[Chelydra]]'' and ''[[Macrochelys]]''. Both are [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The extinct genera are ''[[Acherontemys]], [[Chelydrops]], [[Chelydropsis]], [[Emarginachelys]], [[Macrocephalochelys]], [[Planiplastron]]'', and ''[[Protochelydra]]''.

==Fossil history==
The Chelydridae have a long [[fossil]] history, with [[extinction|extinct]] species reported from [[North America]] as well as all over Asia and [[Europe]], far outside their present range. The earliest described chelydrid is ''[[Emarginachelys cretacea]]'', known from well-preserved fossils from the [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the Late [[Cretaceous]] of [[Montana]].&lt;ref name=PB/&gt; Another well-preserved fossil chelydrid is the Late [[Paleocene]] ''[[Protochelydra zangerli]]'' from [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Danilov G. and J. F. Parham. (2008). A reassessment of some poorly known turtles from the Middle Jurassic of China, with comments on the antiquity of extant turtles. ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' 28(2):306-318&lt;/ref&gt; The [[carapace]] of ''P. zangerli'' is higher domed than that of the recent ''Chelydra'', a trait conjectured to be associated with the coexistence of large, chelonivorous (i.e., turtle-eating) [[crocodilia]]ns. Another genus, ''Chelydropsis'', contains several well-known [[Eurasia]]n chelydrid [[species]] that existed from the [[Oligocene]] to the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, M. (2008).

''Courier Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg'' 260:161-183&lt;/ref&gt; In South America, chelydrids (''[[Chelydra acutirostris|C. acutirostris]]'') only occupy the northwestern corner of the continent, reflecting their recent arrival from Central America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].

__NOTOC__
[[Image:eyegouge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Eye-gouging using the thumb]]
'''Eye-gouging''' is the act of pressing or tearing the [[eye]] using the fingers or instruments. Eye-gouging involves a very high risk of [[eye injury]], such as eye loss or blindness. 

Eye-gouging as a fighting style was once [[Gouging (fighting style)|a popular form of sport fighting]] in the back-country United States, primarily in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorn|first=Elliott J.|date=1985|title="Gouge and Bite, Pull Hair and Scratch": The Social Significance of Fighting in the Southern Backcountry.|jstor=1860747|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=90|issue=1|pages=18–43|doi=10.2307/1860747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye-gouging is prohibited in modern sports. It is a serious offence in rugby football codes where it occurs rarely. It is prohibited in [[combat sports]], but some [[self-defense]] systems teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0277-3066 | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 110 | last = Hosey | first = Timothy |author2=Michael Klaybor | title = Common Sense Self-Defense: For the Woman Who Doesn't Have the Time to Train | work = Black Belt | date = October 1984 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7toDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=eye%20gouge%20self%20defense&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training in eye-gouging can involve extensive [[grappling]] training to establish control, the eye-gouging itself being practiced with the opponent wearing eye protection such as swimming goggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0277-3066 | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 69 | last = Vunak | first = Paul |author2=Erin Vunak | title = Biting and Eye Gouging: Why You Need to Know the Philippine Art of Kino Mutai | work = Black Belt | date = March 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ns4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=eye+gouge+goggles }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuki Nakai]] went on to win a bout in the [[Shooto|Vale Tudo Japan 1995]] tournament after his opponent performed an illegal gouge that [[blindness|blinded]] him in his right eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Yuki-Nakai-429|title= Nakai talks Vale Tudo, SHOOTO and Rickson |accessdate=2008-11-03 |author= Jason Nowe and Stephen Martinez|date= February 14, 2006 |publisher=sherdog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary}}
A '''flower car''' is a type of [[vehicle]] used in the [[funeral]] industry, used to carry flowers for the burial service, or sometimes to carry the [[coffin]] under a bed of flowers. Built on the same commercial [[chassis]] as a [[hearse]], the flower car has half-height rear bodywork on the rear similar to a [[pickup truck]] bed.  The bed contains a liner to hold the flowers, normally built of [[stainless steel]] to resist rust. Some flower cars have a raised, flat [[tonneau cover]] across the bed at the top, upon which the flowers sit; the center portion sometimes is designed to raise and lower, hydraulically or by hand. If the flower car is designed to carry a casket, it will be stored under the tonneau cover in the space beneath, behind the opening rear gate.

In the early years of the [[automobile]], open-topped luxury cars were used for this purpose, but as enclosed vehicles became the norm, specially built vehicles began to be used for this purpose from approximately the 1930s onward. Not every funeral provider owned a flower car; they were a luxury item offered as an extra-cost option for extravagant funerals. The quantities built were low; it is estimated that fewer than a dozen were built each year by each [[coachbuilder]] in the funeral market.

Flower cars are still manufactured, but in ever decreasing numbers. Old flower cars are considered collectible due to their rarity, especially by collectors of hearses and other "[[professional car]]s".

'''Food politics''' are the political aspects of the production, control, [[regulation]], [[Food quality|inspection]], [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[eating|consumption]] of [[food]]. The politics can be affected by the [[ethical]], [[cultural]], [[medical]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental]] disputes concerning proper [[farming]], [[agricultural]] and [[retail]]ing methods and regulations.

==Policy==
{{main|Food policy}}
Government policies around food production, distribution, and consumption influence the cost, availability, and safety of the food supply domestically and internationally. On a national scale, food policy work affects farmers, food processors, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Commodity crops, such as corn, rice, wheat, and soy are most often at the heart of agricultural policy-making.&lt;ref name="Wilde" &gt;{{cite book|last=Wilde|first=Parke|title=Food Policy in the United States: An Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=978-1-84971-428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most food policy is initiated domestically, there are international ramifications. Globally, protectionist trade policies, international trade agreements, famine, political instability, and development aid are among the primary influences on food policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messer|first=E|author2=Cohen, M|title=Conflict, Food Insecurity, and Globalization|journal=Food, Culture and Society: An International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research|date=Summer 2007|volume=10|series=2|pages=297–315|doi=10.2752/155280107x211458}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, climate change concerns and predictions are gaining the attention of those most concern with ensuring an adequate worldwide food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=M|author2=Rosenzweig, C |author3=Livermore, M |title=Climate change, global food supply and risk of hunger|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B|date=Nov 29, 2005|volume=350|series=1463|pages=2125–2138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food politics in the U.S.==

A number of contemporary issues around food policy issues have surfaced in the United States due to changes in the production of food and concerns about the nutritional quality of commercially prepared foods.

==Technology==
As with many industries, the [[food industry]] has experienced growth in the capacity to produce food with the use of improved technologies. In developed countries, there are a number of important trends at play. Yields, or the amount of food harvested per acre of cropland, have increased less than one percent per year in since at least the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Alexandratos, N, Bruinsma, J. "World agriculture towards 2030/2050: the 2012 revision." FSA Working paper No. 12-03. Rome, FAO.&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount of land devoted to crop use is in decline due to development pressures for housing and other economic concerns. In the U.S. alone, about 3000 acres of productive farmland are lost each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Use Overview|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/landuse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This places a premium on quality yields from existing acres of farmland. In addition, the demand for meat products worldwide, expected to double by 2020, has accelerated a trend toward raising more animals on fewer acres of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Cassandra|title=Consequences of increased global meat consumption on the global environment -- trade in virtual water, energy &amp; nutrients|url=https://woods.stanford.edu/environmental-venture-projects/consequences-increased-global-meat-consumption-global-environment|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More intensive forms of animal farming have largely replaced traditional methods of raising pigs, cattle, poultry and fish for human consumption in the U.S. The increased development of [[feedlots|Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations]] have been associated with increased risk of foodborne illnesses from e.coli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Escherichia coli 0157 In United States Feedlots|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/feedlot/downloads/feedlot99/Feedlot99_is_Ecoli.pdf|publisher=USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Comis|first=D|title=An Environmental Look at America's Feedlots|journal=Agricultural Research|date=July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;   environmental degradation, and increased emissions of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane into the air.  In addition to food safety and environmental concerns, organizations such as the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) have drawn attention to a range of practices that allow for the more efficient raising of animals for meat consumption, but these practices stress the animals, the land on which they are raised and the supply of food for human consumption. In a recent report on industrialized animal agriculture, HSUS called on people in Western countries to shift to a plant-based diet because half the world's grain crop is used to raise animals for meat, eggs, and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An HSUS Report: The Impact of Industrialized Animal Agriculture on World Hunger|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Fish farming]] has also come under scrutiny due to high concentrations of fish in smaller spaces than is experienced in the wild. For both land and water animals, [[antibiotic use in livestock|the prophylactic use of antibiotics]] to promote growth and stem the spread of infection among the animals has also been questioned due to concerns that this practice may contribute to strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallinga|first=D|author2=Burch, D|title=Head to Head: Does adding routine antibiotics to animal feed pose a serious risk to human health?|journal=BMJ|date=July 10, 2013|volume=347|page=f4214|doi=10.1136/bmj.f4214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetically modified foods ===
{{main|Genetically modified organism}}
The use of genetically modified seeds to grow commodity and other crops in the U.S. has drawn criticism from organizations such as [[Greenpeace]], [[The Non-GMO Project]], and the [[Organic Consumers Association]] among others. Concerns center on both food safety and the erosion of agricultural biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;  While the European Union regulates genetically engineered foods as they would any other new product requiring extensive testing to provide it is safe for human consumption, the U.S. does not. The Food and Drug Administration generally considers a food with origins from genetically modified organisms (GMO) to be as safe as its conventional counterpart.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;  Numerous studies have backed industry claims that GMO foods appear to be safe for human consumption, including an examination of more than 130 research projects conducted in the European Union prior to 2010&lt;ref&gt;Directorate-General for Research and Innovation: Biotechnologies, Agriculture, Food. European Union 2010. "A decade of EU-funded GMO research (2001–2010)." doj: 10.2777/97784. {{ISBN|978-92-79-16344-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work published by the American Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report 2 of the Council on Science and Public Health: Labeling Bioengineered Foods|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/csaph/a12-csaph2-bioengineeredfoods.pdf|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the political debate has centered primarily on whether or not to label products with GMO origins to better inform the public about the content of the foods they purchase. A statewide ballot question that would have mandated labeling of GMO products in California was defeated in 2012. The measure, known as [[Proposition 37]] was leading by a wide margin in early polling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/news-events/news/2012/10/11-spp-crbt-release-statewide-initiative-survey-results.htm|publisher=Pepperdine University School of Public Health|title=California Business Roundtable and Pepperdine University Release Statewide Initiative Survey Results|date=10/11/12|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but was defeated after an advertising blitz bankrolled by Monsanto, the largest supplier of genetically engineered seeds, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo., and other large food business interests.  The ballot question's results were closely watched across the country as advocates for the measure hoped that it would pass and spur the federal government to mandate labeling of GMO foods as well.&lt;ref name="GMO NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pollack|first=Andrew|title=After Loss, Fight to Label Modified Foods Continues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/business/california-bid-to-label-genetically-modified-crops.html?_r=0|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=11/7/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the labeling law proposal's defeat, an organization called [[March Against Monsanto]] was formed to continue to keep alive the public debate about labeling GMO food products. In 2013, a ballot initiative that would have required labels on GMO foods sold in the state of Washington was defeated by voters, again after a campaign against the initiative was led by major food companies.&lt;ref name="GMO NYTimes" /&gt;

=== Pesticide use ===
Among the much-heralded impacts of the [[Green Revolution]] was the spread of technological advances in the development of pesticides to ensure higher crop yields. [[Health effects of pesticides]] have led to a number of regulatory and non-regulatory efforts to control potential harm to human health from these chemicals in the food supply. The  US Environmental Protection Agency has jurisdiction of the use of [[pesticides]] in crop management and sets tolerances for trace amounts of pesticides that may be found in the food supply. About 12,000 samples of fruits and vegetables available to U.S. consumers are collected each year and tested for residue from pesticides and the results are published in an annual Pesticide Data Program (PDP) hosted by the USDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PESTICIDE DATA PROGRAM (PDP)|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&amp;navID=&amp;rightNav1=&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=ScienceandLaboratories&amp;page=PesticideDataProgram&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=pestcddataprg|publisher=USDA Agricultural Marketing Service|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The non-profit organization, [[Environmental Working Group]], publishes an annual list called the Dirty Dozen designed to direct consumers’ attention to the fruits and vegetables most contaminated by pesticide residue. In its annual Shopper's Guide to Pesticides, the organization urges shoppers to continue eating fresh produce, but consider purchasing organically grown versions of the 12 most contaminated items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary: EWG's 2013 Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce|url=http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php|publisher=Environmental Working Group|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Big food"===
Food manufacturing and processing is a heavily concentrated industry. The 10 largest food companies in the United States control more than half of all food sales domestically and a growing percentage of packaged food and beverage products on store shelves worldwide.&lt;ref name="Lyson article" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyson|first=T|author2=Raymer, AL|title=Stalking the wily multinational: power and control in the US food system|journal=Agric Human Values|year=2000|volume=17|pages=199–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ranked by food sales, [[PepsiCo]], Inc., is the largest food manufacturer in the U.S., followed by [[Tyson Foods]], [[Nestlé]], [[JBS USA]], and [[Anheuser-Busch]], according to a 2013 list published by ''Food Processing'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Processing Top 100 2013|url=http://www.foodprocessing.com/top100/top-100-2013/|publisher=Food Processing magazine|accessdate=12/5/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to figures from the United States Census Bureau from 2007, the most highly concentrated food industries in the country included cane sugar refining, breakfast cereals, bottled water, and cookie/cracker manufacturing using the 4-firm [[concentration ratio]]. Consolidation of this industry took place in the 1970s and 1980s through a series of mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Lyson article" /&gt;

"Big food" has come under fire not only because a small number of players are responsible for a large percentage of the food supply chain, but because of concerns about the links between the highly processed foods they produce and the [[epidemiology of obesity|obesity epidemic]] both in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stuckler|first=D|author2=Nestle, M|title=Big food, big systems, and global health|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2012|volume=96|issue=6|pages=e1001242|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The director general of the World Health Organization, in a speech given at the 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion in Helsinki, Finland in June 2013, noted that the public health community's efforts to combat chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are pitted against the economic interests of the powerful food industry. Several studies are exploring processed foods with high concentrations of sugar, refined carbohydrates, fat, salt and caffeine for addictive properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ifland|first=JR|title=Refined Food addiction: A classic substance disorder|journal=Medical Hypotheses|date=May 2009|volume=72|issue=5|pages=518–526|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.11.035|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing and other strategies of the food industry have been compared to those of the tobacco industry at the height of its influence in the consumer marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gearhardt|first=AN|author2=Davis, C |author3=Kuschner, R |author4=Brownell, KD |title=The Addiction Potential of Hyperpalatable Foods|journal=Current Drug Abuse Reviews|year=2011|volume=4|pages=140–150 |doi=10.2174/1874473711104030140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brownell|first=KD|author2=Warner, KE|title=The perils of ignoring history: Big tobacco played dirty and millions died.

In 2005, General Mills announced a plan to ensure that all of its breakfast cereals contained at least eight grams of whole grain per serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Mills goes whole grains Cereal maker will shift kids cereals to healthier whole grains by early 2005|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/30/news/fortune500/general_mills/|publisher=CNN Money|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Campbell Soup Company announced an initiative to reduce sodium in its products by at least 25 percent. Due to slumping sales, Campbell's acknowledged that it was adding more sodium back into some of its soups in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nestle|first=Marion|title=Campbell Soup fights the salt wars|url=http://www.foodpolitics.com/2011/07/campbell-soup-fights-the-salt-wars/|publisher=Food Politics (blog)|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food movements===
A cultural backlash against an increasingly mechanized food industry has taken a number of different forms.

*[[Local food]] is a movement to shift food expenditures by individuals, families, community organizations, schools, restaurants, and other institutions from foods produced and shipped long distances by larger corporate entities to regional farmers and other local producers of food. Small farming interests, relatively heterogeneous products and short supply chains characterize local food markets, though there is no agreed-upon measure of the distances that constitute "local."  [[Community-supported agriculture]] is a mechanism for connecting consumers with local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Local Food Systems: Concepts, Impacts, and Issues by Stephen Martinez, Michael S. Hand, Michelle Da Pra, Susan Pollack, Katherine Ralston, Travis Smith, Stephen Vogel, Shellye Clark, Loren Tauer, Luanne Lohr, Sarah A. Low, and Constance Newman. Economic Research Report No. (ERR-97) 87 pp, May 2010. http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err97.aspx#.Uqx8RY2E7Fk.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farm-to-table]] efforts are also part of the local food movement.
*[[Meatless Monday]] is a public health awareness campaign encouraging individuals and families to eat a meat-free diet at least once each week. Launched in 2003 through the [[Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future]], its focus is on preventable diseases associated with excessive meat consumption &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/history/|publisher=Meatless Monday|accessdate=12/5/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the campaign has also been incorporated by many concerned about [[sustainable agriculture]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laestadium|first=LI |author2=Neff, RA |author3=Barry, CL |author4=Frattaroli, S|title=Meat consumption and climate change: the role of non-governmental organizations|journal=Climatic Change|year=2013|volume=120|pages=25–38|doi=10.1007/s10584-013-0807-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Slow Food]] is an international movement founded in Italy in 1986, with Slow Food USA established in 2000. The organization stands in opposition to "the standardization of taste and culture, and the unrestrained power of food industry multinationals and industrial agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow Food: The History of an Idea|url=http://www.slowfood.com/international/7/history|publisher=Slow Food International|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those influential in the food movement in the United States are writers, including [[Michael Pollan]] and [[Marion Nestle]], and celebrity chefs such as [[Alice Waters]], [[Mario Batali]] and [[Jamie Oliver]]. Popular books and movies on contemporary topics in food include [[Fast Food Nation]], [[The Omnivore's Dilemma]] and the documentary [[Food, Inc.]]. In 2011, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation referred to this influential group as "self-appointed food elitists" and the Washington Post published an op-ed from Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation, defending the work he and colleagues have done to improve food systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|title=Why being a foodie isn't 'elitist'|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-29/opinions/35229900_1_small-farmers-wealthy-farmers-american-farmers|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=Washington Post|date=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice===
While the production and distribution of food is primarily an economic activity, advocates for a variety of [[social justice]] concerns are increasingly aware of the role that food policy plays in issues of greatest concern to causes they espouse.

====Biofuel mandates and food supply====
{{Main|Food vs. fuel}}
The interests of varied sectors of the agricultural industry are not always in alignment &lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt; as illustrated by tensions stemming from a drought in 2012 that affected domestic corn production. Described as the most severe and extensive drought in the U.S. in the last 25 years by the USDA Economic Research Service, thousands of acres of mostly corn and soy fields in the Midwest were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Drought 2012: Farm and Food Impacts|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/in-the-news/us-drought-2012-farm-and-food-impacts.aspx#.UqyIX42E7Fk|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|accessdate=2013-11-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116030109/http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/in-the-news/us-drought-2012-farm-and-food-impacts.aspx#.UqyIX42E7Fk|archivedate=2013-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This led to increased pressure on the federal government from some domestic farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jegarajah|first=Sri|title=Surging US Corn Prices Spark ‘Food Versus Fuel’ Debate|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/48477352|publisher=CNBC.com|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and international anti-hunger organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US biofuel production should be suspended, UN says|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19206199|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=BBC News|date=8/10/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to relax the [[Renewable Fuel Standard]] that call for a portion of the US-grown corn supply to be set aside for ethanol production. Meat and poultry producers, both of whom rely on corn for animal feed and feared rising prices due to the drought conditions, accused the federal government of "picking winners and losers" with its ethanol policy while ethanol producers, many of whom are corn farmers, argued that price spikes would affect them as well and that ethanol production had been scaled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Drought, a Debate Over Quota for Ethanol|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/business/energy-environment/ethanol-quota-debated-by-corn-farmers-and-meat-industry.html|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic food aid====
Offering government food assistance to the lowest income Americans dates back to the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and has continued into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="SNAP history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History of SNAP|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/short-history-snap|publisher=USDA Food and Nutrition Services|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In FY 2011, the budget for the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, which is responsible for the major feeding programs, was $107 billion. The largest single food assistance program in the country is the [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]], the provisions for which are contained in a [[Farm Bill]] that is re-authorized by Congress and signed by the president every five years. Benefits to SNAP recipients cost approximately $75 billion in 2012. Largely uncontroversial for most of its history, the SNAP program was targeted for major cuts by members of the House of Representatives in the 2012 Farm Bill re-authorization attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nixon|first=Ron|title=House Republicans Pass Deep Cuts in Food Stamps|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/us/politics/house-passes-bill-cutting-40-billion-from-food-stamps.html|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   House leaders also endeavored to separate the SNAP program from the Farm Bill, splitting the long-standing coalition of urban and rural legislators who traditionally backed the renewals of funding for the Farm Bill every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nixon|first=Ron|title=Split Among House Republicans Over How Deeply to Cut May Delay Farm Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/us/politics/house-agriculture-committee-agrees-on-farm-bill.html/|accessdate=2013-11-15|newspaper=New York Times|date=7/12/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increases in the size of the SNAP caseload during the early 2000s were associated with increases in the unemployment rate and with a number of policy changes made to the program in many states.&lt;ref name="2010 SNAP Report"&gt;Mabli, J, Ferrerosa, C. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Caseload Trends and Changes in Measures of Unemployment, Labor Underutilization, and Program Policy from 2000 to 2008 Final Report. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., for USDA Food and Nutrition Service. October 18, 2010. http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/nutrition/SNAP_caseloads.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of six measures to better understand employment trends developed by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], three of which are more conservative estimates of unemployment and three of which define it more broadly, all showed correlations with SNAP participation. In particular, it was suggested that longer-term unemployment results in the heaviest utilization of SNAP benefits.&lt;ref name ="2010 SNAP Report" /&gt;

In addition to concerns about the cost of the program from fiscal conservatives, leaders in the movement to improve the nutritional content of the American diet suggested changes to the program to preclude the purchase of sugar-sweetened soft drinks or other forms of [[junk food]] with low nutritional value.&lt;ref name = "Slate article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Jane|title=SNAP Judgment: Many lawmakers think food stamps should be used only for healthy choices. Anti-hunger groups disagree. Here's why.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/08/food_stamp_choices_should_people_be_allowed_to_buy_junk_food_with_their.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In fact, the House of Representatives’ version of the initial Food Stamp Act of 1964 prohibited using food stamps for the purchase of soft drinks, but the provision was not adopted.&lt;ref name="SNAP history" /&gt;  Efforts to more narrowly define the food purchases by SNAP recipients were derided by anti-hunger organizations &lt;ref name="Slate article" /&gt;  as a form of [[paternalism]]. The 2008 Farm Bill re-authorization established the Healthy Incentives Pilot, a $20 million effort in five states to learn if offering select SNAP recipients credits on purchases of fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, salt, fat, or oil will result in increased purchases of these foods. Results of the pilot study were expected in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Incentive Pilot: Basic Facts|url=http://origin.www.fns.usda.gov/snap/HIP/qa-s.htm|publisher=USDA Food and Nutrition Service|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to advocacy work in Washington, D.C., on behalf of those in poverty, public awareness campaigns around the constraints faced by families receiving SNAP were launched. The [[food stamp challenge]] or SNAP challenge is one mechanism used by advocates such as [[Feeding America]]. Individuals are challenged to restrict food spending for a week to levels typical for families receiving SNAP benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taking the SNAP challenge|url=http://feedingamerica.org/get-involved/hunger-action-month/snap-challenge.aspx|publisher=Feeding America|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor and immigration====
Hired farmworkers are among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the United States.&lt;ref name="ERS Farm Labor Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Workers: Background|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-labor/background.aspx#.Uqx_Po2E7Fk|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Farm labor statistics are published twice yearly by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and are compared with similar data from the prior year. In April 2013, the number of workers hired by farm operators was 732,000. Field workers received an average pay of $10.92 per hour and livestock workers earned $11.46 hourly. Average hourly rates for field and livestock work have been on the rise since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Farm Labor report. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. April Hired Workers Down Over 2 Percent, Wage Rates Increase Over 4 Percent From Previous Year.|accessdate=11/15/2013|http://usda01.library.cornell.edu/usda/current/FarmLabo/FarmLabo-05-21-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Language barriers, fear of deportation, frequent re-locations, and lack of voting status have contributed to difficulties in organizing farm laborers to advocate for wage, benefit, and working condition reforms.&lt;ref name="Wilde" /&gt;

The agricultural industry's reliance on non-native workers has become part of the political debate over immigration policies and enforcement in the country. [[United States Department of Labor]] statistics from 2009 indicated that about 50 percent of hired crop workers were not legally authorized to work in the U.S., a figure that remained largely unchanged over the course of the prior decade.&lt;ref name="ERS Farm Labor Report" /&gt;  During that same time period, intense debate took place in the nation's capital regarding immigration policies and enforcement. Farm interests, concerned about access to a steady workforce, worked on Capitol Hill to secure their interests in the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]]. Provisions favored by the farm lobby included: "earned adjustments" that will allow for temporary legal immigration status based on past experience with the possibility of applying for permanent residency by continuing to work in agriculture for a set period of time; and a more flexible [[guest worker]] program for agricultural workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agricultural Labor - Immigration Reform|url=http://www.fb.org/issues/docs/aglabor13.pdf|work=Working paper|publisher=American Farm Bureau Federations|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to farm labor, workers in the nation's food service industry garnered attention in 2012 and 2013 with a series of strikes against fast food outlets demanding higher wages, better working conditions, and the right to form unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Steven|title=A Day's Strike Seeks to Raise Fast-Food Pay|newspaper=New York Times|date=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A study by the Labor Center at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in October 2013 demonstrated that 52 percent of families of fast-food workers receive public assistance, in comparison to 25 percent of the workforce as a whole. According to the study, full-time hours were not sufficient to compensate for low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Allegretto SA, Doussard M, Graham-Squire D, Jacobs K, Thompson D, and Thompson J.

==Security==
{{main|Food security}}
In the past, the denial of food deliveries has been used as a weapon in war. For example, during both world wars, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[naval]] blockade was intended to starve Germany into submission.

Food security is an important political issue as national leaders attempt to maintain control of sufficient food supplies for their nation. It can drive national policy, encourage the use of subsidies to stimulate farming, or even lead to conflict. This is mostly a national policy because nations have only recognized that there is a negative duty to not disrupt other nations food supply and  do not require that one help them attain such secure access by protecting them against other threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Poverty and Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|website=ohchr.org|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[World Food Summit]] defined food security as:

"There are three traditional routes to national food security: 1) domestic production, which contributes to self-sufficiency; 2) commercial food imports; and 3) international food aid".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/558539/CIRSSummaryReport6FoodSecurity2012.pdf?sequence=5|title=Food Security and Food Sovereignty in the Middle East|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, we need to make it clear that there is a distinction "between self-sufficiency and food security, in that the former is only one possible route to food security at the national level".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since 2007/2008, multiple [[Middle East]]ern and [[North Africa]]n ([[MENA]]) region governments have begun to consider more domestic food production as a part of their national aggregate food security laws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although from a political view that approach may be justified due to it helping in stabilizing domestic food prices and deducting vulnerability to international markets and reliance on other countries, it comes at an enormous economic cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This due to the resource endowments of the majority "of [[MENA]] countries—water scarcity and lack of arable land—are not well-suited to food production", specifically cereal production, and "these countries’ comparative international advantages lie in other economic activities".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of "the international organizations involved in the [[MENA]] economies during the 1990s and the 2000s advocated a food security strategy for most countries" that based on diversificating away from agriculture towards multiple other activities, "including manufacturing exports, with the resulting foreign exchange used to purchase food imports".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Within the agricultural sector there has also been emphasis on shifting resources into high- value crops that are most efficient in water use, such as fruits, vegetables, and tree crops", with a view on export markets, in replace of cereal production for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Hunger==
{{main|Hunger}}
Malnutrition and starvation continue to be a persistent problem in some areas of the world. The effects of low agricultural output can be exacerbated by internecine struggles, such as the famine conditions that occurred in [[Somalia]] during the 1990s. But even under more stable conditions, hunger persists in some nations. Images of starvation can have a powerful influence, leading to charitable and even military intervention.

==Retailing==
During the late 1990s and early 21st century a significant amount of discussion and debate has developed surrounding the role of [[supermarkets]] in the [[retail]]ing of food and the impacts of supermarkets both on the supply and production of food. Due to the buying power of the large supermarket chains, they can put huge demands on producers, often pushing prices artificially low, whilst still making large [[profit (economics)|profits]] on the food themselves, with some products selling at over 400% the price paid to, whilst farmers may only make 50p profit on each animal produced domestically. This buying power also allows supermarkets to transcend national boundaries in sourcing food. For example, in the UK, where the food market is highly dominated by supermarkets, only 25% of [[apples]] sold in supermarkets are produced domestically, with out-of-season [[Cox's Orange Pippin|Cox apples]] being flown 14,000 miles from [[New Zealand]], despite the UK being a natural producer of apples. Furthermore, due to the national nature of the [[supply networks]] used by supermarkets, this often involves domestically produced foodstuffs being transported around the country before being delivered to retailers, creating a huge impact both on [[traffic]] and [[pollution]].

'''Frank Eugene Corder''' (May 26, 1956 &amp;ndash; September 12, 1994) was an American truck driver. He stole a [[Cessna 150]] late on September 11, 1994 and crashed the stolen aircraft onto the [[South Lawn (White House)|South Lawn]] of the [[White House]] early on September 12, 1994, apparently trying to hit the building; he was killed, and was the sole casualty.

==Background==
Corder was born in [[Perry Point, Maryland]], the son of William Eugene Corder, who was an aircraft mechanic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/13/us/crash-at-the-white-house-the-pilot-friends-depict-loner-with-unraveling-life.html | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE: THE PILOT; Friends Depict Loner With Unraveling Life | date=September 13, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dorothy Corder. He dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Aberdeen, Maryland)|Aberdeen High School]] in the eleventh grade and enlisted in the [[U. S. Army|Army]] in October 1974. Corder was stationed at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]] and [[Fort Carson, Colorado]], where he was trained as a mechanic. He was [[honorably discharged]] from military service in July 1975 at the rank of [[private first class]]. After his service ended, he worked as a truck driver from 1976 until his employment was terminated in early 1993.

On April 15, 1993, Corder was arrested for theft and was arrested again later that year on October 9 for drug dealing. He was sentenced to spend 90 days at a drug rehabilitation center and was released in February 1994. After he was released, he was living with his third wife Lydia at Keyser's Motel in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]]. Lydia Corder left Frank three weeks prior to the incident, which is thought to have driven him towards deep [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[suicide]]. Friends claim he bore no ill will towards [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and probably only wanted the publicity of the stunt, based largely on his sentiments towards [[Mathias Rust]]'s flight of a [[Cessna 172]] from Finland to Moscow, USSR. The President was not even in the mansion at the time due to renovations, but was instead staying at [[Blair House]].

==Incident==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:008 frank corder cessna.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The crashed Cessna]] --&gt;
Corder stole the Cessna on the night of September 11 and departed from Aldino Airport in [[Maryland]] while severely intoxicated, which is presumed to have led to his later miscalculation. The plane was noticed by [[radar]] technicians at [[National Airport]] several minutes before he tried to steer it into the wall of the White House. At 1:49&amp;nbsp;a.m., he hit the South Lawn and died on impact.

The crash caused a re-evaluation in security procedures around the White House, as the pilot had entered [[restricted airspace]]. Though the White House is rumored to be equipped with [[surface-to-air missile]]s, none were fired.  The Secret Service has neither confirmed nor dispelled the rumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E1D6173BF930A2575AC0A962958260 |title=CRASH AT THE WHITE HOUSE: THE DEFENSES; Pilot's Exploit Rattles White House Officials - New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Stephen Labaton |date=September 13, 1994 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ghostlore]], a '''ghost train''' is a [[phantom vehicle]] in the form of a [[locomotive]] or train.

==Folklore==
*[[Silverpilen]] (Silver Arrow) is a [[Stockholm Metro]] train which features in several [[urban legend]]s alleging sightings of the train's "ghost".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bengt af Klintberg|af Klintberg, Bengt]], ''Råttan i pizzan.'' Stockholm: Norstedts Förlag, 1992. {{ISBN|91-1-893831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The St. Louis Ghost Train, better known as the [[St. Louis Light]], is visible at night along an old abandoned rail line in between [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] and [[St. Louis, Saskatchewan]]. Two local students won an award for investigating and eventually duplicating the phenomenon, which they determined to be caused by the [[diffraction]] of distant vehicle lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualsk.com/current_issue/mystery.html|title=Mystery Solved?|last=Yanko|first=Dave|work=Virtual Saskatchewan|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8555">{{Scotism}}
"'''Haecceity'''" ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|k|ˈ|s|iː|ɪ|t|i|,_|h|iː|k|-}}; from the [[Latin]] ''haecceitas'', which translates as "thisness") is a term from [[medieval philosophy|medieval]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]], first coined by followers of [[Duns Scotus]] to denote a concept that he seems to have originated: the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing. Haecceity is a person's or object's ''thisness'', the individualising difference between the concept "a man" and the concept "Socrates" (''i.e.'', a specific person).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:W. H. Gardner|Gardner, W. H.]], ''Gerald Manley Hopkins'' (1975), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology&lt;!--'To ti esti' redirects here--&gt;==
Haecceity is a literal translation of the equivalent term in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''''to ti esti'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (τὸ τί ἐστι)&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; or "the what (it) is."

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] later used the term as a non-descriptive reference to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Bertman, M. A., ''Humanities Insights'' (2007), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity and quiddity==
Haecceity may be defined in some dictionaries as simply the "essence" of a thing, or as a simple synonym for [[quiddity]] or [[hypokeimenon]]. However, such a definition deprives the term of its subtle distinctiveness and utility. Whereas haecceity refers to aspects of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing, quiddity refers to the universal qualities of a thing, its "whatness", or the aspects of a thing it may share with other things and by which it may form part of a [[genus]] of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hicks|Hicks, P.]], ''The Journey So Far'' (2003), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus makes the following distinction:

{{quote|Because there is among beings something indivisible into subjective parts—that is, such that it is formally incompatible for it to be divided into several parts each of which is it—the question is not what it is by which such a division is formally incompatible with it (because it is formally incompatible by incompatibility), but rather what it is by which, as by a proximate and intrinsic foundation, this incompatibility is in it. Therefore, the sense of the questions on this topic [viz. of individuation] is: What is it in [''e.g.''] this stone, by which as by a proximate foundation it is absolutely incompatible with the stone for it to be divided into several parts each of which is this stone, the kind of division that is proper to a universal whole as divided into its subjective parts?|Duns Scotus|''Ordinatio'' II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 2, n. 48]}}

While terms such as haecceity, quiddity, [[noumenon]] and hypokeimenon all evoke the [[essence]] of a thing, they each have subtle differences and refer to different aspects of the thing's essence.

Haecceity thus enabled Scotus to find a middle ground in the [[Problem of universals|debate over universals]] between [[Nominalism]] and Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity, sociology and philosophy==
The [[The Social Construction of Reality|social construction of reality]], [[ethnomethodology]], and [[conversation analysis]] are the main streams that elaborated during the 1960s a new kind of sociology—which influenced later sociology, philosophy, and political analysis. [[Harold Garfinkel]] is the founder of ethnomethodology, and teacher of Harvey Sacks, one of the founders of conversation analysis. He used the word haecceity in his seminal ''[[Studies in Ethnomethodology]]'' (1963), to enhance the indexical inevitable character of any expression, behavior or situation. According to him, the members display the social order they refer to within the settings of the situation they contribute to define. The study of particular situations in their "haecceity"&amp;nbsp;— aimed at disclosing the ordinary, ongoing social order that is constructed by the members and their practices&lt;ref&gt;Button, G., ed., ''Ethnomethodology and the Human Sciences'' (1991), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— is the object of ethnomethodology.

In his famous paper generally referred to as "Parson's Plenum" (1988), Garfinkel used the term "Haecceities" to indicate the importance of the infinite [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] in both situations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rawls | first = Ann | contribution = Harold Garfinkel | editor-last = Ritzer | editor-first = George | editor-link = George Ritzer | title = [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists|The Blackwell companion to major contemporary social theorists]] | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts Oxford | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781405105958  | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available as: {{Cite journal | last = Rawls | first = Ann | title = Chapter 5.

Garfinkel was drawing on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic and [[Bertrand Russell]], and perception theory and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Phenomenology is the field of studying the phenomena as such, and can thus be seen as a contemporary philosophical version of the medieval concept of haecceity.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses the term to denote entities that exist on the [[plane of immanence]]. The usage was likely chosen in line with his esoteric concept of difference and individuation, and critique of object-centered [[metaphysics]].

==Influence==
[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] drew on Scotus&amp;nbsp;— whom he described as “of reality the rarest-veined unraveller”&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus's Oxford'' quoted in Gardner, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to construct his poetic theory of [[inscape]].

[[James Joyce]] made similar use of the concept of haecceitas to develop his idea of the secular [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kearney|Kearney, R.]], ''Navigations'' (2007), pp. 133–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] refers extensively to haecceitas (as "thisness") in developing an argument about conspicuous detail in aesthetic [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartosch, R., ''EnvironMentality: Ecocriticism and the Event of Postcolonial Fiction'' ([[Amsterdam]] &amp; [[New York City|New York]]: [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2QjiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270 p. 270].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Hanson Kinney''' (born Hannah Hanson in 1805) was an [[United States|American]] seamstress who was charged with the [[murder]] of her third husband, George Kinney in 1840. [[Arsenic]], the alleged murder weapon, was found in Kinney's stomach during an [[autopsy]]. Though Kinney was acquitted, public records indicate that Kinney's second husband, Reverend Enoch W. Freeman, and Freeman's father, died of arsenic poisoning years earlier. Public consensus following Kinney's trial deemed her guilty, and she published an autobiography in 1841 to defend herself.

==Early life and marriage to Ward Witham==
Hannah Hanson was born in 1805 in [[Lisbon, Maine]]. At seventeen, she met Ward Witham, and they were married in January 1822, in [[Portland, Maine]]. After the first few months of their marriage, Hanson was accused by two neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Weymouth, of stealing their personal items. Witham defended his wife at the time, but later suspected her in the theft when he came to believe that she had been involved in an extra-marital [[affair]].&lt;ref name=Witham42&gt;{{cite book |title=Life of Mrs. H. Kinney, for Twenty Years |author=Ward Witham |authorlink= |year=1842 |publisher=District of Maine |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClMB_FkzCq4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=misconduct&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1822, Hanson and Witham moved out of the home they had shared with the Weymouth family. In July 1823, Kinney gave birth to her first child, a daughter. Witham came to suspect Kinney had been involved in an affair during the winter of 1824. In 1825, Hanson gave birth to her second child, a son. In the winter of 1825, Witham worked outside the home gathering lumber. He suspected his wife was involved in a second affair, this time with a young man.&lt;ref name=Witham42/&gt; Rozilla Moody, a ward of the Witham family, signed an [[affidavit]] in 1826 saying she had witnessed another man in the Witham household during the previous winter.&lt;ref name=Witham42/&gt;

In 1826, Witham moved Hanson and their two children from Portland to [[Dover, Maine]].&lt;ref name=Witham42/&gt; Witham moved to [[Boston]] on his own, and stayed there for two years.&lt;ref name=Kinney41&gt;{{cite book |title=A Review of the Principal Events of the Last Ten Years in the Life of Mrs. Hannah Kinney: Together with Some Comments upon the Late Trial, Written by Herself |author=Hannah Hanson Kinney |authorlink= |year=1841 |publisher=J.N.

In 1830, Witham and Hanson exchanged letters confirming that Kinney had no desire to live with her husband again.&lt;ref name=Kinney41/&gt; Later that year, Hanson moved to Boston without her children. In March 1832, Hanson and Witham [[divorce|legally divorced]] on the grounds of [[adultery]], and full [[child custody|custody]] of their children was awarded to Hanson.&lt;ref name=Kinney41/&gt; Records at the time of their divorce indicate they had four children in total.&lt;ref name=Cowley68&gt;{{cite book |title=An Illustrated History of Lowell |author=Charles Cowley |authorlink= |year=1868 |publisher=Lee &amp; Shepard |location=Lowell, MA |isbn= |page=111 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DukWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hannah+hanson+kinney&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vuoeVbu0M4qGsAXx8IGADQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hannah%20hanson%20kinney&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==

On August 30, 1840, Hanson was visiting friends in Thetford, Vermont when she was arrested for the murder of George Kinney and transported back to Boston.&lt;ref name=Crowley71/&gt; Hanson was held in prison for four months awaiting trial.{{cn|date=April 2018}} According to Hanson's autobiography, she lived in cell number 5 in the common jail.&lt;ref name=Kinney41/&gt; The cause of death on Kinney's autopsy read arsenic poisoning. During the investigation, Rev. Freeman's body was exhumed, and it was revealed on record that his stomach, too, had contained arsenic before his death.&lt;ref name=Myers11/&gt;

Hanson's trial began on December 21, 1840.&lt;ref name=Crowley71/&gt;&lt;ref name=TrialRecord/&gt; Hanson's defense attorneys, Franklin Dexter and George T. Curtis,&lt;ref name=Crowley71/&gt; argued that no proof had been found of Hanson purchasing and administering poison to Kinney.&lt;ref name=TrialRecord/&gt; The prosecution called a servant who worked in the Kinney household as a witness, and she reported seeing a piece of paper in the kitchen with "poison" written on it, but testimony was not concluded to be ample enough evidence to convict Hanson.&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt; During the trial, it was confirmed that Kinney had been treated for syphilis immediately before his death, and arsenic was a well-known medication prescribed to treat venereal disease at the time.&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt;

During the trial, eighteen witnesses were interrogated by the prosecution, including Dr. Martin Gay, a Boston physician who confirmed the presence of arsenic in the late Kinney's stomach, Thomas G. Bradford, a local shopkeeper who sold arsenic but couldn't identify Hanson as a customer, and Mrs. Aurelia Bingham, Hanson's seamstress apprentice.&lt;ref name=TrialRecord/&gt; The defense interrogated twenty two additional witnesses, including Earnest H. Cheetham and Thomas Ridley, Boston citizens who described the rumors about Hanson's guilt, Albert G. Leach, Hanson's brother-in-law and Mr. Coolidge, the local jailor who had once imprisoned the late Mr. Kinney for unpaid  debts.&lt;ref name=TrialRecord/&gt;

On December 25, 1840, Hannah Hanson Kinney was acquitted of the murder charge and released from prison.&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt; The jury took a total of three minutes to deliberate on a verdict.&lt;ref name=TrialRecord/&gt; She sold off her millinery shop to cover her late husband's gambling debts, which totaled $2,000. Once the debt was settled, Hanson was left with $89 in total. Hanson's brother-in-law, Albert Leach, who had visited her while in prison,&lt;ref name=Kinney41/&gt; mortgaged his horse and carriage to get Hanson and her three children back on their feet financially.&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt;

===Public opinion===
The public in Boston and Lowell continued to attribute Kinney and Freeman's deaths to Hanson despite the court declaring her not guilty, and rumors had even begun to attribute the death of Freeman's father to Hanson as well.&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt; Hanson's father-in-law, Mr. Freeman had died suddenly while Hanson and Freeman had been visiting him following their wedding.&lt;ref name=Spectator1840&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spectator |author=F.C.

Kinney, for Twenty Years'' in 1842. He accused her of adultery and slander, but publicize an opinion on the murder trial.&lt;ref name=Witham42/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jones09/&gt;

In 1868, ''The Republican,'' a Springfield, Massachusetts newspaper, mentioned Hannah Hanson as "Hannah Kinney, supposed to have poisoned the Rev Mr Freeman, her second husband, as well as Kinney, her third."&lt;ref name=Repub68&gt;{{cite news |title=A History Of Lowell |author= |work=The Springfield Republican |date=6 April 1868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spectator'' compared Hanson to other women who had infamously used poison or violence to murder men, including Madame LeFarge and Mrs. Cutts of England.&lt;ref name=Spectator1840/&gt;

In 1989, a publication on New England [[Genealogy|genealogical records]] argued that Hanson had attempted to convince the doctors conducting Kinney's autopsy to cite cholera as the cause of death.&lt;ref name=Philips89&gt;{{cite book |title=Genealogical records abstracted from the New England puritan, 1840-1841 |author=Margaret Philips |authorlink= |year=1989 |publisher=Heritage Books |location= |isbn= |page=19 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVIhAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=hannah+hanson+kinney&amp;dq=hannah+hanson+kinney&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vuoeVbu0M4qGsAXx8IGADQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK |accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Martin''' (born 1935) is a former [[British people|British]] doctor who was prosecuted for the murder of three patients in 2005 but acquitted. In June 2010, after being struck off the medical register by the General Medical Council for hastening the deaths of 18 patients, he admitted in a newspaper interview bringing forward the deaths of two patients, including his terminally ill son.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7839369/Murder-case-GP-Dr-Howard-Martin-I-helped-patients-die.html ''Murder case GP Dr Howard Martin: I helped patients die''], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Martin qualified in 1957 and went on to work as a doctor in the British army for 18 years before he became a [[general practitioner]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3021292/GP-hastened-patients-deaths.html ''GP 'hastened patients' deaths''], ''The Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; and worked in [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/4530842.stm ''Probe following GP murder trial''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; He now lives in [[Penmaenmawr]], [[Wales]]. In 2004 the police opened an investigation into his activities after relatives voiced concern regarding the manner of patients' deaths.

==Trial==
In 2005 Martin was prosecuted for the deaths of three patients: Harry Gittins, 74, Stanley Weldon, 74, and Frank Moss, 59, all from [[County Durham]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The trial lasted six weeks.&lt;ref name=DailyP&gt;[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2008/12/01/inquest-into-deaths-after-trial-cleared-north-wales-doc-55578-22374808/ ''Inquest into deaths after trial cleared North Wales doc''], ''Daily Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Weldon had his life shortened by "two hours" according to the prosecution when Martin gave him a terminal dose of painkillers.&lt;ref name=Tel2&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7919768/Howard-Martin-gives-a-tour-of-his-patients-houses.html ''Howard Martin gives a tour of his patients' houses''], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; Police put down the failure to convict to the fact that Martin chose to remain silent during the proceedings meaning cross-examination was impossible.&lt;ref name=Tel&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7919775/GP-Howard-Martin-accused-of-ending-the-lives-of-more-patients.html ''GP Howard Martin accused of ending the lives of more patients''], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 an inquest was also held into the death of William Kerr, 84. His remains had been [[exhumation|exhumed]] as part of the 2004 investigation into Martin. An [[open verdict]] was reached due to the advanced state of the body's [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=DailyP/&gt;

On 18 June 2010 a [[General Medical Council]] hearing struck Martin off the medical register for hastening the deaths of 18 patients in what the hearing described as "despicable and dangerous" conduct.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tel3&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7842498/Doctor-facing-police-investigation-admits-shortening-one-life-by-up-to-a-fortnight.html ''Doctor facing police investigation admits shortening one life by up to a fortnight''], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; Panel chairman Professor Brian Gomes da Costa also said that "Dr Martin's actions were indicative of an autocratic attitude, in that he seemed always to consider that he was right; and rejected, or did not seek, the views of others. He repeatedly broke the trust to which patients are entitled; this is unjustifiable."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/19/doctor-disqualified-deaths-morphine ''Doctor disqualified for hastening deaths with high morphine doses''], ''Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telegraph interviews==
In 2010 Martin gave a series of interviews to Britain's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper about his treatment of patients. In these interviews, he claimed there had been a prosecution "vendetta" against him&lt;ref name=Tel2/&gt; and that all he had done was try to ease the pain of his patients. He admitted shortening the life of some patients, often without their express permission, but denied committing murder. He also admitted helping his terminally ill son to die. The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] stated that it would look into his statements to see if a new prosecution was warranted.&lt;ref name=Tel3/&gt; Martin told the ''Daily Telegraph'', "They can come after me if they like. But I’m nearly 76 now and will be 77 or 78 by the time anything happens. I am an old man. Whatever they try to do to me, my conscience is still clear."&lt;ref name=Tel3/&gt;

In the interviews, Martin rejected any similarity to the case of [[Harold Shipman]], and listed the differences between them:

*"Shipman was a psychopath acting on his own needs [...] I believe I’m a normal, caring practitioner."
*"Dr Shipman used opiate drugs for himself. I am drugs free."
*"He killed for his own power and satisfaction and pleasure. I merely kept patients asleep when they were in dire circumstances."
*"Dr Shipman chose patients who were not terminal. I only treated patients who were imminently dying."
*"Dr Shipman got heroin illegally by fraud. I did everything above board and on prescription."
*"We have to buy the drugs privately and submit a bill to the Government. I want to lead my life righteously and truthfully."
*"Dr Shipman took material advantage from his dead patients. I never took any advantage."
*"Relatives were not present when he gave the injections. In my case the patient’s family were always informed and were usually present."
*"Dr Shipman didn’t discuss his management with the patients. I always did."
*"Dr Shipman chose which patients he would deal with. My patients always called for help in the normal fashion."
*"Dr Shipman’s motives were psychopathic. My motive was to secure lack of suffering and some dignity for patients by keeping them asleep."

In February 2011 the CPS decided not to prosecute Martin for the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8313708/Dr-Howard-Martin-wont-face-second-murder-trial.html ''Dr Howard Martin won't face second murder trial''], Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Martin has claimed that he is not an advocate of [[euthanasia]], instead being concerned with patients' dignity in death.&lt;ref name=Tel/&gt; He said in June 2010, "It’s not playing God to tend to people’s need with compassion and to let them have dignity."&lt;ref name=Tel3/&gt;

'''Iron Man''' ('''Antonio''' "'''Tony'''" '''Stark''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is the [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the fictional superhero [[Iron Man]] that first appeared in the fourth issue of ''[[Ultimate Marvel Team-Up]]'', written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Mike Allred]]. He later appeared in the [[Ultimates]] and often appears in the same titles they do. In the Ultimate Universe, the character is a wealthy business tycoon and inventor who created the Iron Man power armor. Like his mainstream counterpart, he has a drinking problem and life-threatening affliction; in this case an inoperable [[brain]] [[tumor]]. With a life expectancy anywhere between six months and five years, he chose to become a [[philanthropist]] and [[superhero]]. 

While the character hasn't yet been featured in his own ongoing series, Stark's early life and origins were initially explored in the ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' miniseries written by science fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]]. However, this origin story is no longer considered canon in the Ultimate Marvel Universe and was retconned as only being a fictional Japanese [[anime]] version.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Avengers VS New Ultimates'' issue 2&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the character's adult years have been covered mainly by [[Mark Millar]] (in his ''Ultimates'' work) and [[Warren Ellis]].

==Fictional character biography==
===''Ultimates''===
In the limited series ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', when Tony Stark first hears that [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] is assembling a team of superheroes, he volunteers his services. After helping defeat the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]], Stark develops a friendship with [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] and [[Ultimate Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. Though he has many great accomplishments, during the first volume of the Ultimates, he remains unsure of himself, clearly shown when he's heavily beat down and throws up in his own helmet. He acts arrogant, but also constantly doubts his own abilities. In the last issue he seems to decide that he can't continue fighting until a soldier asks, "If you don't do it, who will?". Later, he fights against the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] in ''[[Ultimate War]]'', captures the [[Rhino (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Rhino]] in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', and fights along with [[Spider-Man]] himself in the ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' storyline.

Stark also appears in ''[[Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk]]'', where he supports [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] being sent to kill Bruce Banner. Stark also criticizes the law being used to stop the Hulk, during which he mockingly suggests creating a Superhero Registration Law referencing the mainstream Stark's support of the Superhero Registration Act. The ''[[Ultimate Galactus trilogy]]'' also shows the first signs of an early friendship between Stark and [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] (despite the age difference), in addition to him successfully sneaking aboard a [[Kree]] spacecraft in ''Ultimate Secret'', and decapitated a [[Silver Surfer]] clone in ''Ultimate Extinction''.

===''The Ultimates 2''===
In ''[[The Ultimates 2]]'', Tony Stark quickly falls in love and proposes to [[Alternative versions of Black Widow#Ultimate Marvel|Natasha Romanova]]. Just prior to proposing, Stark gives her a black suit of armor, almost identical to his own. The flight test of the suit includes flying over her homeland, where Stark had paid the three million inhabitants of her hometown to stand in a field, spelling out his proposal, which she immediately accepts. When the Liberators invade America, Natasha shoots [[Edwin Jarvis]] and then tries to get Stark, at gunpoint, to transfer much of his fortune to her. However, Stark has ultimate control of the [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] in her bloodstream that allows her to interface with her armor. Using these nanites, Stark incapacitates Romanova and retrieves the enemy plans from her mind with the intention of fighting back against the Liberators. He takes "Iron Man 6", a massive [[helicarrier]]-sized ship armed with dozens of laser cannons and machine guns, and wipes out the air force of the Liberators in Washington, D.C. (as well as his opposite Liberator number [[Crimson Dynamo#Ultimate Marvel|Crimson Dynamo]]). He then heads to New York to aid the heroes there. After the battle Stark agrees to finance the now independent Ultimates, and seemingly very quickly gets over Natasha's betrayal with the help of a pretty blonde.

===''Ultimates 3'' and ''Ultimate Human''===
''[[Ultimate Power]]'' marks the first appearance of the independent Ultimates, fighting against an alternate universe [[Squadron Supreme]]. This soon follows with the start of ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' which sees Stark becoming a full-blown alcoholic. A [[sex tape]] that he made with Natasha during their time together also makes it into the public, causing a [[Public relations|PR]] nightmare for the rest of the Ultimates. In ''[[Ultimate Human]]'', which was published around the same time, the focus is on Bruce Banner as he pleads with Stark to cure him of his Hulk affliction just before ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'', which dealt with Magneto's attempt at complete destruction.

===''New Ultimates'' and ''Ultimate Armor Wars''===
After ''Ultimatum'', the ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' mini-series featured Iron Man racing across the world to find his stolen armor in order to save the remains of his enterprise. In ''[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]]'', he began a relationship with [[Carol Danvers#Ultimate Marvel|Carol Danvers]] and fought against the returning Loki. In the pages of ''[[Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man]]'', he was also involved with Captain America and Thor in training Spider-Man to become a better hero. During this time, his brother [[List of Marvel Comics characters: S#Gregory Stark|Gregory Stark]] became the new financial manager for the new [[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Avengers]] team in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'', which also featured [[War Machine#Ultimate Marvel|Rhodey]] (Tony's former best friend) and a new Black Widow.

===''Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates''===
In ''[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]'', Tony Stark is among the central characters and a leading member of the Ultimates. In "The Republic is Burning", he saves a now mortal Thor from the destruction of Asgard. With his [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] brethren exterminated by the Children of Tomorrow and Yggdrasil drained of the Odinforce, Thor is no longer a God and Stark takes it upon himself to help Thor resume his role as a God of Thunder. He reveals that he has been keeping Thor's harness and hammer (pieces of EUSS technology that gave him his powers in ''The Ultimates'' and ''The Ultimates 2'') and gives it back to the mortal Thor, with some modifications. Stark joins Nick Fury's latest Ultimates roster alongside Thor, Spider-Woman, Hawkeye, Black Widow and Falcon.

Following the reunification of the United States, Tony Stark builds a new red-white-and-blue version of his Iron Man armor and goes by the name "'''[[Iron Patriot]]'''". The armor is badly damaged in a confrontation with the Dead Hand Hydra terrorist group, and is later cut in half during repairs by Black Knight.

===''Ultimate Comics: X-Men''===
Following the establishment of the mutant nation of Utopia, Tony Stark is appointed as a liaison between Utopia and the United States by President Steve Rogers. Within Utopia, Stark assumes the role of business affairs and military consultant for the fledgling nation. With Kitty's help, he fakes an explosion in one of Utopia's greenhouses that seemingly destroys the 'super seed' developed by the mutants. Later he promises Kitty that once the attention has shifted away from Utopia, he will start releasing the seeds through back channels and have them freely distributed in accordance to Kitty's wishes.

===Return===
When [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] collaborated with [[High Evolutionary]] to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate in order to merge them into one reality, the Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 2'' Vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Earth-616's version of the Ultimates]] arrived on Counter-Earth to confront Maker about his actions, he ordered the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates concluded that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker killed the Earth-1610 Captain America for disobeying his orders. Upon Maker being defeated, both Ultimates helped Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, Ultimate Iron Man and the remaining members of the Earth-1610 Ultimates left to pursue Maker.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimates 2'' #100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Secret Wars (2015)===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a variation of Ultimate Iron Man resides on the [[Battleworld]] domain known as the Kingdom of Manhattan where he co-exists with a variation of his Earth-616 counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate End'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Film===
* In ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'', the identity of Iron Man (voiced by [[Marc Worden]]) is a [[composite character]] of both his Earth-616 and Ultimate incarnations where he has the appearance of the Ultimate Marvel version and the shrapnel problem of the Earth-616 version. 
* In ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'', one of Tony Stark's multiple [[Iron Man]] armors resembles Ultimate Iron Man's original suit.
* Ultimate Iron Man's character served as a big inspiration for Iron Man's concept in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsarama.com/comics/mark-millar-ultimate-universe-100603.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, both Iron Man's Mark VII armor in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and Mark XVII "Heartbreaker" armor in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' resemble Ultimate Iron Man's original armor.
* Iron Man uses a variation of his armor in ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' which resembles the armor used by Ultimate Iron Man. The film also borrows concepts from the comics like, Tony's mentor-mentee relationship with Peter which was established in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' unlike the comics, his mentor-mentee relationship evolves into a father-son relationship.

===Video games===
* Ultimate Iron Man's original armor is one of Iron Man's alternate costumes in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2 (video game)|Iron Man 2]]'' and ''[[Iron Man 3: The Official Game|Iron Man 3]]''.

'''''Jangnye''''' refers to [[Korea]]n funerary rites. ''Jangnye'' has been practiced since the book ''[[The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi]]'' (朱子家禮, ''Zhuzi jiali'') was introduced from [[China]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. Rulers during the era wanted to erase the [[Buddhist]] ceremonies of the previous dynasty, [[Goryeo]], and to replace them with the ceremonies of [[Confucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kfrc.info/ 한국문화장례원&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Chinese philosopher]], [[Zhu Xi]]'s book, ''The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi'' regulated domestic rituals such as weddings, births, funerals and memorial services. Even though it was accustomed with [[Chinese culture]], it wasn't so for the Joseon society. Yi Jae (李栽, 1680~1746) wrote ''[[Sarye pyeollam]]'' ("Easy Manual of the Four Rites") to supplement The Family Rituals of Zhu Xi. Domestic ceremonies, including ''jangnye'', were always performed according to this book.

==Procedures==
Generally, ''jangnye'' is performed for three days and nights. If a person is dead, the body will be laid in a coffin after two days and buried during the morning of the third day. Before laying the body in a coffin, a person dealing with the body cleans it and puts on the grave clothes made of hemp. In Korea, it is common for a person in their sixties to prepare grave clothes.

[[Condoler]]s pay a visit to a bereaved family; a chief mourner expresses his sorrow by ''Gok'', which is similar to crying.

Usually in the morning of the third day, the bereaved family head for their family burial mountain. They dig the ground, put the coffin in it, and build a mound over the grave. It comes to an end with ''[[jesa]]'', which is a Korean traditional memorial service. The ''jangnye'' ceremony is usually held as a burial instead of a cremation. It comes from the Confucian idea that one should not impair the ancestor's bodies but preserve them.

==Elements affecting ''jangnye''==
''Jangnye'' has evolved since its formation. It was a burial ceremony in the era of Three Kingdoms and has changed into a cremation influenced by Buddhism in Goryeo Dynasty. During the Joseon Dynasty, all rules, principles, and ideologies were affected by Confucianism. Since this era, typical Korean Jangrae procedure has been established as a burial. Since the 17th century, Catholicism and Christianity has been introduced in Korea and has influenced it. One Korean method for cremation is Jayeonjang (자연장), which is practiced by scattering the bone ashes on a garden, a tree, or the water.

'''Julius Ellsberry''' (August 22, 1921 – December 7, 1941) was an American killed during the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He was the first Alabamian killed in World War II, and one of the first Americans to die in the [[Pacific War|Pacific]] during [[World War II]]. He was killed while aboard .&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Richard E. (January 8, 2008) "[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4635 Julius Ellsberry]". The Historical Marker Database - accessed August 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ellsberry was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and was a 1938 graduate of [[Parker High School (Alabama)|Parker High School]].

==Military career==

Ellsberry enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in 1940, and was serving aboard the [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'' (BB-37)]] as a Mess Attendant First Class when it was bombed by [[Japan]]ese planes in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack]] on December 7, 1941. He and 413 other crewmen were killed aboard the battleship. He was awarded a posthumous [[Purple Heart]] in honor of his sacrifice.

A Navy press release followed shortly after the announcement of Ellsberry's death describing the heroism of another black seaman, then unidentified. Mess Attendant Second Class [[Doris Miller]] assumed control of a deck gun on the [[USS West Virginia (BB-48)]] after the gunner was killed and helped defend the ship. Media reports at the time often credited Ellsberry with Miller's heroism and the misidentification still sometimes persists.

==Legacy==

The ''[[Birmingham World]]'' labeled Ellsberry "the [[Crispus Attucks]] of World War II".&lt;ref name=Cronenberg&gt;Cronenberg, Allen (2003) "Forth to the Mighty Conflict: Alabama and World War II.'' Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8173-5027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham's Black community raised over $300,000 in war bond purchases toward the completion of a [[B-24 Liberator]] named ''The Spirit of Ellsberry''.&lt;ref name=Bodnar&gt;Bodnar, John E. (1996) ''Bonds of Affection: Americans Define Their Patriotism''. Princeton University Press. p. 208 {{ISBN|0-691-04396-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birmingham's Ellsberry Park near Finley Boulevard north of downtown was dedicated in his honor in 1979. A marker honoring Ellsberry's sacrifice has also been erected in [[Kelly Ingram Park]], which is named for fellow Navy veteran and Birmingham native [[Osmond Ingram|Osmond Kelly Ingram]], the first American killed in [[World War I]].

'''Larry Lee Hillblom''' (May 12, 1943 – May 21, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] businessman, and a co-founder of the shipping company [[DHL]] Worldwide Express.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Larry Hillblom was born on May 12, 1943, and raised in [[Kingsburg, California]].

During his youth, he went to the Concordia Lutheran Church and attended [[Kingsburg High School]].&lt;ref name="Scurlock 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scurlock |first1=James D. |title=King Larry: The Life and Ruins of an American Billionaire Genius |date=2012 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781416589228}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} He attended [[Reedley College]] and [[Fresno State]], eventually earning a law degree at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Boalt Hall School of Law]] and briefly clerked for [[San Francisco]] based attorney [[Melvin Belli]].&lt;ref name="Troy 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Troy |first=Stephen K. |title=Business Biographies: Shaken, Not Stirred ...

===Company history===
In December 1969, Matson Navigation Co. introduced new container ships (Hawaiian Enterprise Class) into its Hawaii cargo service. They were considerably faster than the older ships they replaced, and they saved several days off the crossing time from the US west coast to Hawaii. But with these faster vessels, the shipping documents could not be delivered by U.S. Postal Service to their Hawaii customers before the arrival of the goods.

Larry Hillblom approached Matson and told them that he could get their documents delivered in time. He did this by purchasing tickets for airline passengers who could take 350 pounds{{Citation needed |date=October 2016 |reason=sources required for much of the text, but in particular 350 lb needs sourcing}} of accompanied baggage, and sending the Matson shipping documents with them. Other Hawaii companies with time-sensitive documents learned about and started to use the service.

In 1969 Hillblom co-founded DHL; the company was later transformed into a general air courier, and Hillblom's wealth expanded to several [[billion]] [[dollar]]s. In the 1980s he moved to [[Saipan]], where he started several businesses and development projects in [[Hawaii]], Vietnam, and the Philippines.

===Life in Asia===
In Vietnam, he spent US$40 million to restore the [[Dalat Palace Hotel]] and its golf course. Other investments included the [[Novotel]] Dalat, Novotel Phan Thiet, Ocean Dunes Golf Course, and the Riverside Apartments outside Ho Chi Minh City. The investment was made via an overseas holding company to avoid an American [[embargo]] against Vietnam. The Dalat Palace Hotel opened in 1995 under Hillblom's and his Vietnamese partners' ownership with management personnel provided by Accor.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113626059742036204 |title=A Vietnamese Hotel Gets Second Chance In 'Capital of Love' |first=James |last=Hookway |date=January 3,  2006 |work=WSJ |accessdate=May 14, 2016 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disappearance===
Hillblom was an aircraft enthusiast and owned a number of vintage planes. His seaplane crashed on May 21, 1995, on a flight from [[Pagan Island]] to Saipan. The bodies of the pilot, Robert Long, and a business partner were found, but Hillblom's body was never recovered.&lt;ref name="SFWeekly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Matt |title=Ca$h for Genes |url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-05/news/ca-h-for-genes/2 |work=SF Weekly |publisher= Village Voice Media Holdings, LLC. |date=2000-04-05 |accessdate= 2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paternity controversy==
Hillblom's [[Will and testament|will]] stated that the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) would receive his estate, and did not specify any children in the 1982 will. There was no "disinheritance clause" in the will, which caused controversy.&lt;ref name="Fatherlode"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB95351356059127093 |title=Settled Paternity Suit Makes A Millionaire Out of Junior Hillblom, Despite Downside |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 20, 2000  |author=Robert Frank |accessdate= 2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Hillblom's estate was the subject of lawsuits from children fathered across the Pacific. According to Saipan law, illegitimate children born after a will has been drawn up are entitled to make a claim on the estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/20/news/mn-39088 |title=Asian Children Finally Get Part of $550-Million Estate|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 20, 1999 |author=MARY CURTIUS |accessdate= 2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and underage girls from several Asian and Pacific countries made claims that he had deflowered them by committing [[statutory rape]] on them and was the father of their illegitimate children. Kaylani Kinney, the first woman to come forward, claimed to have given birth to a child, Junior Larry Hillblom, fathered by Larry Hillblom. David J. Lujan (Guam), lead legal counsel and co-counsel Barry Israel (Santa Barbara, CA) for Ms. Kinney were responsible for filing the first claim on the Hillblom estate; several women throughout Asia later made similar claims. The law of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, where Hillblom was a resident, awarded children, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] or not, first right to inheritance, overriding any will. However, since Hillblom's body was not recovered in the crash, there was no [[DNA]] that could be used to determine paternity. Mysteriously, his house in Saipan was discovered to have been wiped clean. The sinks had been scrubbed with [[muriatic acid]], and toothbrushes, combs, hairbrushes and clothes were found buried in the backyard, making them useless for DNA testing.&lt;ref name="Fatherlode" /&gt;

Investigators discovered he had had a facial [[mole (skin marking)|mole]] removed at [[UCSF]] Medical Center, and it was still there; UCSF agreed to relinquish the mole (although its release could, of course, deprive UCSF of the estate if it could be used to prove Hillblom had sired children). It was later discovered that the mole was not from Hillblom.&lt;ref name="Fatherlode" /&gt;

Hillblom's mother, brother, and half-brother initially refused to submit their DNA, which could also have been used to determine paternity of the children. David Lujan and co-counsel Barry Israel then dispatched a team of investigators to compare the DNA of all the children suing for claim on Hillblom's estate. Lujan and Israel surmised that since the girls were located in different countries, if the children shared certain DNA markers, the only logical conclusion would be that they would almost certainly have the same father. In the end, a judge ordered Hillblom's brother and mother to submit to genetic testing. The tests confirmed that four of the eight claimants were Hillblom's children.&lt;ref name="SFWeekly"/&gt;

It was ultimately determined that a Vietnamese child, Lory Nguyen; Jellian Cuartero, 5, and Mercedita Feliciano, 4, of the Philippines; and Junior Larry Hillblom, of Palau were fathered by Hillblom. In the final settlement, each of the four children received a gross payment of US$90 million, reduced to about US$50 million after taxes and fees, while the remaining US$240 million went to the Hillblom Foundation, which followed Hillblom's wishes and donated funds to University of California for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Business Times, "The Week in Review", page 10, January 16, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A film by Alexis Spraic documenting the controversy that took place after Hillblom's death, titled ''Shadow Billionaire'' was first shown at the 2009 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Shadow_Billionaire.html Shadow Billionaire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127040834/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Shadow_Billionaire.html |date=2011-11-27 }}, ''Tribeca Film Festival'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |1212449 |Shadow Billionaire (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' ''' Les Dialogues d’Evhémère''' '' ('The Dialogues of [[Euhemerus]]') is a little-known philosophical dialogue by [[Voltaire]], published in 1777. At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"/&gt; the work is a kind of philosophical testament.  Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banderier |first1=Gilles |title=Voltaire en dialogues |journal=Acta fabula |date=May 2006 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url=http://www.fabula.org/acta/document1332.php |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
The imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a [[Stoic]], was a contemporary of [[Alexander the Great]], remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meurger |first1=Michel |title=Evhémère et les monstres. Croyances populaires et interprétation instruite |url=https://www.hommes-et-faits.com/lime/MMeurger_Monsters_.htm |website=Hommes et faits.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an [[Epicurean]]. His views, including [[atheism]], are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries [[Holbach]], [[La Mettrie]] and [[Diderot]].

In the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vermeer-Pardoen |first1=Hannie |title=Voltaire De dialogen van Euhemeros Het nut van de filosofie |date=2017 |publisher=Gennep B.V., Uitgeverij Van |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-9461648594 |url=https://cbonline.boekhuis.nl/pls/cover/p_get_cover_fe?p_hash=0030284E59D1F5E446B902E37A7BB78D |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

}}

There are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world -  what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an  appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Baar |first1=Marinus |title=Niets dan waanzin, ellende en misdaad |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/niets-dan-waanzin-ellende-en-misdaad~a275ddc5/ |website=trouw.nl |publisher=de Persgroep Nederland B.V. |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dialogues d'Evhémère - Voltaire (1779) |url=https://www.boekmeter.nl/book/38450 |website=Boekmeter.nl |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and the first edition==
Voltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37–40 are not in his hand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receuil factice d'ouvrages et fragments autographes de Voltaire |url=http://w3public.ville-ge.ch/bge/volage.nsf/Attachments/ms01frameset.htm/$file/ms01.pdf |website=w3public.ville-ge.ch|publisher=Bibliothèque de Genève, Institut et Musée Voltaire |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates.&lt;ref name="Cairn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paillard |first1=Christophe |title=La correspondance de Voltaire et l’édition de ses œuvres. problème de méthodologie éditoriale |journal=Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France |date=2012 |volume=112 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.3917/rhlf.124.0859 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire-litteraire-de-la-france-2012-4-page-859.htm |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]] does not mention it. The ''[[Mémoires secrets]]'' from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from [[Jean-Louis Wagnière]] indicated that the ''Dialogues'' had been published only shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oeuvres de Voltaire avec préfaces, avvertissement, notes ... par m. Beuchot: Mélanges. Tome 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1WHuzF7XrQC&amp;pg=PA146|year=1834|publisher=Lefèvre|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions.  He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Birkenstock |first1=Jane |title=Château de Cirey, Residence of Voltaire |url=http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire_bio.htm |website=www.visitvoltaire.com |publisher=Château de Cirey |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed.&lt;ref name="Collins2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Daniel Collins|title=Interpreting Modern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6788-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece of the first known edition of the ''Dialogues d'Evhémère'' indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the ''Mémoires secrets'' but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher.  In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in [[Lausanne]], by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher François Grasset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livre Dialogues d'Evhémère / par M. de Voltaire |url=https://explore.rero.ch/fr_CH/rero/result/L/VlRMU19SRVJPUjAwNDMzMzQ5NQ== |website=explore.rero.ch |publisher=Réseau des bibliothèques de Suisse occidentale |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chatelard |first1=Marie-Claire |title=François GRASSET (1722-1789) |url=http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/359-francois-grasset |website=dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr |publisher=IHRIM UMR &amp; ISH USR |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been one instance of multiple police deaths, when [[Stanley Graham]] gunned down four officers attempting to apprehend him in 1941, and four double fatalities. Most of the homicides have been a result of [[ballistic trauma|gunshot wounds]], the accidents mainly due to either drowning or vehicle (car/aircraft) accidents.

A slain officer may receive a police funeral, including an honour guard and flag-draped casket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzpaimages.co.nz/events.php?event_id=6255&amp;show_all=0&amp;page_no=0|title=Wellington-Funeral of Sergeant Derek Wootton|date=16 July 2008|publisher=NZPA Images|accessdate=2008-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724193847/http://www.nzpaimages.co.nz/events.php?event_id=6255&amp;show_all=0&amp;page_no=0|archive-date=24 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be officially mourned in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/mi-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/7/9/0/48HansD_20080722_00000001-Motions-New-Zealand-Police-Death-of-Sergeant.htm|title=Motions — New Zealand Police—Death of Sergeant Derek Wootton|date=22 July 2008|work=Hansard|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|volume=648 |page=17231|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/1/8/5/48HansD_20080911_00000012-Motions-New-Zealand-Police-Death-of-Sergeant.htm|title=Motions — New Zealand Police—Death of Sergeant Don Wilkinson|date=11 September 2008 |work=Hansard|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|volume=650 | page=18811|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four officers have received posthumous honours—Sergeant [[Stewart Guthrie]] received the highest Commonwealth civilian decoration, the [[George Cross]]. The Lou Grant Award, created in the memory of the police sergeant who died in the [[1993 Auckland mid-air collision|1993 Eagle helicopter mid-air collision]], is awarded every second year for excellence and contributions to [[search and rescue]].

The Memorial Wall at The Royal New Zealand Police College lists the names of fallen colleagues, whom the service commemorates annually on Police Remembrance Day. The Police Association together with the New Zealand Police introduced a Police Remembrance Day Pin in 2007, for officers to wear to honour the memory of those slain during the course of duty. The pin combines a [[Huia]] tail feather with a police chevron; the Huia bird was sacred in [[Māori culture]], wearing of its feathers restricted to people of high status.

In addition to the human officers, 24 [[police dog]]s have died in the line of duty;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10658538|title=Six-year-old Gage 23rd dog to die on duty|first=Jarrod|last=Booker|date=13 July 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the drowning of Enzo in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10486959|title=Man jailed for killing police dog |date=15 January 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gage, a six-year-old [[German Shepherd]], in 2010.

'''Maria Leopoldine of Austria-Tyrol''' (6 April 1632 &amp;ndash; 7 August 1649),&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.genealogy.euweb.cz/habsburg/habsburg4.html genealogy.euweb.cz Habsburg], retrieved 28 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; was by birth [[Archduchess of Austria]] and member of the Tyrolese branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] and by marriage  the second spouse of her first cousin, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III]]. As such, she was [[Empress of the Holy Roman Empire]], [[German Queen]] and [[List of Hungarian consorts|Queen consort of Hungary]] and [[List of Bohemian consorts|Bohemia]]. She died in childbirth.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===

Maria Leopoldine was born in [[Innsbruck]]&lt;ref name="Wurzbach52"&gt;Wurzbach 1861, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 April 1632 as the third (but second surviving) daughter and the fifth and youngest child of [[Leopold V, Archduke of Austria|Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria]], and [[Claudia de' Medici]]. She was born posthumously, because her father died two months before her birth, on 13 September 1632.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 1854, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; On her father's side, her grandparents were [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria|Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria]] and his wife Princess [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1551–1608)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]] and on her mother's side her grandparents were [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and his wife Princess [[Christina of Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl |last=Lundy |date=20 February 2010 |title=Maria Leopoldina Erzherzogin von Österreich |publisher=ThePeerage.Com |url=http://thepeerage.com/p11207.htm#i112062}} cites {{cite book |first=Jirí |last=Louda |first2=Michael |last2=MacLagan |title=Lines of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe |edition= 2nd |location=London, U.K. |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1999 |at=table 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her full-siblings, she had and older half-sister, [[Vittoria della Rovere]], born from her mother's first marriage with [[Federico Ubaldo della Rovere, Duke of Urbino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Darryl |last=Lundy |date=20 February 2010 |title=Claudia de Medici, Principessa di Toscana |publisher=ThePeerage.Com |url=http://thepeerage.com/p11206.htm#i112053}} cites {{cite book |first=Jirí |last=Louda |first2=Michael |last2=MacLagan |title=Lines of Succession: Heraldry of the Royal Families of Europe |edition= 2nd |location=London, U.K. |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1999 |at=table 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Leopoldine's oldest brother, [[Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria|Ferdinand Charles]], inherited [[Further Austria]], but Dowager Archduchess Claudia assumed [[regency]] because of her son's minority. In a letter written to his mother, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth of England]], on 8 September 1641, [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles Louis of the Palatinate]] (later Elector Palatine) described the intentions of his uncle, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]], and Maria Leopoldine's first cousin, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III]], to arrange a marriage between the 9-years-old Archduchess and himself; the marriage between them was to end "all grudges betweene our families".&lt;ref name="Akkerman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Akkerman|first=Nadine|title=The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=0199551081}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the union never took place.

=== Marriage and death ===

In [[Linz]] on 2 July 1648 Maria Leopoldine married the widowed Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III, thereby becoming empress of the Holy Roman Empire, Queen of the Germans, Queen of Hungary and Queen of Bohemia. The wedding ceremony was splendid;&lt;ref name="Barthold"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barthold|first=Friedrich Wilhelm|title=Geschichte des großen deutschen Krieges vom Tode Gustav Adolfs|publisher=Liesching|year=1843|isbn=1409421198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[Andreas Rauch]] celebrated the marriage as "anticipating (with the help of Divine Providence) the most beautiful end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]"&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weaver|first=Andrew H.|title=Sacred Music as Public Image for Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III: Representing the Counter-Reformation Monarch at the End of the Thirty Years' War|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2012|isbn=1409421198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an opera titled ''I Trifoni d'Amore'', produced by [[Giovanni Felice Sances]], was meant to commemorate the event, but the Prague premiere was canceled at the last moment when King [[Vladislaus IV of Poland]] (Ferdinand III's brother-in-law) died within two months of the wedding; the planned [[Pressburg]] performance apparently never took place.&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt; The new Empress was as closely related to her husband as her cousin and predecessor, [[Maria Anna of Spain]]; both marriages were means by which the [[House of Habsburg]], from time to time, reinforced itself.&lt;ref name="Wedgwood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Cicely Veronica|title=The thirty years war|publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]|year=1967|isbn=|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after her wedding, Maria Leopoldine became pregnant, and was [[Pregnancy in art|depicted as such]] in the 1649 painting by the Italian painter and poet [[Lorenzo Lippi]]. The Imperial couple's only child, [[Archduke Charles Joseph of Austria]], was born on 7 August 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 1854, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The childbirth was extremely difficult, ending in the death of the 17-year-old Empress.&lt;ref name="Coxe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coxe|first=William|authorlink=William Coxe (historian)|title=History of the House of Austria, from the Foundation of the Monarchy by Rhodolph of Hapsburgh, to the Death of Leopold the Second|publisher=|year=1807|isbn=|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband remarried within two years, while their son died childless aged 14.&lt;ref name="Wurzbach52"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habsburger.net/de/kapitel/ferdinand-iii-ehen-und-nachkommen Martin Mutschlechner: Ferdinand III - Ehen und Nachkommen in: habsburger.net] [retrieved 03 November 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried in tomb 21 in the [[Imperial Crypt, Vienna|Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]].

'''Martino Zaccaria''' was the [[Lordship of Chios|Lord of Chios]] from 1314 to 1329, ruler of several other [[Aegean islands]], and baron of [[Barony of Veligosti|Veligosti–Damala]] and [[Barony of Chalandritsa|Chalandritsa]] in the [[Principality of Achaea]]. He distinguished himself in the fight against [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish]] corsairs in the Aegean Sea, and received the title of "[[Monarch|King]] and [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of Asia Minor" from the titular [[Latin Emperor]], [[Philip I of Taranto|Philip II]]. He was deposed from his rule of Chios by a Byzantine expedition in 1329, and imprisoned in Constantinople until 1337. Martino then returned to Italy, where he was named the Genoese ambassador to the [[Holy See]]. In 1343 he was named commander of the [[Papal States|Papal]] squadron in the [[Smyrniote crusade]] against [[Umur Bey]], ruler of the [[Emirate of Aydin]], and participated in the storming of [[Smyrna]] in October 1344. He was killed, along with several other of the crusade's leaders, in a Turkish attack on 17 January 1345.

==Life==

===Lord of Chios and wars against the Turks===
Martino Zaccaria was a scion of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Zaccaria]] family. Through his father, [[Nicolino Zaccaria]], he was a nephew to [[Benedetto I Zaccaria]], lord of [[Chios]] and of [[Phocaea]] on the [[Anatolia]]n coast.{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=285, 287, 289}} Benedetto I had captured Chios from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1304, citing the island's vulnerability to Turkish raids. His occupation was acknowledged by the impotent Byzantine emperor, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], initially for a period of 10 years, but which was then renewed at five-year intervals.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=113}}{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=287–289}} Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in Chios by his son, [[Paleologo Zaccaria]]. When he died childless in 1314, the island passed to Martino and his brother, [[Benedetto II Zaccaria|Benedetto II]].{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=287–289}}{{sfn|Topping|1975|p=120}} Chios was a small but wealthy domain, with an annual income of 120,000 gold ''[[hyperpyron|hyperpyra]]''. Over the next few years, Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of [[Asia Minor]], including [[Samos]] and [[Kos]].{{sfn|Topping|1975|p=120}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=171–172}}

As lord of Chios, Martino and Benedetto fought with distinction against the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish]] pirates, who made their appearance in the Aegean in the early years of the 14th century. In 1304, the capture of [[Ephesus]] by the emirate of [[Menteshe]] had sparked the Genoese occupation of Chios, and raids against the Aegean islands intensified over the next years. The [[Emirate of Aydin]] soon emerged as the chief Turkish maritime emirate, especially under the leadership of [[Umur Bey]], while the Zaccaria, along with the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of [[Rhodes]], became the two main [[Latinokratia|Latin]] antagonists of the Turkish pirates.{{sfn|İnalcık|1993|pp=312–315}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=142–144}} The Zaccaria are reported to have maintained a thousand infantry, a hundred horsemen and a couple of [[galley]]s on constant alert.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=289}} In 1317, they lost the citadel of [[Smyrna]] on the Anatolian coast to the Aydinids, but continued to hold on to the lower city until 1329, when Umur Bey captured it.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=143}}  In 1319, however, Martino Zaccaria participated with seven ships in a Hospitaller fleet that scored a [[Battle of Chios (1319)|crushing victory]] over an Aydinid fleet from Ephesus.{{sfn|Luttrell|1975|p=288}} By the end of his rule on Chios, Martino is said to have taken captive or slain more than 10,000 Turks, and received an annual tribute in order not to attack them.{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=289–290, 291}} His constant efforts against the Turkish pirates earned him great praise by contemporary Latin writers, who wrote that if not for his vigilance, "neither man, nor woman, nor dog, nor cat, nor any live animal could have remained in any of the neighbouring islands".{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=289}} Martino also intervened to stop the slave trade carried out by the Genoese of [[Alexandria]], for which he was praised by [[Pope John XXII]]. In exchange, the Pope granted him the right to export [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]] to Egypt—an exemption to the papal ban on trade with the [[Mamluks of Egypt]]—and proposed that the Zaccaria be given command of the Latin fleets in the Aegean.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=289}}

Martino's prestige rose further when he also became one of the most important feudatories in the [[Principality of Achaea]]. Shortly after 1316, he bought the rights to the [[Barony of Chalandritsa]] from [[Aimon of Rans]], although in a document of 1324 it appears that he possessed only half of it, the other being held by [[Peter dalle Carceri]]. Martino added to his domains when he married [[Jacqueline de la Roche]], related to the [[De la Roche]] [[dukes of Athens]] and heiress of the [[Barony of Veligosti|Barony of Veligosti–Damala]].{{sfn|Topping|1975|p=120}}{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=195–196, 205, 235–236}}{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=290}} Martino's elevated standing was now recognized by [[Philip I of Taranto|Philip II]], titular [[Latin emperor of Constantinople]], who in 1325 named him "[[Monarch|King]] and [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of Asia Minor" and gave him as fiefs the islands of Chios, Samos, Kos, and [[Lesbos]]—which formed part of the Latin emperors' personal domain by the [[Treaty of Viterbo]]—as well as [[Ikaria]], [[Tenedos]], [[Oinousses]] and [[Marmara Island]]. This award was mostly symbolic, as except for the first three, which the Zaccaria already controlled, the others were in the hands of the Byzantines or the Turks. In exchange, Martino promised to aid with 500 horsemen in Philip's hoped-for, but never to be realized, expedition to recover [[Constantinople]] from the Byzantines.{{sfn|Topping|1975|p=120}}{{sfn|Nicol|1993|p=171}}{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=290}}

===Byzantine recovery of Chios===
[[File:Map of the Aegean Sea.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Map of the Aegean Sea]]
If these ties to the Latin Emperor provoked displeasure at the Byzantine court, for the time being relations remained good: the lease of Chios was renewed in 1324, and in 1327 Martino took part in alliance negotiations between the Byzantines and the [[Republic of Venice]].{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=290–291}} At the same time, however, Martino's behaviour became increasingly assertive: ca. 1325 he ousted his brother as co-ruler of Chios and began minting coins in his own name.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=291}}{{sfn|Trapp|Walther|Beyer|Sturm-Schnabl|1978|loc=6495. Zαχαρίας Μαρτῖνος}} In 1328, the rise of a new and energetic emperor, [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]], to the Byzantine throne, marked a turning-point in relations. One of the leading Chian nobles, [[Leo Kalothetos]], went to meet the new emperor and his chief minister, [[John Kantakouzenos]], to propose a reconquest of the island. Andronikos III readily agreed. On the pretext of Martino's unauthorized building of a new fortress on the island, the emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction, and to present himself in Constantinople in the next year in order to renew the island's lease. Martino haughtily rejected the demands and accelerated construction, but now his deposed brother Benedetto lodged a complaint with the emperor claiming the one-half share of the island's revenues that was his due. With these events as an excuse, in autumn 1329 Andronikos III assembled a fleet of 105 vessels—including the forces of the Latin [[Duke of Naxos]], [[Nicholas I Sanudo]]—and sailed to Chios.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=291}}

Even after the imperial fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions in exchange for the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession in the same way as his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of [[Galata]], from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.{{sfn|Nicol|1993|pp=171–172}}{{sfn|Miller|1921|pp=292–294}}

===Later life and the Smyrniote crusade===
Martino was released in 1337 at the intercession of the Pope and [[Philip VI of France]], and was offered a military command and some castles by the emperor as compensation.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=293}} He then returned to his hometown, Genoa, and was named the city's ambassador to the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Trapp|Walther|Beyer|Sturm-Schnabl|1978|loc=6495. Zαχαρίας Μαρτῖνος}} In September 1343, he was appointed to command the four papal galleys in the [[Smyrniote crusades|crusade]] against Umur Bey, under the overall command of the titular [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Henry of Asti]]. In view of Zaccaria's character, the Pope expressly warned Henry of Asti not to allow him to divert the crusade in a bid to recover Chios, and authorized Henry to replace Zaccaria if he deemed it necessary.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=293}}{{sfn|Setton|1976|pp=186, 191}} The crusade scored a swift and unexpected success: Umur Bey was caught off guard, and the crusaders recaptured the lower town of Smyrna on 28 October 1344. The citadel remained in Turkish hands, however, and the crusaders' position remained precarious. With Venetian aid, they fortified the lower town to enable them to resist Umur's counterattack. The emir bombarded the lower town with [[mangonel]]s, but the crusaders managed to sortie and destroy them, effectively breaking the siege. To celebrate this feat, Henry of Asti decided, against the advice of the other crusader leaders, to hold mass in the city's former cathedral, which lay in the no-man's-land between the citadel and the crusader-held lower town. The Turks attacked during the service, on 17 January 1345, and killed Zaccaria, Henry of Asti and other crusader leaders present.{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=293}}{{sfn|Setton|1976|pp=191–192}}

== Family ==
[[File:La Zecca di Scio p 19.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the Zaccaria family in [[Latin Greece]]]]
Martino Zaccaria married, probably some time before 1325, Jacqueline de la Roche.{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=236, 708}} An earlier conjecture of [[Karl Hopf]] about a first marriage to a daughter of [[George I Ghisi]], heir to the lordship of [[Tinos]] and [[Mykonos]], has since been discarded.{{sfn|Loenertz|1975|pp=107–108}}

From his marriage, Martino had two sons:
* [[Bartolommeo Zaccaria]] (died 1334). By right of his wife, he was [[Margrave of Bodonitsa]].{{sfn|Miller|1921|p=290}} 
* [[Centurione I Zaccaria]] (died 1382). As the sole surviving son, he inherited his father's fiefs in Morea in 1345. He founded the family's Moreote line, which eventually ascended to the princely title of Achaea under [[Maria II Zaccaria]] and [[Centurione II Zaccaria]].{{sfn|Bon|1969|pp=241, 708}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1861">The '''multi-surface method''' (MSM) is a form of decision making using the concept of piecewise-linear separability of datasets to categorize data.

==Introduction==
Two datasets are linearly separable if their [[convex hull]]s do not intersect. The method may be formulated as a [[feedforward neural network]] with weights that are trained via [[linear programming]]. Comparisons between neural networks trained with the MSM versus [[backpropagation]] show MSM is better able to classify data.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://homepages.rpi.edu/~bennek/papers/NeuralNetworkTraining.pdf Neural Network Training via Linear Programing]'', Advances in Optimization and Parallel Computing, 1992, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The decision problem associated linear program for the MSM is [[NP-Complete]].

== Mathematical Formulation ==
Given two finite disjoint point sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A,B} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, find a discriminant, &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n \to  \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\mathcal{A}) &gt; 0, f(\mathcal{B}) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;. If the intersection of convex hulls of the two sets is the empty set, then it is possible to use a single linear program to obtain a linear discriminant of the form, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=cx+\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Usually, in real applications, the sets' convex hulls do intersect, and a (often non-convex) piecewise-linear discriminant can be used, through the use of several linear programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Pattern Recognition via Linear Programming: Theory and Application to Medical Diagnosis", O. L. Mangasarian, R Setiono, and W. H. Wolberg, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zakariya ibn Muhammad Qazwini - The Angels Munkir and Nakir - Walters W65951B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|This illustration from Walters manuscript W.659 depicts the angels Munkir and Nakir, who are charged with questioning the deceased people.]]

{{Eschatology}}

'''Munkar and Nakir''' ({{lang-ar|منكر ونكير}}) (English translation: "The Denied and The Denier") in [[Islamic eschatology]], are [[Islamic view of angels|angels]] who test the faith of the dead in their graves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.britannica.com/ebc/article-9054288 Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, Entry: Munkar and Nakir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
These angels are described as having solid black eyes, having a shoulder span measured in miles, and carrying hammers "so large, that if all of mankind tried at once to move them a single inch, they would fail". When they speak, tongues of fire come from their mouths. If one answers their questions incorrectly, one is beaten every day, other than Friday, until God gives permission for the beating to stop. (Source?)

==Questioning in the grave==
Muslims believe that after [[Islamic view of death|a person dies]], his soul passes through a stage called [[barzakh]], where it exists in the grave (even if the person's body was destroyed, the soul will still rest in the earth near their place of death).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.edu.pk/marfulhadith/lifeafterdeath.htm "Life after death" at www.al-islam.edu.pk]&lt;/ref&gt; The questioning will begin when the funeral and burial is over. Nakir and Munkar prop the deceased soul upright in the grave and ask three questions: "Who is your God? What is your religion? What is your faith about this person (Muhammad)?". A righteous believer will respond correctly, saying that their Lord is [[Allah in Islam|God]], that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] is their prophet and that their religion is [[Islam]]. If the deceased answers correctly, the time spent awaiting the resurrection is pleasant and may enter heaven. Those who do not answer as described above are chastised until the day of judgment in hell.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-0-521-50637-3}} Seite 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathreference.com/Ho-Ka/Islam.html The Encyclopedia of Death and Dying, Entry: Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that a person will correctly answer the questions not by remembering the answers before death (compare with the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]]) but by their [[iman (concept)|iman]] and deeds such as [[salat]] and [[shahadah]] (the Islamic profession of faith).

==History and Origins==
Munkar and Nakir bear some similarity to Zoroastrian divinities. Some of these, such as [[Mithra]], [[Sraosha]] and [[Rashnu]] have a role in the judgement of souls. [[Rashnu]] is described as a figure who holds a set of scales, like some angels of the grave. E.G. Brown has suggested that a continuity exists between Rashnu and Munkar and Nakir.&lt;ref&gt;E.G. Brown, ''A year amongst the Persians; impressions as to the life, character, and thought of the people of Persia, received during twelve month's residence in that country in the years 1887-8'', London, 1893, p. 378 https://archive.org/details/yearamongstpersi00browuoft&lt;/ref&gt; 
A mythical figure in [[Mandaean]] religion, [[Abathur]] Muzania is similar to Rashnu. He holds the same position in the world of the dead, and also holds a set of scales. ''Muzania'' means scales ([[mizan]]) in Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;E.S. Drower, ''The Mandaeans of the Iraq and Iran'', Oxford 1937 https://archive.org/details/TheMandaeansOfIraqAndIran&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent research, Munkar and Nakir are originally astrological figures and a transformation of the Mesopotamian astral god Nergal.&lt;ref&gt;for more information, see Gürdal Aksoy, ''On the Astrological Background and the Cultural Origins of An Islamic Belief: The Strange Adventures of Munkar and Nakir from the Mesopotamian god Nergal to the Zoroastrian Divinities'', https://www.academia.edu/35372440/On_the_Astrological_Background_and_the_Cultural_Origins_of_An_Islamic_Belief_The_Strange_Adventures_of_Munkar_and_Nakir_from_the_Mesopotamian_god_Nergal_to_the_Zoroastrian_Divinities_Mezopotamyal%C4%B1_Tanr%C4%B1_Nergal_den_Zerd%C3%BC%C5%9Fti_Kutsiyetlere_M%C3%BCnker_ile_Nekir_in_Garip_Maceralar%C4%B1_&lt;/ref&gt; 
Aksoy shows in his new research that the Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]] has almost the same characteristics as Munkar and Nakir. He begins with ''Nakru'' which is an epithet of Nergal and means 'enemy'. The Assyrian ''nakru'', like the names Munkar and Nakir, comes from the same root, from the proto-Semitic NKR. Some scholars use a different spelling; ''nakuru''.&lt;ref&gt;for ''nakuru'' see C.J. Snijders, ''Beginselen der Astrologie'', Amsterdam, 1949, p. 153 https://archive.org/details/beginselenderast00snij&lt;/ref&gt; which is almost the same as Nakir. Moreover, Nergal is a lord of the Underworld and the grave (Assyrian ''qabru'': grave). Like Munkar and Nakir, he has a terrifying voice that can cause panic among men and gods. He holds a shining mace and his breath can burn his enemies. Because he is related to fire most scholars suggest that he was originally a sun god. Furthermore, he is identified with the celestial twins (''Gemini'') in the Babylonian astral mythology which forms a direct link to Munkar and Nakir.&lt;ref&gt;for more information, see Aksoy, ''On the Astrological Background and the Cultural Origins of An Islamic Belie: The Strange Adventures of Munkar and Nakir from the Mesopotamian god Nergal to the Zoroastrian Divinities''&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no reference to Munkar and Nakir in the Quran. Their names are first mentioned by Tirmidhi in the hadith tradition. Tirmidhi is known to have visited Iraq. This suggests that the names of Munkar and Nakir are introduced to Islamic beliefs during an early stage in the Islamization of Mesopotamia (or Iraq). The Mesopotamians still believed in the sun god [[Shamash]], as well as [[Nergal]] and several other Babylonian gods at the time Islam was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Al-Khamis, "The Iconography of Early Islamic Lusterware from Mesopotamia: New Considerations", ''Muqarnas'', Vol. 7, 1990, pp.109-118, https://www.academia.edu/1383806/The_Iconography_of_Early_Islamic_Lusterware_from_Mesopotamia_New_Considerations&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Nergal]] the god of the Underworld who is symbolized by the planet Mars, is a possible prototype for Munkar and Nakir. Astrologically, Munkar and Nakir share more clues in their Martian characteristics which connect them to Nergal.&lt;ref&gt;for more detailles, see Aksoy, ''On the Astrological Background and the Cultural Origins of An Islamic Belief: The Strange Adventures of Munkar and Nakir from the Mesopotamian god Nergal to the Zoroastrian Divinities''&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Byrne and John Morley, two officers of the [[Garda Síochána]], the police force of Ireland, were murdered on 7 July 1980 by alleged members of the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) during a pursuit in the aftermath of a bank robbery near [[Loughglynn]], [[County Roscommon]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} The officers' deaths provoked national outrage. Three men were apprehended, convicted and sentenced to death for capital murder. Two of the sentences were later reduced to 40 years imprisonment while the third was overturned.

==Bank robbery==
On 7 July 1980 three armed and masked men raided the [[Bank of Ireland]] in [[Ballaghaderreen]], County Roscommon. The group held staff and customers at gunpoint before leaving with [[Irish pound|IR£]]35,000. The [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] (Irish police) arrived on the scene but were unarmed and were unable to stop the armed men from escaping in a blue [[Ford Cortina]].&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/gardaarlar/prog3.html |title=Garda Ar Lár: Programme 3: Garda John Francis Morley and Garda Henry Gerard Byrne |publisher=RTÉ |year=2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators were intercepted by a Garda patrol car from [[Castlerea]] station with four Gardaí, including Detective John Morley, who was armed with an [[Uzi]] submachine gun. The two cars collided at Shannon's Cross, Aghaderry, [[Loughglinn]]. One of the raiders jumped out of the Cortina and sprayed the patrol car with bullets, killing Garda Henry Byrne.

One man left the Cortina and ran off while his two accomplices – wearing balaclavas – ran in the opposite direction. There was an exchange of shots in which Morley is believed to have wounded one of the men, but he himself was fatally wounded. Both of these men were later apprehended, while a third man - Peter Pringle- was arrested in the city of [[Galway (city)|Galway]] almost two weeks later. The two other Gardaí - Sergeant Mick O'Malley and Garda Derek O'Kelly - survived the shootout.

==Garda Síochána officers==
John Francis Morley, born 1942 in [[Knock, County Mayo]], was a [[Garda Síochána]] detective. Morley was married with two sons, Shane and Gordon and a daughter, Gillian. Morley had also been a noted [[Gaelic Football]]er and was considered one of the best centre backs in the history of [[Connacht]] football. He played 112 league and championship games for [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] between 1961–1974.&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eamonn |last=Sweeney |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/overcoming-lifes-cruel-breaks-127676.html |title=Overcoming life's cruel breaks |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date=12 March 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2005/03/23/story24327.asp |title=Archives |publisher=Archives |date= |accessdate=13 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819052031/http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2005/03/23/story24327.asp |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Byrne, born 1950 in [[Knock, County Mayo]], was an officer in the Gardaí. Byrne was married with two children and his wife was pregnant with a third at the time of his death.

== Aftermath ==
The event drew considerable national media commentary in Ireland.&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Seamus |last=Duke |url=http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/pdf/RSP_2103_Ed1_052.pdf |title=A famous victory at the end of a tragic week |work=The Classics...Revisited |publisher=[[Roscommon People]] |page=52 |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218201756/http://www.roscommonpeople.ie/pdf/RSP_2103_Ed1_052.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrne and Morley were the fifth and sixth Gardaí officers to die in [[the Troubles]], and the 21st and 22nd Gardaí to die violently since the foundation of the state in 1922.

Morley and Byrne were [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Scott Medal]] for their actions. The medals were presented to their families at a special ceremony in [[Garda Síochána College|Templemore]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aoife |last=Finneran |url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/comment/bravery-honour-and-tragedy-of-a-career-spent-in-line-of-fire-1451775.html |title=Bravery, honour and tragedy of a career spent in line of fire |publisher=[[Evening Herald]] |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three men apprehended were Peter Pringle, Patrick McCann, and Colm O'Shea.&lt;ref name="hot press"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/5232622.html?page_no=1&amp;show_comments=1 |title=Once in never out |date=3 February 2009 |first=Jason |last=O'Toole |publisher=[[Hot Press]] |accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a portion of funding for the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA), a [[Irish Republican|Republican]] paramilitary organisation, came from bank robberies, the three robbery suspects were identified as being associated with the INLA. This claim was disputed by advocates for the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]], the INLA's political wing, who stated that only one of the men (Pringle) had had a peripheral connection with the Irish Republican organisation some years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Brian &amp; Frank Farrell, [http://www.irsm.org/history/starryplough/dublin_journalists.html "Dublin Journalists Co-Operate with Garda Black Propaganda], ''The Starry Plough'', March 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

All three men were found guilty of murder and sentenced to [[death sentence|death]] by hanging. Two weeks before their execution dates in June 1981, their sentences were commuted to 40 years imprisonment with no chance of parole.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/22/former-death-row-couple|title=Former death row couple: 'Life turned out beautifully'|last=Qureshi|first=Huma|date=June 22, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pringle always denied any involvement in the crime and his conviction was overturned by the high court in 1995 due to discrepancies in the evidence.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; In September 2012, Colm O'Shea was one of the Ireland's longest-serving prisoners, but he failed in an appeal to the High Court for remission of his sentence which determined O'Shea could was not entitled to the standard 30-year remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2012/0906/world/garda-killeraposs-bid-to-overturn-40-year-term-fails-206598.html | title=Garda killer’s bid to overturn 40-year term fails | date=September 6, 2010 | first=Aodhan | last=O’Faolain | newspaper=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2013, the Irish [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] ruled that a prisoner serving 40 years for capital murder was entitled to the normal remission on his sentence if he met the conditions applied to other inmates. As a result, the prison authorities found that both O'Shea and McCann had already served the required 30-year term in jail and they were consequently released from in [[Portlaoise Prison]].&lt;ref name="hot press"/&gt;  The details of their releases were not published in the national press until October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/two-garda-killers-who-faced-death-penalty-have-been-freed-from-prison-29657572.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Two garda killers who faced death penalty have been freed from prison | date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phillip O'Donnell''' (25 March 1972 – 29 December 2007) was a Scottish [[Association football|footballer]], who played as a  left-sided [[midfielder]] for [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] during his career. He also earned one [[cap (sport)|international cap]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], and twice won the [[Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year]] award. He died after suffering cardiac arrest while playing for Motherwell against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 29 December 2007, aged 35. 

==Career==

===Motherwell===
O'Donnell was born on 25 March 1972 in [[Bellshill]], [[North Lanarkshire]], a few miles away from Motherwell's [[Fir Park]] ground.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/7165237.stm |title=Phil O'Donnell: 1972–2007 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell began his career with his local team, making his first team debut in the [[1990–91 in Scottish football|1990–91 season]] against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]], and soon a regular first team player. He won a [[Scottish Cup]] winner's medal after scoring with a diving header to put Motherwell 2-1 up in a [[Scottish Cup 1990-91#Final|4–3]] victory over [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the final that year. [[Ally McCoist]] commentating on the match describing him as being ''"brave as a lion"''.&lt;ref name=McLeod&gt;McLeod, Keith. [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2007/12/31/grief-of-family-fans-and-stars-for-phil-o-donnell-86908-20270583/ Grief Of Family, Fans And Stars For Phil O'Donnell], The Daily Record (31 December 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That result earned Motherwell entry to European competition for the first time and O'Donnell became the club's youngest player in Europe, playing a tie against Polish side [[GKS Katowice]].&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;Martin Hannan, [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sport/A-model-professional-a-great.3628396.jp A model professional, a great club ambassador], ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 30 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year Award in 1992 and 1994, and he earned one cap for the [[Scotland national football team]], playing for 15 minutes as a substitute against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 8 September 1993, replacing [[David Bowman (footballer born 1964)|David Bowman]].&lt;ref name="SFA"&gt;[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/match_details.cfm?matchid=57953/ Scottish National Teams – Match Details], ''[[Scottish Football Association|SFA]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This form made him a target for bigger clubs and he signed for Celtic in September 1994. The fee of £1.75m is the highest Motherwell have received for a player.&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;

===Celtic===
O'Donnell scored two goals in his debut for Celtic against [[Partick Thistle FC|Partick Thistle]], and went on to win another [[Scottish Cup 1994-95#Final|Scottish Cup in 1995]]. He also earned his sole league winner's medal with the club in 1998, but injuries proved to be a major concern and his appearances for the club were limited. In 1999 O'Donnell was among a number of players who failed to agree terms on a new contract with Celtic chairman [[Fergus McCann]], and instead moved on.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
After leaving Celtic as a free agent,&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Alan |last1=Campbell |first2=Michael |last2=Grant |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18983466.html |title=Celtic set to lose out on Phil |work=[[Sunday Herald]] |publisher= |date=14 February 1999 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell signed for Sheffield Wednesday later that year. He made his debut against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 11 September 1999, but injuries continued to curtail his career and he played just one match during [[1999-2000 in English football|his first season]] (when the club were relegated from the [[Premier League]]). He went on to play just 20 times in four years for [[Sheffield Wednesday]] (scoring once in a League Cup quarter final tie against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/worthington_cup/1717972.stm|title=Owls stun Watford
|publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 December 2001 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]] at the time of their relegation to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in 2003.

===Return to Motherwell===
O'Donnell returned to Scotland where former club Motherwell offered him the chance to train with them again. The Fir Park outfit re-signed him in January 2004, allowing him the chance to appear alongside his nephew, [[David Clarkson]] and earning him the club nickname, "Uncle Phil".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He was also the uncle of [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] midfielder [[Stephen O'Donnell (footballer born 1983)|Stephen O'Donnell]] and [[Brian Dempsie]] who had also played for Motherwell. In his second spell at Motherwell he appeared in another cup final, this time being on the losing side as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] won the 2005 [[Scottish League Cup]] 5–1. The following season he replaced [[Scott Leitch]] as club [[Captain (association football)|captain]].

==Death==
{{Wikinews|Scottish footballer Phil O'Donnell collapses during game and dies}}
On 29 December 2007, O'Donnell collapsed during a game against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] just as he was about to be substituted. He was treated on the pitch for about five minutes by the Motherwell and Dundee United club doctors before being taken by ambulance to [[Wishaw General Hospital]]. However, he was pronounced dead at 17:18 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Motherwell captain O'Donnell dies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/7164150.stm |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-29 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 35 years of age.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

A [[autopsy|postmortem]] examination was carried out on 1 January 2008 and it was revealed O'Donnell died of [[Left ventricle|left ventricular]] failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7166784.stm |title=Footballer died of heart failure |publisher=BBC News |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was on 4 January, at [http://www.rcdom.org.uk/parishes_stmarys_hamilton.htm St Mary's Church] in [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He was survived by his wife Eileen, and their daughters Megan and Olivia and sons Christopher and Luc, aged twelve, six, ten and four years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2008/01/02/phil-o-donnell-killed-by-heart-failure-86908-20272207/|title=Phil O'Donnell Killed By Heart Failure|author=Keith McLeod|date=2 January 2008|work=dailyrecord}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==

[[File:Phil O'Donnell Stand - geograph.org.uk - 3004357.jpg|thumb|right|The stainless-steel permanent memorial to O'Donnell, erected on November 2011.]]
Former [[First Minister of Scotland|Scottish First Minister]] [[Jack McConnell]], [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for Motherwell and Wishaw, was among those to pay tribute. He hailed the midfielder as a "great professional."

Motherwell and other fans laid flowers, scarves, strips and other mementos at the gates of Fir Park.&lt;ref name=McLeod /&gt; The club's scheduled SPL game against Hibs at [[Easter Road]] the following Wednesday was postponed along with the club's home game with Celtic the following Sunday out of respect. Scottish Premier League chairman [[Lex Gold]] said: "We understand from Phil's family that they would appreciate it if the Motherwell v Celtic game scheduled for 6 January 2008 could be postponed. Both clubs are happy to meet the request and we have called the game off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/7164972.stm |title=Motherwell postpone Celtic match |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December the SPL postponed the [[Old Firm|Celtic v Rangers fixture]] scheduled for 2 January 2008, following a request by O'Donnell's former club Celtic, which was agreed by Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/7165976.stm |title=Old Firm match postponed by SPL |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2007-12-31 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These postponements contributed to fixture congestion at the end of the 2007&amp;ndash;08 season, which required the [[2007&amp;ndash;08 Scottish Premier League]] season to be extended when Rangers reached the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/25/rangers.celtic |title=Celtic's 'sporting integrity' is giving Rangers a fixture headache |work=The Guardian |first=Ewan |last=Murray |publisher= |date=25 April 2008 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players on 30 December in [[Premier League]] matches between [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Blackburn Rovers]], and [[Manchester City]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], wore black bands in his honour. Sheffield Wednesday's matches at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and at home to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] were preceded by a minute's applause as a mark of respect to their former player, with the [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] flags flying at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/default.sps?pagegid=%7BDBD12D53-8346-431D-A04F-5D0F8664DE80%7D&amp;newsid=519221 |title=Manchester City v Liverpool |publisher=Manchester City FC |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Premier League matches in the New Year programme were preceded with either a minute of applause or silence in O'Donnell's memory. While playing for Everton, [[James McFadden]], a former Motherwell player, dedicated his goal to O'Donnell in Everton's 2–0 win at Middlesbrough by pointing solemnly to his black armband and then towards the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caulkin |first=George |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3118818.ece |title=James McFadden tears bring sense of perspective to Everton’s ascent |work=The Times |publisher= |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nottingham Forest]] opted not to show their respects before their [[Football League One]] match with [[Huddersfield Town]] on New Year's Day. Forest manager [[Colin Calderwood]], himself a former Scottish international with 36 caps, explained: "I didn't particularly want a tribute. Sometimes I don't think it's appropriate to have them for every tragedy that happens. The fact that it was a boy in Scotland, does that make it any different to a boy in Colombia?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=Gail |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article636399.ece |title=It's Cald Hearted |work=The Sun |date=2 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calderwood later apologised for any offence caused by the comments, after he had been appointed manager of SPL club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/9181186.stm | work= |publisher=BBC Sport | first=Brian | last=McLauchlin | title=Calderwood apology over O'Donnell | date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of tributes from around the world were posted on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferguson |first=John |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2007/12/31/o-donnell-tributes-from-fans-around-world-86908-20270670/ |title=O'Donnell Tributes From Fans Around World |work=Daily Record |publisher= |date=31 December 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club received hundreds of written tributes from fans as far as Korea and Ukraine, as well as many emotional messages from [[Sevilla FC]], comparing O'Donnell's death to the similar fate of their player [[Antonio Puerta]] that August. Sevilla director of football [[Monchi]] said, "This is terrible news. Right now, my thoughts are with Phil's family and everybody at Motherwell. Unfortunately, with the death of Phil O'Donnell, Motherwell have suffered a similar tragedy to ours. Antonio Puerta died at the beginning of the season and I know how terrible the whole experience is. Sevilla will be available to help in any way that we are able, to heal the pain and sadness of this tragic loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halliday |first=Stephen |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Motherwell-players-offered-counselling-to.3631484.jp |title=Motherwell players offered counselling to deal with tragedy |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Gareth |url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Scots-football-star-dies-in.3628391.jp |title=Scots football star dies in pitch tragedy |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motherwell announced the Main Stand at Fir Park would be renamed The Phil O'Donnell Stand as a permanent tribute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10292~1212575,00.html |title=Main Stand renamed after Phil O'Donnell |publisher=Motherwell FC |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his team-mates paid their own personal tribute by having his signature embroidered on their strips for the remainder of the 2007–08 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motherwellfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10292~1212357,00.html |title=Embroidered tribute to Phil O'Donnell |publisher=Motherwell FC |date=11 January 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2011, a permanent memorial to O'Donnell was erected on the side of the stand bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15902604.stm|title=Motherwell unveil new Phil O'Donnell tribute |publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 November 2011|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2008, a benefit match was held at [[Celtic Park]] in memory of O'Donnell with the proceeds going to various charities. The match was between a Celtic side drawn from their 1998 title-winning squad and a Motherwell side drawn from their 1991 Scottish Cup win. Other players such as David Clarkson and James McFadden played in the game. [[Henrik Larsson]] described the match as "a sad occasion but at the same time it's a kind of celebration for everything." The match finished 5–1, in front of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/7419472.stm| title=Larsson takes time for O'Donnell| publisher=BBC Sport| date=25 May 2008| accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the annual sponsored walk, that started on 29 December 2008, that is held on that day to honour O'Donnell's memory. The walk starts from Fir Park and ends at Celtic Park, the homes of two of O'Donnell's former clubs. The money raised from the walk goes directly to charities such as the [[British Heart Foundation]] and [[Mary's Meals]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walk10for10.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, a number of fellow Scottish footballers that had played alongside Phil had thought of his family announced they would trek up [[Cotopaxi]] in Ecuador in memory of Phil to raise £100,000 for the British Heart Foundation. The trek is scheduled to take place in the summer of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tributetophil.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since O'Donnell's death in 2007, his nephew [[David Clarkson]] is the only player to have worn the number 10 shirt, which he had up until his departure in 2009. Since then this number, although not retired, has not been issued to any subsequent player.

{{nihongo|'''''Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia'''''|ポケモンレンジャー　バトナージ|Pokemon Renjā Batonāji|"Pokémon Ranger: Vatonage"}} is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Creatures Inc.]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and distributed by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[video game console]]. 

It was announced in the January 2008 issue of ''[[CoroCoro]]'' and was released in Japan on March 20, 2008. It was announced at [[E3 2008]] that the game would be released in the United States under the title ''Shadows of Almia'' on November 10, 2008. It was announced on September 25 that the game would be released in Europe under the title ''Shadows of Almia'' on November 21, 2008. It was released on the European Wii U Virtual Console on June 9, 2016, and was released on the North American Wii U Virtual Console on August 4, 2016.

The game features 270 Pokémon, including new Pokémon which were not featured in the original ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'', from [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]. The game utilizes the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] to download new missions.

==Gameplay==
The game takes place in the Almia region. The player begins as a Pokémon ranger-in-training at the Ranger School and quickly graduates to a rookie Ranger and must advance from there.  The player may choose their character’s gender, but unlike in the original ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'', this choice does not affect their partner Pokémon.

Much of the gameplay is similar to the original game. Players must capture/befriend wild Pokémon to aid them by circling them with their [[Nintendo DS]] stylus (known as a Capture Styler in the game).

There is a major change from the original capture method.  Instead of having to complete certain number of loops without lifting the stylus, the player must fill up a Pokémon’s Friendship Gauge by drawing loops around the Pokémon, but can lift the stylus to avoid attacks.  However, the power in Friendship Gauge will decrease over time if the player stops drawing loops for too long.  The amount of power in the gauge filled by each loop increases as the player levels up the styler.

Shadows of Almia also introduces Quests, which are mini-missions not essential to the plot that involve the player completing requests from Almia citizens, earning new partner Pokémon and power-ups (such as resistance to attacks or longer capture lines) for their styler as rewards.

Unlike the original, ''Shadows of Almia'' allows the player to choose their partner Pokémon.  In the previous game, the partner was decided based on the players chosen gender ([[Minun]] for male, [[Plusle]] for female). Players start with either Pachirisu, Munchlax, or Starly, and the other 14 partners (as well as the two partners that were not chosen at the beginning) are obtainable either through sub-quests or in-game events, and once captured, can be switched to be the player's partner at any time. There are 17 possible partners, one for each of the [[Pokémon types]] that existed at the time.

Shadows of Almia also includes 4 different types of stylers: the School, Capture, Fine and Vatonage stylers. The School styler is a simplified version of the capture styler, while the Fine Styler has a charge feature (which can be upgraded) which activates when the styler is held down, increasing the amount of feelings conveyed to the Pokémon and enabling quicker captures. The Vatonage styler is a unique Fine Styler that can capture Team Dim Sun's Pokémon instead of merely releasing them.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
This game takes place in a new region - {{nihongo|Almia|アルミア地方|Arumia-chihō}}, far from all other regions encountered in other games. The Fiore region is an exception, however. It is mentioned frequently in Almia. Almia has a widely varied landscape, everything from the hot Haruba Desert to the chilly Hia Valley.

===Plot===
The game starts at the Ranger School, with the player enrolling as a student after expertly capturing a Pikachu. The player quickly makes friends with two of classmates, Rhythmi who dreams of being an Operator, and Keith, a rival, who dreams of becoming a Top Ranger. After the player and Keith nearly discover what Mr. Kincaid, a teacher, is doing in the basement, Mr. Kincaid seals it off from all students. Both the player and Keith show strong potential as Rangers, and graduate with full honors after defeating two Tangrowth at their graduation ceremony. The player stays in Almia, while Keith and Rhythmi go to Fiore as part of their training. The player's family moves into a nearby town known as Chicole Village, and the player goes to live with them.

During this time, an evil group emerges in Almia known as Team Dim Sun. Dim Sun uses machines called Miniremos and Gigaremos to control Pokémon for their own use.

The player becomes an Area Ranger, helping out the people of Vientown, and receives a partner Pokémon by befriending it. The player receives their first major mission soon after: Patrolling a nearby cave. In this cave, strange Pokémon under mind control are found and rescued, with the source of their control being a (not known at the time) Gigaremo unit. The player comes back from Ranger HQ after talking about the gigaremo, when a forest fire soon breaks out in Vien Forest. After stopping the fire with a Blastoise, the player gains access to the town on the other side, Pueltown.

The player's next big mission is to locate the leader of the Area Rangers-Barlow, who was last seen leaving to investigate disturbances on the volcanic isle of Boyleland. After exploring Boyle Volcano, the player captures two of Team Dim Sun's guards, who tell him that Barlow is on their large ship used to transport Pokémon. The player runs after the ship, and after finding Barlow, they confront the leader, Mr. Kincaid, who was a leader of Dim Sun. Kincaid deploys a Drapion to deal with the Rangers, and is defeated. Kincaid orders the ship to be submerged, which the player prevents, and Kincaid flees. Barlow steers the ship into the yard of the Ranger Academy, where the mission is declared a success.

The player is promoted to the rank of Top Ranger and gains the use of the Fine Styler. Their first mission is to help Sven, another Top Ranger, investigate a Dim Sun mining operation in the Chroma Ruins. They discover that Dim Sun is looking for Dark Crystals to power their Gigaremo and Miniremo units. They also find a hole where a large Shadow Crystal was once held, and a Diary written by the late Brighton Hall, the previous president of Altru Inc; the mining site is discovered to be the ruins of the site where Doyle Hall, the company's founder, first began prospecting for new energy sources. While examining the Dark Crystal, the Rangers discover that the effects of these crystals can be nullified by shards of three gems known as the Tears of Princes.

The player and Keith go on to separately collect the sources of these shards; the blue gem from Almia Castle, the red gem from Boyle Volcano, and the yellow gem from Hippowdon Temple. Although the player takes both the blue and red gems, Keith is captured by Dim Sun, which uses him to blackmail the player into surrendering the yellow gem. Meanwhile, Sven raids Dim Sun's undersea base, stealing plans for an "Incredible Machine". With the aid of Isaac, a former classmate of the player and Kincaid's unwitting protege, it is discovered that the plans are for Altru Inc.'s tower, which is actually a massive Gigaremo powered by the Shadow Crystal. With this revelation it is realized that Altru Inc. is behind Team Dim Sun's activities.

Immediately after this realization, the Sinis Trio — three Dim Sun agents serving Blake Hall, Altru's president — attack the Ranger Union headquarters. They bribe Isaac into returning to save his sister. After the player and Keith defeat Blake's deputy Wheeler, the leaders of the Ranger Union plan an all out strike on Altru Tower, known as Operation Brighton. The two top rangers circle the headquarters, while Keith and the player would charge the tower, find the Yellow gem, rescue Isaac, and destroy the barrier. After this is accomplished, the player confronts Blake on the top of the tower, too late to prevent its full activation. With the Shadow Crystal's power, Blake summons a Dusknoir from Hippowdon Temple, but the player captures it and defeats Wheeler once more. Pushing the Incredible Machine into the unsafe "Level Dark," Blake summons [[Darkrai]], the Shadow Crystal's protector; driven mad by the Incredible Machine, Darkrai breaks free from Blake's control, consumes him and Wheeler in a Dark Void, and goes on a rampage. The player uses the power of the Tears of Princes linked with their Styler to capture Darkrai and save Blake, which turns the Shadow Crystal into the Luminous Crystal, ending the mission. Professor Hastings arrives and reveals that Blake was born Wyatt Hall, and Brighton offered him to the Shadow Crystal and changed his name, a mistake Brighton came to regret when Blake drove him from Altru. Remorseful for his actions, Blake surrenders to Hastings and is taken to face justice.

Peace returns to Almia and its inhabitants, and the characters enjoy a concert originally planned for Altru (played by the Go-Rock Quads from the original ''Pokémon Ranger'') while the player returns home to his family. The game ends showing Darkrai circling the Luminous Crystal. In an epilogue mission, Kincaid reorganizes the remnants of Team Dim Sun under his own leadership. Now dubbed Team Debonairs, the revived organization attempts to revert the Luminous Crystal back into the Shadow Crystal by removing the Tears of Princes from their positions around it. With Darkrai's aid, the player thwarts Team Debonairs, ends Kincaid's ambitions and ensures a peaceful future for all of Almia.

''Shadows of Almia'' has received mostly mixed reviews, with a score of 68 on [[Metacritic]].  [[GameSpot]] gave the title a 7.5 out of 10 rating, stating that "''Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia'' improves upon its predecessor just enough to make it a fun, solid addition to the spin-off series.". [[Eurogamer]] gave Shadows of Almia a 6 out of 10 rating, stating that "With a long wait until the next proper Pokémon game, many fans may feel that's enough, but they shouldn't expect anything more than a mild distraction." [[1UP.com|1UP]] gave the title a C+ rating, stating that "While it's nowhere near as addictive as the regular color-coded Pokémon games, Almia's still a decent diversion -- I just wish the story offered something a little deeper." [[IGN]] gave the title a rating of 6.7 out of 10, stating that "Unless you're addicted to scribbling circles like that creepy boy from The Ring, or you're some sort of hippie that only likes playing humane non-battling Pokémon games, you could probably pass on this and be just fine."  As of July 9, 2008, the game has sold 576,467 copies in Japan, according to ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Weekly Famitsu, issue 1020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/ds.php|title=Nintendo DS Japanese Ranking|publisher=Japan Game Charts|date=2008-07-30|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808100144/http://www.japan-gamecharts.com/ds.php|archivedate=2008-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the 13th best-selling game of Japan in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parfitt, Ben|title=JAPANESE 2008 MARKET REPORT|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/business/japanese-2008-market-report|publisher=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games|MCVUK]]|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the sixth best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kohler, Chris|title=Top 10 Games of December 2008, By Platform|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/top-10-games-of/|website=[[Wired.com]]|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2018-05-27|date=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Postpartum infections''', also known as '''childbed fever''' and '''puerperal fever''', are any bacterial [[infection]]s of the [[female reproductive tract]] following [[childbirth]] or [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; Signs and symptoms usually include a [[fever]] greater than {{convert|38.0|C|F}}, chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling [[vaginal discharge]].&lt;ref name=W2014&gt;{{cite book|title=Williams obstetrics|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-179893-8|pages=Chapter 37|edition=24th|chapter=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.&lt;ref name=Hir2014&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hiralal Konar|title=DC Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics|date=2014|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5152-067-2|page=432|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=LU2VAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208041911/https://books.google.ca/books?id=LU2VAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Causes and diagnosis--&gt;
The most common infection is that of the [[uterus]] and surrounding tissues known as '''puerperal sepsis''', '''postpartum metritis''', or '''postpartum endometritis'''.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hac2015&gt;{{cite book |title=Hacker &amp; Moore's essentials of obstetrics and gynecology |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier Canada |isbn=9781455775583 |pages=276-290 |edition=6 |chapter=Cover of Hacker &amp; Moore's Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynecology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include [[Cesarean section]] (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as [[group B streptococcus]] in the vagina, [[premature rupture of membranes]], multiple [[vaginal exam]]s, manual removal of the [[placenta]], and [[prolonged labour]] among others.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOBook2015&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of maternal peripartum infections|date=2015|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241549363|pmid=26598777|page=1|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/186171/1/9789241549363_eng.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207091250/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/186171/1/9789241549363_eng.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most infections involve a number of types of bacteria.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; Diagnosis is rarely helped by [[microbiological culture|culturing]] of the vagina or blood.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; In those who do not improve, [[medical imaging]] may be required.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; Other causes of fever following delivery include [[breast engorgement]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, infections of an abdominal incision or an [[episiotomy]], and [[atelectasis]].&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOBook2015/&gt;

&lt;!--Prevention and treatment--&gt;
Due to the risks following C-section, it is recommended that all women receive a preventive dose of [[antibiotic]]s such as [[ampicillin]] around the time of surgery.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; Treatment of established infections is with antibiotics, with most people improving in two to three days.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; In those with mild disease, oral antibiotics may be used; otherwise [[intravenous]] antibiotics are recommended.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; Common antibiotics include a combination of [[ampicillin]] and [[gentamicin]] following vaginal delivery or [[clindamycin]] and gentamicin in those who have had a C-section.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; In those who are not improving with appropriate treatment, other complications such an [[abscess]] should be considered.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt;

&lt;!--Epidemiology and history--&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms usually include a [[fever]] greater than {{convert|38.0|C|F}}, chills, low abdominal pain, and possibly bad smelling vaginal discharge.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt; It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.&lt;ref name=Hir2014/&gt;

==Causes==
After childbirth a woman's [[Female genital tract|genital tract]] has a large bare surface, which is prone to infection. Infection may be limited to the cavity and wall of her [[uterus]], or it may spread beyond to cause [[septicaemia]] (blood poisoning) or other illnesses, especially when her resistance has been lowered by a long labour or severe bleeding. Puerperal infection is most common on the raw surface of the interior of the uterus after separation of the [[placenta]] (afterbirth); but [[pathogenic]] organisms may also affect [[lacerations]] of any part of the genital tract. By whatever portal, they can invade the [[bloodstream]] and [[lymph system]] to cause [[septicemia]], [[cellulitis]] (inflammation of connective tissue), and pelvic or generalized [[peritonitis]] (inflammation of the abdominal lining). The severity of the illness depends on the [[virulence]] of the infecting organism, the resistance of the invaded tissues, and the general health of the woman. Organisms commonly producing this infection are ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''; [[staphylococci]] (inhabitants of the skin and of [[pimples]], [[carbuncles]], and many other [[pustular]] eruptions); the [[Peptostreptococcus|anaerobic streptococci]], which flourish in devitalized tissues such as may be present after long and injurious labour and unskilled instrumental delivery; ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (inhabitants of the lower bowel); and ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''.

===Risk factors===
Causes (listed in order of decreasing frequency) include [[endometritis]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[pneumonia]]/[[atelectasis]], [[wound infection]], and [[septic pelvic thrombophlebitis]]. Septic risk factors for each condition are listed in order of the [[postpartum]] day (PPD) on which the condition generally occurs.
* PPD 0: [[atelectasis]] risk factors include [[general anesthesia]], [[cigarette smoking]], and [[obstructive lung disease]].
* PPD 1–2: urinary tract infections risk factors include multiple [[catheterization]] during labor, multiple [[vaginal examination]]s during labor, and untreated [[bacteriuria]].
* PPD 2–3: endometritis ( the most common cause ) risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examinations during labor.
* PPD 4–5: wound infection risk factors include emergency [[cesarean section]], prolonged [[membrane rupture]], prolonged labor, and multiple vaginal examination during labor.
* PPD 5–6: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis risk factors include emergency cesarean section, prolonged membrane rupture, prolonged labor, and diffuse difficult vaginal childbirth.
* PPD 7–21: [[mastitis]] risk factors include nipple trauma from [[breastfeeding]].

== Diagnosis ==
Puerperal fever is diagnosed when:
* A temperature rise above {{convert|38|C|F|1|abbr=on}} maintained over 24 hours or recurring during the period from the end of the first to the end of the 10th day after childbirth or abortion. (ICD-10)
* Oral temperature of {{convert|38|C|F|1|abbr=on}} or more on any two of the first ten days postpartum. (USJCMW)&lt;ref name="gfmer.ch"&gt;[http://www.gfmer.ch/Medical_education_En/PGC_RH_2004/Pdf/Chisembele_Puerperal_sepsis.pdf The Global Incidence of Puerperal Sepsis Protocol for a Systematic Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217023721/http://www.gfmer.ch/Medical_education_En/PGC_RH_2004/Pdf/Chisembele_Puerperal_sepsis.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerperal fever  (from the Latin ''puer'', ''male child (boy)''), is no longer favored as a diagnostic category. Instead, contemporary terminology specifies:&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2005):98&lt;/ref&gt;
# the specific target of infection: [[endometritis]] (inflammation of the inner lining of the uterus), [[metrophlebitis]] (inflammation of the veins of the uterus), and [[peritonitis]] (inflammation of the membrane lining of the abdomen)
# the severity of the infection: less serious [[infection]] (contained multiplication of microbes) or possibly life-threatening [[sepsis]] (uncontrolled and uncontained multiplication of microbes throughout the blood stream).

[[Endometritis]] is a polymicrobial infection.  It frequently includes organisms such as ''[[Ureaplasma]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', and ''[[Bacteroides]]'', and may also include organisms such as ''[[Gardnerella]]'', ''[[Chlamydia (genus)|Chlamydia]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Escherichia]]'', and ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/1990/04000/bacteriologic_findings_of_post_cesarean.12.aspx | title=Bacteriologic Findings of Post-Cesarian Endometritis in Adolescents | first=AB | last=Berenson | journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology | date=April 1990 | volume=75 | pages=627–629 | pmid=2314783 | issue=4 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103084443/http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/1990/04000/bacteriologic_findings_of_post_cesarean.12.aspx | archivedate=2013-11-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
A number of other conditions can cause fevers following delivery including: [[urinary tract infections]], [[breast engorgement]], [[atelectasis]] and surgical incisions, among others.&lt;ref name=W2014/&gt;

==Management==
Antibiotics have been used to prevent and treat these infections however the misuse of antibiotics is a serious problem for global health.&lt;ref name=WHOBook2015/&gt; It is recommended that guidelines be followed which outline when it is appropriate to give antibiotics and which antibiotics are most effective.&lt;ref name=WHOBook2015/&gt;

[[Atelectasis]]: mild to moderate fever, no changes or mild rales on chest [[auscultation]].

Management: pulmonary exercises, ambulation (deep breathing and walking)

[[Urinary tract infection]] : high fever, malaise, [[costovertebral angle tenderness|costovertebral]] tenderness, positive urine culture.

Management: antibiotics as per culture sensitivity (cephalosporine).

[[Endometritis]]: moderate fever, exquisite uterine tenderness, minimal abdominal findings.

Management: multiple agent IV antibiotics to cover polymicrobial organisms: clindamycin, gentamicin, addition of ampicillin if no response, no cultures are necessary.

[[Wound infection]]: persistent spiking fever despite antibiotics, wound [[erythema]] or fluctuance, wound drainage.

Management: antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain wound, saline-soaked packing twice a day, secondary closure.

[[Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis]]: persistent wide fever swings despite antibiotics, usually normal abdominal or pelvic exams.

Management: IV heparin for 7–10 days at rates sufficient to prolong the PTT to double the baseline values.

[[Mastitis]]: unilateral, localized erythema, [[edema]], tenderness.

Management: antibiotics for cellulitis, open and drain abscess if present.

==Epidemiology==
The number of cases of puerperal sepsis per year shows wide variations among published literature — this may be related to different definition, recording etc.&lt;ref name="gfmer.ch"/&gt; Globally, bacterial infections are the cause of 10% of maternal deaths- this is more common in low income countries but is also a direct cause of maternal deaths in high income countries.&lt;ref name=WHOBook2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/186171/1/9789241549363_eng.pdf?ua=1|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of maternal peripartum infections|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306061338/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/186171/1/9789241549363_eng.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, puerperal infections are believed to occur in between one and eight percent of all births. About three die from puerperal sepsis for every 100,000 births. The single most important risk factor is [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=K. Codell |last2=Carter |first2=Barbara R. |title=Childbed fever.

Puerperal infections in the 18th and 19th centuries affected, on average, 6 to 9 women in every 1,000 births, killing two to three of them with peritonitis or septicemia. It was the single most common cause of [[maternal mortality]], accounting for about half of all deaths related to [[childbirth]], and was second only to [[tuberculosis]] in killing women of childbearing age. A rough estimate is that about 250,000–500,000 died from puerperal fever in the 18th and 19th centuries in England and Wales alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loudon |first=Irvine |authorlink=Irvine Loudon |title=The Tragedy of Childbed Fever |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA; |date=9 March 2000 |location= |page=6 |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-820499-X.pdf |doi= |id= |isbn=0-19-820499-X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211075531/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-820499-X.pdf |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although it had been recognized from as early as the time of the [[Hippocratic corpus]] that women in childbed were prone to fevers, the distinct name, "puerperal fever" appears in historical records only from the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The debate about when this term first emerged is presented by Irvine Loudon, The tragedy of childbed fever, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death rate for women giving birth decreased in the 20th century in [[developed countries]]. The decline may be partly attributed to improved environmental conditions, better [[obstetrical]] care, and the use of [[antibiotics]]. Another reason appears to be a lessening of the virulence or invasiveness of Streptococcus pyogenes. This organism is also the cause of [[scarlet fever]], which over the same period has also declined markedly in severity and incidence. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The historical level of maternal deaths is probably around 1 in 100 births.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance mortality rates at the Dublin Maternity Hospital [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly patient mortality rates at the Dublin Maternity Hospital 1784-1849|1784–1849]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates reached very high levels in maternity institutions in the 1800s, sometimes climbing to 40 percent of birthgiving women (see [[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever]]). At the beginning of the 1900s, maternal death rates were around 1 in 100 for live births.

==="The Doctor's Plague"===
[[Image:Yearly mortality rates 1784-1849.png|thumb|right|300px|In his 1861 book, [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] presented evidence to demonstrate that the advent of [[pathological anatomy]] in Vienna in 1823 (vertical line) was correlated to the incidence of fatal childbed fever there. Onset of [[chlorine]] handwash in 1847 marked by vertical line. Rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy, is shown for comparison ([[Historical mortality rates of puerperal fever#Yearly mortality rates for birthgiving women 1784-1849|view rates]]). His efforts were futile, however.]]
From the 1600s through the mid-to-late 1800s, the majority of childbed fever cases were caused by the doctors themselves. With no knowledge of [[Microorganism|germs]], doctors did not believe hand washing was needed.

Hospitals for childbirth became common in the 17th century in many European cities. These "lying-in" hospitals were established at a time when there was no knowledge of [[antisepsis]] or [[epidemiology]], and women were subjected to crowding, frequent vaginal examinations, and the use of contaminated instruments, dressings, and bedding. It was common for a doctor to deliver one baby after another, without washing his hands or changing clothes in between.

The first recorded epidemic of puerperal fever occurred at the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris]] in 1646. Hospitals throughout Europe and America consistently reported death rates between 20% to 25% of all women giving birth, punctuated by intermittent epidemics with up to 100% fatalities of women giving birth in childbirth wards.&lt;ref&gt;Loudon I. Deaths in childbed from the eighteenth century to 1935. Med History 1986; 30: 1–41&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth in the doctor's [[maternity ward]].  His investigation discovered that washing hands with an [[antiseptic]], in this case a calcium chloride solution, before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | title=The Childbed Fever Mystery and the Meaning of Medical Journalism | last=Caplan | first=Caralee E. | journal=McGill Journal of Medicine | year=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707205101/http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of his findings was not well received by the medical profession.

Semmelweis was not the only doctor ignored after sounding a warning about this issue: in ''Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever'' (1795), ex-naval surgeon and [[Aberdeen|Aberdonian]] obstetrician [[Alexander Gordon (physician)|Alexander Gordon]] warned that the disease was transmitted from one case to another by midwives and doctors.  Gordon wrote, "It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention, that I myself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of women."&lt;ref name="Dr Alexander Gordon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/images/ignaz-semmelweis.html |title=Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever |publisher=www.general-anaesthesia.com |work=Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720005441/http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/images/ignaz-semmelweis.html |archivedate=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Watson Research Center|Thomas Watson]], Professor of Medicine at [[King's College Hospital]], London, wrote in 1842: "Wherever puerperal fever is rife, or when a practitioner has attended any one instance of it, he should use most diligent [[Hygiene|ablution]]." Watson recommended [[handwashing]] with [[chlorine]] solution and changes of clothing for obstetric attendants "to prevent the practitioner becoming a vehicle of contagion and death between one patient and another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_11_021202/dec10354_fm.html#i1067496 ''The Medical Journal of Australia.''"The contagiousness of childbed fever: a short history of puerperal sepsis and its treatment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203030203/http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_11_021202/dec10354_fm.html |date=2006-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention via hygienic measures===
[[File:DBP 1956 244 Semmelweis.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Semmelweis, discoverer of some of the causes of puerperal fever]]
In 1843, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.]] published ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holmes, O.W.|title=On the contagiousness of puerperal fever|journal=New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine. |volume=i |pages=503–30 |year=1842–1843}} in Richard Gordon. (1983), Great Medical Disasters. p.147 (see also p.43 for selected quote).&lt;/ref&gt; and controversially concluded that puerperal fever was frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses; he suggested that clean clothing and avoidance of autopsies by those aiding birth would prevent the spread of puerperal fever.&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.html Oliver Wendell Holmes: ''The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203165344/http://www.bartleby.com/38/5/1.html |date=2007-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes quoted Dr. James Blundell as stating, "...&amp;nbsp;in my own family, I had rather that those I esteemed the most should be delivered unaided, in a stable, by the mangerside, than that they should receive the best help, in the fairest apartment, but exposed to the vapors of this pitiless disease."&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"/&gt;

Holmes' conclusions were ridiculed by many contemporaries, including [[Charles Delucena Meigs]], a well-known obstetrician, who stated, "Doctors are gentlemen, and gentlemen's hands are clean."&lt;ref name="wertz"&gt;Wertz RM, Wertz DC. Lying-in: a history of childbirth in America. New York: New York Free Press, 1977.  Original reference is probably {{cite book  | last = Meigs  | first = Charles Delucena   | title = On the Nature, Signs, and Treatment of Childbed Fevers: In a Series of Letters Addressed to the Students of His Class  | publisher = Blanchard and Lea, Philadelphia  | year = 1854  | location = Original from Harvard University (Digitized Nov 30, 2007), Retrieved September 1, 2008  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RigSAAAAYAAJ   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  | page = 362 pages }}:104
&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gordon states that Holmes' exhortations "outraged obstetricians, particularly in Philadelphia".&lt;ref name="GordononMotherhood"&gt;{{cite book| title=Great Medical Disasters| last= Gordon|first= Richard | authorlink=Richard Gordon (English author)|chapter=Disastrous Motherhood: Tales from the Vienna Wards | editor=...| year= 1983| publisher= Hutchinson &amp; Co.| location= London |pages=43–46}}p.43&lt;/ref&gt; In those days, "surgeons operated in blood-stiffened frock coats - the stiffer the coat, the prouder the busy surgeon", "pus was as inseparable from surgery as blood", and "Cleanliness was next to prudishness". He quotes [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]] on that era: "There was no object in being clean&amp;nbsp;... Indeed, cleanliness was out of place. It was considered to be finicking and affected. An executioner might as well manicure his nails before chopping off a head".&lt;ref name="GordononMotherhood44"&gt;Gordon, Richard (1983) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] was appointed assistant lecturer in the First Obstetric Division of the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (Allgemeines Krankenhaus), where medical students received their training. Working without knowledge of Holmes' essay, Semmelweis noticed his ward's 16% mortality rate from fever was substantially higher than the 2% mortality rate in the Second Division, where midwifery students were trained. Semmelweis also noticed that puerperal fever was rare in women who gave birth before arriving at the hospital. Semmelweis noted that doctors in First Division performed autopsies each morning on women who had died the previous day, but the midwives were not required or allowed to perform such autopsies. He made the connection between the autopsies and puerperal fever after a colleague, [[Jakob Kolletschka]], died of sepsis after accidentally cutting his hand while performing an autopsy.

Semmelweis began experimenting with various cleansing agents and, from May 1847, ordered all doctors and students working in the First Division wash their hands in chlorinated lime solution before starting ward work, and later before each vaginal examination.

[[Elizabeth of York]], the mother of [[Henry VIII of England]], died of puerperal fever one week after giving birth to a daughter. Other famous victims include author [[Jean Webster]], English queens [[Jane Seymour]] and [[Katherine Parr]] (both wives of Henry VIII), housekeeping authority [[Isabella Beeton]], famous French natural philosopher [[Émilie du Châtelet]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], author of ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' and mother of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' author [[Mary Shelley]]. Suzanne Barnard, mother of philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contracted childbed fever after giving birth to him, and died nine days later. Her infant son was also in perilous health following the birth; the adult Rousseau later wrote that "I came into the world with so few signs of life that little hope was entertained of preserving me". He was nursed back to health by an aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [[Will Durant]]'s "The Age of Rousseau".{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; African-American poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] (1753–84) died of puerperal fever. In [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', it is implied that both [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge's]] mother and younger sister perished from this condition, explaining the character's animosity towards his nephew Fred and also his poor relationship with his own father{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

[[File:ElijahByLouisHersent.JPG|230px|thumb|Painting by [[Louis Hersent]].]]
The '''raising of the widow of [[Sarepta|Zarephath]]'s son''' is a [[miracle]] of the prophet [[Elijah]] recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[1 Kings]] 17.

==Background==

1 Kings 17 is the chapter in which Elijah is first mentioned by name in the Bible. It states that he is a [[Tishbite]] from [[Gilead]], who visited King [[Ahab]] to give him a message from God that there would be no rain in the land until he declared it (v1). In order to avoid the wrath of the king God told Elijah to hide by the Brook [[Cherith]] where he was fed bread and meat by [[raven]]s sent from God (vv2-6).

After a while, due to the drought, the brook dried up so God told Elijah to go to the town of [[Sarepta]] and to seek out a widow that would find him water and food (vv.7-9). Elijah learns that the widow has a son and between them they only have enough flour and oil for one more meal before they die. Despite this the widow helps Elijah (vv11-14). Because she did this God caused the flour and the oil never to run out (vv15-16).

==Elijah, the widow and the widow's son==

{{quotation|1 Kings 17:17-18 After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him 18 And she said to Elijah, "What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to be to bring my sin and remembrance and to cause the death of my son!"}}

[[Victor H. Matthews]] suggests that the woman "uses sarcasm which is designed to shame the prophet for being the cause of her son's death." Elijah does not try and rationalise with the grieving woman and takes the son up to his bedroom where he prays to God asking for his help. 

{{quotation|1 Kings 17:21-22 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, "O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again". 22 And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.}}

He then takes the child downstairs again and presents him, living, to his mother. This causes her to declare ''"Now by this I know that thou art a man of God"'' (v24), Elijah therefore "regains his honor and his status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=Victor H.|author-link=Victor H. Matthews|title=Female Voices: Upholding the Honor of the Household|journal=[[Biblical Theology Bulletin]]|date=1994|volume=24|pages=10–11|url=http://btb.sagepub.com/content/24/1/8.full.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliezer ben Hurcanus|Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus]], also known as Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol, relates that the son raised by Elijah was none other than the prophet [[Jonah]], most notably associated with the incident involving a giant fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pirkderabbieli00frieuoft|title=Pirkê de Rabbi Eliezer : (the chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great) according to the text of the manuscript belonging to Abraham Epstein of Vienna|last=Friedlander|first=Gerald|date=1916-01-01|publisher=London : Paul|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators have noted verbal parallels with the [[raising of the son of the widow of Nain]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;The People's New Testament Commentary - M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock - 2004 Page 204 "7:11-17 RAISING THE WIDOW'S SON This story is only in Luke, but it has many points of contact with the story of Elijah's raising the widow of Zarephath's son (1 Kgs. 17:8-24), including such verbatim parallels as "he gave him to his mother" ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle is represented in the [[Dura synagogue]] murals.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner Judaism in late antiquity - Page 115 Jonathan A. Goldstein "In WC1, Elijah restores to life the son of the widow from Zarephath (I Kings 17:17- 24)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ramdwara.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The most popular Ramdwara is situated in Shahpura.]]
'''Ramdwara''' (Devanagari रामद्वारा) means 'the doorway to the ''Ram''&lt;nowiki /&gt;' (i.e., to the name of God). It is a place of worship for the people who believe in Ramsnehi Sampradaya, which advocates chanting of 'Ram' (राम).&lt;ref name=x&gt;Page 324, Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Ahmedabad Government Central Press 1879 https://archive.org/stream/gazetteerbombay18enthgoog#page/n346/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsnehi means "People who love God". Their way of worshipping God is simple. People of all faiths, castes, sections etc. visit at the Ramdwaras.&lt;ref name = qqa&gt;Page 24, Spiritual heritage of Rajasthan, Dinesh Chandra Shukla, Books Treasure, 1992 https://books.google.com/books?id=FhscAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ramdwara+Shahpura&amp;dq=Ramdwara+Shahpura&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DOUQUsGMH8TqrQfZmYCACQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;Preface, Lakshya Ram Ji Maharaj, "Ram Rahasya Darshan" https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3bUXrI1MZN1ZjI0WHhnX2s4T3M/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of ''Ram'' or ''Rama'' is distinct from the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]].

== Origin of Ramsnehi==
[[File:SwamiRamCharan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portrait of the Founder of RamSnehi Sampradaya.&lt;br/&gt; Shri 1008 (Salutation) Swami Ji Shri Ram Charan Ji Maharaj.]]
Ramsnehi Sampradaya is a spiritual and religious tradition originating in 1817 [[Vikram Samwat]] in Bhilwara city of Rajasthan by the [[Apprenticeship|disciple]] of Swami Shri [[Ram Charan Maharaj]] who provided the spiritual and philosophical basis for the sect.

In present time, ''Ramsnehi Sampradaya'' has four major [[monastery|monasteries]]. All are in [[Rajasthan]], India.  They are in the following cities:

*Shahpura, Rajasthan
* Banwara, Rajasthan
*Sodha, Rajasthan
*Bhilwara, Rajasthan

[[File:People at Ramdwara Chhatribagh, Indore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|People talking to a saint at Ramdwara, Chhatribagh, Indore]]

Smaller Ramdwara centres are located at various places in states of [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Delhi]].

Swami Ji Shree [[Ram Charan Ji Maharaj]] came to [[Shahpura, Bhilwara|Shahpura]] from [[Bhilwara]] and did [[Tapasya]] (deep meditation).

At the place where Swami Ram Charan Ji Maharaj's body was cremated, a giant Ramdwara has been built. This is now the chief Ramdwara of ''Ramsnehi Sampradaya''.

This Ramdwara is also called Ram Niwas Dhaam or Ram Niwas Baikunth Dhaam.

== Construction ==
[[File:barahdari.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Barahdari'' of Ramdwara.]]
The Shahpura Ramdwara was sponsored by the then King of Shahpura, Maharaja Amar Singh, and his brother Chattra Singh.
It was built by constructors named Jarror Khan and Kushal Khan. This is also a great example of the brotherhood of [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslims]] in India.

All the marble stones used in construction were sourced from a place near the north border of nearby village named ''Kanti''.
There is a speciality in all used marble stones that each marble stone has a picture and stone mark on it as of Hindi (Devnagari) alphabets of the construction of word "Ram" (Lord Ram), bow, saint, India's map, sword, lion, monkey and other natural pictures.

The main (and base) structure of Shahpura Ramdwara is an octagon shaped shiny marble pillar which is about 12 feet long. This pillar is situated at the cremation place of [[Ram Charan Maharaj]]. This pillar is called the [[Samadhi]] Stambh.

The floor above the pillar is called [[Baradari (building)|Baradari]] (a kind of summer house with several open marble gates ). A rectangular stone is placed in the center of Baradari which is just over the main pillar.

The Baradari has 108 small pillars which make 84 open gates.

The construction was done in different phases.

== Monks of Ramdwara ==
[[File:ramdwaramonk.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Monk'' of Ramdwara.]]

The [[monk]]s of ''RamSnehi Sampradaya'' are identical by their dressing code. They wear a robe coloured a very light pink. After taking oaths, monks can not return to their family and must treat the whole world equally and fairly, without any prejudices. They are supposed to follow all the defined rules strictly.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;

== Way of worship and belief ==
Ramsnehis believe in the name of God (Ram राम) and do not believe in i[[Idolatry|dolatry]]. A Ramsnehi only follows the simple and easily defined rules. Ramsnehis just do [[Darśana|Darshan]] of the chair of current [[Acharya]] and monks. They pay respects to all the previous (departed) acharyas and saints as well.&lt;ref name="qqa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

[[File:Ramdwara ed f.ogg|thumb|Ram dhun- Evening chanting of Ram Ram at Ramdwara Shahpura, the main centre of Ramsnehi Sampradaya.]]

Ramsnehis remember the name राम (Ram, a name of the Lord).  Three main pillars of the ideology are:

*Have the Name of God (राम) in your Heart
*Have mercy for every living being
*Be ready to serve any needy person

'''Ratanachai Sor Vorapin''' is a professional boxer and a former [[WBO]] bantamweight champion. He is the younger brother of [[Ratanapol Sor Vorapin]], a former [[IBF]] strawweight champion.

==Professional career==
After winning 6 consecutive matches, he fought Ruangroj Kiatkriangkrai for the Thai light flyweight championship where he won by unanimous decision on September 28, 1992. In his first defense of that title 73 days later, he lost to Kompayak Chor Charoen on points and tasted his first defeat. He regained it on March 26, 1994 with TKO victory over Suksawat Torboonlert in two rounds.

Sor Vorapin had his first shot at a world title on April 24, 1999 where he battled [[Mark Johnson (boxer)|Mark Johnson]] for the vacant IBF super flyweight title. Unsuccessfully, he lost via unanimous decision.

He then moved up in weight where he took on [[Tim Austin]] for the IBF bantamweight title on December 15, 2001. Like his previous attempt for a world crown, Sor Vorapin lost the match in a similar fashion.

In his third world title shot, Sor Vorapin finally achieved victory. There, he won the [[WBO]] bantamweight title on May 7, 2004 with a unanimous decision win over [[Cruz Carbajal]]. Following some wins in seven ordinary matches, Sor Vorapin defended his title by outpointing Mauricio Martinez on August 5, 2005. On his second title defense, however, he was TKO'd in seven rounds by [[Jhonny Gonzalez]] on October 29, 2005.

He attempted to regain the title by challenging [[Gerry Peñalosa]] who won it from Gonzalez. In the aftermath of the fight, Vorapin was defeated by an 8th round stoppage from Peñalosa on April 6, 2008 in the event "Invasion: Philippines vs. The World" at the [[Araneta Coliseum]]. Peñalosa knocked down the Thai thrice, in the 5th, 7th, and earlier in the eighth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/87923/Pe&amp;ntildealosa-beats-Vorapin-in-8th-to-retain-WBO-bantam-title GMA NEWS.TV, Peñalosa beats Vorapin in 8th to retain WBO bantam title] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522072715/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/87923/Pe%26ntildealosa-beats-Vorapin-in-8th-to-retain-WBO-bantam-title |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2008, Filipino boxer [[Michael Domingo]] scored a 9th-round [[technical knockout]] victory over Ratanachai Sor Vorapin at the New [[Cebu]] [[Coliseum]] to retain the regional [[World Boxing Organization]] Oriental [[bantamweight]] title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/120247/(Update)-Domingo-TKOs-ex-world-champ-retains-Oriental-title gmanews.tv, Domingo TKOs ex-world champ, retains Oriental title]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philboxing.com/news/story-18981.html philboxing.com, Domingo stops Vorapin]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7178">Surviving texts indicate that there was a belief in '''[[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in [[Germanic paganism]]'''. Examples include figures from [[eddic poetry]] and [[saga]]s, potentially by way of a process of naming and/or through the family line. Scholars have discussed the implications of these attestations and proposed theories regarding belief in reincarnation among the [[Germanic peoples]] prior to [[Christianization]] and potentially to some extent in [[folk belief]] thereafter.

==North Germanic textual mentions==
In the Helgi lays of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', Helgi and his [[valkyrie]] lover are said to have been reborn: in the prose at the end of "[[Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar]]", there is a statement that Helgi Hjörvarðsson and [[Sváva]] were subsequently born again, and at the end of "[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]", that according to "ancient lore" now dismissed as "old women's lying tales", [[Helgi Hundingsbane|Helgi Sigmundsson]] was reborn as [[Helgi Haddingjaskati]] (prince of the [[Haddingjar]]) and [[Sigrún]] as [[Kára|Kara Hálfdanardóttir]].&lt;ref name=Hel139&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Roderick Ellis]], ''The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature'', Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1943, repr. New York: Greenwood, 1968, {{OCLC|311911348}}, p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AR183&gt;[[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]], ''[[Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte]]'', Grundriß der germanischen Philologie 12.1, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1935, rev. ed. 1956, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, {{OCLC|848545556}}, p.&amp;nbsp;183 {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Haddingjar" in: [[John Lindow]], ''Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, 2001, repr. Oxford: Oxford University, 2002, {{ISBN|9780195153828}}, p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;[[Nora Chadwick|N. K. Chadwick]], "Norse Ghosts (A Study in the Draugr and the Haugbúi", ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'' 57.2, June 1946, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1256952  pp.&amp;nbsp;50–65], pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely in "[[Sigurðarkviða hin skamma]]", [[Högni]] expresses the wish that [[Brynhildr]] not be reborn.&lt;ref name=AR183/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hel140&gt;Ellis, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'' version of ''[[Óláfs saga helga]]'', the "[[Þáttr Ólafs Geirstaða Alfs]]" recounts how the dead [[Ólaf Geirstaða Álfr]] gives instructions in a dream for his [[burial mound|barrow]] to be robbed and his body mutilated, and his belt used to ease the birth of a boy who is to be named after him and given his sword and knife; the boy becomes [[Olaf II of Norway]], St. Olaf, and is rumoured among his followers to be the earlier Olaf reincarnated.&lt;ref name=AR183/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 138–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Turville-Petre|E. O. G. Turville-Petre]], ''Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia'', History of Religion, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1964, {{OCLC|606010675}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;193–95: "We can safely say that some people thought that St Ólaf was his older namesake reborn".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nora Chadwick]] suggested that in the older Olaf's name and elsewhere, the [[álfar]] (elves) referred to souls awaiting rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, p. 58 and note&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also mentions in two [[legendary saga]]s of boys being born with the marks of wounds that were dealt to an ancestor: in ''[[Gautreks saga]]'', a poem by [[Starkaðr]] alludes to the marks supposedly on his body from his grandfather's eight arms being torn off by the god [[Thor]],&lt;ref name=Chadwick/&gt; and in one version of ''[[Þórðar saga hræðu]]'', Þórðr is born with a mark on his left arm corresponding to a wound his father had received.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
In "Helgakviða Hundingsbana II", the second Helgi receives his name while sitting on a barrow; King Olaf was named after a man buried in a barrow at the latter's request; and in another tale in ''Flateyjarbók'' and in ''[[Vatnsdæla saga]]'', ''[[Svarfdæla saga]]'' and ''[[Finnboga saga]]'', dead and dying men ask for their names to be passed on, often to future sons of those they are speaking to. [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] saw a connection between name-giving and the idea of rebirth in these passages.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, pp. 139–42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Storm]] proposed this interpretation in an 1893 article;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Storm]], "Vore Forfædres Tro paa Sjælvandring og deres Opkaldelsessystem", ''[[Arkiv för nordisk filologi]]'' (1893) 119–20; cited in Ellis, pp.&amp;nbsp;143–44.&lt;/ref&gt; a study of Icelandic genealogies by Max Keil supported the conclusion but cast into question Storm's idea that there was a change in practice from name-giving using variation to name-giving using repetition, and also distinguished a belief in rebirth from transmigration of souls as it is understood in Eastern religion, involving a progression over a series of lives.&lt;ref name=Keil&gt;Max Keil, ''Altisländische Namenwahl'', Palaestra 176, Leipzig: Mayer &amp; Müller, 1931, {{OCLC|898959310}}; cited in Ellis, pp.&amp;nbsp;142, 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Both scholars noted that a grandfather's name was most commonly re-used—[[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] saw the derivation of the German word for 'grandson', ''Enkel'', from [[Old High German]] ''eninchilî'', 'little grandfather', as support for the idea that a belief in rebirth underlay the custom of skipping one generation in naming&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;—and rarely that of a still living person, and Keil also concluded that what genealogical evidence there is on women suggests the same practice in naming as for men.&lt;ref name=Keil/&gt; [[Sami people|Sami]] customs of naming also rest on a belief that people are reborn into the same family.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas A. DuBois]], ''Nordic Religions in the Viking Age'', The Middle Ages Series, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1999, {{ISBN|9780812217148}}, p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical reports==
In the 2nd century CE, [[Appian]] wrote in his ''Roman History'' that the Teutons had no fear of death because they hoped to be reborn.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in de Vries, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
K. A. Eckhardt, who published a book on the concept of rebirth within the extended family or clan, suggested that the burial position with the legs drawn up against the body emulated the [[fetal position|position of the foetus in the womb]] and was therefore evidence of the belief in rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Karl August Eckhardt, ''Irdische Unsterblichkeit: germanischer Glaube an die Wiederverkörperung in der Sippe'', Studien zur Rechts- und Religionsgeschichte 1, Weimar: Böhlau, 1937, {{OCLC|977866293}}, p.&amp;nbsp;128, cited in de Vries, Volume 1, p.&amp;nbsp;79, note&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock County John Doe''', commonly referred as '''John Clinton Doe''', is the name given to unidentified skeletal remains estimated to be a young adult or teenaged white male, which were found alongside Turtle Creek near [[Clinton (town), Rock County, Wisconsin|Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin]] on November 26, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Find JCD Project |url=http://findjcd.org/|website=findjcd.org|publisher=Jack Friess|date=|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, at the request of law enforcement, the [[DNA Doe Project]] has taken on the case and is in the early stages of their investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Clinton Doe |url=http://dnadoeproject.org/case/john-clinton-doe/ |website=DNA Doe Project |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The nearly complete skeleton was found by a hunting party at approximately 9:00 AM within private property alongside the creek, in a remote, densely wooded 100-acre area owned by the hunters. The skeleton was mostly complete and articulated, lying on its belly, with its hands over the head while the head and back were partially covered by a denim jacket. The body still wore age-fitting clothes{{clarify|date=July 2018}}, save for a shoe, and was located on a steep embankment, ten feet from the creek and four feet from the barbed wire fence of the property.

It was initially estimated that the deceased died in the fall or winter of 1994, about one year before he was found, but recent comparisons with modern [[body farm|forensic facility]] research suggests that he may have died in the summer of 1995, around five months before his discovery.

The cause of death is currently unknown, as no signs of trauma were found on the skeleton: a homicide is deemed unlikely, and no other causes could be determined. Analysis of his hair found no conclusive traces of cocaine, [[codeine]] or morphine, making it unlikely that he had a long-term opioid addiction; however, this does not exclude the possibility that he was intoxicated or that he took hallucinogenic drugs before his death. It is commonly believed that he died from [[hypothermia]] from getting soaked in the creek, perhaps after getting intoxicated and becoming disoriented as a result.

The skull was cremated while the rest of the skeleton was buried in Johnstown Center Cemetery, Rock County, Wisconsin. His DNA and dental records are available.

== Physical description ==

The Caucasian male stood approximately 66&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or between 5 feet 4 inches or (1.65 m) and 5 feet 6 inches (1.70 m). His weight was estimated to be approximately 140&amp;nbsp;lb (64&amp;nbsp;kg). He was estimated to be between 17 and 20 years old. He had straight teeth and seemed to have received good dental care with only one or two fillings, and still had his wisdom teeth, with two having partially [[tooth eruption|erupted]] and one being [[Impacted wisdom teeth|impacted]].

The decedent wore a T-shirt with the trademarked logo of the heavy metal group "[[Venom (band)|Venom]]" on the back, which contains a golden five-pointed star surrounded by a circle with a goat head at the center and the caption "Welcome to hell" and " ©Venom 1987"; gray urban camouflage fatigues of small/medium size; a lined flannel red and green jacket with a plaid design; size medium/34 boxer underwear with a [[Bart Simpson]] design; and a 1993 size 9-1/2 Black Nike Air Bound basketball shoe. Only one of the shoes were found at the site, lying near the skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation #3: John Clinton Doe Clothing Renderings.
|url=http://imgur.com/a/0WLMi|publisher=|date=|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man carried a distinctive pendant made from a dinner fork, shaped like the head of a goat. Other items found with the body were cigarette butts, a Budweiser disposable butane lighter with the caption "Proud to be Your Bud" printed on it, a tube of [[Carmex]] lip balm, and a black Aquatech watch.

His clothes, pendant and hair suggest that he was a heavy metal music aficionado and, as such, familiar with [[Heavy metal subculture|metal subculture]], but investigations in the local metal circles did not bring conclusive results about his identity.

Several facial approximations were publicly released over time. The first reconstruction released by Project Edan in 2013 is currently considered to be inaccurate by authorities. The second reconstruction released in 2014 by the FBI is considered by official agencies to be the most accurate to date, depicting a 20-year-old youth with collar long{{clarify|date=July 2018}}, dark feathery hair and high cheek bones. A third, colored and age-regressed version of the FBI approximation, regressed to approximately age 16, was released to the public in February 2016 to help identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Irizarry|first1=Jaleesa|title=UPDATE: New hope in Rock County cold case|url=http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/New-lead-in-John-Doe-cold-case-266823111.html|accessdate=3 October 2016|agency=[[WMTV]]|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Rock Co. Unidentified John 1995.jpg|thumb|1994 Eyewitness sketch of the man dubbed "River Guy", believed to possibly be the same man as “John Clinton Doe".]]

=== "River Guy" ===

Several witnesses remember seeing, on October 16, 1994 around 5:30 PM, a young man in his early twenties near the same area where the body was found. The man, who was wearing similar clothing as found with John Clinton Doe, was seen running and stumbling in Turtle Creek, visibly intoxicated and distraught. Dubbed "River Guy" by local investigators, he was reported by witnesses to have fallen in the water two or three times, trying to climb up the embankment and yelling at bystanders, telling them to get away from him. He also mentioned being wronged by a woman named Mary and being a fugitive. He was then seen sitting on the creek bank after his ramblings. Contrary to the FBI approximation of JCD, the 1994 police artist facial composite of "River Guy" shows him as having a light beard.

It is commonly believed by those close to the case that River Guy and John Clinton Doe are the same person. However, this hypothesis is challenged by the recent forensic estimations based on body decomposition rates that JCD may have died later than originally determined, as late as May, 1995.  As such this new range of the possible time of death (as late as the spring of 1995) does not correspond as closely with the date of "River Guy" sightings.

=== The pendant ===

In 2010, the distinctive goat pendant was traced by the Rock County Sheriff's detective working the case to a Janesville area craftsman.  Active in the local metal scene, the man claims to have made the pendant as well as sold or given similar items to a dozen people. However none of these people could be traced back as John Clinton Doe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigation #3: John Clinton Doe.|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tKM80cdg4qFNYVOgAedwZcOmZEXIZzj9n_X3Vksmv7w/edit|website=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotopic analysis ===

The '''Santa Compaña''' ("Holy Company") is a deep-rooted [[mythology|myth]]ical belief in rural northwest of [[Iberia]]: [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]] ([[Spain]]) and [[Northern Portugal]].

It is also known under the names of "'''Estadea'''", "'''Estantiga''''" (''estantigua'' in Spanish, from Latin ''hostis antiquus'', meaning "ancient [[:wikt:host|host]]"), "'''Rolda'''", "'''As da nuite'''" (The Night Ones), "'''Pantalla'''", "'''Avisóns'''", "'''Pantaruxada'''"; all of which are terms that denote the presence of the dead in the world of the living. In [[Asturias]] it's prominently well-known as '''Güestia''', which is related to the Asturian word "güeste" (host in English language).

==Description==
Although many different versions of the Santa Compaña can be found, the common belief is that of a [[procession of the dead]] (or a procession of [[soul]]s that are in torment) that wander through the village paths of a parish beginning at midnight wearing white, hooded cloaks. 

The procession is led by a living person (usually a parishioner of a particular church) carrying a [[Christian cross|cross]] or a cauldron of [[holy water]] (sometimes he carries both), followed by several of the souls of the dead holding lit candles. Although these souls are not always seen, it is said{{By whom|date=February 2016}} that the scent of melted wax can be detected on the breeze which appears as they pass to warn of their presence. The living leader of the procession is compelled by a supernatural force (in this case, a mysterious curse) to go out every night and walk by towns, villages and forests; but having no recollection of it the following day. By the same token, because the living person is unaware of what he is doing, there is no chance that he will renounce his duty in leading the Santa Compaña as the curse that forces him to lead the procession puts him into a trance every midnight. The procession ends before daybreak and the living leader of the procession returns to his bed with no memory of what occurred the next morning but feeling very tired and weary as though he did not get adequate rest. He can only be freed of the curse if he manages to come across another person during the procession to carry the cross or the cauldron (or both), as the curse will be passed onto that person. It is said that if the curse leader does not pass the curse onto another person in a matter of weeks, he will eventually grow pale, thin and sickly and eventually die and the curse will be passed onto another parishioner that will unknowingly receive the curse.

To avoid receiving the curse, the person who sees the Santa Compaña pass by must quickly draw "Solomon's Circle" on the ground using chalk (a circle with [[Seal of Solomon]] inside a six-pointed star, which can be changed into a cross) and enter it, or he can also lie face-down until the procession passes. Another way to evade the Santa Compaña is to tie a [[black cat]] in the middle of the Santa Compaña's path and run away quickly from it, or to perform diverse warding symbols with both hands such as the [[corna|horn gesture]] (extending the index and little fingers and to contract the rest of fingers) or the [[List of gestures|fig sign]] (which consists of closing the fist and putting the thumb between the index and middle fingers). The person leading the procession can be a man or a woman—this all depends on whether the [[patron saint]] of the parish is male or female. The Santa Compaña's purpose is to announce death and its primary mission is to visit the homes where death is due.

According to popular belief, apart from the living procession leader, the Santa Compaña can't be seen but can be felt, eliciting a shiver or shudder as it passes, accompanied with a sensation of intense danger. It is also believed that those who can see the Santa Compaña are people who, when baptised by the priest of their parish, were mistakenly anointed with holy oil for the sick instead of chrism. In other versions, it is believed that they are people with special sensibilities who are able to see hidden things. Some people are unable to see the souls in the procession but can see the light of their candles, floating in the air like ignis fatuus or will-o'-the-wisp (similar to the "spook lights" in the rural USA or "jack o'lantern" in the rural UK) as they move along their path.

==Origins==
It may be related to [[Odin]]'s [[Wild Hunt]], or the Welsh [[Hounds of Annwn]] and the Breton Celtic westward processions of the dead to the [[Finistère|End of the World]].

'''Sasha Bordeaux''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was at first primarily associated with [[superhero]] [[Batman]], and she has subsequently evolved an association with [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] in two of its incarnations. Sasha Bordeaux was created by [[Greg Rucka]] and Shawn Martinbrough, and first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #751 (December 2000).&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Sasha Bordeaux | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 58 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===Bodyguard and superhero===
Sasha Bordeaux first appeared as an attractive young martial artist who was hired as Bruce Wayne's [[bodyguard]] by [[Wayne Enterprises|WayneCorp]]'s second in command, [[Lucius Fox]], albeit against Wayne's wishes. Wayne at first tried to avoid her, but she kept on doing her job.

She eventually became suspicious of his constant late-night disappearances and did some searching, and was shocked to find that Bruce Wayne was secretly Batman.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Knowing he couldn't legally fire her for knowing of his [[secret identity]], Batman began training her to become his apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #761 (October 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; After weeks of hard work, she became fit enough to go out with him on patrol in a suit, though he still treated her as a total stranger both as Batman and as Bruce Wayne. During this time, she fell in love with him, even as he insisted on having her around while he dated other women.

===Framed===
One night while Batman and Bordeaux were out on patrol, the assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] lured Wayne's ex-girlfriend [[Vesper Fairchild]] to Wayne Manor and killed her, framing Wayne in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The 10-Cent Adventure'' (March 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Both Wayne and Bordeaux were charged with murder, and Sasha refused to exonerate herself by giving up Wayne's secret despite the fact that they had been patrolling separate areas at the time of the murder and therefore even she couldn't be sure Bruce hadn't killed Vesper.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #766 (March 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; They were both arraigned and held without bail while awaiting trial. After a while, Batman escaped to leave his alter ego behind, leaving Bordeaux inside [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate prison]]. Although Sasha was briefly offered her freedom if she testified against Bruce Wayne— even contemplating taking the deal after Bruce abandoned her— a meeting with [[Alfred Pennyworth]], who had recently returned to Gotham after spending time away, left her resolved to reject the offer. Alfred helped her realize that Bruce had truly valued her work, rather than using her without any thought for herself, as otherwise he would never have allowed her to accompany him as Batman. Batman eventually confronted those who framed him, and Wayne and Sasha were cleared of all charges.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

===Checkmate===
While in prison custody, Sasha was severely wounded by another prisoner and would have died had the government agency [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] not given her medical treatment. They faked her death and offered to give her a new name and identity (complete with [[plastic surgery]]) if she would work for them. With no other options, she agreed.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

Batman tirelessly searched for Sasha, not believing she had died in prison. To facilitate this, he disrupted all of Checkmate's operations in [[Gotham City]]. The group eventually organized a meeting between the two, where Wayne confessed that he loved her. Sasha, though feeling the same way, realized that her new life would prevent them from being together and told him to let her go.

Over time, Bordeaux rose through the ranks of Checkmate to become right hand to [[Maxwell Lord]], the group's leader. Lord later hijacked the Brother I [[satellite]] that Batman had created to monitor all superhuman activity. Brother I itself had recently become sentient due to the actions of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] as a part of his plans for the [[Infinite Crisis]]. He also created an army of [[cyborg]]s known as [[OMACs]] (humans transformed by a virus) programmed to hunt and kill all superhumans and/or specific targets. During his rule, Lord killed all who opposed him, assisted by Brother I who monitored for rebellion. Sasha feigned loyalty to stay alive, but broke the pretense  when Lord killed his former ally [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)]] and ordered Sasha to dispose of his corpse. Filled with hatred for herself and Lord, she sent Kord's trademark goggles to Batman as part of a message detailing Lord's madness.

When Brother I revealed Sasha's betrayal, he sent out an OMAC squad, who found Sasha and Batman in an abandoned warehouse just after they shared a kiss. The OMACs' goal of killing Batman and taking Sasha only partly succeeded, as Batman escaped. Lord, realizing he could not get any information out of Sasha, imprisoned her and brainwashed [[Superman]] in an attempt to kill Batman. To stop this, [[Wonder Woman]] snapped Lord's neck, killing him instantly.

===Cyborg===
With the help of another imprisoned agent, Jessica Midnight (who had attempted to assassinate Lord earlier), Bordeaux escaped and set out to kill Lord, unaware he was already dead. As they were on their way out, an OMAC attacked the two and impaled Bordeaux. This attack somehow activated her latent inner programming, turning her into an OMAC cyborg. However, she retained most of her human features, although her skin now resembled a metallic coating and one of her eye sockets was empty. She also found that she retained her [[will (philosophy)|free will]]; unlike the other OMACs, she was not under Brother I's control. 

With Lord's death, Brother I rechristened itself "Brother Eye" and activated all the remaining OMACs to kill Earth's superhumans. Bordeaux contacted the other various factions of Checkmate who had left when Lord took over, apologizing for Lord and asking them to rejoin.

She then created a [[computer virus]] and hooked herself up to the Brother Eye satellite. The virus, along with a massive electromagnetic pulse blast created by the various superheroes, disabled the majority of the OMACs. Brother I escaped with 200,000 OMACS. 

She later reunited with Batman, who comforted her when she told him she was now a machine.

===Infinite Crisis===

Eventually, with the aid of the [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|new Blue Beetle]], Batman located Brother Eye. He then gathered a team of heroes, including Bordeaux, to attempt to destroy it (''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #5 and #6). The attack sent Brother Eye crashing to Earth, but the satellite's central memory remained intact. With the various superheroes needed elsewhere, Batman tasked Bordeaux with destroying Brother Eye once and for all. Sasha resisted the machine's brainwashing long enough to blow it up. She survived the blast, albeit at the cost of the majority of her OMAC shell.

===One year later===
[[One Year Later|One year after ''Infinite Crisis'']], Bordeaux became the "Black Queen" of the Checkmate organization. In the first issue of the new ''Checkmate'' comic series, she led a group of operatives into a [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] stronghold. As the new series began, Bordeaux was depicted as a cold-blooded killer; it remains to be seen whether this was an aftereffect of her conversion to a cyborg or due to events of [[52 (comics)|the previous year]]. Her "the ends justify the means" attitude towards the success of Checkmate missions put her into conflict with [[Alan Scott]]. She was also in conflict with several of her Checkmate colleagues, particularly [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]], with whom she was romantically involved. As the series progressed, this aspect of her personality was rarely referred to again. In a 2007 story arc involving [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]], Bordeaux suffered extreme torture at the hands of [[Chang Tzu]] who wished to learn more about her cybernetic implants. Although she (barely) survived this encounter, subsequent issues have had her fighting to regain her confidence, especially when the healing process resulted in even more of her body becoming cybernetic.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

In ''[[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]'' (#27, January 2007), Sasha intervened in the trial of [[Wonder Woman]] (for murdering [[Maxwell Lord]]) by secretly delivering exonerating evidence to Wonder Woman's lawyer, [[Kate Spencer]].

===Final Crisis===

During the events of "[[Final Crisis]]", Sasha formed a small resistance team that included [[Snapper Carr]], her current romantic interest [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]], an artificial intelligence, and later the villain [[Cheetah (DC Comics)|Cheetah]]. They caused much damage against the conquering forces of [[Darkseid]], mainly utilizing Snapper's teleportation power. When Sasha was infected by the Anti-Life Formula, the OMAC nanites in her body put her in a coma to prevent the spread of the infection.  After Snapper's powers were neutralized, Mister Terrific realized they had to re-activate all the OMACS that were left. The only way to do this was to revive Sasha and retrieve the OMAC codes from her nanites.  The activation of the OMACs is successful, but the revival caused Sasha's biological processes to shut down.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis: Resist'' (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===JSA vs. Kobra===
In the 2009 miniseries "JSA Vs. Kobra", Mr. Terrific and Dr. Mid-Nite were keeping a comatose Sasha alive via life support in hopes of being able to cure her. By the end of the series, Sasha was restored to life and passionately kissed Mr. Terrific.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA Vs. Kobra'' #6 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This was her last appearance for six years.

===DC Rebirth===
A new interpretation of Sasha debuted in ''Wonder Woman'' volume 3 as part of the [[DC Rebirth]] initiative. In the new continuity, Sasha is a superior to [[Etta Candy]], and is introduced discussing [[Steve Trevor]]'s mission in the African jungle and a nearby sighting of [[Wonder Woman]]. After Etta leaves, she is revealed to be linked to an evil artificial intelligence which is monitoring Sasha and attempting to manipulate Wonder Woman from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Wonder Woman v3 (2016) #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Even before her transformation, Sasha was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and marksman. She was skilled enough that Batman allowed her to serve as a sidekick of sorts.

When [[Chang Tzu]] captured Sasha and studied her,&lt;ref&gt;''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #15 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; he discovered that she had the following abilities:

* "A rough ten-to-twenty percent enhancement over even an Olympic level athlete across the board--in strength, stamina, endurance, speed, dexterity...". During the procedure, she also demonstrated a rapidly increasing tolerance to the sedatives being used to keep her unconscious.
* "(Via Sasha's) ocular implant, the whole of the visual spectrum and more, revealed to you". Earlier in the same storyline, Sasha demonstrated the ability to see in the infrared spectrum.
* "Optimized targeting optics...you must make a terrifyingly accurate sniper..."
* "Body parts encased in the OMAC composite shell...nanobot scabs covering your weaker flesh."

Sasha also has the ability to turn her nanorobotic components on and off at will. They also help her to regenerate from damage she sustains, particularly to those non-biological parts of her body.

'''Secular ethics''' is a branch of [[moral philosophy]] in which [[ethics]] is based solely on human faculties such as [[logic]], [[empathy]], [[Reasoning|reason]] or [[moral intuition]], and not derived from supernatural revelation or guidance—the source of [[ethics in religion|ethics in many religions]]. Secular ethics refers to any ethical system that does not draw on the supernatural, and includes [[humanism]], [[secularism]] and [[freethinking]]. A classical example of literature on secular ethics is the [[Tirukkural|Kural text]], authored by the ancient [[Tamils|Tamil]] [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Thiruvalluvar|Valluvar]] who lived during the 1st century BCE.

Secular ethical systems comprise a wide variety of ideas to include the normativity of [[social contract]]s, some form of attribution of intrinsic moral value, [[ethical intuitionism|intuition-based]] [[deontological ethics|deontology]], cultural [[moral relativism]], and the idea that scientific reasoning can reveal objective moral truth (known as [[science of morality]]).

Secular ethics frameworks are not always mutually exclusive from theological values. For example, the [[Golden Rule]] or a commitment to [[non-violence]], could be [[Golden Rule#Humanism|supported]] by both religious and secular frameworks. Secular ethics systems can also vary within the societal and cultural norms of a specific time period.

==Tenets of secular ethics==
Despite the width and diversity of their philosophical views, secular ethicists generally share one or more principles:{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
*Human beings, through their ability to empathize, are capable of determining ethical grounds.
*The well-being of others is central to ethical decision-making
*Human beings, through [[logic]] and [[reason]], are capable of deriving [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] principles of behavior.
*This may lead to a behavior preferable to that propagated or condoned based on religious texts. Alternatively, this may lead to the advocacy of a system of moral principles that a broad group of people, both religious and non-religious, can agree upon.
*Human beings have the moral responsibility to ensure that societies and individuals act based on these ethical principles.
*Societies should, if at all possible, advance from a less ethical and just form to a more ethical and just form.

Many of these tenets are applied in the [[science of morality]], the use of the scientific method to answer moral questions. Various thinkers have framed morality as questions of empirical truth to be explored in a scientific context. The science is related to [[ethical naturalism]], a type of [[ethical realism]].

In ''How Good People Make Tough Choices: Resolving the Dilemmas of Ethical Living'', [[Rushworth Kidder]] identifies four general characteristics of an ethical code:
::1. It is brief
::2. It is usually not explanatory
::3. Can be expressed in a number of forms (e.g. positive or negative, single words or a list of sentences)
::4. Centers on moral values&lt;ref name="Kidder 2003. 82"&gt;[[#Kid03|Kidder 2003]]. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanist ethics===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ethical naturalism]] --&gt;

[[Humanism|Humanists]] endorse [[Moral universalism|universal morality]] based on the commonality of [[human nature]], and that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our best understanding of our individual and joint interests, rather than stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, therefore rejecting [[faith]] completely as a basis for action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility, thus ultimately eliminating human suffering.

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) is the world-wide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance.

:''Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/node/3253 Humanism's Unfinished Agenda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152317/http://www.iheu.org/node/3253 |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanism is known to adopt principles of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]].

===Secular ethics and religion===
{{see also|Morality#Morality and religion}}

There are those who state that religion is not necessary for moral behavior at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/moral.html Is Atheism Consistent With Morality?], paper (2001) by Mark I. Vuletic&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that compassion and affection are human values independent of religion: "We need these human values. I call these secular ethics, secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0106 Interview with the Dalai Lama], ''The Progressive'' (January 2006), scroll to ''Question'': Apart from Buddhism, what are your sources of inspiration? ''The Dalai Lama'': Human values.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are unhappy with the negative orientation of traditional religious ethics believe that prohibitions can only set the absolute limits of what a society is willing to tolerate from people at their worst, not guide them towards achieving their best.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In other words, someone who follows all these prohibitions has just barely avoided being a criminal, not acted as a positive influence on the world. They conclude that rational ethics can lead to a fully expressed ethical life, while religious prohibitions are insufficient.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

That does not mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]], are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some [[Deists]], prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Examples of secular ethical codes==

===Humanist Manifestos===

The [[Humanist Manifesto]]s are three [[manifestos]], the first published in 1933, that outline the philosophical views and stances of [[humanists]]. Integral to the manifestos is a lack of [[supernatural]] guidance.

===Alternatives to the Ten Commandments===
There are numerous versions of [[Alternatives to the Ten Commandments]]

===Girl Scout law===

The Girl Scout law is as follows:

:I will do my best to be
:::honest and fair,
:::friendly and helpful,
:::considerate and caring,
:::courageous and strong, and
:::responsible for what I say and do,
:and to
:::respect myself and others,
:::respect authority,
:::use resources wisely,
:::make the world a better place, and
:::be a sister to every Girl Scout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/promise_law/|title= The Girl Scout Promise and Law|author= Girl Scouts of the USA|year= 2010|accessdate= 16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Naval Academy honor concept===
"Midshipmen are persons of integrity: They stand for that which is right.
:::They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth is known. '''They do not lie'''.
:::They embrace fairness in all actions. They ensure that work submitted as their own is their own, and that assistance received from any source is authorized and properly documented. '''They do not cheat'''.
:::They respect the property of others and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their own property. '''They do not steal'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usna.edu/OfficerDevelopment/honor/honorconcept.html|title= Officer Development|accessdate= 15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnesota Principles===
The Minnesota Principles were proposed "by the Minnesota Center for Corporate Responsibility in 1992 as a guide to international business activities":

# Business activities must be characterized by fairness. We understand fairness to include equitable treatment and equality of opportunity for all participants in the marketplace.
# Business activities must be characterized by honesty. We understand honesty to include candor, truthfulness and promise-keeping.
# Business activities must be characterized by respect for human dignity. We understand this to mean that business activities should show a special concern for the less powerful and the disadvantaged.
# Business activities must be characterized by respect for the environment. We understand this to mean that business activities should promote sustainable development and prevent environmental degradation&lt;!--sic??--&gt; and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kid03|Kidder 2003]]. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotary Four-Way Test===
[[The Four-Way Test]] is the "linchpin of Rotary International's ethical practice." It acts as a test of thoughts as well as actions. It asks, "Of the things we think, say, or do":

#Is it the truth?
#Is it fair to all concerned?
#Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
#Will it be beneficial to all concerned?&lt;ref name="Kidder 2003. 82"/&gt;

===Military codes===
{{see also|Ranger Creed}}

As the United States Constitution prohibits the establishment of a government religion, US military codes of conduct typically contain no religious overtones.

====West Point Honor Code====
The [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] [[Cadet Honor Code|honor code]] states that "A [[cadet]] will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do." The non-toleration clause is key in differentiating it from numerous other codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usma.edu/committees/honor/info/main.htm|title= Information Paper on "Honor" – A Bedrock of Military Leadership|accessdate= 16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and ethics==
{{See also|Social effect of evolutionary theory | evolutionary ethics}}
Whether or not the relationships between animals found in nature and between people in early human evolution can provide a basis for human morality is a persistently unresolved question. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] wrote in ''Evolution and Ethics'' in 1893 that people make a grave error in trying to create moral ideas from the behavior of animals in nature. He remarked:
{{quote|The practice of that which is ethically best — what we call goodness or virtue — involves a course of conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside, or treading down, all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fellows... It repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence... Laws and moral precepts are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic process.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_nonmoral.html|title=Nonmoral Nature|author=[[Stephen Jay Gould]]|publisher=[stephenjaygould.org]|accessdate=January 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

Famous biologist and writer [[Stephen Jay Gould]] has stated that "answers will not be read passively from nature" and "[t]he factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner". Thus, he concluded that ideas of morality should come from a form of higher mental reason, with nature viewed as an independent phenomenon.&lt;ref name=gould/&gt;

Evolutionary ethics is not the only way to involve nature with ethics. For example, there are [[Ethical realism|ethically realist]] theories like [[ethical naturalism]]. Related to ethical naturalism is also the idea that ethics are best explored, not just using the lens of philosophy, but science as well (a [[science of morality]]).

==Key philosophers and philosophical texts==
===Valluvar===
[[File:இலண்டன் திருவள்ளுவர்.JPG|thumb|left|Valluvar (a theist who wrote a secular text) statue in SOAS, University of London.]]
[[Thiruvalluvar]], a [[Eastern philosophy|South Indian poet-philosopher]] of the pre-Christian era and the author of the [[Tirukkural|Kural]], a non-denominational [[Tamil_language|Classical Tamil]] work on secular ethics and morality, is believed to have lived about the 1st century [[BCE]]. While others of his time chiefly focused on the praise of God, culture and the ruler of the land, Valluvar focused on the moral behaviors of the common individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Holyoake===
[[File:Holyoake2.JPG|thumb|left|126px|Holyoake, agnostic]]
[[George Jacob Holyoake]]'s 1896 publication ''English Secularism'' defines secularism thus:

"Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good."&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, George J. (1896). ''English Secularism.'' Chicago: The Open Court Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holyoake held that secularism should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong [[freethought]] and atheism.  In this he disagreed with [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.

===Nietzsche===
[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|left|126px|Nietzsche, atheist]][[Friedrich Nietzsche]] based his work on ethics on the rejection of [[Christianity]] and [[authority]] in general, or on [[moral nihilism]]. Nietzsche's many works spoke of a [[Master-Slave Morality]], [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]], or something stronger that overcomes the weaker and [[Social Darwinism|Darwinistic]] adaptation and will to live. Nietzsche expressed his moral philosophy throughout his collection of works; the most important of these to secular ethics being ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (in which the famous [[God is dead]] phrase was first used), ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On The Genealogy of Morals]]''.

===Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|126px|Kant, theist (disputably Christian)]]
{{Main article|Kantian ethics}}
On [[ethics]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] wrote works that both described the nature of universal principles and also sought to demonstrate the procedure of their application.  Kant maintained that only a "good will" is morally praiseworthy, so that doing what appears to be ethical for the wrong reasons is not a morally good act.  Kant's emphasis on one's intent or reasons for acting is usually contrasted with the [[utilitarian]] tenet that the goodness of an action is to be judged solely by its results. Utilitarianism is a hypothetical imperative, if one wants _____, they must do ______. Contrast this with the Kantian ethic of the [[categorical imperative]], where the moral act is done for its own sake, and is framed: One must do ______ or alternatively, one must not do ______.

For instance, under Kantian ethics, if a person were to give money to charity because failure to do so would result in some sort of punishment from a god or Supreme Being, then the charitable donation would not be a morally good act.  A dutiful action must be performed solely out of a sense of duty; any other motivation profanes the act and strips it of its moral quality.

===Utilitarianism===
[[File:JohnStuartMill.jpg|thumb|left|126px|[[John Stuart Mill]], developer of [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s utility-based theory]]
{{Main article|Utilitarianism}}
Utilitarianism (from the Latin utilis, useful) is a theory of ethics that prescribes the quantitative maximization of good consequences for a population. It is a form of [[consequentialism]]. This good to be maximized is usually happiness, pleasure, or preference satisfaction. Though some utilitarian theories might seek to maximize other consequences, these consequences generally have something to do with the welfare of people (or of people and nonhuman animals). For this reason, utilitarianism is often associated with the term welfarist consequentialism.

In utilitarianism it is the "end result" which is fundamental (as opposed to Kantian ethics discussed above). Thus using the same scenario as above, it would be irrelevant whether the person giving money to charity was doing so out of personal or religious conviction, the mere fact that the charitable donation is being made is sufficient for it to be classified as ''morally good''.

[[File:Seedbank.jpg|thumb|240px|Seedbank at the USDA Western Regional Plant Introduction Station]]
A '''seed bank''' (also '''seedbank''' or '''seeds bank''') stores [[seed]]s to preserve genetic diversity; hence it is a type of [[gene bank]]. There are many reasons to store seeds. One is to have available the genes that plant breeders need to increase yield, disease resistance, drought tolerance, nutritional quality, taste, etc. of [[crop]]s. Another is to forestall loss of genetic diversity in rare or imperiled plant species in an effort to conserve [[biodiversity]] ex situ. Many plants that were used centuries ago by humans are used less frequently now; seed banks offer a way to preserve that historical and cultural value. Collections of seeds stored at constant low temperature and low moisture are guarded against loss of genetic resources that are otherwise maintained in situ or in field collections. These alternative "living" collections can be damaged by [[natural disaster]]s, outbreaks of disease, or [[war]]. Seed banks are considered [[seed libraries]], containing valuable information about evolved strategies to combat plant stress, and can be used to create genetically modified versions of existing seeds. The work of seed banks spans decades and even centuries. Most seed banks are publicly funded and seeds are usually available for research that benefits the public.

==Storage conditions and regeneration==
Seeds are living creatures and keeping them viable over the long term requires adjusting storage moisture and temperature appropriately. As they mature on the mother plant, many seeds attain an innate ability to survive drying. Survival of these so-called 'orthodox' seeds can be extended by dry, low temperature storage. The level of dryness and coldness depends mostly on the longevity that is required and the investment in infrastructure that is affordable. Practical guidelines from a US scientist in the 1950s and 1960s, James Harrington, are known as 'Thumb Rules.' The 'Hundreds Rule' guides that the sum of relative humidity and temperature (in Fahrenheit) should be less than 100 for the sample to survive 5 years. Another rule is that reduction of water content by 1% or temperature by 10 degrees Fahrenheit will double the seed life span. Research from the 1990s showed that there is a limit to the beneficial effect of drying or cooling, so it must not be overdone.

Understanding the effect of water content and temperature on seed longevity, the Food and Agriculture division of the United Nations and a consultancy group called Bioversity International developed a set of standards for international seed banks&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3704e/i3704e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve seed longevity. The document advocates drying seeds to about 20% relative humidity, sealing seeds in high quality moisture-proof containers, and storing seeds at -20 degrees Celsius. These conditions are frequently referred to as 'conventional' storage protocols. Seeds from our most important species - corn, wheat, rice, soybean, pea, tomato, broccoli, melon, sunflower, etc.—can be stored in this way. However, there are many species that produce seeds that do not survive the drying or low temperature of conventional storage protocols. These species must be stored cryogenically. Seeds of citrus fruits, coffee, avocado, cocoa, coconut, papaya, oak, walnut and willow are a few examples of species that should be preserved cryogenically.

Like everything, seeds eventually degrade with time. It is hard to predict when seeds lose viability and so most reputable seed banks monitor germination potential during storage. When seed germination percentage decreases below a prescribed amount, the seeds need to be replanted and fresh seeds collected for another round of long-term storage.&lt;ref name="HoEl"&gt;Hong, T.D. and R.H. Ellis. 1996. A protocol to determine seed storage behaviour. IPGRI Technical Bulletin No. 1. (J.M.M. Engels and J. Toll, vol. eds.) International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, Rome, Italy. {{ISBN|92-9043-279-9}} [https://www.cbd.int/doc/case-studies/tttc/seedstorage.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
* Knowing what to store in a seed bank is the greatest challenge. Collections must be relevant and that means they must provide useful genetic diversity that is accessible to the public. Collections must also be efficient and that means they mustn't duplicate materials already in collections.
* Keeping seeds alive for hundreds of years is the next biggest challenge. Orthodox seeds are amenable to 'conventional' storage protocols but there are many seed types that must be stored using nonconventional methods. Technology for these methods is rapidly advancing; Local institutional infrastructure may be lacking.

==Alternatives==
[[In-situ conservation]] of seed-producing plant species is another [[Conservation movement|conservation]] strategy. In-situ conservation involves the creation of [[National Park]]s, [[United States National Forest|National Forests]], and [[National Wildlife Refuge]]s as a way of preserving the natural habitat of the targeted seed-producing organisms. In-situ conservation of agricultural resources is performed on-farm. This also allows the plants to continue to evolve with their environment through natural selection.

An [[arboretum]] stores trees by planting them at a protected site.

A less expensive, community-supported [[seed library]] can save local genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-23/classified/ct-sun-garden-0325-seed-lenders-20120323_1_katherine-grover-plants-butterfly-weed | title=Nurturing plant legacies: Two groups lend seeds and plants to gardeners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of seeds remaining [[Dormancy|dormant]] within the [[soil]] is well known and documented (Hills and Morris 1992).&lt;ref name="hills2"&gt;Hills, S.C.; Morris, D.M. 1992. The function of seed banks in northern forest ecosystems: a literature review. Ont. Min. Nat. Resour., Ont. For. Res. Instit., Sault Ste. Marie ON, For. Res. Inf. Pap., No. 107. 25 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed information on the role of such “seed banks” in northern Ontario, however, is extremely limited, and research is required to determine the species and abundance of seeds in the soil across a range of forest types, as well as to determine the function of the seed bank in post-disturbance vegetation dynamics. Comparison tables of seed density and diversity are presented for the [[Taiga|boreal]] and [[deciduous]] forest types and the research that has been conducted is discussed. This review includes detailed discussions of: (1) seed bank dynamics, (2) physiology of seeds in a seed bank, (3) boreal and deciduous forest seed banks, (4) seed bank dynamics and succession, and (5) recommendations for initiating a seed bank study in northern Ontario.

==Longevity==
{{Main article|Oldest viable seed}}
Seeds may be viable for hundreds and even thousands of years. The oldest [[carbon-14]]-dated seed that has grown into a viable plant was a [[Judean date palm]] seed about 2,000 years old, recovered from excavations at the palace of [[Herod the Great]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1122_051122_old_seed.html National Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Russian scientists announced they had regenerated a narrow leaf campion ([[Silene stenophylla]]) from a 32,000-year-old seed. The seed was found in a burrow {{convert|124|ft}} under Siberian [[permafrost]] along with 800,000 other seeds. Seed tissue was grown in [[test tubes]] until it could be transplanted to soil. This exemplifies the long-term viability of [[DNA]] under proper conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-20/32-000-year-old-plant-reborn-from-ancient-fruit-found-in-siberian-ice.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Sarah | last=Frier | title=32,000-Year-Old Plant Reborn From Ancient Fruit Found in Siberian Ice | date=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate Change ==
Conservation efforts such as seed banks are expected to play a greater role as [[climate change]] progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Kate|title=Maximizing the phylogenetic diversity of seed banks|journal=Conservation Biology|date=April 2015|volume=29|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Seed banks offer communities a source of climate-resilient seeds to withstand changing local climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maharjan|first1=Shree|title=Roles and contributions of community seed banks in climate adaptation in Nepa|journal=Development in Practice|date=February 2018|volume=28|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As challenges arise from climate change, community based seed banks can improve access to a diverse selection of locally adapted crops while also enhancing indigenous understandings of plant management such as seed selection, treatment, storage, and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernooy|first1=Ronnie|title=The roles of community seed banks in climate change adaption|journal=Development in Practice|date=April 2017|volume=27|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is designed to survive catastrophes such as [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] and world war. It is operated by the [[Global Crop Diversity Trust]]. The area's [[permafrost]] will keep the vault below the freezing point of water, and the seeds are protected by 1-metre thick walls of steel-reinforced concrete. There are two airlocks and two blast-proof doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/02/09/climate.deep.freeze.reut/index.html?eref=rss_space Work starts on Arctic seed vault]{{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vault accepted the first seeds on 26 February 2008.

* The [[Australian Grains Genebank]] (AGG) is a national center for storing genetic material for Plant breeding and research. The Genebank is in a collaboration with the Australian Seed Bank Partnership on an Australian Crop Wild Relatives project. It is located at Grains Innovation Park, in Horsham, Victoria, Australia, and was officially opened in March, 2014 The primary reason for the bank to be created was the extreme temperatures in the area, up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer time. Because of that they had to ensure the protection of the grains all year around. The Genebank aims to collect and conserve the seeds of Australian crop wild species, that are not yet adequately represented in existing collections.

[[Vice-Admiral]] '''Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet''' (25 February 1714 – 1782) was a British naval commander.

Parker was born at [[Tredington, Warwickshire|Tredington]] (which was then in Worcestershire). His father, a clergyman, was a son of Sir Henry Parker. His paternal grandfather had married a daughter of [[Alexander Hyde]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]]. He began his career at sea in the merchant service. Entering the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of 24, he was made lieutenant in 1744, and in 1748 he was made [[post-captain]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21310?docPos=1 Sir Hyde Parker at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In his royal navy career, he captured a Spanish Galleon that was worth £600,000 .{{efn|£600,000 was the amount when they captured the ship. Nowadays, it would be worth around £106 million.}} This gave his family his wealth. At the current moment, his family live in the south-wing of [[Melford Hall]].

==Seven Years War==

In October 1755 Hyde Parker commissioned the newly-launched [[post ship]] {{HMS|Squirrel|1755|6}}. A year later, in her he captured the French privateeer ''Très Vénėrable''.

During the latter part of the [[Seven Years' War]] he served in the [[East Indies]], taking part in the  [[Siege of Pondicherry (1760)|capture of Pondicherry]] in 1761 and of [[Battle of Manila (1762)|Manila]] in 1762.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In the latter year Parker with two ships [[Action of 2 October 1762|captured one of the valuable]] [[Manila galleon|Spanish plate ships]] in her voyage between [[Acapulco]] and [[Manila]].

==American War of Independence==
In 1778 he became [[Rear-Admiral]] and went to North American waters as second-in-command.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; For some time before [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|George Rodney]]'s arrival he was in command on the [[Leeward Islands]] station, and conducted a skilful campaign against the French at [[Martinique]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1781, having returned home and become [[Vice-Admiral]], he fell in with a Dutch fleet of about his own force, though far better equipped, near the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. After a fiercely contested [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)|battle]], in which neither combatant gained any advantage, both sides drew off. Parker considered that he had not been properly equipped for his task, and insisted on resigning his command.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1782 he accepted the [[East Indies Station|East Indies command]], though he had just succeeded to the family baronetcy.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On the outward voyage his flagship ''Cato'' was lost with all on board.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

He was succeeded by his older son Harry, the sixth Baronet. Parker's second son was Admiral [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]] (1739–1807).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The word ‘dynamics’ appears frequently in discussions and writing about strategy, and is used in two distinct, though equally important senses.

The '''dynamics of strategy and performance''' concerns the ‘content’ of strategy – initiatives, choices, policies and decisions adopted in an attempt to improve performance, and the results that arise from these managerial behaviors.

The '''dynamic model of the strategy process''' is a way of understanding how strategic actions occur. It recognizes that [[strategic planning]] is dynamic, that is, strategy-making involves a complex pattern of actions and reactions. It is partially planned and partially unplanned.

A literature search shows the first of these senses to be both the earliest and most widely used meaning of ‘strategy dynamics’, though that is not to diminish the importance of the dynamic view of the strategy process.

== Static models of strategy and performance ==

The static assessment of strategy and performance, and its tools and frameworks dominate research, 
textbooks and practice in the field. They stem from a presumption dating back to before the 1980s that market and industry conditions determine how firms in a sector perform on average, and the scope for any firm to do better or worse than that average. E.g. the airline industry is notoriously unprofitable, but some firms are spectacularly profitable exceptions.

The ‘industry forces’ paradigm was established most firmly by [[Michael Porter]], (1980) in his seminal book ‘Competitive Strategy’, the ideas of which still form the basis of strategy analysis in many consulting firms and investment companies.
[[Richard Rumelt]] (1991) was amongst the first to challenge this presumption of the power of ‘industry forces’, and it has since become well understood that business factors are more important drivers of performance than are industry factors – in essence, this means you can do well in difficult industries, and struggle in industries where others do well. Although the relative importance of industry factors and firm-specific factors continues to be researched, the debate is now essentially over – management of strategy matters.

The increasing interest in how some businesses in an industry perform better than others led to the emergence of the ‘[[resource based view]]’ (RBV) of strategy ([[Birger Wernerfelt|Wernerfelt]], 1984;  Barney, 1991; [[Robert McQueen Grant|Grant]], 1991), which seeks to discover the firm-specific sources of superior performance – an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.

== The need for a dynamic model of strategy and performance ==

The debate about the relative influence of industry and business factors on performance, and the RBV-based explanations for superior performance both, however, pass over a more serious problem. This concerns exactly what the ‘performance’ ''is'' that management seeks to improve. Would you prefer, for example, (A) to make $15m per year indefinitely, or (B) $12m this year, increasing by 20% a year, starting with the same resources?

Nearly half a century ago, [[Edith Penrose]] (1959) pointed out that superior profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors – who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows – nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant – it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, [[Rugman]] and [[Verbeke]] (2002) have reviewed the implications of this observation for research in strategy. [[Richard Rumelt]] (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.

The essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.

This is not just of theoretical concern, but matters to executives too – efforts by the management of firm B to match A’s profitability could well destroy its ability to grow profits, for example. A further practical problem is that many of the static frameworks do not provide sufficiently fine-grained guidance on strategy to help raise performance. For example, an investigation that identifies an attractive opportunity to serve a specific market segment with specific products or services, delivered in a particular way is unlikely to yield fundamentally different answers from one year to the next. Yet strategic management has much to do from month to month to ensure the business system develops strongly so as to take that opportunity quickly and safely.
What is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory – i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance.

&lt;div style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;[[Image:Why Where How performance over time.png|alt text {20}x{20}px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

==A possible dynamic model of strategy and performance==

To develop a dynamic model of strategy and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most of the relationships on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.
Since a company’s sales clearly change over time, there must be something further back up the causal chain that makes this happen. One such item is ‘customers’ – if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.

The number of ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be calculated from anything else. It is one example of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or statistical observation, but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.
Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time:
* ''Time compression diseconomies'' i.e. it takes time to accumulate resources.
* ''Asset Mass Efficiencies'' ‘the more you have, the faster you can get more’..
* ''Interconnectedness of Asset Stocks'' .. building one resource depends on other resources already in place.
* ''Asset erosion'' .. tangible and intangible assets alike deteriorate unless effort and expenditure are committed to maintaining them
* ''Causal ambiguity'' .. it can be hard to work out, even for the firm who owns a resource, why exactly it accumulates and depletes at the rate it does.

The consequences of these features is that relationships in a business system are highly non-linear. Statistical analysis will not, then, be able meaningfully to confirm any causal explanation for the number of customers at any moment in time. If that is true then statistical analysis also cannot say anything useful about any performance that depends on customers or on other accumulating asset-stocks – which is always the case.

Fortunately, a method known as [[system dynamics]] captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).
The asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the ‘VRIO’ criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability. Yet day-to-day performance must reflect the simple, tangible resources such as customers, capacity and cash. VRIO resources may be important also, but it is not possible to trace a causal path from reputation or product development capability to performance outcomes without going via the tangible resources of customers and cash.

Warren (2002, 2007) brought together the specification of resources [tangible and intangible] and capabilities with the math of system dynamics to assemble a framework for strategy dynamics and performance with the following elements:
* Performance, ''P'', at time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', discretionary management choices, ''M'', and exogenous factors, ''E'', at that time (Equation 1).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(1)	''P''(''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', ''M''(''t''), ''E''(''t'')} &lt;/div&gt;
* The current quantity of each resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'' is its level at time ''t-1'' plus or minus any resource-flows that have occurred between ''t-1'' and ''t'' (Equation 2).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(2)	''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') = ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''t-1'') +/- &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') &lt;/div&gt;
* The change in quantity of ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' between time ''t-1'' and time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t-1'', including that of resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' itself, on management choices, ''M'', and on exogenous factors ''E'' at that time (Equation 3).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(3)	&lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), ''M''(''t-1''), ''E''(''t-1'')} &lt;/div&gt;

This set of relationships gives rise to an ‘architecture’ that depicts, both graphically and mathematically, the core of how a business or other organization develops and performs over time. To this can be added other important extensions, including :
* the consequence of resources varying in one or more qualities or ‘attributes’ [e.g. customer size, staff experience]
* the development of resources through stages [disloyal and loyal customers, junior and senior staff]
* rivalry for any resource that may be contested [customers clearly, but also possibly staff and other factors]
* intangible factors [e.g. reputation, staff skills]
* capabilities [e.g. product development, selling]

== The Static Model of the Strategy Process ==

According to many introductory strategy textbooks, strategic thinking can be divided into two segments : strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation is done first, followed by implementation.

Strategy formulation involves:
# Doing a situation analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
# Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. This involves crafting vision statements (long term), mission statements (medium term), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.
#  These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to obtain these goals.
This three-step strategy formation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.

The next phase, according to this linear model is the implementation of the strategy. This involves:
* Allocation of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, computer system support)
* Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as [[cross-functional team]]s)
* Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
* Managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and  making adjustments to the process as necessary.
* When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes

==The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process==

Several theorists have recognized a problem with this static model of the strategy process: it is not how strategy is developed in real life.  Strategy is actually a dynamic and interactive process. Some of the earliest challenges to the planned strategy approach came from [[Charles Lindblom|Linblom]] in the 1960s and [[James Brian Quinn|Quinn]] in the 1980s.

[[Charles Lindblom]] (1959) claimed that strategy is a fragmented process of serial and incremental decisions. He viewed strategy as an informal process of mutual adjustment with little apparent coordination.

[[James Brian Quinn]] (1978) developed an approach that he called "logical incrementalism". He claimed that strategic management involves guiding actions and events towards a conscious strategy in a step-by-step process. Managers nurture and promote strategies that are themselves changing. In regard to the nature of strategic management he says: "''Constantly integrating the simultaneous incremental process of strategy formulation and implementation is the central art of effective strategic management''." (page 145). Whereas Lindblom saw strategy as a disjointed process without conscious direction, Quinn saw the process as fluid but controllable.

Joseph Bower (1970) and [[Robert Burgelman]] (1980) took this one step further. Not only are strategic decisions made incrementally rather than as part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.

[[Henry Mintzberg]] (1978) made a distinction between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy. Emergent strategy originates not in the mind of the strategist, but in the interaction of the organization with its environment. He claims that emergent strategies tend to exhibit a type of convergence in which ideas and actions from multiple sources integrate into a pattern. This is a form of [[organizational learning]], in fact, on this view, organizational learning is one of the core functions of any business enterprise (See [[Peter Senge]]'s ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990).)

[[Constantinos Markides]] (1999) describes strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and [[reform]]ation.

A particularly insightful model of strategy process dynamics comes from [[J. Moncrieff]] (1999). He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned, though whether the resulting performance is better for being planned or not is unclear. The unplanned element comes from two sources : “emergent strategies” result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and “Strategies in action” are ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization. These multitudes of small actions are typically not intentional, not teleological, not formal, and not even recognized as strategic. They are emergent from within the organization, in much the same way as “emergent strategies” are emergent from the environment. However, it is again not clear whether, or under what circumstances, strategies would be better if more planned.

In this model, strategy is both planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. Five general processes interact. They are strategic intention, the organization's response to emergent environmental issues, the dynamics of the actions of individuals within the organization, the alignment of action with strategic intent, and strategic learning.

The alignment of action with strategic intent (the top line in the diagram), is the blending of strategic intent, emergent strategies, and strategies in action, to produce strategic outcomes. The continuous monitoring of these strategic outcomes produces strategic learning (the bottom line in the diagram). This learning comprises feedback into internal processes, the environment, and strategic intentions.  Thus the complete system amounts to a triad of continuously self-regulating feedback loops. Actually, quasi self-regulating is a more appropriate term since the feedback loops can be ignored by the organization. The system is self-adjusting only to the extent that the organization is prepared to learn from the strategic outcomes it creates. This requires effective leadership and an agile, questioning, corporate culture. In this model, the distinction between strategy formation and strategy implementation disappears.

==Criticisms of Dynamic Strategy Process Models==

Some detractors claim that these models are too complex to teach. No one will understand the model until they see it in action. Accordingly, the two part linear categorization scheme is probably more valuable in textbooks and lectures.

Also, there are some implementation decisions that do not fit a dynamic model. They include specific project implementations. In these cases implementation is exclusively tactical and often routinized. Strategic intent and dynamic interactions influence the decision only indirectly.

'''Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit''' ({{lang-th|วิภาวดีรังสิต}}; {{RTGS|''Wiphawadi Rangsit''}}; 20 November 1920 – 16 February 1977), née '''Princess Vibhavadi Rajani''' ({{lang-th|วิภาวดี รัชนี}}; {{RTGS|''Wiphawadi Ratchani''}}) is a Thai writer and a member of the [[Thailand|Thai]] [[royal family]] well known for her fiction writing and her developmental work in rural Thailand.

She was killed by communist insurgents while on a routine visit to assist rural villagers in [[Surat Thani Province]].

==Early life==
Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit was born on 20 November 1920. She is the eldest daughter of [[Bidyalongkorn|Rajani Chamcharas, Prince Bidyalongkorn]] and Princess Phonphimonphan Rajani (''née'' Princess Phimonphan Voravan). She had a sibling, [[Bhisadej Rajani|Prince Bhisadej Rajani]].

The princess was educated at the [[Mater Dei School (Thailand)|Mater Dei School]], Bangkok. After completing her secondary education, she worked as a secretary for her father, who at the time was one of the most respected poets of the [[Rattanakosin era]] and wrote under the pseudonym '''No. Mo. So.''' (NMS; {{lang|th|นมส.}}). Princess Vibhavadi inherited her father's gift for writing and displayed her ability as early as age of fourteen, when she began writing children's novels. She was well known by her pen-name '''V. na Pramuanmarg''' ({{lang|th|ว. ณ ประมวญมารค}} ''Wo Na Pramuanmak''). Her famous first novel, ''Prisana'' ({{lang|th|ปริศนา}} ''Pritsana''), was written when she was eighteen and was followed by two sequels and many other novels, some of them historical.

==Marriage==
Princess Vibhavadi Rangsit married Prince Piyarangsit Rangsit ({{lang|th|ปิยะรังสิต รังสิต}}), eldest son of [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat and Elisabeth Scharnberger, on 6 May 1946. They were the only couple married by King [[Ananda Mahidol]] (Rama VIII). She had two daughters:
# ''Mom Rajawongse'' Vibhananda Rangsit ({{lang|th|วิภานันท์ รังสิต}} ''Wiphanan Rangsit'')
# ''Mom Rajawongse'' Priyanandana Rangsit ({{lang|th|ปริยนันทนา รังสิต}} ''Priyananthana Rangsit'')

==Work==
In addition to a full writing career, the princess worked for King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and Queen [[Sirikit]] of Thailand. In 1957, she began accompanying them when they toured the country and was appointed a [[lady-in-waiting]] to the queen when they went on their first [[state visit]] abroad in 1960. Princess Vibhavadi accompanied them on seven occasions, visiting twenty-five countries.

The last ten years of her life were dedicated to rural development in [[southern Thailand]] under the direction and sponsorship of the king. Her involvement began when the monarch asked her to go to a remote area called [[Amphoe Phrasaeng|Phrasaeng]] in [[Surat Thani Province]]. From that initial visit in 1967, she was committed to the development of neglected areas and the improvement of the villagers' living standards. Sponsored by the king, she led a medical team on many missions to distribute medical supplies, schooling equipment, blankets, and other necessities to villagers in remote and almost inaccessible parts of the South.

==Death==
Princess Vibavadi often visited soldiers and Border Patrol Police stationed in areas where there was communist [[insurgency]]. On the morning of 16 February 1977, she set off on what should have been a routine visit to villages and to boost the morale of troops at [[Amphoe Wiang Sa, Surat Thani Province|Wiang Sa District]] in Surat Thani. While flying to her destination in an army [[helicopter]], she heard a [[radio]] message saying two Border Patrol Policemen had been wounded by a [[landmine]]. She immediately ordered the flight diverted to pick up the wounded men and rush them to a hospital. As they flew at low altitude over Ban Nua Khlong, the helicopter was attacked from the ground by communist insurgents. A burst of heavy [[machine gun]] fire crippled the helicopter and seriously wounded the princess. She died one hour later.

Prior to her royally sponsored [[cremation]] at Ratchabophit Temple, on 4 April 1977, "in recognition of her services to the country and the people", the king elevated her to the higher royal rank of Phra Chao Worawongse Ther Phra Ong Chao (Her Royal Highness) and awarded her the highest level of the most Illustrious Order of the House of [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]]

==Legacy==
February 16 is now known in Surat Thani as Vibhavadi Day, and civil and religious ceremonies are held in her honour. Vibhavadi Rangsit Highway, which connects [[Don Mueang International Airport]] with Bangkok, was named for the beloved princess.

Her husband, Prince Piya Rangsit, founded the [[Vibhavadi Rangsit Foundation]] to ensure the continuity of her charitable work in the southern provinces.

[[Vibhavadi Rangsit Road]], which runs from [[Phaya Thai District]] in [[Bangkok]] to [[Lam Luk Ka District]] in [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathumthani]] was also named in her honour.

'''Willem Leonard Oltmans''' (10 June 1925 – 30 September 2004) was a Dutch [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] and author who did not hesitate to pro-actively intervene in international politics.

Due to the highly critical and opposite stance he often took towards Dutch global politics, as of 1956 the Dutch government conspired to keep him out of work. A lengthy lawsuit (1991–2000) involving the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Royal family]] led to the state having to pay him damages. An erudite orator, the straightforward and uncompromising Oltmans was a striking character in Dutch society.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/oltmans |title=Biography at the 'Netherlands Institute of History' (ING) |publisher=Inghist.nl |date= |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Early life==
Oltmans was born into a wealthy family with roots in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. During the Second World War he was a member of the Dutch Resistance. "We blew up a German train," Oltmans told the Dutch daily ''Reformatorisch Dagblad'' in 2003&lt;ref name="digibron.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibron.nl/search/detail.jsp?sourceid=1011&amp;uid=00000000012dc9f4df844b61e76bbf93&amp;docid=0 |first=Jaap |last=de Wreede |title=Publicist Willem Oltmans kan het dwarsliggen niet laten |work=Reformatorisch Dagblad |date=24 May 2003 |publisher=Digibron.nl |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hitler called me a terrorist, but I saw myself as a freedom fighter."

He studied at the prestigious [[Nyenrode Business University]] (1946) and [[Yale University]] (1948), without graduating. Originally intent on a career with the diplomatic corps of the foreign service, he ended up working in press offices in the Netherlands (1953–1955). He married in 1955 and worked as a freelance reporter in Rome in 1956. There he befriended Indonesian president [[Sukarno]], which started his remarkable career as a controversial journalist.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;

Convinced that a well connected and informed individual could play a decisive role in the international political arena, he assumed a pro-active part in global political developments, becoming both a news reporter and news maker.

==Dutch state conspiracy==
[[File:Willem Oltmans (1973).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Willem Oltmans in 1973]]
Against the will of the Dutch government, Oltmans interviewed [[Indonesia]]n president [[Sukarno]] in 1956. Once he became a confidant of Sukarno and part of his inner circle he took it upon himself to convince the broader public in the Netherlands of the legitimacy of Sukarno's viewpoints. In 1957 he pleaded for the transfer of [[Dutch New Guinea]] to Indonesia while in Indonesia. He claimed to have prevented a Dutch war against Indonesia over New Guinea by sending a memo to US president Kennedy. Subsequently [[Joseph Luns]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, covertly tried everything to sabotage Oltmans' career, with considerable success: for a long time, Oltmans was forced to live off welfare. Luns, who now had become Oltmans' [[wikt:nemesis|nemesis]], called him a 'one engine mosquito'. In 1995 Oltmans published his book ''My friend Sukarno''.

He fought a long lawsuit (1991–2000) against the Dutch state, which he eventually won. In 2000 a commission awarded him eight million guilders (four million dollars) in damages, after taxes. Having paid two million guilders in lawyer's fees, Oltmans bought a penthouse on a canal in Amsterdam and a Steinway piano.

==Kennedy conspiracy==
[[File:Willem Oltmans 2004.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Willem Oltmans during his last public performance at the [[Universiteit Maastricht]] (22 April 2004)]]

Oltmans was based in the USA in the 1960s, where he worked as a reporter for Dutch TV broadcaster [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] and established ties to President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s closest circle of advisors.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt; After Kennedy was assassinated in [[Dallas]] in 1963, Oltmans interviewed the mother of accused assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], Marguerite. Further investigation led him to Oswald's acquaintance [[George de Mohrenschildt]]. In 1977 De Mohrenschildt agreed to disclose information to Oltmans, but disappeared from their meeting place and was found dead in Florida a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boekenroute.nl/gasten/gtn1Auteur.aspx?AuteurID=6359 |title=Oltmans, Willem '&amp;#39;"Reportage over de Kennedy-moordenaars."'&amp;#39; (1977) |publisher=Boekenroute.nl |date=30 April 1990 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 1977, De Mohrenschildt was found dead due to apparent self-inflicted shotgun blast to the mouth.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Examiner; March 30, 1977"&gt;{{cite news |date=March 30, 1977 |title=A Mystery Suicide: A Key Oswald Witness; Friend Reported to Have Known of Death Plot |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/White%20Assassination%20Clippings%20Folders/Warren%20Commission%20Folders/Warren%20Commission-Reopening/Item%20268.pdf |work=San Francisco Examiner |location=San Francisco |agency=UPI |page=1 |access-date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Richardson Preyer]] of the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigating the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of Kennedy]] stated that De Mohrenschildt was "crucial witness, based on the new information that he had".&lt;ref name="San Francisco Examiner; March 30, 1977"/&gt; A few days later, Oltmans told the HSCA that de Mohrenschildt had implicated himself in the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. And Pat S. Russell, who was De Mohrenschildt's attorney said "I definitely feel there was a conspiracy and that definitely was the opinion of George."&lt;ref&gt;"Lawyer Says Texan Told Him Oswald Had Aid in '63 Plot", ''The New York Times'', April 3, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Oltmans testified for three hours behind closed doors and told the committee that De Mohrenschildt told him he had discussed the assassination of Kennedy with Lee Harvey Oswald from A to Z. "De Mohrenschildt told me that Oswald acted at his (De Mohrenschildt's) instructions and that he knew Oswald was going to kill Kennedy," Oltmans said.&lt;ref&gt;"Journalist tells of JFK Plots", The Ledger (Lakeland, Florida), April 4, 1977"&lt;/ref&gt; Although Oltmans had given information to the Committee shortly before, De Mohrenschildt's death had released Oltmans from his promise not to divulge certain information. Oltmans revealed that De Mohrenschildt, whom he had known for ten years, had told him that there had been a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and that he had played a role in the conspiracy. De Mohrenschildt said that CIA and FBI personnel were involved as well.&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane |first=Mark |title=The Mysterious Death of a Key JFK Witness |publisher= Gallery Magazine |date= November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oltmans played the role of De Mohrenschildt in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film about the assassination, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/jfkcameooltmans.html |title=Article about Oltmans cameo in the movie on the JFK website |publisher=Jfk-online.com |date= |accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Soviet Union==
In the 1980s Oltmans endeavoured to create a more balanced opinion in the West about the [[Soviet Union]]. Looking for a more poised perspective on the one sided bad image of the [[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]'s communist power, he often traveled to Russia. Together with the Kremlin's foreign expert [[Georgi Arbatov]], he wrote the book 'The Soviet position', elaborating on Moscow's perspective on the East-West issues in 1981. The book received much attention and was published in several languages.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;

==In Suriname==
Also in the '80s, Oltmans actively interfered with the [[postcolonial]] Dutch-Suriname relationship. He recognised a bilateral relationship based in negative sentiments similar to the Dutch-Indonesian relationship. Intent on playing a mediating role Oltmans traveled to [[Suriname]] to interview military dictator [[Bouterse]]. He published a book that was banned in Suriname and misunderstood in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;

==In South Africa==
Due to the ban imposed on him by Minister Luns, Oltmans was forced to help support himself through his family's inheritance; the death of his parents (1966 and 1974) and some bad investments caused him financial difficulty. In the late eighties he intended to use his large global network as a consultant to introduce entrepreneurs to Eastern European business opportunities. Through a string of quarrels with his stakeholders this initiative failed completely and Oltmans left for [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;

Both his brothers had settled in South Africa in 1948. He had visited the country regularly and in 1990 decided to settle there permanently. In South Africa he continued his tendency of actively intervening in local politics. His investigative reporting was not appreciated by the shaky South African regime of the time and in August 1992 he was deported on charges of espionage. Oltmans always insisted the Dutch Security Service was involved in his deportation.&lt;ref name="inghist.nl"/&gt;
