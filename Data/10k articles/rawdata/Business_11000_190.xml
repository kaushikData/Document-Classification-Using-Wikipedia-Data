'''45 Broad Street''' is a [[skyscraper]] under construction in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States.&lt;ref name="Plitt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2016/1/6/10849252/planned-1100-foot-86-story-tower-will-rise-at-45-broad-st|title=Planned 1,100-Foot, 86-Story Tower Will Rise at 45 Broad St.|last=Plitt|first=Amy|date=6 January 2016|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building will become Downtown's tallest residential tower.

==History and construction==
A proposal dating to 2008 planned a [[Nobu|Nobu Hotel]] for the site, which was backed by [[Robert De Niro]]. The building, a conventional glass [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]], would have contained a retail base, 128 hotel rooms, and 77 "super-luxury" condominiums above the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.curbed.com/2008/5/8/10571232/nobu-hotel-like-its-patrons-will-be-tall-skinny|title=Nobu Hotel, Like its Patrons, Will be Tall &amp; Skinny|last=Arak|first=Joey|date=8 May 2008|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned Nobu Hotel would have been 62 stories and 709 feet in height, but the proposal was derailed due to the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkyimby.com/2014/01/45-broad-street-for-sale.html|title=For Sale: 45 Broad Street|last=Fedak|first=Nikolai|date=21 January 2014|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the parcel was placed on the market, and Madison Equities finalized their acquisition of the land in October of that year.&lt;ref name=YIMBYfirms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkyimby.com/2015/10/developers-close-on-45-broad-street-plan-65-story-condo-tower-financial-district.html|title=Developers Close On 45 Broad Street, Plan 65-Story Condo Tower, Financial District|last=Wilson|first=Reid|date=26 October 2014|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMS Acquisitions is also an investor in the project, and the building will be constructed by firm Pizzarotti-IBC.&lt;ref name=YIMBYfirms/&gt;

Real estate site 6sqft released early renderings of the new plans for the site in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.6sqft.com/revealed-45-broad-street-slated-to-be-among-the-highest-condo-buildings-downtown/|title=REVEALED: 45 Broad Street, Slated to Be Among the Highest Condo Buildings Downtown|last=Hylton|first=Ondel|date=5 January 2016|publisher=6sqft|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the renderings, Pizzarotti-IBC Rance MacFarland confirmed that the new structure would be a supertall, residential skyscraper catering to "entry- and mid-level buyers".&lt;ref name="Plitt"/&gt; More developed renderings were published by ''[[The Real Deal (magazine)|The Real Deal]]'' in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therealdeal.com/2016/02/26/revealed-madison-equities-45-broad-street-condo-tower/|title=Revealed: Madison Equities’ 45 Broad condo tower|last=Clarke|first=Katherine|date=26 February 2016|publisher=The Real Deal|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the New York real estate industry have expressed doubts that Madison will recoup costs, and the company has faced difficulty receiving funding for the project.&lt;ref name=trdmay&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/robert-gladstones-risky-business/|title=Robert Gladstone’s risky business|last=Clarke|first=Katherine|date=1 May 2017|publisher=The Real Deal|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties are in part due to the site's proximity to the New York Stock Exchange and the high-level security around that building.&lt;ref name=trdmay/&gt;  However, the anticipated pricing of units in the building at just under $1 million up to $4 million has attracted additional investors including Gemdale (one of China's largest developers) given the softening super-luxury market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therealdeal.com/2016/06/20/chinese-company-partners-to-build-45-broad/|title=Chinese company partners with Madison Equities to build 45 Broad condo|last=Brenzel|first=Kathryn|date=20 June 2016|publisher=The Real Deal|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Construction work on the foundation began in April 2017,&lt;ref name=trdmay/&gt; and excavation began in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/05/excavation-begins-for-45-broad-street-downtowns-first-residential-supertall.html|title=Excavation Begins For 45 Broad Street, Downtown’s First Residential Supertall|last=Nelson|first=Andrew|date=9 May 2018|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subway elevators===
In July 2016, it was announced that the [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] had approved the construction of two new subway elevators outside the entrance to the building, available for public use. They will connect to the existing Broad Street [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J/Z]] subway [[Broad Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|station]]. The design of the elevators is being overseen by Urbahn Architects, although they did not design the associated building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkyimby.com/2016/07/45-broad-street-supertall-coming-with-new-subway-elevators-financial-district.html|title=45 Broad Street Supertall Coming with New Subway Elevators, Financial District|last=Bindelglass|first=Evan|date=28 July 2016|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's City Council approved the construction of the elevators in July 2018, and granted the developers 71,391 additional square feet in zoning rights in exchange for building the elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therealdeal.com/2018/07/05/city-council-approves-70k-sf-bonus-for-madison-equities-fidi-supertall/|title=City Council approves 70K sf bonus for Madison Equities’ FiDi supertall|last=Brenzel|first=Kathryn|date=5 July 2018|publisher=The Real Deal|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and amenities==
The building will be mixed-use with 245 residences and a five-story retail base with 62,000 square feet dedicated to commercial-retail use and 93,900 square feet dedicated to a school. Amenities in the building will include a fitness center with a pool, an outdoor garden, and several lounges.  Windbreak levels will puncture the façade on the 27th and 43rd floors. The two floors will have 32-foot tall ceilings made open for terrace space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2018/05/excavation-begins-for-45-broad-street-downtowns-first-residential-supertall.html|title=Excavation Begins For 45 Broad Street, Downtown’s First Residential Supertall|last=Nelson|first=Andrew|date=9 May 2018|publisher=YIMBY|accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The building is being designed by [[CetraRuddy]], which also designed [[One Madison]], and is being built by &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2018/05/04/blue-glass-pleated-khaki-facades-new-york-stone-concrete-brick-skyscrapers/|title=New York architects ditch "default" glass facades for brick, stone and copper|last=Gibson|first=Eleanor|date=4 May 2018|publisher=DeZeen|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's bronze aluminum cladding and its distinctive crown will make it one of the first so-called Neo Art Deco skyscrapers being built in New York City.

The '''American Express Building''', also known as '''65 Broadway,''' is a building between Morris and Rector Streets in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was built in 1914-1917 and was designed by [[James L. Aspinwall]] of the firm of [[Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell|Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Tucker]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]]. The 21-story building goes through to [[Trinity Place]], and was the headquarters of [[American Express]] until 1975.&lt;ref name=nycland&gt;{{cite nycland}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The building is now sometimes called the '''Standard &amp; Poors Building''', but should not be confused with another building using that name at [[Cunard Building (New York City)|25 Broadway]]. This Class A office building has 10 elevators, is [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified, and qualifies for the Lower Manhattan Energy Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://42floors.com/ny/new-york/65-broadway|publisher=Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, Joshua Gosin|title=65 Broadway|date=January 2014|accessdate=2014-01-23}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">The '''British Arrows''' (formerly the '''British Television Advertising Awards (BTAA)''') is an advertising awards body in London, which honours the best moving image advertising in the UK. 

Founded in 1976, the AWARDS show, held in March, awarded advertising agencies and production companies across a number of categories. Special awards including Advertising Agency of the Year, Production Company of the Year and Commercial of the Year were also awarded. In 1996 the CRAFT AWARDS, held in November, were founded, honouring the best craftspeople in advertising and awarded individuals across a number of categories, including Director, Editing and Casting. Special awards including Best Crafted Commercial of the Year were also awarded. For each show a Chair of the Jury is selected by the Board of Directors. The Chair then curates their own Jury from a range of disciplines who watch and discuss all commercials entered at a private cinema in Soho before voting. 

In 2017, after 40 years of AWARDS and 20 years of CRAFT, the two shows were combined to create The British Arrows 2017, held in May at Battersea Evolution.

'''&lt;u&gt;BOARD OF DIRECTORS&lt;/u&gt;''' 

The British Arrows is overseen by a Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board is Charlie Crompton, [[Rogue Films]]. 

The current list of Board of Directors are Alice Tonge, Andy Gulliman, Ben Priest, Chris Bovill &amp; John Allison, Chris O'Reilly, Clare Donald, Dave Monk, Davud Karbassioun, Francine Linsey, Jane Bolton, KJ Weir, Lee Pavey, Lindsey Clay, Lizie Gower, Mark Benson, Orlando Wood, Robin Shenfield, Sally Campbell and Tony Davidson.

'''&lt;u&gt;GLOBAL TOUR&lt;/u&gt;''' 

The [[Walker Art Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Greta Cunningham]] |coauthors= |title=Awards honor offbeat TV ads |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2003/12/05_cunninghamg_brit/ |quote=For the 27th year, the Walker Art Center will present the British Television Advertising Awards. The screenings draw more than 10,000 Minnesotans each year and are almost always sold out. Audiences get to see the best of British advertising, from campaigns featuring a male streaker to avant-garde ads for hot noodles and automobiles. The annual event showcases a collision of art and commerce. MPR's Greta Cunningham talked with [[Peter Bigg]], the administrator for the awards, who says this year's selections come in a variety of themes. |work=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |date=December 5, 2003 |accessdate=2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began screening the British Television Advertising Awards in 1986, when the program was part of a tour that was facilitated by the BTAA and the Film Department of the Museum of Modern Art.  Walker had a strong interest in advertising and design and had been screening the Clio Awards for many years, so there was a natural curiosity about foreign commercials. Major companies such as Target, Best Buy and General Mills are based in the Twin Cities and bring creative teams over to screenings, as do other advertising agencies like Fallon.  Watching the awards in a cinematic setting provides a unique communal screening experience that has broadened the program to a general audience of Anglophiles, film students, and the press who attend annually.

In December each year, over 27,000 people attend over 88 screenings of the latest British Arrows Awards showreel at Walker each year.  It’s a much-loved program in the Twin Cities with many people attending year after year.  The audiences are moved by the program, which can be a unique cross cultural experience, as they try to figure out brands and products that are not available in the U.S., but are cleverly conveyed.  It’s a unique experience for American audiences to view ads that are not invested in the hard sell; rather, gaining interest in products and services through humor, pathos and a dynamic cinematography. Each year a member of the British Arrows board attends the presentation, introduces the program on the opening night and handles interviews on TV, radio and the press.

Alongside the Walker Art Center the British Arrows Awards has also been screened at the Cincinnati World Cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincyworldcinema.org/x_161014baa.php|title=CWC :: British Arrows 2016|website=www.cincyworldcinema.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Cleveland Cinematheque]], [[Hong Kong Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkac.org.hk/en/calendar.php?id=1837|title=Hong Kong Arts Centre calendar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Memphis Brooks Museum of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.overtonpark.org/events/british-arrows-awards-at-brooks-museum|title=British Arrows Awards at Brooks Museum {{!}} Overton Park|website=www.overtonpark.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Milwaukee Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2015/09/29/milwaukee-film-festival-british-arrows-awards/|title=Milwaukee Film Festival: British Arrows Awards|last=Jannene|first=Jeramey|website=Urban Milwaukee|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts Houston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/event/british-arrows-2015-7993021|title=British Arrows 2015|website=Houston Press|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Northwest Film Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nwfilm.org/films/2015-british-arrows-awards/|title=2015 British Arrows Awards {{!}} NW Film Center|date=2016-04-26|work=NW Film Center|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Smith San Rafael Film Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfstation.com/2014-british-arrows-award-e2247861|title=2014 British Arrows Award|website=www.sfstation.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, The Institute of Contemporary Art Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icaboston.org/events/2016-british-arrows|title=2016 British Arrows {{!}} icaboston.org|website=www.icaboston.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Wisconsin Film Festival]] and [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ybca.org/whats-on/british-arrows-awards-2016|title=YBCA: British Arrows Awards 2016|website=www.ybca.org|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] [[Industrial park|Industrial Area]] is the industrial subdivision located in southern [[Saskatoon]]. It is also known as '''South Saskatoon''', after the CN rail siding located in the area. It is a part of the [[Nutana SDA, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Nutana]] Suburban Development Area. This industrial park was established with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway crossing the [[South Saskatchewan River]].

C.N. Industrial is bisected by [[Circle Drive]], which directly links to all major highways entering the city, and is also connected directly to the Idylwyld Freeway, which links to downtown Saskatoon.

This neighbourhood on the east side of Saskatoon is not to be confused with the [[Canadian National Railway]] (C.N.) Yards Management Area located on Chappell Drive in the [[Confederation SDA, Saskatoon|Confederation SDA]] of Saskatoon's west side. These two sides of Saskatoon are connected with the [[Grand Trunk Bridge (Saskatoon)|Grand Trunk Bridge]] or CN railway bridge over the [[South Saskatchewan River]].

==Geography==
[[File:C.N. Industrial, Saskatoon.JPG|thumb|left|CN railway tracks]]
CN Industrial is bordered to the south by [[The Willows, Saskatoon]], on the north by Idylwyld Drive and [[Avalon, Saskatoon|Avalon]].  [[Stonebridge, Saskatoon|Stonebridge]] is to the east, and [[Saskatchewan Highway 219|Sk Hwy 219]] to the west. Diefenbaker management area and the South Saskatchewan River are west of the CN Industrial area. The [[auto mall]] is a newer part of the CN Industrial area east of Portage Avenue to Clarence Avenue. There is a new interchange at Clarence Avenue and Idylwyld Drive to provide easier access to the area.

The [[Grand Trunk Bridge (Saskatoon)]] or CN Bridge crosses the [[South Saskatchewan River]] between the [[Queen Elizabeth Power Station]] on the upstream (west) side and Diefenbaker Park on the downstream (east) side. The train bridge commenced construction work in 1906 with rail line service beginning on September 21, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Wonder City| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://olc.spsd.sk.ca/de/stoon100pics/photogallery/bridges.htm| doi =| accessdate =2008-05-12| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080224093557/http://olc.spsd.sk.ca/de/stoon100pics/photogallery/bridges.htm| archivedate =2008-02-24| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A southwest extension of [[Circle Drive]], which opened in July 2013, passes through C.N. Industrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=City of Saskatoon · Departments · Infrastructure Services ... |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/municipal_engineering/river_crossings/index.asp |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807185211/http://city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/municipal_engineering/river_crossings/index.asp |archivedate=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to businesses in C.N. Industrial is facilitated via an interchange at Lorne Avenue, but the area is now split into two sections with Jasper Avenue no longer crossing Circle Drive.

==Economy==
[[Image:AutomallCNIndustrial.jpg|thumb|Auto mall]]
Some of the major employers in this area are Early Seed and Feed, Roadex Services, Ltd., and Speedway Moving &amp; Storage. The Saskatoon Auto Mall, which opened on the east side of C.N. Industrial in the early 2000s, includes Saturn, Mini, Sherwood, Chevrolet, and BMW auto dealers, most of whom relocated to the auto mall from locations along 8th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition, retail development has occurred on the west side of Clarence Avenue south of Brand Road in the wake of development of the Stonebridge commercial hub to the east and new residential communities beyond it. The city's detachment of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] relocated to C.N. Industrial from its previous location on 8th Street East in the 2000s.

The hall has not had a resident company since 1962, when the [[New York Philharmonic]] moved to [[Lincoln Center]]'s [[Avery Fisher Hall|Philharmonic Hall]] (renamed Avery Fisher Hall in 1973 and David Geffen Hall in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Thomasini|authorlink=Anthony Tommasini|title=Music: Lang Lang opens Philharmonic Season as Avery Fisher Hall is Renamed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/arts/music/review-lang-lang-opens-philharmonic-season-as-avery-fisher-hall-is-renamed.html?_r=0|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie Hall has 3,671 seats, divided among its three auditoriums.

==Venues==
Carnegie Hall contains three distinct, separate performance spaces.

===Main Hall (Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage)===
[[File:Carnegie-hall-isaac-stern.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac Stern Auditorium]]
The Isaac Stern Auditorium seats 2,804 on five levels and was named after violinist [[Isaac Stern]] in 1997 to recognize his efforts to save the hall from demolition in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite web| title=The A to Z of Carnegie Hall: S is for Stern| url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/BlogPost.aspx?id=4294989134| date=September 23, 2013| publisher=Carnegie Hall| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hall is enormously high, and visitors to the top balcony must climb 137 steps. All but the top level can be reached by elevator.&lt;ref name="bronx.worldweb.com"&gt;{{cite web| title=Information: Accessibility| url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Information/Accessibility/| publisher=Carnegie Hall| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main hall was home to the performances of the [[New York Philharmonic]] from 1892 until 1962. Known as the most prestigious concert stage in the U.S., almost all of the leading classical music and, more recently, popular music performers since 1891 have performed there. After years of heavy wear and tear, the hall was extensively renovated in 1986 (see below).

The Ronald O. Perelman Stage is 42 feet deep. The five levels of seating in the Stern Auditorium begin with the Parquet level, which has twenty-five full rows of thirty-eight seats and four partial rows at stage level, for a total of 1,021 seats. The First Tier and Second Tier consist of sixty-five boxes; the First Tier has 264 seats at eight seats per box and the Second Tier seats 238, with boxes ranging from six to eight seats each. Second from the top is the Dress Circle, seating 444 in six rows; the first two rows form an almost-complete semicircle. At the top, the balcony seats 837. Although seats with obstructed views exist throughout the auditorium, only the Dress Circle level has structural columns.&lt;ref name=rentals&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Stern Auditorium-Perelman Stage Rentals|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Rentals/Stern-Auditorium-Perelman-Stage-Rentals/|accessdate=May 5, 2015|ref=rentals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zankel Hall===
Zankel Hall, which seats 599, is named after Judy and Arthur Zankel. Originally called simply Recital Hall, this was the first auditorium to open to the public in April 1891. Following renovations made in 1896, it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was leased to the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in 1898, converted into a cinema, which opened as the [[Carnegie Hall Cinema]] in May 1961 with the film ''[[White Nights (1957 film)|White Nights]]'' by [[Luchino Visconti]] and was reclaimed for use as an auditorium in 1997. The completely reconstructed Zankel Hall is flexible in design and can be reconfigured in several different arrangements to suit the needs of the performers. It opened in September 2003.&lt;ref name="nyt_20000130"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|authorlink=David W.

The 599 seats in Zankel Hall are arranged in two levels. The Parterre level seats a total of 463 and the Mezzanine level seats 136. Each level has a number of seats which are situated along the side walls, perpendicular to the stage. These seats are designated as boxes; there are 54 seats in six boxes on the Parterre level and 48 seats in four boxes on the Mezzanine level. The boxes on the Parterre level are raised above the level of the stage. Zankel Hall is accessible and its stage is 44 feet wide and 25 feet deep—the stage occupies approximately one fifth of the performance space.&lt;ref name=zankelrental&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Zankel Hall Rental|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Rentals/Hall-Rentals/|accessdate=May 5, 2015|ref=zankelrental}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weill Recital Hall===
The Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall seats 268 and is named after [[Sanford I. Weill]], a former chairman of the board, and his wife Joan. This auditorium, in use since the hall opened in 1891, was originally called Chamber Music Hall (later Carnegie Chamber Music Hall); the name was changed to Carnegie Recital Hall in the late 1940s, and finally became Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall in 1986.

The Weill Recital Hall is the smallest of the three performance spaces, with a total of 268 seats. The Orchestra level contains fourteen rows of fourteen seats, a total of 196, and the Balcony level contains 72 seats in five rows.&lt;ref name=weilhall&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Weill Recital Hall|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Information/Weill-Recital-Hall/|accessdate=May 5, 2015|ref=weillhall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other facilities===
The building also contains the Carnegie Hall Archives, established in 1986, and the [[Rose Museum]], which opened in 1991. Until 2009 studios above the Hall contained working spaces for artists in the performing and graphic arts including music, drama, dance, as well as architects, playwrights, literary agents, photographers and painters. The spaces were unusual in being purpose-designed for artistic work, with very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. In 2007 the Carnegie Hall Corporation announced plans to evict the 33 remaining studio residents, some of whom had been in the building since the 1950s, including celebrity portrait photographer [[Editta Sherman]] and fashion photographer [[Bill Cunningham (American photographer)|Bill Cunningham]]. The organization's research showed that Andrew Carnegie had always considered the spaces as a source of income to support the hall and its activities. The space has been re-purposed for music education and corporate offices.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite news| first=Wendy| last=Goodman| title=Great Rooms: Bohemia in Midtown| url=http://nymag.com/homedesign/greatrooms/42385/| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| date=December 30, 2007| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pressler&gt;{{cite news| first=Jessica| last=Pressler| title=Editta Sherman, 96-Year-Old Squatter| url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/10/editta_sherman_96-year-old_squ.html| work=New York| date=October 20, 2008| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Carnegie Hall exterior, NYC IMG 3937.JPG|thumb|Closeup view of Carnegie Hall]]

Carnegie Hall is one of the last large buildings in New York built entirely of masonry, without a steel frame; however, when several flights of studio spaces were added to the building near the turn of the 20th century, a steel framework was erected around segments of the building. The exterior is rendered in narrow [[Roman brick]]s of a mellow ochre hue, with details in [[terracotta]] and [[brownstone]]. The foyer avoids typical 19th century Baroque theatrical style with the Florentine Renaissance manner of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[Pazzi Chapel]]: white plaster and gray stone form a harmonious system of round-headed arched openings and Corinthian [[pilaster]]s that support an unbroken [[cornice]], with round-headed [[lunette]]s above it, under a vaulted ceiling. The famous white and gold auditorium interior is similarly restrained. The firm of [[Adler &amp; Sullivan]] of Chicago, noted for the acoustics of their theaters, were hired as consultant architects though their contributions are not known.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Andrew Carnegie, three-quarter length portrait, seated, facing slightly left, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Andrew Carnegie, 1913]]
Carnegie Hall is named after [[Andrew Carnegie]], who funded its construction. It was intended as a venue for the [[Oratorio Society of New York]] and the [[New York Symphony Society]], on whose boards Carnegie served. Construction began in 1890, and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company. Although the building was in use from April 1891, the official opening night was May 5, with a concert conducted by maestro [[Walter Damrosch]] and great [[Russian people|Russian]] composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carnegiehall.org/ch/pages/1-3-1-3-1-3-1.aspx?pageid=4294981013|title=Tchaikovsky in America|publisher= Carnegie Hall official website|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968416|title=1891 Andrew Carnegie’s new Music Hall opens|publisher=|access-date=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528220247/http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968416#|archive-date=May 28, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally known simply as "Music Hall" (the words "Music Hall founded by Andrew Carnegie" still appear on the façade above the marquee), the hall was renamed Carnegie Hall in 1893 after board members of the Music Hall Company of New York (the hall's original governing body) persuaded Carnegie to allow the use of his name. Several alterations were made to the building between 1893 and 1896, including the addition of two towers of artists' studios, and alterations to the smaller auditorium on the building's lower level.

[[File:Carnegie Hall in 1895.jpg|thumb|Carnegie Hall in 1895]]
[[File:Carnegiehall 1910.jpg|thumb|Carnegie Hall in 1910]]

The hall was owned by the Carnegie family until 1925, when Carnegie's widow sold it to a real estate developer, Robert E. Simon. When Simon died in 1935, his son, [[Robert E. Simon, Jr.]], became owner. By the mid-1950s, changes in the music business prompted Simon to offer Carnegie Hall for sale to the New York Philharmonic, which booked a majority of the hall's concert dates each year. The orchestra declined, since it planned to move to [[Lincoln Center]], then in the early stages of planning. At the time, it was widely believed that New York City could not support two major concert venues. Facing the loss of the hall's primary tenant, Simon was forced to offer the building for sale. A deal with a commercial developer fell through, and by 1960, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] on the move to Lincoln Center, the building was slated for demolition to make way for a commercial skyscraper. Under pressure from a group led by violinist [[Isaac Stern]] and many of the artist residents, special legislation was passed that allowed the City of New York to buy the site from Simon for $5 million (which he would use to establish [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]), and in May 1960 the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation was created to run the venue. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web| url={{NHLS url|id=66000535}}| first=Richard| last=Greenwood| title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Carnegie Hall| date=May 30, 1975| publisher=[[National Park Service]]| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{cite web| url={{NHLS url|id=66000535|photos=y}}| title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Carnegie Hall—Accompanying Photos| date=May 30, 1975| publisher=National Park Service| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the greatest performers of classical music since the time Carnegie Hall was built have performed in the Main Hall, and its lobbies are adorned with signed portraits and memorabilia. The [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]], frequently recorded in the Main Hall for [[RCA Victor]]. On November 14, 1943, the 25-year old [[Leonard Bernstein]] had his major conducting debut when he had to substitute for a suddenly ill [[Bruno Walter]] in a concert that was broadcast by [[CBS]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:1943 Nov 14 NYPhil Bernstein.jpg|Playbill]] and [[:File:1943 Nov 14 NYPhil Bernstein.ogg|CBS announcement]], concert on November 14, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; making him instantly famous. In the fall of 1950, the orchestra's weekly broadcast concerts were moved there until the orchestra disbanded in 1954. Several of the concerts were televised by NBC, preserved on [[kinescope]]s, and have been released on home video.

Many legendary jazz and popular music performers have also given memorable performances at Carnegie Hall including [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Billy Eckstine]], [[At Carnegie Hall (Dave Brubeck Quartet album)|the Dave Brubeck Quartet]], [[Violetta Villas]], [[Judy at Carnegie Hall|Judy Garland]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[James Gang]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], all of whom made celebrated live recordings of their concerts there.

The hall has also been the site of many famous lectures, including the [[Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture]] by [[Booker T. Washington]], and the last public lecture by [[Mark Twain]], both in 1906.

[[Sissieretta Jones]] became the first African-American to sing at the Music Hall (renamed Carnegie Hall the following year), June 15, 1892.&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Maureen D.|title=Sissierettta Jones, "The Greatest Singer of Her Race," 1868–1933|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hudson&gt;{{cite web| title=From Opera, Minstrelsy and Ragtime to Social Justice: An Overview of African American Performers at Carnegie Hall, 1892–1943| url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=perspectives/opera-minstrelsy-and-ragtime-social-justice-overview-african-american-performers-carneg |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |last=Hudson |first=Rob |publisher=The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Benny Goodman Orchestra gave a [[The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert|sold-out swing and jazz concert]] January 16, 1938.

Rock and roll music first came to Carnegie Hall when [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] appeared in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1955/05/07/85693342.pdf| title=Stars assist the blind| work=The New York Times| date=May 7, 1955| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when [[The Beatles]] performed two shows&lt;ref name=happened&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beatles at Carnegie Hall|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/the-beatles-at-carnegie-hall-1964-02-12|work=It All Happened – A Living History of Live Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their historic first trip to the United States.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news| title=2,900-Voice Chorus Joins The Beatles| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/02/13/97379541.pdf| first=John S.| last=Wilson| work=The New York Times| date=February 13, 1964| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter [[Sid Bernstein]] convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue "would further international understanding" between the United States and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Schaffner&gt;{{cite book| first=Nicholas| last=Schaffner| title=The Beatles Forever| location=New York| publisher=Fine Communications| date=July 1977| page=14| isbn=978-1567310085}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Led Zeppelin]] became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the [[Rolling Stones]] tore the place up some five years ago."

[[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]] performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album ''What You Hear is What You Get''. [[The Beach Boys]] played concerts in 1971 and 1972, and two songs from the show appeared on their ''[[Endless Harmony Soundtrack]]''. [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] recorded its 4-LP box set ''[[Chicago at Carnegie Hall]]'' in 1971.

===Renovations and additions===
The building was extensively renovated in 1986 and 2003, by [[James Polshek]], who became better known through his post-modern [[planetarium]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Polshek and his firm, [[Polshek Partnership]], were involved since 1978 in four phases of the Hall's renovation and expansion including the creation of a Master Plan in 1980; the actual renovation of the main hall, the Stern Auditorium, and the creation of the Weill Recital Hall and Kaplan Rehearsal Space, all in 1986;&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Hall: Timeline—1986 Full interior renovation completed |publisher=Carnegie Hall |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968843}}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of the Rose Museum, East Room and Club Room (later renamed Rohatyn Room and Shorin Club Room, respectively), all in 1991; and, most recently, the creation of Zankel Hall in 2003.&lt;ref name="nyt_20000130" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_20030912" /&gt;

The renovation was not without controversy. Following completion of work on the main auditorium in 1986, there were complaints that the famous acoustics of the hall had been diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sounds in the night |first=Michael |last=Walsh |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963548-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=February 16, 1987 |volume=129 |issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although officials involved in the renovation denied that there was any change, complaints persisted for the next nine years. In 1995, the cause of the problem was discovered to be a slab of concrete under the stage. The slab was subsequently removed.&lt;ref name=Kozinn&gt;{{cite news |last=Kozinn |first=Alan |title=A Phantom Exposed: Concrete at Carnegie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/us/a-phantom-exposed-concrete-at-carnegie.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=September 14, 1995 |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carnegie Hall Tower.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Carnegie Hall Tower]]
In 1987–1989, a 60-floor office tower, named [[Carnegie Hall Tower]], designed by [[César Pelli]] &amp; Associates, was completed next to the hall on the same block. New backstage space and banquet spaces, contained within the tower, connect with the main Carnegie Hall building.

In June 2003, tentative plans were made for the Philharmonic to return to Carnegie Hall beginning in 2006, and for the orchestra to merge its business operations with those of the venue. However, the two groups abandoned these plans later in 2003.&lt;ref name=Billboard&gt;{{cite news |title=N.Y.

In 2014, Carnegie Hall opened its Judith and Burton Resnick Education Wing, which houses 24 music rooms, one of which is large enough to hold an orchestra or a chorus. The $230 million project was funded with gifts from [[Sanford I. Weill|Joan and Sanford I. Weill]] and the Weill Family Fund, Judith and Burton Resnick, [[Lily Safra]] and other donors, as well as $52.2 million from the city, $11 million from the state and $56.5 million from bonds issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York.&lt;ref name=Cooper2014&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cooper |date=September 12, 2014 |title=Carnegie Hall Makes Room for Future Stars: Resnick Education Wing Prepares to Open at Carnegie Hall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/arts/music/resnick-education-wing-prepares-to-open.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015–2016 Season celebrates a 125th Anniversary and the launch of an unprecedented commissioning project of at least 125 new works with 'Fifty for the Future" coming from Kronos (25 by female composers and 25 by male composers.)

===Management===
Since July 2005, the Executive and Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall is Sir [[Clive Gillinson]], formerly managing director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

===Carnegie Hall Archives===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
Unexpectedly, for most concert-goers, it emerged in 1986 that Carnegie Hall had never consistently maintained an archive. Without a central repository, a significant portion of Carnegie Hall's documented history had been dispersed. In preparation for the celebration of Carnegie Hall's centennial in 1991, the management established the Carnegie Hall Archives.

===Carnegie Hall joke===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rumor is that a pedestrian on Fifty-seventh Street, Manhattan, stopped Jascha Heifetz and inquired, "Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?" "Yes," said Heifetz. "Practice!"&lt;ref name=Cerf&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Bennett Cerf| last=Cerf| first=Bennett| title=The Life of the Party: A New Collection of Stories and Anecdotes| location=Garden City, New York| publisher=Doubleday| year=1956| page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This old joke has become part of the folklore of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. According to ''The New York Times'', the main player in the story has been described at various times as either an unnamed man, violinist [[Jascha Heifetz]] or the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/nyregion/29fyi.html| work=The New York Times| first=Michael| last=Pollak| title=The Origins of That Famous Carnegie Hall Joke| date=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its webpage, Carnegie Hall quotes the wife of violinist [[Mischa Elman]] as having perhaps the best story of its origin: "One day, after a rehearsal that hadn’t pleased Elman, the couple was leaving Carnegie Hall by the backstage entrance when they were approached by two tourists looking for the hall’s entrance. Seeing his violin case, they asked, 'How do you get to Carnegie Hall?' Without looking up and continuing on his way, Elman simply replied, 'Practice.'"&lt;ref name=Joke&gt;{{cite web| title=History FAQ: Who created the "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?" joke?| url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/History-FAQ/| publisher=Carnegie Hall| accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances==
The hall's operating budget for the 2008–2009 season was $84&amp;nbsp;million. For 2007–2008, operating costs exceeded revenues from operations by $40.2&amp;nbsp;million. With funding from donors, investment income and government grants, the hall ended that season with $1.9&amp;nbsp;million more in total revenues than total costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">A '''Certified Quality Auditor (CQA)''' is a professional that knows and employs the standards and principles associated with [[audit]]ing. A CQA is capable of using various evaluation techniques to identify a [[Operations management#Production_systems|production system]]'s{{dn|date=August 2018}} strengths and weaknesses in [[quality control]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asq.org (Retrieved June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[quality audit]] is a process that involves the systematic identification and examination of a production quality system. A Certified Quality Auditor must analyze all elements of a quality system and assess its degree of adherence to the applicable industry criteria. This is described in detail in Russell.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-87389-847-8 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal CQA certification is given by the [[American Society for Quality]] (ASQ).
Each CQA certification candidate needs to pass a [[multiple choice]] examination that focuses mostly on auditing practices, and measures comprehension of the ASQ Body of Knowledge (BOK), covering:

* Auditing Basics
* Process of auditing
* [[Auditor]] competencies
* Audit program and [[business application]]s
* Quality tools and techniques

'''Corporate tax in France''' deals with the [[tax]] payable in [[France]] on the profits earned by companies. In general, any company is subject to 33.3% [[corporate tax]] (''Impôt sur les Sociétés'') on its worldwide profits. However, certain items of income are exempt from tax and certain costs are non-deductible. Furthermore, the tax rate is planned to be reduced to 28% by 2020. Net corporate tax revenues in 2016 amounted to 30 billion euros (after tax credits &amp; deductions).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.performance-publique.budget.gouv.fr/sites/performance_publique/files/files/documents/ressources_documentaires/SMB/2016/situation_mensuelle_budget_etat_31122016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of profits==
A company is subject to French corporate tax on profits generated in France, in addition to any profit allocated to France by virtue of international [[Tax treaty|tax treaties]], after taking into account tax deductible costs.

==Tax base==

{{Empty section|date=December 2017}}

==Rate==
The 2017 French corporate tax rate was 15% of the taxable income up to and including €38,120, 28% up to €75,000 and above which the rate is 33.3%.

By 2020, the whole taxable income of all companies will be taxed at 28%.

On 7 November 2017 the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]] approved a new corporate tax.&lt;br&gt;
Business with more than €1 billion in sales a year are subject to pay a tax rate with 38.3% instead of 33.3%. If a firm makes more revenue than €3 billion the rate will be 43.3 %.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/frankreich-nationalversammlung-beschliesst-sondersteuer-fuer-konzerne-15281155.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax credits==
In 2012 a new [[tax credit]] was introduced to make France more competitive. Companies get a tax credit of 7% of total wage &amp; salary costs&lt;ref&gt;https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/international-professionnel/tax-incentives#CETC&lt;/ref&gt; up to a limit of 2.5 times the minimum salary (in 2017 the minimum salary was €1,460). The effect is to substantially reduce the effective rate of corporation tax. The tax credit amounts to 19 billion euros&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gouvernement.fr/en/the-cice-gains-momentum&lt;/ref&gt; (about 40% of gross corporate tax take). 

==Allowances==
Certain items of income are exempt from corporate tax:

* Research Tax Credit
* Innovative start-ups
* New Business
* Higher depreciation allowance scheme

'''Costimator''' is an American-based series of [[Cost Estimating software]] developed by Thomas Charkiewicz in 1982 and is designed to model manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=128|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software is designed, developed and marketed by MTI of [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield, MA.]]

== History ==

Costimator was designed by Thomas Charkiewicz, a former machinist and manufacturing manager who studied computer-aided manufacturing at the [[University of Massachusetts]]. Costimator was released in late 1982,&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt; designed to model manufacturing costs.

In 2002, [[IBM]] bought Costimator OEM from MTI Systems, Inc.&lt;ref name="amazon_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=132|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the products on the market focused on machine shop operations. Costimator had its roots in the machining industry, but later branched out to include several other manufacturing processes.

John Kagan, the former manager of PC Cost Management at IBM and [[Lenovo]] estimated that between 2003 and 2004, IBM saved more than $10 million using Costimator.&lt;ref name="amazon_a" /&gt;

Costimator also includes a function known as IQ builder which customers can use to model their own manufacturing process based on historical data. The data was derived from the company’s customers in addition to various independent industry sources. Labor costs come from the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smock|first=Douglas|title=On-Demand Supply Management: World Class Strategies, Practices, and Technology|year=2007|publisher=J. Ross Publishing|isbn=1932159622|pages=133|url=https://www.amazon.com/On-demand-Supply-Management-World-class-Strategies/dp/1932159622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, MTI Systems, Inc. reached an agreement with European distributor Premier Manufacturing Solutions, LTD (Stockport, UK) to market its flagship products Costimator OEM and Costimator JS to companies throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_apr_09.html|url=http://www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_apr_09.html|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Cimtronics and MTI Systems, Inc. also agreed to terms on a distribution partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTI Systems Announces Channel Agreement with Cimtronics|url=http://www.mtisystems.com/press_room/press_releases/press_Mar_11_1.html|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Anderson Hatfield''' (September 9, 1839 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1921)—known as '''Devil Anse Hatfield'''—was the [[patriarch]] of the Hatfield clan during the infamous [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] which has since formed part of American [[folklore]]. Devil Anse survived the feud and agreed to end it in 1891.

==Biography==
Hatfield was born in East Virginia{{what|date=August 2018}} (now [[Logan, West Virginia]]), the son of Ephraim Hatfield, of [[Kilpin|English]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genfan.com/getperson.php?personID=I20327&amp;tree=MASTER&lt;/ref&gt; and Nancy Vance of Scots-Irish descent. His nickname "Devil Anse" has a variety of supposed origins: it was given to him by his mother; by [[Randolph McCoy]]; earned from his bravery during battle in the [[American Civil War]]; or as contrast to his good-tempered cousin, Anderson "Preacher Anse" Hatfield.&lt;ref name="Alther"/&gt;

A [[Southern United States|Southern]] sympathizer, Hatfield enlisted in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. He was commissioned a First Lieutenant of Cavalry in the Virginia State Line in 1862, a group made to protect the territory along the Kentucky-Virginia border where resident loyalties to the North and South were mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarprofiles.com/devil-anse-hatfield-fights-his-first-border-war/|title=Devil Anse Hatfield Fights His First Border War  |last=Lively|first= Mathew W. |publisher=''Civil War Profiles'' |date=March 25, 2013  |accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia State Line eventually disbanded in 1863 and Hatfield enlisted as a private in the newly formed 45th Battalion Virginia Infantry, before being appointed first lieutenant and later captain of Company  B. His unit spent most of its time patrolling the border area against bushwhackers sympathetic to the Union as well as engaging in guerrilla warfare against Union soldiers. Devil Anse himself has been connected to battles and killings of several Union fighters, including trackers Ax and Fleming Hurley in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, William. ''Virginia at War, 1863''. University Press of Kentucky; 1st edition (December 5, 2008). pp. 70-71. {{ISBN|978-0813125107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devil Anse and his uncle Jim Vance would later form a [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighting unit called the "Logan Wildcats."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libby-genealogy.com/hatfield-mccoy.htm Hatfield - McCoys&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.libby-genealogy.com&lt;/ref&gt; One of the group's victims was Union General Bill France; killed in revenge for losing one of their members to France's unit.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/12/true-story-real-feud-hatfields-mccoys/|title=THE REAL FEUD BETWEEN THE HATFIELDS AND MCCOYS |last=Blitz|first=Matt |publisher=''Today I Found Out'' |date=December 29, 2014 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, he was suspected of having been involved in the murder of his rival Asa Harmon McCoy, who had fought for the [[Union Army]] and was waylaid by The Wildcats on his return home. Hatfield had been home ill at the time of the killing, which was probably committed at the instigation of his uncle, Jim Vance. This may have sparked the beginning of the notorious feud between the two families that claimed many lives on both sides.

Devil Anse was the patriarch leader during the Hatfield-McCoy feud. His family and Randolph McCoy's fought in one of the bloodiest and most well-known feuds in American history.&lt;ref name=History.com&gt;{{cite web|last=History.com|title=The Hatfield and McCoy Feud|url=http://www.history.com/shows/hatfields-and-mccoys/articles/the-hatfield-mccoy-feud|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental during the execution of McCoy boys Tolbert, Pharmer and Bud, as well as being present during the Battle of Grapevine Creek before most of his sons and friends were arrested for the murder of the McCoys.

Hatfield was baptized on September 23, 1911 in [[Island Creek (West Virginia)|Island Creek]] by William Dyke ''"Uncle Dyke"'' Garrett and converted to [[Christianity]] (he had maintained a largely agnostic or anti-institutional view of religion prior to this conversion). He went on to found a Church of Christ congregation in West Virginia.&lt;ref name="Alther"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lisa |last=Alther |year=2012 |title=Blood Feud: The Hatfields and the McCoys: The Epic Story of Murder and Vengeance |publisher=[[Globe Pequot]] |isbn=0762785349}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an uncle of the eventual [[Governor of West Virginia]], and [[United States Senator]], [[Henry D. Hatfield]].

=== Marriage and children ===
William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield married Levisa "Levicy" Chafin (December 20, 1842 – March 15, 1929), the daughter of Nathaniel Chafin and Matilda Varney, on April 18, 1861 in Logan County, West Virginia (then Virginia). Their 13 children were:

===Death===
Hatfield died on Thursday, January 6, 1921 in Stirrat, Logan County, West Virginia at the age of 81 of [[pneumonia]] at his home along Island Creek.  He is buried in the [[Hatfield Cemetery (Sarah Ann, West Virginia)|Hatfield Family Cemetery]] along [[West Virginia Route 44]] in southern [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]]. His grave is topped by a life-sized statue of himself made of Italian marble.  Levicy outlived her husband by eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKim|first=Sean|title=Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=3061&amp;PIpi=45987443|publisher=Find A Grave, Inc. |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her great nephew was the infamous anti coal Miners Union/Political boss Sheriff [[Don Chafin]].

==In popular culture==
Hatfield was portrayed by actor [[Kevin Costner]] in the miniseries ''[[Hatfields &amp; McCoys (miniseries)|Hatfields &amp; McCoys]]''.

[[File:Dole Air Race Miss Doran (8091694562).jpg|thumb|Mildred Doran]]
The '''Dole Air Race''', also known as the '''Dole Derby''', was a tragic [[air race]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from northern California to the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in August 1927. Of the 15–18 airplanes entered, eleven were certified to compete but three crashed before the race, resulting in three deaths. Eight eventually participated in the race, with two crashing on takeoff and two going missing during the race. A third, forced to return for repairs, took off again to search for the missing and was itself never seen again. In all, before, during, and after the race, ten lives were lost and six airplanes were total losses. Two of the eight planes successfully landed in Hawaii.

==The Dole prize==
[[File:James Drummond Dole.jpg|thumb|James D Dole]]Inspired by [[Charles A. Lindbergh]]'s successful trans-Atlantic flight, [[James D. Dole]], the [[Hawaii]] [[pineapple]] magnate, put up a prize of US$25,000 for the first fixed-wing aircraft to fly the {{convert|3870|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from [[Oakland, California]], to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], and US$10,000 for second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dole Derby|url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/aviation-photos/1920-1929/dole-derby/ha_photo_album_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C=|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The transpacific record===
The first transpacific flight had already taken place, twice over. On 28 June, about a month after Dole posted the prizes, [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] Lieutenants [[Lester J. Maitland]] and [[Albert F. Hegenberger]] flew a three-engine [[Bird of Paradise (aircraft)|Atlantic-Fokker C-2]] military aircraft from [[Oakland International Airport|Oakland Municipal Airport]] to [[Wheeler Army Airfield]] on [[Oahu]] in 25 hours and 50 minutes. [[Ernie Smith (aviator)|Ernie Smith]] and Captain C.H. Carter had arrived earlier for the attempt, but due to mechanical difficulties, took off two hours after Maitland, and returned with a broken windshield. Carter quit after the record was lost, but Smith hired [[Emory Bronte]] as a navigator, and the ''City of Oakland'', a small [[Travel Air 5000]] civilian monoplane, took off again on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Plane and Pilot|date=July 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon running out of fuel 26 hours and 36 minutes later, they crash-landed in a thorn tree on [[Molokai]]. Dole disqualified both of them from his prizes because they did not land in Honolulu (the Air Corps flight had been planned months prior to the prize announcement and had no intent to land other than at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler]]).

===The Dole Air Derby===
[[image:Matson Building &amp; Annex (San Francisco).jpg|100px|right|thumb|The draw started at the Matson Building.]]
An early entrant was Richard Grace, a Hollywood stunt pilot who shipped his plane to San Francisco shortly after wrecking his Cruzair in a Kauai to San Francisco attempt in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=GRACE TO FLY IN DOLE RACE. Hawaii-California Flier Who Crashed to Enter Competition|date=7 July 1927|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draw for starting position in the Dole race was held on 8 August in the office of [[C. W. Saunders]], California director of the [[National Aeronautics Association]], in the Matson Building in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].

Two days after the draw, [[United States Navy]] Lieutenants [[George W. D. Covell]] and [[R. S. Waggener]] took off from [[San Diego, California]] in their [[Tremaine Humming Bird]] ''Spirit of John Rodgers'' to fly to Oakland, flew into a fog bank, crashed into an ocean cliff at [[Point Loma]], and died.&lt;ref name="aerofiles Ti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aerofiles.com/_ti.html |title=American airplanes: ti – ty |publisher=Aerofiles.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day, British pilot [[Arthur V. Rogers]] took off for a test flight in the twin engine ''Angel of Los Angeles'' at [[Western Air Express Field]] at [[Montebello, California]], circled, came about to land, jumping out of the plane before it suddenly dived into the ground, and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 August 1927|title=THIRD DOLE FLIER KILLED IN CRASH AT LOS ANGELES: Accident to Capt. A. V. Rogers Makes Three Planes Wrecked Among Entrants. HIS WIFE SEES THE TRAGEDY Parachute Leap Apparently Failed After Plane Nose Dived at 150 Feet. NINE REMAIN IN THE RACE They Seem Thankful for Their Decision to Put Start Off Until Tuesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Mildred Doran]], [[Auggy Pedlar]], and navigator [[Manley Lawling]] were flying into Oakland when their aircraft developed engine trouble.  They successfully landed in a wheat field in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], but had trouble making repairs because they no longer had any tools. Doran was quoted as stating, "We threw [the tools] off at Long Beach because they were in the way and cluttering things up."  Lawling was later replaced by Vilas R. Knope when Lawling could not satisfy the race committee of his navigational skills.  He reportedly got lost over Oakland.

Then, on 11 August, as [[J. L. Giffin]] and [[Theodore S. Lundgren]] approached Oakland, their aircraft, an [[Catron &amp; Fisk CF-10|International CF-10 Triplane]], the ''Pride of Los Angeles'', crashed into [[San Francisco Bay]], but the two men were unhurt.

In test flights before the race, Gobel's ''Woolaroc'' encountered gear issues that required Gobel to hang outside the plane to fix. The ''Air King (City of Peoria)'' flown by Charles Parkhurst Lomax and Ralph C. Lower Jr, was disqualified on the 16th because its 370-gallon tanks were estimated to give the plane a range 300 miles short by inspectors. A missing component on the ''Miss Doran'' compass sparked fears of vandalism the night before the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=DOLE PRIZE FLIERS GUARD THEIR AEROS AS TAKE-OFF NEARS: Missing Compass Causes Talk of Vandalism in Tense Camp.

===Participants===
The race began on 16 August, by which time the starting line-up had diminished to eight aircraft:
* ''Pabco Flyer'', a [[Breese-Wilde Model 5|Breese-Wilde Monoplane]], ''NX646'', flown alone by [[Livingston Gilson Irving]]
* ''Woolaroc'', One of two modified [[Travel Air 5000]] aircraft, ''NX869'', flown by [[Arthur C. Goebel]] and navigated by [[William V. Davis Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Ed Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=AAHS Journal|date=Spring 1985|title=Woolarc!|author=Ed Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Oklahoma'', a [[Travel Air 5000]] sister ship of ''Woolaroc'', ''NX911'', piloted by [[Bennett Griffin]] and navigated by [[Al Henley]]&lt;ref name="Ed Phillips"/&gt;
* ''Aloha'', a [[Breese-Wilde Model 5|Breese-Wilde 5 Monoplane]], ''NX914'', flown by [[Martin Jensen (aviator)|Martin Jensen]] and navigated by [[Paul Schluter]]
* ''El Encanto'', a [[Goddard Special]] metal monoplane, ''NX5074'', flown by [[Norman A. Goddard]] and [[Kenneth C. Hawkins]], which was heavily favored in the pre-race odds
* ''Golden Eagle'', the prototype [[Lockheed Vega|Lockheed Vega 1]] [[monoplane]], ''NX913'', flown by [[Jack Frost (aviator)|Jack Frost]] and navigated by Gordon Scott
* ''Miss Doran'', a [[Buhl Airsedan|Buhl CA-5 Air Sedan]], ''NC2915'', flown by [[Auggy Pedlar]], navigated by [[Vilas R. Knope]], and carrying [[Mildred Doran]]
* ''[[Dallas Spirit]]'', a [[Swallow Monoplane]], ''NX941'', flown by [[William Portwood Erwin]] and navigated by [[Alvin Eichwaldt]]

===Takeoff, race and aftermath===
The fifteen competitors were seen off by a crowd estimated to include 75,000 to 100,000 persons. Weather was predicted to have a high fog on takeoff and showers along the route.

The initial takeoffs were plagued with trouble. ''Oklahoma'' took off first just before 11am. The crew would eventually abort the flight over San Francisco with an overheating engine.&lt;ref name="Ed Phillips"/&gt; She was followed by ''El Encanto'', which failed to clear the runway before she swerved and crashed. ''Pabco Flyer'' lifted momentarily into the air, then crashed some 7000 feet from the runway. Their crews were not hurt. ''Golden Eagle'' took off smoothly and flew out of sight. ''Miss Doran'' succeeded in taking off but circled back and landed less than ten minutes later, its engine “sputtering like a Tin Lizzie.”&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/above-and-beyond-aunt-mildred-79371463/#JGj9GvJzm7zOmCyk.99 Above &amp; Beyond: Aunt Mildred] By Richard A. Durose; ''[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]''; March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Then ''Dallas Spirit'' returned to Oakland with fabric ripping off the fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=THWARTED DOLE RACER PLANS FLIGHT TO TOKYO: Pilot of Dallas Spirit, Disabled by Wind, Repairs Plane for New Start West. WEATHER DICTATES MOVE|date=18 August 1927|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aloha'' and ''Woolaroc'' took off uneventfully, and ''Miss Doran'' succeeded on her second attempt. ''Pabco Flyer'' also tried and crashed a second time.

[[File:Woolaroc - Pazifiküberflug.jpg|thumbnail|left|Frontpage of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]],'' 18 August 1927]]
''Woolaroc'' flew a [[great-circle distance|great-circle route]], flying at 4,000 to 6,000 feet of altitude. The navigator Davis used sextants and smoke bombs to calculate course and wind drift. They were greeted in Hawaii and escorted by a [[Boeing PW-9]] out of [[Wheeler Field]]. Goebel and Davis won the race in 26 hours, 17 minutes, earning them the US$25,000 first prize. ''Aloha'' arrived in 28 hours, 16 minutes, earning Jensen and Schluter the US$10,000 second prize. Out of his $10,000 winnings, pilot Jensen gave his navigator Schulter only $25.&lt;ref&gt;"Winner of $10,000 in Dole Race Gives Only $25 to His Navigator", ''Boston Daily Globe'', August 25, 1927, p8&lt;/ref&gt; Neither ''Golden Eagle'' nor ''Miss Doran'' was ever seen again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=FLOWERS CAST ON SEA FOR LOST DOLE FLIERS: Steamer Halts in Pacific While Tribute Is Paid to Six Men and Young Woman.|date=17 September 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for the ''Golden Eagle'' and ''Miss Doran'' was aided by three submarines, {{USS |R-8 |SS-85 |6}}, {{USS |S-42 |SS-153| 6}}, and {{USS |S-46 |SS-157| 6}}. After repairing ''Dallas Spirit'', Erwin and Eichwaldt joined the search, leaving Oakland for Honolulu. Their last radio message was that they were in a spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=CALLS DOLE RACE "MISTAKE." Ernest Smith Fears That Erwin May Have Stripped Fuselage|date=21 August 1927|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither was seen again. In the days after the race, the disqualified owners of the ''Air King'' charged that race officials should have disqualified the ''Golden Eagle'', because it also had only 350 gallons of fuel capacity when it took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=RULES WAIVED FOR LOST DOLE PLANE, IS CHARGE: Golden Eagle Had Less Fuel Than Required, Airways System Declares. TELEGRAM TO M'CRACKEN|date=19 August 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a bitter conclusion, the father of the sponsor of the race, Rev. [[Charles Fletcher Dole|Charles F. Dole]], died on November 27, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=REV. CHARLES F. DOLE DIES.: Peace Advocate Was Father of Sponsor of Dole Air Race|date=28 September 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goebel and Davis returned on a [[Matson, Inc.|Matson liner]] to an impromptu parade in San Francisco where they doubted there would be any survivors of a sea ditching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=WINNERS OF DOLE RACE BACK, BOWED IN SORROW: Goebel Says He Entertains No Hope for Seven Who Did Not Finish|date=1 September 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Woolaroc'' has survived and is on display at the [[Woolaroc|Woolaroc Museum]] in [[Oklahoma]], which started as a hangar to store and display the plane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20021016003912/http://www.joplinglobe.com/archives/2000/000612/headline/story2.html Ranch delights children]; ''[[The Joplin Globe]]'', by John Hacker, MONDAY, JUNE 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, 2004, Barrett in his capacity as President of ITV Direct, Inc./Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc. received a [[FDA Warning Letter|Warning Letter]] from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notifying him that the product Supreme Greens was being marketed as an unlicensed drug with false or misleading claims.  The letter requested that ITV Direct correct the deceptive practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casewatch.org/fdawarning/prod/2004/sg.shtml Warning Letter, April 19, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts alleging that Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., ITV Direct, Inc., and their president, Donald W. Barrett had deceptively marketed Supreme Greens and Coral Calcium Daily by claiming that it could prevent, treat, and cure cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes.  They also claimed it caused substantial weight loss, and was safe for use by pregnant women, children – including those as young as one year old, and persons taking any form of medication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/10/supreme.shtm Federal Trade Commission news release, October 6, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422065534/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/10/supreme.shtm |date=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2004, ITV Direct was enjoined from marketing Supreme Greens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/dmc.shtm FTC Obtains Preliminary Injunction Against Marketers of Bogus Cancer-Cure "Supreme Greens", July 1, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418092609/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/dmc.shtm |date=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2007, the FTC sued ITV Direct, Inc. and Donald Barrett for misrepresenting [[Kevin Trudeau]]'s "Weight-Loss Cure" book in the infomercial they produced to market it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/10/weight.shtm FTC Charges Marketers of “Weight-Loss Cure” Book with Misrepresenting Book’s Contents, October 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the FTC's suit, ITV Direct sued the FTC for alleged harassment and violation of free speech rights.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsequently, on November 19, 2007, in a separate FTC action, Trudeau was found in [[contempt of court|contempt]] of a 2004 court order for making "patently false" claims in the weight loss book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20071119-1334-ftc-trudeau.html Court finds ''Natural Cures' author Trudeau in contempt of 2004 settlement, may be fined again'' Christopher S.

On July 19, 2008, a federal judge ruled that two infomercials produced by Beverly-based ITV Direct for "Coral Calcium" and "Supreme Greens" were deceptive and that the firm's owners are liable for restitution being sought by the Federal Trade Commission, which is seeking nearly $55 million.  The judge also dismissed a countersuit filed by Barrett, ITV's president, who claimed the FTC was violating his First Amendment rights by taking him to court to force him to pull the ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717012953/http://salemnews.com/punews/local_story_200202510.html  Judge finds Beverly company's promise to cure cancer in infomercials 'deceptive', The Salem News, July 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EFQM excellence model''' is a non-prescriptive business excellence [[Conceptual framework|framework]] for [[Organizational theory|organizational]] management, promoted by the [[European Foundation for Quality Management]] (EFQM) and designed to help organizations to become more competitive.

Regardless of sector, size, structure or maturity, organizations need to establish appropriate management systems to be successful. The EFQM excellence model is a tool to help organizations do this by measuring where they are on the path to excellence, helping them understand the gaps, and promoting solutions.

==History==
A number of research studies have investigated the correlation between the adoption of holistic models such as the EFQM excellence model, and improved organizational results. The majority of such studies show a positive link. One of the most comprehensive of these was carried out by Vinod Singhal of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and Kevin Hendricks of the [[College of William and Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. Hendricks &amp; V. Singhal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.42.3.415|title=Quality Awards and the Market Value of the Firm: An Empirical Investigation|publisher=Georgia Tech|journal=Management Science|volume=42|issue=3|year=1996|pages=415-436|quote=We note that the abnormal returns generated by the quality award winning announcements provide a lower bound for the impact of implementing an effective quality award improvement program. Our results show that the stock market reacts positively to quality award announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The EFQM model provides a framework allowing organisations to determine their current "level of excellence" and where they need to improve their efforts. The model also helps to ensure that business decisions incorporate the needs of all stakeholders and are aligned with the organisation's objectives.

The EFQM model acts as a common reference. It provides its users with a set of performance improvement tools in order for them to achieve and sustain business success. The model is regularly reviewed to incorporate new ideas, concepts and learning.  The last revision was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;EFQM Excellence Model 2013, multiple authors, EFQM&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFQM model is used to obtain a complete view of the organizational performance and to understand the relations of [[cause and effect]]s between what organisations do and the results they achieve. 

== Components ==
The model consists of three components:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efqm.org/the-efqm-excellence-model&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Eight core values or key management principles that drive sustainable success&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.efqm.org/efqm-model/fundamental-concepts|title=Fundamental Concepts|date=9 July 2013|newspaper=EFQM|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*#Adding value for customers
*#Creating a sustainable future
*#Developing organisational capability
*#Harnessing creativity and innovation
*#Leading with vision, inspiration and integrity
*#Managing with agility
*#Succeeding through the talent of people
*#Sustaining outstanding results 
* Nine criteria, separated into five "enablers" (leadership, people, strategy, partnerships and resources, and [[business process|processes]], products and services) and four "results" (people, customer, society, and business results)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.efqm.org/efqm-model/model-criteria|title=Model Criteria|date=7 May 2013|newspaper=EFQM|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://managementmania.com/en/efqm-excellence-model|title=EFQM Excellence Model|last=ManagementMania|newspaper=ManagementMania.com|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RADAR logic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.efqm.org/efqm-model/radar-logic|title=RADAR Logic|date=7 May 2013|newspaper=EFQM|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; continuous improvement cycle used by [[EFQM]].  It was originally derived from the [[PDCA cycle]].
**Determine the '''R'''esults aimed at as part of the strategy
**Plan and develop a set of '''A'''pproaches to deliver the required results now and in the future
**'''D'''eploy the approaches in a systematic way to ensure implementation
**'''A'''ssess and '''R'''efine the deployed approaches based on monitoring and analysis of the results achieved and ongoing learning 

== Application ==
The model is used by about 30000 organisations across Europe.&lt;ref name="prn"&gt;{{Cite web|year=2012|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/revised-efqm-model-to-help-increase-europes-competitiveness-173234131.html|title=Revised EFQM Model to Help Increase Europe's Competitiveness|last=EFQM|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, more and more countries started implementing the Model, especially across Middle East and South America.

{{Quote|text=All European organisations, both in the public and private sectors, are facing new challenges. The increasing pressure to compete on a global stage with limited resources means we all have to work together to secure our future prosperity, and that of generations to come ... The EFQM Excellence Model provides a framework that encourages cooperation, collaboration and innovation that we will need to ensure this goal is achieved|author=[[Herman Van Rompuy]]&lt;ref name="prn"/&gt;}}

==EFQM Excellence Award==
The [[EFQM Excellence Award]] is run annually by [[EFQM]].  It is designed to recognize organizations that have achieved an outstanding level of sustainable excellence, based on assessment against the EFQM Excellence Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/prensa/20070610/santander/colegio-kostka|title=Kostka in Calabria awarded|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic City''' is an [[information technology]] hub in [[Bangalore]], India, located in [[Anekal]] taluk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.electronic-city.in/about/introduction|title=About Electronic City|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of India's largest electronic/IT [[industrial park]]s, spread over 800 acres (3.2&amp;nbsp;km²) in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages in Bangalore. It consists of four zones called ''phases''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV. Electronic City was established by Keonics, Karnataka Electronic,&lt;ref name="keonics"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.keonics.in/
|title= Keonics web site
|publisher=Keonics
|accessdate=2011-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in information technology infrastructure development. There are approximately 200 [[Information technology|IT]]/[[Business process outsourcing|ITES]] companies located in Electronic City, which include main campuses of
IT/Bio-tech majors [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services|TCS]], [[HCL Technologies|HCL]], [[Tech Mahindra]], [[Biocon]] etc.

==History==
Electronic City was the brainchild of [[R. K. Baliga]], the first Chairman and Managing Director of Keonics, Karnataka Electronic.&lt;ref name="keonics" /&gt; He dreamt of making Bangalore the [[Silicon Valley of India]] when he developed the concept of Electronic City. In 1978, Keonics established Electronic City on 332 acres of land in Konappana Agrahara and Doddathogur villages. The [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalisation of the Indian economy]] in the early 1990s by the then Indian Prime Minister [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] and then Indian Finance Minister [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]] helped Electronic City to become what it is today&amp;nbsp;— the outsourcing capital of the world.

In 1997, the maintenance and upkeep of Electronic City was handed over by Keonics to ELCIA, the Electronic City Industries Association, with  representatives from units in the enclave, for effective local governance and management. Security is provided by ELCIA, who have deployed around 500 security officials and also installed CCTV cameras on strategic locations. On 18 March 2013, a notification by the Urban Development Department has brought Electronic City Phases I, II, III under the E-City Industrial Township Area.

The '''Ethel Barrymore Theatre''' is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] located at 243 West [[47th Street (Manhattan)|47th Street]] in the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] of [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]], New York City. It is named for acclaimed actress [[Ethel Barrymore]].

==History==
Designed by [[architect]] [[Herbert J. Krapp]] and constructed by the [[The Shubert Organization|Shuberts]], it opened on December 20, 1928, with ''The Kingdom of God'', a play selected by leading lady [[Ethel Barrymore]]. Over the next dozen years she returned to star in ''The Love Duel'' (1929), ''Scarlett Sister Mary'' (1930), ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' (1931), and ''An International Incident'' (1940).

It is the only surviving theatre of the many the Shuberts built for performers who were affiliated with them. It has been used continuously as a legitimate house, unlike many of the older theatres that have been used for a variety of purposes throughout the years.

'''Federico Augusto Boyd López''' (24 September 1851 – 25 May 1924) was acting [[President of Panama]] from October 1, 1910 to October 5, 1910. He belonged to the [[National Liberal Party (Panama)|Liberal Party]].

Boyd was born in [[Panama City]] on September 24, 1851. He was the son of Archibaldo B. Boyd and Maria Lopez de Boyd. He was a businessman who became an active member of the Patriotic Revolutionary Junta that struggled to get Panama's independence from Colombia. He fought in favor of his country without thinking of the danger of the actions he undertook. He served in several positions: member of the Panama City Town Hall (1888); member of the Provisional Government Junta (1903); National Assembly senator (1910); head of state of Panama (1910); foreign relations minister (1911–1912); ambassador and minister in Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium; general consul; and business representative in Honduras and El Salvador.

He was elected as [[Vice President of Panama|the second presidential designate]] by the [[National Assembly of Panama|National Assembly]] for the term 1906-1908.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tHYqAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as [[Vice President of Panama|the second presidential designate]] for the term 1910-1912, and as [[Vice President of Panama|the first presidential designate]] for the term 1920-1922.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tHYqAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

His talent as public speaker brought him to represent Panama's interests before the Colombian Government. He presented a petition to obtain a delay on the negotiations with the French Government to build a Panama Canal. Later on, his intervention made possible a negotiation with the U.S. Government for the construction of an interoceanic canal through the Isthmus of Panama.

Boyd died in New York City on May 25, 1924. He is remembered as one of the founding fathers of Panama.

The '''Fox Theatre''' is a performing arts center located at 2211 Woodward Avenue in [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], near the [[Grand Circus Park Historic District]]. Opened in 1928 as a flagship [[movie palace]] in the [[Fox Theatres]] chain, it was at over 5,000 seats the largest theater in the city. Designed by theater architect [[C. Howard Crane]], it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985 and was designated a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan|National Historic Landmark]] in 1989 for its architecture. The area surrounding the Fox is nicknamed ''Foxtown''. The city's major [[Theatre in Detroit|performance centers and theatres]] emanate from the Fox Theatre and [[Grand Circus Park Historic District]] and continue along [[Woodward Avenue]] toward the [[Fisher Building|Fisher Theatre]] in the city's [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]].&lt;ref name="HillGallagher2003"/&gt;

The Fox has 5,048 seats (5,174 seats if removable seats placed in the raised orchestra pit are included). It is the largest surviving movie palace of the 1920s and the largest of the original Fox Theatres. The Fox was fully restored in 1988.&lt;ref name="Foxtheatre"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodges |first=Michael H. |date=September 8, 2003 |department=Michigan History |work=[[The Detroit News]] |url=http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=215 |title=Fox Theater's Rebirth Ushered in City's Renewal |accessdate=August 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121205184440/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=215 |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marzejka"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marzejka |first=Laurie J. |date=January 25, 1998 |url=http://www.waterwinterwonderland.com/movietheaters.aspx?id=597&amp;LocTypeID=5 |title=Detroit's Historic Fox Theatre |work=[[The Detroit News]] |publisher=WinterWaterWonderland.com |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjacent office building houses the headquarters of [[Olympia Entertainment]] and [[Little Caesars]].&lt;ref name="olympia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://olympiaentertainment.com/olympia/about.jsp;jsessionid=JMGOPGNBGFII |publisher=Olympia Entertainment |accessdate=November 2, 2009 |title=About Us |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107010535/http://www.olympiaentertainment.com/olympia/about.jsp |archivedate=January 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franchise"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://franchise.littlecaesars.com/Portals/0/pocket_folder.pdf |format=PDF |title=Franchise Opportunities |publisher=Little Caesars Enterprises |accessdate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Performing arts in Detroit}}
The Detroit Fox is one of five spectacular [[Fox Theatres]] built in the late 1920s by film pioneer [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]]. The others were the Fox Theatres in Brooklyn, [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Atlanta]], [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Louis]], and [[Fox Theatre (San Francisco, California)|San Francisco]]. Architect [[C. Howard Crane]] designed the Fox with a lavish interior featuring a blend of [[Burma|Burmese]], [[China|Chinese]], [[India]]n and [[Iran|Persian]] motifs. There are three levels of seating, the Main Floor above the orchestra pit, the Mezzanine, and the Gallery (balcony). The exterior of the attached 10-story office building features a façade with Asian motifs which, when illuminated at night, can be seen for several blocks. The [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] is (on the interior) its near architectural twin with about 500 fewer seats. The 10-story Detroit Fox Theatre building also contains the headquarters of [[Olympia Entertainment]], while the St. Louis Fox is a stand-alone theatre. The architectural plaster molds of the Detroit Fox (1928) were re-used on the St. Louis Fox (1929).

The Fox opened in 1928 and remained Detroit's premier movie destination for decades. Unlike many neighboring theatres, it operated continually until it was closed in the 1980s for restoration. However, by the 1960s, the venue was showing its age and maintenance of many key areas was deferred. By the 1970s mezzanine and balcony seating areas were closed to the public.

In 1984 Chuck Forbes, owner of the [[Fillmore Detroit|State]] and Gem theaters, proposed a renovation project. These plans were never fully realized, but in 1988 the theater was acquired by new owners, [[Mike Ilitch|Mike]] and [[Marian Bayoff Ilitch|Marian Ilitch]], who fully restored the Fox at a cost of $12 million.&lt;ref name="Foxtheatre"/&gt; Their company, [[Ilitch Holdings, Inc.]], is headquartered in the Fox Theater Office Building. The downtown area near [[Grand Circus Park Historic District|Grand Circus Park]] which encompasses Fox Theatre is sometimes referred to as ''Foxtown'' after the theater. In 2000, [[Comerica Park]] opened and helped to revitalize the neighborhood along with the construction of [[Ford Field]] in 2002.

===Productions===

The gala opening took place September 21, 1928, and featured the silent film [[Street Angel (1928 film)|''Street Angel'']] starring Janet Gaynor. The live show depicted a history of Detroit from its settlement in 1701 to the present. Productions included feature-length movies, shorts and newsreels, and performances by the 60-piece Fox Theatre Grand Orchestra, a 50-voice choir and a 32-member chorus line called the Tillerettes. This was Fox's version of producer [[Samuel Roxy Rothafel|Samuel "Roxy" Rothafel's]] [[The Rockettes|Roxyettes]].

In the 1930s, Shirley Temple made appearances when the theater showed her films. During [[World War II]], like many theaters in the area, the Fox operated 24 hours a day to accommodate defense plant workers on afternoon and evening shifts. The theater routinely grossed $75,000 a week when admission was 35 cents. In 1953, the theater was the first in Michigan equipped for [[CinemaScope]] and premiered the epic picture [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']].&lt;ref name="Foxtheatre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marzejka"/&gt;

In May 1956, the theater hosted three performances by [[Elvis Presley]]&lt;ref name="scotty"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Fox Theatre, Detroit, MI |publisher= scottymoore.net |url= http://scottymoore.net/detroit56.html |date= July 26, 2009 |accessdate= January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the theater hosted performances by many [[Motown]] recording artists, but by the 1970s the theater was showing its age. Unlike other downtown Detroit theaters in the 1970s, such as the [[Michigan Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Michigan]] and [[United Artists Theatre Building|United Artists]], the Fox was able to remain open by programming [[Blaxploitation]] and [[Martial arts films|martial arts]] films.&lt;ref name="Foxtheatre"/&gt;

The first production at the Fox after restoration was a November 19, 1988, concert with Joe Williams and the [[Count Basie Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="Foxtheatre"/&gt; Since then, notable performances include a concert with [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Liza Minnelli]] which was recorded and broadcast on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network in 1989 and a 1990 performance by [[Victor Borge]] which was recorded for broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and later incorporated into his DVD ''Victor Borge: Then and Now''. The theater hosted the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] ceremony on March 31, 2007, the night before [[WrestleMania 23]] was held at nearby [[Ford Field]]. The prior evening, March 30, 2007, the theater hosted the world premiere of the film [[The Condemned]].

Live productions have included touring companies of ''[[Sesame Street Live]]: Let's Be Friends'', [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], ''Blue's Clues Live!'', [[Fairuz]], [[Donny Osmond]], ''[[Irving Berlin's White Christmas]]'', ''Dora The Explorer Live'', ''Go! Diego! Live!'' and ''[[What's Done in the Dark]]'' and ''[[Riverdance]]''. The [[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]] was an annual favorite from 1997 through 2005. Both the interior and exterior of The Fox were used in a [[Chrysler]] [[Born of Fire|commercial]] for its [[Chrysler 200]], featuring [[Eminem]], that [[Super Bowl XLV#Advertising|aired]] during [[Super Bowl XLV]] in February 2011.

==Architecture==
[[File:Fox Theatre at Night.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Fox Theatre at night with new LED lights in Downtown Detroit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150623/NEWS/150629941/fox-theatre-marquee-gets-a-face-lift-thousands-of-new-lights |title=Fox Theatre marquee gets a face-lift, thousands of new lights | date=March 31, 2017 |last=Broda |first=Natalie |newspaper=[[Crain Communications|Crain's Detroit Business]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Fox Office Building, which forms the Woodward façade of the theatre, is 10 stories in height. The front and sides of the office tower are faced with a cream-colored terra cotta. There are decorative [[lintel (architecture)|lintels]] above the windows on the second and tenth floor. The building wraps around the theatre lobby creating a u-shaped floor plan. The auditorium and rear of the office tower are faced with brick.

The current marquee was installed during the 1987 restoration but is based on the original which itself was replaced in the 1950s.

The original configuration of the street and second floors contained 20 retail spaces on each level. Spaces featured large display windows looking into the corridors and ground floor spaces also had access directly from the street.

Office space occupied the third through tenth floor and featured marble floors and wainscoting in the corridors. Office doors featured full-length glass with glass transoms above to allow light and ventilation into the corridors. Many of these features remained when the 1987 restoration began with the exception of the seventh floor which was altered in the 1970s to accommodate a [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Administration]] office.&lt;ref name="form"/&gt;

The theatre entrance on Woodward has 16 doors that open onto the storm lobby with a black and white marble floor and small ornate plaster alcoves in the ceiling. The storm lobby opens into the main lobby which is approximately {{convert|87|ft|m}} deep and six floors high. The floor is terrazzo with brass inlays but it was unseen until the 1988 renovation. Lore says that Eve Leo, wife of Fox President William Fox, was unhappy when she learned that the theatre was to have a bare floor. She insisted it needed carpeting, so it was covered with what was the largest single-piece wool rug ever manufactured. The rug covered {{convert|3600|sqft|m2|}} of the lobby floor and weighed {{convert|3000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Marzejka"/&gt;

Above the entrance doors are faux organ pipes fashioned from plaster and in a balcony to the upper left is a 3-manual, 13-rank [[M. P. Moller|Moller]] organ with the real pipes in the chamber above the console. The Fox's Moller is the only one still in situ. On each side of the lobby are eight vermillion [[scagliola]] columns. The columns rise from black octagonal bases and are adorned with eagles, flowers, glass jewels highlighted by silver leaf to a height of approximately {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The Corinthian capitals are also silver leafed and bear images of a variety of animals and birds. The columns support plaster beams decorated with faces, starbursts and cartouches. Between the columns are small balconies on the mezzanine and balcony levels that overlook the main floor. The ceiling is blue with a sunburst design surrounded by Fox griffins. At the rear of the lobby, the grand staircase leads to the mezzanine level. Two plaster lions with jeweled eyes guard the base of the stairs and fish-like creatures adorn the balustrades. On the mezzanine level, four additional columns frame two-story windows enclosing the auditorium. A loggia above the windows allows patrons on the balcony level to look down into the lobby.

Beside the grand stairs are doors leading to the 2,898 orchestra-level seats. The auditorium is {{convert|108|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|175|ft|abbr=on}} wide. An inner lobby wraps around the seating area and contains two oval stairways leading to upper seating levels and the lounges on the lower level. The walls of the auditorium are shades of beige and are adorned with molded plaster plants, human faces, geometric designs, birds and animals.

The proscenium is {{convert|70|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} high. Like the side walls, it is adorned with animals, human figures, starbursts and flowers. Above the center of the proscenium is an elephant's head. Suspended below the elephant is a large quatrefoil-shaped censer that conceals speakers. The backstage area originally had 18 performer dressing rooms, offices and a broadcast booth. In the basement were staff dressing rooms, workshops, an infirmary, screening room and storage rooms.

The orchestra pit and sections of the stage can be raised and lowered on hydraulic lifts. The stage is {{convert|78|ft|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|32|ft|abbr=on}} deep and houses the four-manual 36-rank [[Wurlitzer]] organ. This organ was constructed especially for the theatre and is one of the few [[theatre organ]]s in the world that remains in its original installation.

On the side walls at the orchestra level are Moorish arches extending to the balcony. Above is a colonnade at the balcony level with nine vermillion scagiolia columns matching those in the lobby. The columns support decorated arches and behind the first three are grilles that conceal the bays containing the 2,700 pipes and other effects for the organ. The areas between the other columns are filled with tinted mirrors. The walls are topped with a cornice decorated with lion and human faces set among geometric designs and sunbursts.

The ceiling is designed to resemble a round tent with an oculus supported by spears. The tent drapes slightly and is covered with acoustical felt bearing a stenciled design. The ceiling of the oculus is blue with a globe chandelier of colored glass suspended from a starburst design. The chandelier is {{convert|13|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter weighs {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}} and contains 1200 pieces of glass.

The projection booth was one of the largest of its day and originally housed four projectors, three spotlights and a [[Brenkert Brenograph Jr.|Brenograph Machine]] to produce special effects.&lt;ref name="form"&gt;{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form |publisher=National Park Service |date=February 9, 1989 |accessdate=January 10, 2011 |url=http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NHLS&amp;item=Text/85000280.djvu&amp;style=nps/FOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item(SUMMARY,COPYRIGHT),cat(Name)&amp;page=0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402165147/http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NHLS&amp;item=Text%2F85000280.djvu&amp;style=nps%2FFOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item%28SUMMARY%2CCOPYRIGHT%29%2Ccat%28Name%29&amp;page=0 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Harkort 1793-1880.png|thumb|right|Friedrich Harkort in 1820]]
'''Friedrich Harkort''' (February 22, 1793, [[Hagen]] - March 6, 1880), known as the "Father of the [[Ruhr]]," was an early prominent German industrialist and pioneer of industrial development in the Ruhr region.&lt;ref name="faces1"&gt;(29 December 2009). [https://www.derwesten.de/kultur/friedrich-harkort-vorbild-und-vordenker-id2313221.html Friedrich Harkort - Vorbild und Vordenker], ''Derwesten.de'' (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819, he founded the first industrial workshop at Castle [[Wetter (Ruhr)|Wetter]].  An early proponent of railroads, he proposed the construction of a railway line from [[Cologne]] to [[Minden]] in 1825, which eventuated as the [[Cologne-Minden trunk line]], completed in 1847. In 1826 he built a small test track, as a [[monorail]] following a design of the Englishman [[Henry Robinson Palmer]].

}}'''Hermann Dietrich Upmann''' (born 1 May 1816 in Bielefeld-Altstadt,Germany  - d. 29. January 1894 [[Bremen]], [[Germany]]) was a [[bank]]er, [[merchant]] and cigar manufacturer in [[Cuba]], creator of the [[H. Upmann]] 1844 brand.

With 23 years he embarked for the New World in 1839 to work for an import / export Company: The Gravenhorst &amp; Co. During the voyage, a Briton persuaded him to stay in [[Havana]] where the tobacco business was flourishing. Upmann accepted the suggestion. He learned the processes and secrets of cigar manufacturing, purchased a local cigar [[factory]] at 85 San Miguel Street, Havana, and created the H. Upmann 1844 brand, which is among the oldest cigar brands in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cigars-review.org/cigars/H-Upmann.htm|title=H. Upmann Cigars - Cuban Cigar Reviews|website=www.cigars-review.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brand thrives in the international market. In 1855 he received the first of many prizes that he would obtain over the following years. He achieves the qualification of "''Provider of His Majesty [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Don Alfonso XII]], King of Spain''". His is one of the five largest tobacco factories in Cuba. Hermann Upmann becomes a director of the [[Havana cigar|Havana Cigar]] Brand Association, an organization that works to confront the production and sale of [[counterfeit]] cigars .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alnavio.com/la-familia-alemana-que-creo-un-imperio-de-habanos-en-cuba|title=La familia alemana que creó un imperio de habanos en Cuba|last=Latina|first=Noticias y actualidad de Venezuela, México y América|work=Noticias y actualidad de Venezuela, México y América Latina|access-date=2017-10-01|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He nevertheless finds the tropical climate in Cuba difficult, so he decided against a lasting stay.His youngest brother, August Ludwig Upmann (born 1818) started to work with him and thus stayed in Cuba. Hermann Dietrich Upmann returned to Germany in 1848 and founded the cigar company Gebrüder Upmann &amp; Co. Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.h-upmann.de/6.html|title=1844 - 1870 - H.Upmann &amp; Co. Zigarren in Bremen|last=mfg-transfer|first=webdesign|website=www.h-upmann.de|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, his nephew, [[Heinrich Upman]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n, arrived in Cuba. With capital contributed mainly hisuncle, they found an organization dedicated to the banking operations: initially catering to tobacco dealers and manufacturers, whose operations are spread through the Antilles. The company has grown to such an extent that it is transformed into a vertical operation: they take care of the seedbeds, plant, harvest, manufacture, pack and, with their own shipping company, transport their products to other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-S5IDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235&amp;dq=herman+upmann&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmeLWis_WAhXRI1AKHSl3DOQ4ChDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=herman%20upmann&amp;f=false|title=Top 10 Cuba|last=Travel|first=D. K.|date=2017-01-16|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=9780241301609|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermann Upmann retired in 1890, and was succeeded at [[H. Upmann &amp; Co.|H.Upmann &amp; Co]] by his nephew, [[Heinrich Upmann]], who continued the business with his partners [[Heinrich Runken]] and [[Theodore Garbade]]. The later was president of the Union of Cigar manufacturers of the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nUkrAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=teodoro+garbade&amp;dq=teodoro+garbade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxzNHptsrWAhUKYlAKHQoMC0YQ6AEIPjAE|title=Colección legislativa|last=Cuba|date=1920|publisher=Rambla y Bouza|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Heinrich’s death in 1914, he was succeeded by his nephews Hermann and Albert (Alberto) Upmann.

Hermann Upmann died in Bremen 1894 and is buried in the Upmann family grave at the {{Interlanguage link|Riensberger Friedhof|de|Riensberger Friedhof|WD=}} in Bremen.

'''Jan van de Cappelle''' (or '''Joannes / van der / Capelle''' in various combinations; 25 January 1626 (baptized) &amp;ndash; 22 December 1679 (buried))&lt;ref&gt;"Capelle", which he sometimes used himself, is also found. His signatures may also use "Capel" and "Joannes". MacLaren, 73&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] of seascapes and winter landscapes, also notable as an industrialist and art collector.  He is "now considered the outstanding marine painter of 17th century Holland".&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; He lived all his life in [[Amsterdam]], and as well as working as an artist spent much, or most,&lt;ref&gt;In 1666 he gave his occupation to a [[notary]] as "dyer". &lt;!--According to G. Schwarz Van de Cappelle produced dye.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of his time helping to manage his father Franchoy's large dyeworks, which specialized in the expensive [[dye]] [[carmine]], and which he eventually inherited in 1674.  Presumably because of this dual career, there are fewer than 150 surviving paintings,&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; a relatively small number for the industrious painters of the Dutch Golden Age.  His marine paintings usually show estuary or river scenes rather than the open sea, and the water is always very calm, allowing it to act as a mirror reflecting the cloud formations above; this effect was Cappelle's speciality.

==Life==
[[File:Jan van de Cappelle 001.jpg|thumb|left|''The Home Fleet Saluting the State Barge'', 1650, a "parade" picture. 64 × 92.5 cm (25.20 × 36.42 in)]]

His father (1594–1674) was a cloth-dyer, his mother came from Rotterdam; they married in 1622 in Amsterdam. Joannes' baptism is recorded in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], Amsterdam on 25 January 1626.&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen Giltay en Jan Kelch, Lof der Zeevaart, de Hollandse zeeschilders van de 17de eeuw (Rotterdam, 1996), pp. 187; Birthcertificate Amsterdam City Archive [https://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/indexen/doopregisters/zoek/search.nl.pl?v1=Fran*&amp;b1=&amp;a1=%3Fap*&amp;r1=1&amp;v2=&amp;b2=&amp;a2=&amp;r2=3&amp;d1=20&amp;m1=01&amp;y1=1620&amp;d2=01&amp;m2=02&amp;y2=1640&amp;rs=0&amp;x=57&amp;y=7]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was described (by [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]]) as a self-taught artist, but probably received some form of training from [[Simon de Vlieger]], whose style he copied or is closest to his early paintings, and perhaps other masters such as [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]]. He received the [[poorter|citizenship]] of Amsterdam on 24 July 1653, an essentially honorific ceremony for one of the city elite.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 73, Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months before, on 2 February 1653, he had married Annetje Jansdr. Grotingh, the daughter of a bricklayer. 
Van de Cappelle was a very wealthy man who never needed to rely on his painting for his livelihood,&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; and it is not known if he joined the city's [[Guild of Saint Luke]], or the separate "brotherhood of painters" founded in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Culture in a European Perspective: 1650, hard-won unity Door Willem Frijhoff,Marijke Spies [https://books.google.com/books?id=6yFZWojD6HwC&amp;pg=PA446]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether he sold his work, or how he did so, is unclear.
[[File:Wintergezicht Rijksmuseum SK-A-4043.jpeg|thumbnail|Winterlandscape,  Rijksmuseum &lt;!-- SK-A-4043 --&gt;]][[File:Jan van de Capelle.jpg|thumb|''A Calm'', 1654]]
[[Abraham Bredius]] suggested Van de Cappelle was a friend of [[Rembrandt]],&lt;ref&gt;Bredius, A. (1892) De schilder Johannes van de Capelle, p. 29. In: Oud-Holland 10., see also Michel 62 and most writers&lt;/ref&gt; at whose insolvency sales in 1656 and 1658 he was a large buyer, and who painted portraits of him and his wife. It has been speculated that he may have used his business contacts to help obtain the commission for Rembrandt's last, and financially very useful, group portrait commission, the [[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]] of 1662.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

His earliest dated painting is an important and already highly accomplished one from 1645, and only one is dated in the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, pp. 74, 76; this is NG 966, where the last digit is unreadable. Another painting, possibly not authentic, is said to have a date of 1671 or 1675.&lt;/ref&gt; From this most authors assume he devoted his later years to his business, in which his brother Franchois also worked.  In May 1661 he bought a house in the Koestraat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsterdaminsite.nl/burgo.en/J1954004.HTM View on Koestraat]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Nieuwmarkt]], moving from the even more expensive [[Keizersgracht]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://amsterdaminsite.nl/grachtw.en/J2956701.HTM View on Keizersgracht]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--now nr 316 near Beerenstraat--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The purchase of the house is surprising. Liedtke suggests it had to do with the distance to the dye works. Liedtke, W. (2008) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 120. Yale University Press. New Haven and London.&lt;/ref&gt; The house with a garden, next to a school, was sold by a son  of [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck|Sweelinck]], and in the deed of purchase van de Cappelle is simply called ''schilder'' (painter) and not a master painter.&lt;ref&gt;Breen, J.C. (1913) De woning van [[Jan van der Heyden]] in de Koestraat met eenige bijzonderheden uit de geschiedenis deezer straat. In: Yearbook Amstelodamum, p. 111. Being a "Mr schilder" would mean he was admissioned as a master in the painters guild.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife predeceased him in 1677, and van de Cappelle himself was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk on 22 December 1679. He left seven children.&lt;ref name="Grove and MacLaren"&gt;Grove and MacLaren&lt;/ref&gt;  The inventory of his property at death has survived and is the main source of information about his impressive art collection. It took seven months to list all.&lt;ref&gt;After the death of his son, also called Jan, his share of the collection was dispersed. One large sale was on 6, 7 and 8 November 1709. See ''Dutch drawings in the Pierpont Morgan Library, Volume 1''; Dudok van Heel, S.A.C. (1975) Honderdvijftig advertenties van kunstverkopingen uit veertig jaargangen van de Amsterdamsech Courant 1672-1711, p. 171. In: Yearbook Amstelodamum.&lt;/ref&gt;  He left his children six houses,&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Three houses were owned by his wife. &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; a country house south of [[Loenen aan de Vecht|Loenen]] on the river [[Vecht (Utrecht)]], a pleasure yacht, "44 bags of ducats", silk and bonds together valued at 92,720 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;Bredius, A. (1892) De schilder Johannes van de Capelle, p. 26-40. In: Oud-Holland 10. An English translation of his inventory is in: Russell, M. (1975). &lt;!--In: Liedtke, W. (2008) Dutch Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 119. Yale University Press. New Haven and London.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A lengthy list of the items from his splendid wardrobe was made, (including his [[purple|violet]] stockings)&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted [https://books.google.com/books?id=WEQy3xkbU9cC&amp;pg=PA162 here] Inventory of clothes App II, Q, pp 348-9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a list of his large and important art collection.&lt;ref name="Grove and MacLaren"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Cappelle, Calm.jpg|thumb|''A Calm'', 1650–1655]]

The majority of his works are marine or river views, nearly always with several vessels, but he also left a number of small winter landscapes somewhat in the manner of [[Aert van der Neer]];&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 73 says "about forty" winter landscapes, but this seems outdated or a mistake. Grove ("fewer than twenty") and more recent sources give far fewer - see the list given by [http://www.oldmasters.net/nsa-cappelle-winter.html Lindsay Fine Art] who recognise only about fifteen]&lt;/ref&gt; these all seem to date between 1652 and 1654.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Green. One recorded as dated 1644 is untraced, per Grove.&lt;/ref&gt;  His seascapes (using the term loosely) may be large or small; the nine examples in the [[National Gallery, London]], the largest group in a single collection, vary between 122 x 154.5&amp;nbsp;cm (NG 967: 48 x 61&amp;nbsp;inches) and 34.8 x 48.1&amp;nbsp;cm (NG 865: 14 x 19&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 73-79, or see online link below&lt;/ref&gt;

He had no interest in rough seas or cloudless skies,&lt;ref&gt;A "Storm" mentioned in his inventory is untraced&lt;/ref&gt; showing large cloudy skies, with the horizon low, about 15-20% of the way up the vertical axis.  The clouds are often mirrored in the dead calm water, although light ripples may be shown.  As is often the case in Dutch seascapes, there is often a warship or "statenjacht" ("States yacht"), an official yacht used for transport, official salutes and other business.  The edge of the composition often slices through vessels, leaving them half seen.  Van de Cappelle painted many ''parade'' marine subjects, depicting "a formal gathering of ships for a ceremonial occasion".&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;   Other paintings, mostly smaller and of less busy subjects, a type often called "calms", show "an all-pervading luminous atmosphere that softens all outlines and unifies forms and local colours",&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; or as [[Kenneth Clark]] puts it, "When sky was reflected on water, there was achieved that unity of luminous atmosphere which is ... the whole point of van de Capelle and van de Velde".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uNS87UG0hRwC&amp;pg=PA31 ''Landscape into Art'', 31]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early works he followed the muted palette of the "tonal school", but enlived with local highlights of bright colour, but moved in his later works to "a warmer golden tonality, exceptionally allowing himself a greater colouristic exuberance when setting the rosy glow of a sunset sky against water of a deep turquoise blue, as in the ''River Scene with Sailing Vessels'' ([[Rotterdam]], [[Boymans–van Beuningen Museum]])".&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;  According to his leading scholar, Margarita Russell, "More than any other artist of his time, with the exception only of Rembrandt, van de Cappelle was a painter of light".&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

Cappelle made a small number of etchings; only two signed ones of landscapes are now firmly attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Grove - Hollstein gives him nine, but most of these are now not regarded as his.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fewer than twenty of the nearly 750 of his own drawings in the 1680 inventory have survived identifiably.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nMnqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Jan+van+de+Cappelle+inventory&amp;dq=Jan+van+de+Cappelle+inventory&amp;cd=4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==

[[File:Rembrandt.fallhut.jpg|thumb|One of van de Cappelle's 500 Rembrandt drawings]]
[[File:CAPELLE Jan van de Winter Landscape.jpg|thumb|''Winter Landscape'']]

He had one of the largest art collections of his day, with 192&lt;ref&gt;Rooses, M. (1898) DE HOLLANDSCHE MEESTERS [https://www.elseviermaandschrift.nl/EGM/1898/07/18980701/EGM-18980701-0179/story.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000148/http://www.elseviermaandschrift.nl/EGM/1898/07/18980701/EGM-18980701-0179/story.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}. The inventory of Capelle's estate was first published by Abraham Bredius, also in [http://english.rkd.nl/Activities/Publications_by_the_RKD/Oud_Holland/default_Oud_Holland ''Oud Holland'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; paintings and over 7,000 drawings,&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; nearly all Dutch with a few Flemish works, and concentrating heavily on his own specialisms of marine painting and winter landscapes.  He had portraits of himself by both Rembrandt (one of a pair with his wife) and [[Frans Hals]], and he is the only person known to have been painted by both of the greatest Dutch portraitists.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 220&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if they survive the identity of both paintings has been lost.  The Rembrandt was claimed to be a portrait of an artist of 1648, once at [[Castle Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_hrOixWVE6gC&amp;pg=PA62 Rembrandt]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1961 [[Norton Simon]] bought a Hals then called a portrait of Cappelle, but now just ''Portrait of a Young Man''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=M.1972.4.P Norton Simon Museum]; and [https://books.google.com/books?id=ELP2haHL69MC&amp;pg=PA44 Simon's purchase]&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also portraits by [[Gerbrandt van den Eeckhout]] and [[Jan van Noordt]], also untraced.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

The collection had major groups as follows:&lt;ref&gt;see note at end of section for all these&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rembrandt: 7 paintings and five portfolios with over 500 drawings,&lt;ref&gt;For drawings see note at end of section. For the paintings, apart from the pair of portraits, NG 1400, a unique [[grisaille]] study for an [[etching]] of the ''[[Ecce Homo]]'', matches one of the inventory items. MacLaren, 346-349; [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rembrandt-ecce-homo National Gallery online]&lt;/ref&gt; including 56 "[[history painting|histories]]", an album of 135 drawings of women and children, and 300 landscape drawings - almost all those known of the last two types.  This was the largest group of Rembrandt drawings ever owned by a collector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25142479 JSTOR]''Four Dutch Landscape Drawings'', Louise S. Richards, The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Vol. 48, No. 10 (Dec., 1961), pp. 266-270.  For their later history, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=qpu-UrUOgOkC&amp;pg=PA250 Wedmore]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Simon de Vlieger]]: 9 paintings and over 1,300 drawings including one unfinished painting,&lt;ref&gt;One of them is described in the inventory as "nr. 5 Een gedootverwde dito van Simon de Vlieger" . ("ditto" refers to the subject of the painting listed under "nr. 4 Een gedootverwde see van den Overleden" = Jan van der Capelle.  The word "onvolledig" means literally "not complete" in this case it means probably " gedoodverfd" (dead colour: the first layers of paints –fairly monotone in shade- applied by the artist).  Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie RKD/Netherlands Institute for Art History&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jan van Goyen]]: 10 paintings and over 400 drawings
*[[Jan Porcellis]]: 16 paintings
*[[Hendrick Avercamp]]: paintings and nearly 900 drawings
*[[Hercules Segers]]: 5 paintings, a large proportion of his known output and perhaps bought from Rembrandt.
*There were seven paintings listed, one unfinished, made by van de Cappelle himself,&lt;ref&gt;Bredius, A. (1892) De schilder Johannes van de Capelle, p. 32-37. In: Oud-Holland 10. Two landscapes (106, 107), a sea after Porcellis (116) a storm (119), a [[Schenkenschans]] after de Vlieger and a model (?) (167)&lt;/ref&gt; but between 800 drawings, perhaps around 1150, including works described as copies by him after Porcellis and de Vlieger
*Several [[Artist's portfolio|portfolios]] with drawings by [[Esias van de Velde]] (88), [[Pieter van Laer]] (41), [[Willem Buytewech]] (86), [[Pieter de Molijn]] (57), and [[Allaert van Everdingen]] (52)

The collection included paintings by [[Jan Lievens]], [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Paulus Potter]], [[Adam Elsheimer]], [[Dürer]], [[David Vinckboons]], [[Pieter Aertsen]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Jacob Pynas]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]], [[Frans Floris]], [[Philips Koninck]] and [[Pieter Lastman]]; Flemish artists represented included [[Rubens]] (three paintings), [[Van Dyck]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Adriaen Brouwer]]. Van de Capelle owned 83 drawings by [[Jan den Uyl]]. The large groups of drawings by individual artists suggest that he had bought their studio stock of working drawings complete after their death or retirement.  The Rembrandt drawings were probably acquired at his insolvency sales in 1656 and 1658.&lt;ref&gt;Details variously from Grove, MacLaren, Slive and [http://www.rembrandtpainting.net/about_rembrandt_drawings.htm Slive on Rembrandt drawings]; Crenshaw, 162, note 14.  The inventory was first printed by Bredius in 1898, and is reprinted in Russell's monograph.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and location of works==
Van de Cappelle had a considerable influence on painters of both marine and winter subjects, including [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]] in the former group, [[Jan van Kessel (Amsterdam)|Jan van Kessel]] in the latter, and [[Hendrick Dubbels]] in both.&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

Van de Cappelle does not seem to have participated much in the commercial art world of his day, which may account for his absence from the all the contemporary collections of artists' biographies such as the over 500 lives by [[Arnold Houbraken]]'s in his ''De groote schouwburg der Nederlandsche kunstschilders en schilderessen'' – "The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters", (1718–21).  [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606–1688) and [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627–1678) also overlook him.  This was also probably partly the result of the biographers' following contemporary prejudices against marine, landscape, and [[still life]] painting, regarded as the lowest in the [[hierarchy of genres]].  He was for long perhaps better known in England than Holland, and the distribution of his works still reflects this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The largest collection of his work is the nine paintings in London, as mentioned above.  There are works in the [[Rijksmuseum]], the [[Mauritshuis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearttribune.com/Acquisition-of-a-seascape-by-Jan.html Art Tribune] Mauritshuis acquisition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rijksmuseum Twenthe]], in the [[Getty Museum]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/a_state_yacht_and_other_craft_in_calm_water/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=110000275&amp;collID=11&amp;vw=0 MMA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Museum of Wales]], [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]] (3), [[Nationalmuseum]], [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/cappelle_jan_van_de.html Artcyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jody David Scheckter''' (born 29 January 1950) is a [[South Africa]]n former [[auto racing|motor racing]] driver. He competed in [[Formula One]] from 1972 to 1980, winning the Drivers' Championship in {{F1|1979}} with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].

==Career==
Scheckter was born in [[East London, Eastern Cape]], and educated at [[Selborne College]].

===Formula One===
[[File:Scheckter Britain 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Scheckter in a [[Tyrrell 007]] at the [[1974 British Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]].]]
He rapidly ascended to the ranks of Formula One after moving to Britain in 1970. His Formula 1 debut occurred at the US Grand Prix at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] in [[1972 Formula One season|1972]] with [[Team McLaren|McLaren]], where he ran as high as third place before spinning and finishing ninth. Immediately becoming a name to watch, he continued his development the following year, winning the [[1973 SCCA L&amp;M Championship]] and racing five times in F1.  In France, he almost won in only his third start in F1 before crashing into [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], the reigning World Champion, who said after the crash about Scheckter: "This madman is a menace to himself and everybody else and does not belong in Formula 1."&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt; In his next start, the British Grand Prix at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], Scheckter's spin triggered a major accident which took nearly a dozen cars out of the race.  The [[Grand Prix Drivers Association]] demanded his immediate banishment, which was only put off when McLaren agreed to rest their driver for four races.&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt; Scheckter's [[McLaren M23]] bore the number zero during the Canadian and American Grands Prix of 1973.  Scheckter is one of only two F1 drivers to compete under this number, the other being [[Damon Hill]]. During the practice for the American event at the [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] circuit, Frenchman [[François Cevert]], who was due to be Scheckter's Tyrrell teammate for 1974, was killed in an appalling accident at the fast uphill Esses corners. Scheckter was behind Cevert when he crashed, and he stopped his McLaren, got out of his car and attempted to help Cevert out of his destroyed Tyrrell, but the 29-year-old Frenchman had been cut in half by the circuit's poorly installed Armco barriers and was already dead. Witnessing Cevert's dreadful accident left an indelible mark on the South African and caused him to abandon his reckless ways, becoming a more mature and calculating driver as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/283/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ScheckterJody1976-07-31Tyrrell-FordP34.jpg|thumb|Scheckter in the iconic six-wheel [[Tyrrell P34]] at the [[Nürburgring]] in 1976.]]
[[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] in 1974 gave him his first full-time drive in F1. Jody rewarded them with a third-place finish in the Drivers' Championship and a pair of wins in [[1974 Swedish Grand Prix|Sweden]] and [[1974 British Grand Prix|Britain]]. During the year, he scored points in eight consecutive races, one of the longer scoring streaks of the time. A slight off-year followed, although he did become the only South African to win the [[South African Grand Prix]], but his third year with the team in 1976 gave him another third-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. In that season, Tyrrell introduced the most radical car in F1 history, the innovative six-wheeled [[Tyrrell P34]]. Although he later went on record as saying the car was "a piece of junk", Scheckter gave the six-wheeler its only win on Sweden's [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] circuit and in his twelve races with the car, he scored points ten times. This included a thrilling race-long battle for the lead in the [[1976 United States Grand Prix|American Grand Prix]] between himself and his great friend [[James Hunt]].

Scheckter left for [[Walter Wolf (industrialist)|Walter Wolf]]'s new team in 1977 and Scheckter gave the team a win in its maiden race. He won twice more with the team and was often on the podium, but finished second on points behind a more dominant [[Niki Lauda]]. A seventh-place finish with the team in 1978 followed and he left the team after the season to join [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to partner [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in the team's ground effect [[Ferrari 312T|312T4]] car.

Critics felt he would not get along well with the domineering management at Ferrari, but he far surpassed expectations and helped give F1's most recognisable team another Constructors' Championship, while Scheckter's consistent finishes, with three wins among them, gave him the Drivers' Championship in 1979.&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/283/|publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|title=F1 Teams &amp; Drivers Hall of Fame: Jody Schekter|accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he struggled badly in his 1980 title defence, even failing to qualify for one race. After managing only two points, Scheckter announced his retirement from the team and the sport. Scheckter was the last driver to win a Drivers' Championship for Ferrari until [[Michael Schumacher]] twenty-one years later in {{F1|2000}}.

==After Formula One==
===Broadcaster===
In 1981 [[CBS Sports]] hired Scheckter as a Pit reporter for its [[F1]] coverage.

Scheckter was brought in by [[ABC Sports|ABC's]] [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World Of Sports]]  as a Pit reporter for the [[1983 Monaco Grand Prix]].

Scheckter was a guest commentator for ITV during the [[1999 San Marino Grand Prix]], replacing [[Martin Brundle]].

===Other interests===

In 1981, Scheckter won the World [[Superstars]] competition in Key Biscayne, Florida.  He defeated athletes such as [[Russ Francis]], [[Renaldo Nehemiah]], [[Peter Mueller (athlete)|Peter Mueller]], [[Rick Barry]], [[Gaétan Boucher]] and [[Andy Ripley]].  In 1983 he was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].

After Scheckter's retirement, he founded [[FATS Inc]], a company which built firearms training simulators for military, law enforcement and security organisations. The sale of the company provided funds to allow Scheckter to help the racing careers of his sons [[Tomas Scheckter|Tomas]] and [[Toby Scheckter|Toby]].  Tomas raced in the [[Indy Racing League]] where he won two races. Scheckter's brother, [[Ian Scheckter|Ian]], also raced in F1 for a few years.

In 2004 Scheckter was reunited with his championship-winning Ferrari at the South African two-seater F1x2 Charity Grand Prix at [[Kyalami]] in South Africa.

===Present===
Scheckter now spends his time as a [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula One's Jody Scheckter Turns to Meat|publisher=foodmanufacture.co.uk|url=http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/4388/Formula_One's_Jody_Scheckter_turns_to_meat.html|date=1 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223001440/http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/4388/Formula_One's_Jody_Scheckter_turns_to_meat.html|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having bought [[Laverstoke Park Farm]], near [[Overton, Hampshire]], {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} west of London. As an organic farming expert, Scheckter was featured in 2005 on the Visionhealth DVD and TV documentaries "[[Asthma]]: An Integrated Approach", "[[Arthritis]]: An Integrated Approach" and "[[Diabetes]]: An Integrated Approach". On 20 November 2011, he also appeared on the ''[[Countryfile]]'' television show to make a case for [[organic food]].  Laverstoke Park Farm was also featured on BBC's "Escape To the Country" where Jody showed viewers how [[Buffalo Mozzarella]] was made.  In December 2009, Scheckter announced his intention to produce a [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] [[sparkling wine]] by 2012. In 2015 the farm was the setting for ITV's Sugar Free Farm where a group of celebrities had to go sugar free for two weeks whilst working on the farm.  
Embarking on the radical regime were musical theatre star [[Jane McDonald]], comedian [[Rory McGrath]], quiz mastermind and Chaser [[Mark Labbett]], actress [[Tupele Dorgu]], TOWIE's [[James Argent|James 'Arg' Argent]] and actress and singer [[Jennifer Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, James, ''Decanter.com'' (14 December 2009).

'''John Taylor''' or '''Johnie Taylor''' (b. Freetown, Sierra Leone, d. March 12, 1898) was a [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Creole]] merchant based in [[Port Loko]] who was killed during the [[Hut Tax War]] by Bai Bureh's war boys. Taylor was the only Creole who was murdered by Bai Bureh's war boys and his death was said to have been caused by his actions during the uprising.

==Hut Tax War and death==
John Taylor moved from [[Freetown]] and established a store in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. Taylor was killed by Temne "war boys" mustered by [[Bai Bureh]] during the Hut Tax War in 1898. The war boys found Taylor by releasing his pet monkey, which ran upstairs and revealed where he was hiding in his house. Taylor's throat was then cut and he was chopped to pieces by the war boys. Taylor was killed because Bai Bureh's men believed he supported the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in their "hut tax" on all houses. Taylor was also accused of spying and providing information to District Commissioner Sharpe regarding the movement of Bai Bureh's men.

==Family==
Taylor had a daughter called Susan who resided at [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] after her marriage. Taylor was married to Tabitha Mariah Taylor (the daughter of the catechist Charles S. Brown) and the couple had a daughter called Mary Petan Taylor. Mary was five years old when her father was killed in Port Loko.

'''''Light Metal Age''''' is a technical trade magazine exclusively devoted to primary production and semi-fabrication of [[light metals]], specifically [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[magnesium]], [[beryllium]], and their [[alloys]]. However, the main editorial emphasis is [[aluminum]].

Published bimonthly by Fellom Publishing, ''Light Metal Age'' is distributed worldwide to primary and secondary [[smelters]]; casthouses; [[aluminum extrusion|extrusion]] operations; [[rolling mills]]; sheet, rod, and wire mills; and foundries. Recipients are executives, general managers, plant managers, technicians, metallurgists, chemists, and engineers responsible for fabrication, production, and operations in this industry.

== History ==
''Light Metal Age'' was founded in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1943 by Roy Fellom, Jr., owner of Fellom Publishing. Roy Fellom predicted that there would be an increased use of [[light metals]], especially [[aluminum]]. In the first issue of ''Light Metal Age'' in May 1943, he wrote a dedication explaining that the magazine was created to "herald the new LIGHT METAL ERA which shall see these most abundant basic metals brought to the service of man in all the common uses where metal is required."&lt;ref&gt;Fellom, Jr., Roy: "Dedication", page 4. Light Metal Age, 1(1), 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Roy Fellom moved the company from Chicago to [[San Francisco]], California, where it remained until 1989 when the headquarters was moved to [[South San Francisco]], where it is now located.

Roy Fellom was recognized for his dedication to promoting the light metals industry via ''Light Metal Age'' in 1992 with the Maurice H. Roberts Award of Excellence, presented at the Fifth International Aluminum Extrusion Technology Seminar (ET ’92).

In 2000, ''Light Metal Age'' was named the official publication of the Seventh International Aluminum Extrusion Technology Seminar (ET 2000), and was again named the official publication for the subsequent seminars, ET ’04 and ET ’08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.org/assets/media/LMAofficialET08.doc “Light Metal Age Named Official Publication of ET ’08”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718121905/http://www.aec.org/assets/media/LMAofficialET08.doc |date=2011-07-18 }} (DOC), [http://www.aec.org Aluminum Extruders Council], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy Fellom, Jr. died in 1993. ''Light Metal Age'' is carried on by his daughter, Ann Marie Fellom.

In 2006, ''Light Metal Age'' donated Roy Fellom’s extensive library of 692 books covering all topics of light metal production to the [[List of Illinois Institute of Technology buildings|Paul V. Galvin Library]] at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] (IIT) in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightmetalage.com/whatsnew.php?item=6 "Light Metal Age Donates Metallurgical Library to IIT"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713205120/http://www.lightmetalage.com/whatsnew.php?item=6 |date=2011-07-13 }}, ''Light Metal Age'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maid service''', '''cleaning service''', '''apartment cleaning''' and '''janitorial service''' are terms more modernly describing a specialized outside service, providing a specific service to individuals, businesses, fraternal clubs and associations as well residential premises

==History==
Maid services may be different from what is generally thought to be the historically prevalent services performed by a [[maid]], and these services may be provided by both male and/or female individuals.
[[File:Works Progress Administration maid poster cropped.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Stylized drawing of a maid on a [[Works Progress Administration]] poster]]

Once part of an elaborate hierarchy in affluent homes and profitable businesses, today a maid may be the only domestic worker that upper and even middle-income households can afford, as a household domestic-help employee.  Maids perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning, grocery shopping, walking the family dog, and tending to the household children.

==Socio-economic factors==
In the Western world, comparatively few households can afford live-in domestic help employees, in lieu of live-in staff, a maid service is utilized as a periodic cleaner. In developing nations, differences found within income and social status between different socio-economic classes, lesser educated women, with less opportunity are believed to provide a labor source for domestic work.

Socio-economic opportunities, not being confined to any specific global location, may allow cleaning services to perform 'cleaning' as their source of business as a service.

There are thousands of residential cleaning businesses throughout the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Historically and traditionally, cleaning was considered a woman's role, but as more and more women have joined the workforce, the time pressure on families with children has grown, so paying a service for cleaning makes sense to persons who can afford it. Additionally, many modern homeowners lack the proper knowledge to use the safest and most effective cleaning products.
==Services provided==
Maids, ''per se'', perform typical domestic chores such as cooking, ironing, washing, cleaning, folding clothes, grocery shopping, walking the family dog and taking care of children. Some maid services offer hourly, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly work as well.Book Professional and trained Maids from [https://www.springcleaning.ae/ Cleaning Services] Dubai

==Reasons for use==
Utilizing a maid service may be considered due to a number of personal factors, including but not limited to geographical location, social standing, lack of personal time, lack of experience. There are many reasons why individuals may consider hiring help around the house, especially with cleaning. It may, for example, prove easier for them to enjoy time with their family rather than spending time cleaning.

A maid service may be more expensive than simply hiring a part-time [[maid]], but it offers a number of advantages. Usually the service will provide not only someone to do the cleaning, but also all of the necessary cleaning supplies. Also, as a ''bona fide'' employer, the service is responsible for withholding [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and other income taxes. Third, a service is [[insured]] and often [[Surety bond|bonded]], so it can be held accountable if something is [[Theft|stolen]] or missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8861">{{more footnotes|date=February 2016}}'''Management cybernetics''' is the application of [[cybernetics]] to [[management]] and [[organizations]]. "Management cybernetics" was first introduced by [[Stafford Beer]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=rosehead /&gt; Beer developed the theory through a combination of practical applications  and a series of influential books. The practical applications involved steel production, publishing and operations research in a large variety of different industries.

== Research into operations ==

As practiced by Beer, research into operations involved multidisciplinary teams seeking practical assistance for difficult managerial issues. It often involved the development of models borrowed from basic sciences and put into an isomorphic relationships with an organizational situation. Beer initially called this "[[operations research]]" (OR) but, along with [[Russell Ackoff]], became increasingly disenchanted with that term as the field transitioned into one in which a predefined set of mathematical tools was applied to well-formulated problems. Beer's critique of traditional OR, in part, was that it became a matter of experts in mathematics looking for situations that could be conformed to their methods. Beer insisted that what was needed for effective research into operations was to first understand the key dynamics within the situation and only then to select the theory or methods that would allow one to understand that situation in detail. Beer's "Decision and Control", especially chapter six, discusses the methodology in some detail.

== Viable system model ==

Viable means capable of independent existence and implies both maintaining internal stability and adaptation to a changing environment. "Internal stability" and "adaptation" can be in conflict, particularly if the relevant environment is changing rapidly, so the [[viable system model]] (VSM) is about maintaining a balance between the two such that the system is able to survive.

The VSM is a model of the structures and functions that are both necessary and sufficient for the long term survival of a system in a changing environment. Allenna Leonard, Beer's longtime partner, suggested that the most useful way to think about the VSM is as a language. The VSM is a language of viability. The VSM is a language for diagnosing organizations and managerial teams in terms of their viability or lack thereof. The VSM is also a language for designing organizations and managerial teams that will be viable.

== Syntegration ==

One of the great difficulties in managing  the modern large organization is that many of the issues are far too [[complexity|complex]] for even small groups. The critical knowledge is often dispersed among a substantial number of people. Organizations are often faced with choosing between 1) very costly and time-consuming meetings of large groups or 2) making bad decisions based on an inadequate grasp of the relevant factors. Syntegration is a group method designed to solve this conundrum.

Syntegration melds a number of cybernetic principles with [[Bucky Fuller]]'s ideas on [[tensegrity]]. The initial "team [[syntegrity]]" format involved 30 people divided into 12 overlapping teams to deal with some broad and initially ill-defined issue.  The teams and roles within the teams are arranged to achieve the mathematically optimum degree of resonance of information throughout the entire group. In practice, syntegration achieves a remarkable degree of shared understanding of the initial issue. In syntegrations intended to develop a plan of action, the implementation phase is usually very quick and effective, probably because of the shared understanding developed among the participants.

== Learning ==

The literature on management cybernetics is extensive. Beer wrote hundreds of papers and about ten books. Others have contributed perhaps an equal amount.  [[Barry Clemson]], at Beer's urging,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} wrote an introduction to management cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1968|author=Barry Clemson|title=Cybernetics: A new management tool|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VqQpICD5IXgC|isbn=9782881245183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Hoverstadt wrote an introduction using real-life examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Hoverstadt|title=The Fractal Organization:Creating sustainable organizations with the Viable System Model|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-06056-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational cybernetics ==

Organizational cybernetics (OC) is distinguished from management cybernetics. Both use many of the same terms but interpret them according to another philosophy of systems thinking. The full flowering of management cybernetics is represented in Beer's books&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. Jackson]] (1991), ''Systems Methodology for the Management Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational cybernetics studies organizational design, and the regulation and self-regulation of organizations from a [[systems theory]] perspective that also takes the social dimension into consideration. Extending the principles of [[autonomous agency theory]] (AAT), cultural agency theory (CAT) has been formulated for the generation of higher cybernetic orders.&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I, Fink, G. (2014). Personality, pathology and mindsets: – Agency, Personality and Mindscapes, Kybernetes, 43(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers in economics, public administration and political science focus on the changes in institutions, organisation and mechanisms of social steering at various levels (sub-national, national, European, international) and in different sectors (including the private, semi-private and public sectors; the latter sector is emphasised).&lt;ref name = "NSM"&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/imr/programmes/programmes/oc/ Organisational Cybernetics], Nijmegen School of Management, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, much of his financial clout came from the [[SAAR Foundation]], a Herndon-based foundation with Saudi roots. The foundation was a 50-50 partner in many of Hadid's ventures.&lt;ref name=wapo-whois /&gt; In the late 1980s, he faced at least 30 lawsuits from creditors and banks claiming he had not fulfilled various financial obligations.&lt;ref name=wapo-hardtimes&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|title=Hard Times for Developer Mohamed Hadid|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1989/11/20/hard-times-for-developer-mohamed-hadid/f853c2e4-9bbb-4a28-bf25-e9a8bc6ae4d5/|accessdate=26 July 2017|first= Jacqueline L. |last=Salmon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid $150 million for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and New York.

}}'''Pino Tovaglia''' (3 December 1923 - 30 November 1977) was an Italian graphic designer. He is regarded as one of the major exponents of the [[International Typographic Style|Swiss Style]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Born in [[Milan]], Tovaglia was active in the field of graphic design since his youth, first as an assistant of  [[Carlo Carrà]], and then as a collaborator of  [[Marco Zanuso]], [[Giò Ponti]], and the Castiglioni  brothers. From 1946 he was professor of graphic design in several art schools of Milan.&lt;ref name="Vogue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fabia Di Drusco|title=Focus su Pino Tovaglia|url=http://www.vogue.it/uomo-vogue/news/2012/04/pino-tovaglia-triennale|accessdate=14 October 2016|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Tovaglia won the National Prize of Advertising thanks to an advertisement series made for [[Finmeccanica]]. In 1956 he founded the NCPT Studio together with Giulio Confalonieri, Ilio Negri and Michele Provinciali. In 1958 he won the Golden Palm at the  [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Giorgio Fioravanti. "Pino Tovaglia". ''Il dizionario del grafico''. Bologna, Zanichelli, 1993.{{ISBN|88-08-14116-0}}.  p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967 to 1970 Tovaglia was art director of [[Pirelli]], and in the same period he realized famous posters such as ''Italia da salvare'' (1967), ''Cinturato Pirelli'' (1967) and ''Brandy Stock'' (1970). In 1972 he realized the restyling of the [[Alfa Romeo]] logo, while in 1975 he designed the symbol of the [[Lombardy Region]] in collaboration with [[Bruno Munari]], [[Bob Noorda]] and Roberto Sambonet.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

A member of [[Alliance Graphique Internationale]], in 1998 he was awarded a posthumous [[Compasso d'Oro]] for his career. A collection consisting in over 13,000 pieces is kept at the CSAC (Study Center and Archives of Communication) of the [[University of Parma]], and several of his works are part of the permanent collection at [[MoMa]], New York.&lt;ref name="Vogue"/&gt;

'''Preference regression''' is a statistical technique used by marketers to determine consumers’ [[Preference|preferred]] core benefits. It usually supplements  [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]] techniques like [[multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|multi dimensional scaling]] or [[factor analysis]] and is used to create ideal vectors on [[perceptual mapping|perceptual maps]].

==Application==
Starting with raw data from surveys, researchers apply positioning techniques to determine important dimensions and plot the position of competing [[product (business)|products]] on these dimensions. Next they [[regression analysis|regress]] the survey data against the dimensions. The independent variables are the data collected in the survey. The dependent variable is the preference datum. Like all regression methods, the computer fits weights to best predict data. The resultant regression line is referred to as an ideal vector because the slope of the vector is the ratio of the preferences for the two dimensions.

If all the data is used in the regression, the program will derive a single equation and hence a single ideal vector. This tends to be a blunt instrument so researchers refine the process with [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]]. This creates clusters that reflect [[market segment]]s. Separate preference regressions are then done on the data within each segment. This provides an ideal vector for each segment.

==Alternative methods==
[[Self-stated importance method]] is an alternative method in which direct survey data is used to determine the weightings rather than statistical imputations. A third method is [[conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]] in which an additive method is used.

==Work==
Rose produces video installations juxtaposing images and sounds demonstrating that life is complex and intricate.&lt;ref name=NYTDistraction /&gt; Whitney curator Christopher Y. Lew approved of “how she was able to gather such a mix of images, and of content as well, and weave it into a unique narrative. She pulled some kind of order out of our whirlpool of information, without ever denying the flood".&lt;ref name=NYTDistraction /&gt; Rose's videos consist of original footage and found material combined to depict an autonomous perspective using language and technology.&lt;ref name=flash&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.flashartonline.com/article/it-looked-like-a-universe/| title=It Looked Like a Universe| date=October 2015| publisher=Flash Art| access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her experiential pieces work to convey sensorial aspects of ideas by manipulating sound and image.&lt;ref name=bomb/&gt; Her imagery depicts "humanity's shard current anxieties and their multi-layered interconnectivity" as well as humanities' relationship to the natural world, advancing technology, mortality, and history.&lt;ref name=mousse/&gt; Each video is driven by an intense period of research centered on a subject, theory or belief.&lt;ref name=flash/&gt;

The [[Taipei Fine Arts Museum|Taipei]] Biennial exhibition featured Rose's 2013 video, ''Sitting Feeding Sleeping'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/taipei-biennial-2014/| title=Taipei Biennial 2014| author=Kevin McGarry| date=December 26, 2014| publisher=Art in America| access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which debuted at the artist's graduate thesis exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1070745/reel-to-real-rachel-roses-trippy-videos-have-painterly-roots| title=Reel to Real: Rachel Rose's Trippy Videos Have Painterly Roots| author=Wendy Vogel| date=January 3, 2015| publisher=Blouin Art Info| access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose's 2014 video ''Palisades in Palisades'' focused on the human relationship with the natural world and was shot in [[Palisades Interstate Park]] in New Jersey.

{{distinguish|Restructuring}}

'''Reconstruction''' in [[law]] refers typically to the transfer of a company's (or several companies') business to a new company. The old company will get put into liquidation, and shareholders will agree to take shares of equivalent value in the new company.

In [[UK company law]], the governing provisions are in the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], ss. 110–111. The sanction of a court is not required (unlike under a so-called "[[scheme of arrangement]]", which could or creditors). Yet if a shareholder objects, he or she may require a cash payment instead of shares. Creditors who object to have their debts transferred to a new company can demand satisfactions during the old company's liquidation.

Small private companies, family companies and investment trusts often use the procedure. The purposes can vary, from changing the objects of the business, varying share class rights, or reorganize before a [[demerger]] takes place.

'''Ruth McCormick Simms''' (née '''Ruth Hanna'''; March 27, 1880 &amp;ndash; December 31, 1944) was a [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] from [[Illinois]] and active in the [[women's suffrage]] movement.

==Early life and education==
Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms was the daughter of Senator [[Mark Hanna]] and the wife of Senator [[Joseph M. McCormick|Joseph Medill McCormick]] and later of Congressman [[Albert Gallatin Simms]], hence her maiden name, Ruth Hanna, and name upon death, Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms, are also seen in the literature.

McCormick was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] where she attended [[Hathaway Brown School]]. Later, she attended [[The Masters School]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]] and the [[Miss Porter's School]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]]. She owned and operated a [[Dairy farming|dairy]] and breeding farm near [[Byron, Illinois]] and was the publisher and president of the [[Rockford Consolidated Newspapers]] in [[Rockford, Illinois]].

In 1903 she married [[Joseph M. McCormick|Joseph "Medill" McCormick]]. They had three children: 
*[[Bazy Tankersley|Ruth "Bazy" McCormick Miller Tankersley]], (1921–2013) She was publisher of the Washington Times-Herald and founded [[Al-Marah Arabians]], a breeding and training farm for [[Arabian horse]]s now in [[Tucson, Arizona]], which is still operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=...&amp;nbsp;and Ride Away Singing |last=Parkinson |first=Mary Jane |year=1998 |publisher=Arabian Horse Owners Foundation |isbn=978-1-930140-00-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Katrina McCormick (1913–2011), who married Courtland Dixon Barnes, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Katrina|title=Katrina McCormick Weds Courtland Dixon Barnes, Jr.|url=http://www.tarzan.org/pdf/19350615.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Syracuse Herald|date=June 15, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Medill McCormick, called "Johnny," died in a mountain-climbing accident in 1938.
Medill served in both the [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] prior to his death at age 47 on February 25, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= National Affairs: Medill McCormick |date= March 9, 1925 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751256,00.html |accessdate= January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not publicized as such at the time, his death was considered a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{CongBio |M000369 |inline=please}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Ruth McCormick served as the chairman of the first woman's executive committee of the [[Republican National Committee]], and an associate member of the national committee 1919-1924, in the latter year becoming the first elected national committeewoman from Illinois and served until 1928. She was an active worker for the suffrage amendment from 1913 until the [[United States Constitution]] was amended. From 1913 to 1914, she served as head of the [[United States congressional committee|Congressional Committee]] for the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). She took over leadership from [[Alice Paul]], who went on to form the [[Congressional Union]] as a separate national suffrage organization. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, she produced an eight-reel [[melodrama]] ''Your Girl and Mine'', which was intended to help gain support for the suffrage movement. The film never circulated broadly, despite critical praise from contemporary film reviewers, because the distribution agreement between NAWSA and the [[World Film Company]] fell apart shortly after the premiere in 1914 and the film was confined to private screenings.

McCormick was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[71st United States Congress|Seventy-first Congress]]  and served from March 4, 1929 to March 3, 1931 for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], at-large from Illinois.  She defeated [[Charles S. Deneen]] in the 1930 Republican primary, but lost the November election to James Hamilton Lewis.  She resumed her newspaper interests. In 1932, she married [[Albert Gallatin Simms]], of [[New Mexico]], who was also a Member of the Seventy-first Congress and resided in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="House.gov"&gt;http://history.house.gov/People/Listing/M/McCORMICK,-Ruth-Hanna-(M000372)/&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to New Mexico with Simms to a ranch in northern Albuquerque. The property would become [[Los Poblanos Historic Inn &amp; Organic Farm|Los Poblanos]], designed by [[John Gaw Meem]] in the [[Pueblo Revival architecture|Pueblo Revival Style]]. In 1932, she founded Sandia School, later becoming the [[Sandia Preparatory School]]. In 1938, she founded [[Manzano Day School]]. [[Albuquerque Academy]]'s land was donated by the Simms' and [[Albuquerque Little Theatre]] was also founded by Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Mexico Chiles: History, Legend and Lore|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xIUcCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|date = 2015-07-20|isbn = 9781625853530|first = Kelly|last = Urig}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran a radio station and two newspapers in this period and later purchased a 250,000–acre cattle and sheep ranch in Colorado.&lt;ref name="House.gov"/&gt;  She developed [[pancreatitis]] following a fall from a horse in 1944,&lt;ref name="House.gov"/&gt; and died in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on December 31, 1944.  She was buried in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==Early life==

Born in 1863 in [[Nuremberg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], Siegfried Bettmann moved to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1885,&lt;ref name="Triumph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumph.co.uk/australia/1531.aspx|title=About Triumph|accessdate=5 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821040348/http://www.triumph.co.uk/australia/1531.aspx|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in [[Coventry]], [[Warwickshire]]. He found work with Kelly &amp; Co. compiling foreign directories for their publications. After six months, he obtained a job with the White Sewing Machine Co. as a translator and worked as the company's sales representative in [[northern Europe]]. Fluent in several languages, he perfected his English, married a local woman, Annie Meyrick (known as Millie).&lt;ref name="Gloria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/terryreeves.htm|title=Triumph and Gloria|accessdate=5 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108172730/http://www.hellfire-corner.demon.co.uk/terryreeves.htm|archivedate=8 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==

Bettmann founded S. Bettmann &amp; Co and started selling bicycles by the name 'Triumph' from premises in London.  In 1886, Bettmann sought a more general name, and the company became known as the [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph Cycle Company]]. A year later, the company registered as the New Triumph Co. Ltd., with funding from the [[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company]]. In that year, Bettmann was joined by a native from Papenburg named Johann Moritz Schulte, as a partner. Schulte encouraged Bettmann to transform Triumph into a manufacturing company, and in 1888 Bettmann purchased a site in Coventry using money lent by his and Schulte's families. The company began producing the first Triumph-branded bicycles in 1889. In 1896, Triumph initiated a subsidiary, [[Triumph (TWN)|Orial TWN (Triumph Werke Nuremberg)]] a [[:de:Triumph (D)|German subsidiary]] for cycle production in his native city.

In 1902 the company diversified into making motorcycles at their works in Much Park Street.  In 1902 the first Triumph motorcycle was developed.  It was a strengthened bicycle with a 2.25&amp;nbsp;bhp [[Minerva]] engine.&lt;ref name="Triumph"/&gt; Once the business grew the purchased engines were replaced with their own and in 1907 the company expanded into a new factory in Priory Street, in premises of a former mill.
[[Image:Triumph 1922 H 1.jpg|thumb|left|1922 Triumph H 1]]
At the beginning of [[World War I]] the War Office called a meeting of [[Coventry]] industrialists at St Mary's Hall and asked them to put their resources at the disposal of the military and two weeks after Britain had declared war on Germany, Bettmann received a telephone call from Capt. C. V. Holdsworth of the Army Service Corps, (who later became Triumph's managing director) with an order for a hundred Triumph motorcycles for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] who were soon to go to France. Despite being a Saturday afternoon, Bettmann and his staff worked non-stop to crate the required motorcycles and by Sunday evening they were delivered to Coventry railway station in time for the evening train.&lt;ref name="Gloria" /&gt; The British Army subsequently placed large orders for the Triumph 550 cc Model H and by 1918 they were Britain's largest motorcycle manufacturer.
[[Image:Triumph.Gloria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Triumph Gloria]]]]
In 1921 Bettmann further diversified into car production and bought the Dawson Car Company to produce the Triumph 10/20. In 1927 he developed the Triumph Super 7 which sold well until 1934. In 1930 the company changed its name to the Triumph Motor Company and produced the Triumph Southern Cross and Gloria ranges. In 1936 the company had financial problems however and in 1936 the Triumph bicycle and motorcycle businesses were both sold. The motorcycle business was bought by [[Jack Sangster]] of [[Ariel Motorcycles]] to become [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd]].

==Later life==

Siegfried Bettmann's success enabled him to become President of the Coventry [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Association. A [[Freemason]] and founder member of Coventry's [[Chamber of Commerce]], he was also a [[Justice of the Peace]] and in 1913 became [[Mayor of Coventry]], the first non-British subject to have the position.&lt;ref name="Gloria" /&gt;

His German origins resulted in him being removed from this position on the beginning of the [[First World War]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=46628|title=Siegfried Bettmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1914 Siegfried Bettmann founded the Annie Bettmann Foundation with his wife to help young Coventry men and women between the ages of eighteen and forty who wished to start a business. Preference was given to ex-servicemen and the fund, which is still in existence, was extended subsequently to include grants for further education.&lt;ref name="Gloria" /&gt; Bettmann also commissioned a memorial for the 66 employees of the Triumph company killed in action during the First World War, built in Coventry's London Road cemetery in 1921.&lt;ref name="Gloria" /&gt;

The Triumph Motorcycle Company became one of the most famous motorcycle marques of the world and Bettmann retained an association with the company until his death.&lt;ref name="Triumph over adversity"/&gt; Siegfried Bettmann died on 23 September 1951 at his home "Elm Bank", Stoke Park, [[Coventry]].&lt;ref&gt;Death notice published in ''The Times'', 25 September 1951&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2015 the Coventry Society installed a [[Blue Plaque]] onto this residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sigfried Bettman's Home Gets Blue Plaque|url=http://www.coventrysociety.org.uk/news/article/bettmanns-home-gets-blue-plaque.html|publisher=Coventry Society|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Store brands''', also called '''own brands''',{{cn|date=October 2018}} are [[private label]] brands managed solely by a retailer for sale in only a specific chain of stores. The retailer will design the manufacturing, packaging and marketing of the goods in order to build on the relationship between the products and the store's customer base. Store-brand goods are generally cheaper than national-brand goods, because the retailer can optimize the production to suit [[consumer]] demand and reduce [[advertising]] costs. Goods sold under a store brand are subject to the same regulatory oversight as goods sold under a national brand. Consumer demand for store brands might be related to individual characteristics such as demographics and socioeconomic variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baltas|first1=George|title=A combined segmentation and demand model for store brands|journal=European Journal of Marketing|date=2003|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1499–1513|doi=10.1108/03090560310487211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[Image:Wal-Hist package.jpg|thumb|right|Wal-Hist, store-brand antihistamine medication from [[Walgreens]]]]
A Food Marketing Institute study found that store brands account for an average of 14.5 percent of in store sales with some stores projecting they will soon reach as high as 20 percent of all sales.&lt;ref name="sbd"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Store branding is a [[Product life cycle management|mature industry]]; consequently, some store brands have been able to position themselves as premium brands. Sometimes store-branded goods mimic the shape, packaging, and labeling of national brands, or get premium display treatment from retailers. (For example, "Dr. Thunder" and "Mountain Lightning" are the names of the [[Sam's Choice]] store brand equivalents of [[Dr Pepper]] and [[Mountain Dew]], respectively.)

==Economic assessment==
Research has found that some retailers{{Who|date=December 2009}} believe that, while advertising by premium national brands brings shoppers to the store, the retailer typically makes more profit by selling the shopper a store brand. This assumption has led to a spurt in the academic and trade literature on the subject of positioning the store brand as compared with the national brand.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] publishes research on store branding and store positioning.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, while store brands are usually cheaper than national (or even regional) brands, they remain more expensive than [[generic brand]]s sold at the store. (e.g. [[Pittsburgh]]-based [[Giant Eagle]] selling their store brands for less than national brands but more than [[Topco Associates, LLC|Topco]]'s ''Valu Time'' generic brand.)

Grocery chains such as [[Aldi]] and [[Save-A-Lot]] primarily sell store brands to promote overall lower prices, compared to [[supermarket]] chains that sell several brands. [[Richelieu Foods]], for example, is a [[private label]] company producing frozen pizza, salad dressing, sauces, marinades, condiments and deli salads for other companies, including [[Hy-Vee]], Aldi, Save-A-Lot, [[Sam's Club]],&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite web

Another example is [[President's Choice]] in Canada, a major shop brand found in Loblaw group supermarkets.

==Advantages of private branding==
Private branding means a large [[distribution (business)|distribution channel]] member (usually a [[retailer]]) buys from a manufacturer in bulk and puts its own name on the product. This strategy is generally only practical when the retailer does very high volume of sales. The advantages to the retailer are:
*more freedom and flexibility in [[pricing]]
*more control over product attributes and quality
*higher margins (or lower selling price)
*eliminates much of the manufacturer's promotional costs
* can fill category gaps that are not being filled by National Brands
* can aid in differentiation for the retailer as exclusive lines that are only available at that retailer
* can keep the National Brands competitive and innovative as they will now be fighting for shelf space with the Private Brands
The advantages to the manufacturer are:
*reduced promotional costs
*stability of sales volume (at least while the contract is operative)
* increase production capacity if not currently running at 100%
* can grow smaller local businesses as retailer would prefer using non National Branded manufacturers

'''Temporary Assistance for Needy Families''' ('''TANF''' {{IPAc-en||t|æ|n|f}}) is one of the [[United States of America]]'s [[federal assistance]] programs.  It began on July 1, 1997, and succeeded the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program, providing cash assistance to indigent American families through the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2011. "TANF". Accessed 12/9/2011 from {{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314134457/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cash benefit is often referred to simply as "welfare."

TANF was created by the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] instituted under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 1996. The Act provides temporary financial assistance while aiming to get people off of that assistance, primarily through employment. There is a maximum of 60 months of benefits within one's lifetime, but some states have instituted shorter periods.&lt;ref&gt;http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/are-safety-nets-working.html Are "Safety Nets" Working. CQ Researcher Blog&lt;/ref&gt;  The reform granted states wide discretion of how to distribute TANF entitlements. States also have the authority to eliminate payments to recipients altogether. Under the new act, TANF recipients are required to find a job within 24 months of receiving aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Dorothy|title=Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty|year=1997|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In enforcing the 60-month time limit, some states place limits on the adult portion of the assistance only, while still aiding the otherwise eligible children in the household.

==Background==
Prior to TANF, [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] was a major [[federal assistance]] program that was coming under heavy criticism. Some argued that such programs were ineffective, promoted dependency on the government, and encouraged behaviors detrimental to escaping from [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mead |first=Lawrence M. |year=1986 |title=Beyond Entitlement: The Social Obligations of Citizenship |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-02-920890-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7VD5plVv_YC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people also argued that TANF is detrimental to its recipients because using these programs have a stigma attached to them, which makes the people that use them less likely to participate politically to defend this program, and thus the programs have been subsequently weakened.  Beginning with President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration and continuing through the first few years of the Clinton administration, growing dissatisfaction with AFDC, particularly the rise in welfare caseloads, led an increasing number of states to seek waivers from AFDC rules to allow states to more stringently enforce work requirements for welfare recipients. The 27 percent increase in caseloads between 1990 and 1994 accelerated the push by states to implement more radical [[welfare reform]].&lt;ref name="Blank2002"/&gt;

States that were granted waivers from AFDC program rules to run mandatory welfare-to-work programs were also required to rigorously evaluate the success of their programs. As a result, many types of mandatory welfare-to-work programs were evaluated in the early 1990s. While reviews of such programs found that almost all programs led to significant increases in employment and reductions in welfare rolls, there was little evidence that income among former welfare recipients had increased. In effect, increases in earnings from jobs were offset by losses in public income, leading many to conclude that these programs had no anti-poverty effects.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Dan and Charles Michalopoulos. 2001. ''How Welfare and Work Policies Affect Employment and Income: A Synthesis of Research''. New York: Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; However, the findings that welfare-to-work programs did have some effect in reducing dependence on government increased support among policymakers for moving welfare recipients into employment.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordschool.umich.edu/research/pdf/Isrconference.pdf|last=Danziger|first=Sheldon|title=Welfare Reform Policy from Nixon to Clinton: What Role for Social Science?|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy]]|date=December 1999|accessdate=2011-12-11}} Paper prepared for Conference, "The Social Science and Policy Making". Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, March 13–14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

While liberals and conservatives agreed on the importance of transitioning families from government assistance to jobs, they disagreed on how to accomplish this goal. Liberals thought that welfare reform should expand opportunities for welfare mothers to receive training and work experience that would help them raise their families' living standards by working more and at higher wages.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998"/&gt; Conservatives emphasized work requirements and time limits, paying little attention to whether or not families' incomes increased. More specifically, conservatives wanted to impose a five-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits and provide block grants for states to fund programs for poor families.&lt;ref name ="NW"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Institute for Policy Research |publisher=Northwestern University |title=A Look Back at Welfare Reform |year=2008 |volume=30 |issue=1 |accessdate=2011-10-11 |url=http://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/publications/docs/newsletter/NLW08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives argued that welfare to work reform would be beneficial by creating role models out of mothers, promoting maternal self-esteem and sense of control, and introducing productive daily routines into family life. Furthermore, they argued that reforms would eliminate welfare dependence by sending a powerful message to teens and young women to postpone childbearing. Liberals responded that the reform sought by conservatives would overwhelm severely stressed parents, deepen the poverty of many families, and force young children into unsafe and unstimulating child care situations. In addition, they asserted that welfare reform would reduce parents' ability to monitor the behaviors of their children, leading to problems in child and adolescent functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Greg J. and P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale. 2001. "For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families." In ''For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of children and Families''. New York: [[Russell Sage Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, as a presidential candidate, Bill Clinton pledged to "end welfare as we know it" by requiring families receiving welfare to work after two years. As president, Clinton was attracted to welfare expert and [[Harvard University]] Professor [[David T. Ellwood|David Ellwood]]'s proposal on welfare reform and thus Clinton eventually appointed Ellwood to co-chair his welfare task force. Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system. He advocated providing assistance to families for a limited time, after which recipients would be required to earn wages from a regular job or a work opportunity program.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998" /&gt; Low wages would be supplemented by expanded tax credits, access to subsidized childcare and health insurance, and guaranteed child support.

In 1994, Clinton introduced a welfare reform proposal that would provide job training coupled with time limits and subsidized jobs for those having difficulty finding work, but it was defeated.&lt;ref name ="NW" /&gt; Later that year, when Republicans attained a Congressional majority in November 1994, the focus shifted toward the Republican proposal to end [[entitlement]]s to assistance, repeal AFDC and instead provide states with blocks grants.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" &gt;Greenberg, Mark et al. 2000. Welfare Reauthorization: An Early Guide to the Issues. Center for Law and Social Policy&lt;/ref&gt; The debates in Congress about welfare reform centered around five themes:&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" /&gt;
* '' '''Reforming Welfare to Promote Work and Time Limits:''' '' The welfare reform discussions were dominated by the perception that the then-existing cash assistance program, AFDC, did not do enough to encourage and require employment, and instead incentivized non-work. Supporters of welfare reform also argued that AFDC fostered divorce and out-of-wedlock birth, and created a culture of dependency on government assistance. Both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans emphasized the need to transform the cash assistance system into a work-focused, time-limited program.
* '' '''Reducing Projected Spending:''' '' Republicans argued that projected federal spending for low-income families needed to be reduced because it was too high and that this reduction was necessary to reduce federal spending.
[[File:Clinton prwora.PNG|thumb|250px|right|President [[Bill Clinton]] signing welfare reform legislation.]]
* '' '''Promoting Parental Responsibility:''' '' There was broad agreement among politicians that both parents should support their children. For custodial parents, this meant an emphasis on work and cooperation with child support enforcement. For non-custodial parents, it meant a set of initiatives to strengthen the effectiveness of the child support enforcement.
* '' '''Addressing Out-of-Wedlock Birth:''' '' Republicans argued that out of wedlock birth was presenting an increasingly serious social problem and that the federal government should work to reduce out-of-wedlock births.
* '' '''Promoting Devolution:''' '' A common theme in the debates was that the federal government had failed and that states were more successful in providing for the needy, and thus reform needed to provide more power and authority to states to shape such policy.

Clinton twice vetoed the welfare reform bill put forward by Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. Then just before the Democratic Convention he signed a third version after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] voted 74-24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00232|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|work=senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] voted 256-170&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll331.xml&lt;/ref&gt;  in favor of welfare reform legislation, formally known as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] of 1996 (PRWORA).  Clinton signed the bill into law on August 22, 1996. PRWORA replaced AFDC with TANF and dramatically changed the way the federal government and states determine eligibility and provide aid for needy families.

Before 1997, the federal government designed the overall program requirements and guidelines, while states administered the program and determined eligibility for benefits.  Since 1997, states have been given block grants and both design and administer their own programs.  Access to welfare and amount of assistance varied quite a bit by state and locality under AFDC, both because of the differences in state standards of need and considerable subjectivity in caseworker evaluation of qualifying "suitable homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lieberman |first=Robert |title=Shifting the Color Line: Race and the American Welfare State |location=Boston |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-674-00711-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, welfare recipients under TANF are actually in completely different programs depending on their state of residence, with different social services available to them and different requirements for maintaining aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Darren S. "Aid to Families with Dependent Children (ADFC)", in ''Encyclopedia of Health Care Management'', ed. Michael J. Stahl. SAGE Publications, 2003, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and eligibility==
[[File:Welfare Benefits Payments Graph.gif|thumb|250px|Evolution of monthly [[AFDC]] and [[TANF]] benefits in the USA (in 2006 dollars)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators08/apa.shtml#ftanf2 2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence] Figure TANF 2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

PRWORA replaced AFDC with TANF and ended entitlement to cash assistance for low-income families, meaning that some families may be denied aid even if they are eligible. Under TANF, states have broad discretion to determine who is eligible for benefits and services. In general, states must use funds to serve families with children, with the only exceptions related to efforts to reduce non-marital childbearing and promote marriage. States cannot use TANF funds to assist most legal immigrants until they have been in the country for at least five years. TANF sets forth the following work requirements in order to qualify for benefits:&lt;ref name="Schott"&gt;Schott, Liz. 2011. Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Accessed 11/2/2011 from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=936&lt;/ref&gt;

# Recipients (with few exceptions) must work as soon as they are job ready or no later than two years after coming on assistance.
# Single parents are required to participate in work activities for at least 30 hours per week. Two-parent families must participate in work activities 35 or 55 hours a week, depending upon circumstance.
# Failure to participate in work requirements can result in a reduction or termination of benefits to the family.
# States, in [[fiscal year]] 2004, have to ensure that 50 percent of all families and 90 percent of two-parent families are participating in work activities. If a state meets these goals without restricting eligibility, it can receive a caseload reduction credit. This credit reduces the minimum participation rates the state must achieve to continue receiving federal funding.

While states are given more flexibility in the design and implementation of public assistance, they must do so within various provisions of the law:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

[[File:TANF Program Spending.png|thumb|right|TANF Program Spending&lt;ref name="Schott" /&gt;]]

Since these four goals are deeply general, "states can use TANF funds much more broadly than the core welfare reform areas of providing a safety net and connecting families to work; some states use a substantial share of funding for these other services and program".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-an-introduction-to-tanf|title=Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF|date=2008-11-17|work=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for TANF underwent several changes from its predecessor, AFDC. Under AFDC, states provided cash assistance to families with children, and the federal government paid half or more of all program costs.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" /&gt; Federal spending was provided to states on an open-ended basis, meaning that funding was tied to the number of caseloads. Federal law mandated that states provide some level of cash assistance to eligible poor families but states had broad discretion in setting the benefit levels. Under TANF, states qualify for block grants. The funding for these block grants are fixed and the amount each state receives is based on the level of federal contributions to the state for the AFDC program in 1994&lt;ref&gt;Loprest, Pamela, Stefanie Schmidt, and Anne Dryden White. 2000. "Welfare Reform under PRWORA: Aid to Children with Working Families?" in ''Tax Policy and the Economy'' edited by James M. Poterba: 157-203&lt;/ref&gt;  States are required to  maintain their spending for welfare programs at 80 percent of their 1994 spending levels, with a reduction to 75 percent if states meet other work-participation requirements. States have greater flexibility in deciding how they spend funds as long as they meet the provisions of TANF described above.

In July 2012, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] released a memo notifying states that they are able to apply for a waiver for the work requirements of the TANF program. Critics claim the waiver would allow states to provide assistance without having to enforce the work component of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republicans accuse HHS of gutting welfare reform with quiet policy change |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/13/republicans-accuse-hhs-gutting-welfare-reform-with-quiet-policy-change/ |work=FoxNews.com |date=July 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration has stipulated that any waivers that weaken the work requirement will be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romney's starting his race to the bottom

==Impact==
Discussions about the effectiveness of TANF by policymakers and proponents of welfare reform has centered on the rapid decline in the number of families on welfare since TANF went into effect. Indeed, if measured by the reduction in welfare caseloads, TANF has been a success. Between 1996 and 2000, the number of welfare recipients plunged by 6.5 million, or 53% nationally. Furthermore, the number of caseloads was lower in 2000 than at any time since 1969, and the percentages of persons receiving public assistance income (less than 3%) was the lowest on record.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002"&gt;Lichter, Daniel T. and Rukamalie Jayakody. 2002. "Welfare Reform: How Do We Measure Success?" ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 28:117-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the implementation of TANF occurred during a period of strong economic growth, there are questions about how much of the decline in caseloads is attributable to TANF program requirements. First, the number of caseloads began declining after 1994, the year with the highest number of caseloads, well before the enactment of TANF, suggesting that TANF was not solely responsible for the caseload decline.&lt;ref name ="Blank2002"&gt;Blank, Rebecca. 2002. "Evaluating Welfare Reform in the United States." Journal of Economic Literature, American Economic Association 40(4): 1105-116&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that both changes in welfare policy and economic growth played a substantial role in this decline, and that no larger than one-third of the decline in caseloads is attributable to TANF&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bavier2001"&gt;Bavier, Richard. 2001. "Welfare Reform Data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation." Monthly Labor Review (July): 13-24&lt;/ref&gt;

While declining caseloads dominates discussion about TANF's effect, declining caseloads are an incomplete and misleading indicator of TANF's success. Caseload reductions indicate less reliance on government assistance, but they do not account for the well-being of poor families and children. As such, other factors have been taken into account in assessing the impact of TANF: work, earnings, and poverty of former welfare-recipients; marriage and fertility of mothers; well-being of mothers; and child well-being.

===Work, earnings, and poverty===
One of the major goals of TANF was to increase work among welfare recipients. During the post-welfare reform period, employment did increase among single mothers.  Single mothers with children showed little changes in their labor force participation rates throughout the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, but between 1994-1999, their labor force participation rose by 10%.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; Among welfare recipients, the percentage that reported earnings from employment increased from 6.7% in 1990 to 28.1% by 1999.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; While employment of TANF recipients increased in the early years of reform, it declined in the later period after reform, particularly after 2000. From 2000-2005, employment among TANF recipients declined by 6.5%.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007"&gt;Acs, Gregory and Pamela Loprest. 2007. "TANF Caseload Composition and Leavers Synthesis Report". The Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Among welfare leavers, it was estimated that close to two-thirds worked at a future point in time&lt;ref name="Moffitt2000"&gt;Moffitt, Robert A. and Jennifer Roff. 2000. "The Diversity of Welfare Leavers, Welfare Children, and Families: A Three City Study." Johns Hopkins University Policy Brief 00-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devere, Christine. 2001. "Welfare Reform Research: What Do We Know About Those Who Leave Welfare?" CRS Report for Congress. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research service&lt;/ref&gt;  About 20 percent of welfare leavers are not working, without a spouse, and without any public assistance.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007" /&gt; Those who left welfare because of sanctions (time limits or failure to meet program requirements) fared comparably worse than those who left welfare voluntarily. Sanctioned welfare recipients have employment rates that are, on average, 20 percent below those who left for reasons other than sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Tweedie, Jack. 2001. "Sanctions and Exists: What States Know about Families that leave Welfare Because of Sanctions and Time Limits." In ''For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

While the participation of many low-income single parents in the labor market has increased, their earnings and wages remained low, and their employment was concentrated in low-wage occupations and industries. Over three quarters (78 percent) of employed low-income single parents were concentrated in 4 typically low-wage occupations: service; administrative support and clerical; operators, fabricators, and laborers; and sales and related jobs.&lt;ref name="Peterson2002"&gt;Peterson, Janice et al. 2002. Life After Welfare Reform: Low-income Single Parent Families, Pre- and Post-TANF. Institute for Women's Policy Research #D446&lt;/ref&gt; While the average income among TANF recipients increased over the early years of reform, it has become stagnant in the later period; for welfare leavers, their average income remained steady or declined in the later years.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007" /&gt; Studies that compared household income (includes welfare benefits) before and after leaving welfare find that between one-third and one-half of welfare leavers had decreased income after leaving welfare.&lt;ref name="Bavier2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancian2000"&gt;
Cancian, Maria. 2000. Before and After TANF: The Economic Well-Being of Women Leaving Welfare. Institute for Research on Poverty. Special Report no.77&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, poverty among single-mother and their families declined rapidly from 35.4% in 1992 to 24.7% in 2000, a new historic low.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; However, due to the fact that low-income mothers who left welfare are likely to be concentrated in low-wage occupations, the decline in public assistance caseloads has not translated easily into reduction in poverty. The number of poor female-headed families with children dropped from 3.8 million to 3.1 million between 1994 and 1999, a 22% decline compared to a 48% decline in caseloads.&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt; As a result, the share of [[working poor]] in the U.S. population rose, as some women left public assistance for employment but remained poor.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; Most studies have found that poverty is quite high among welfare leavers. Depending on the source of the data, estimates of poverty among leavers vary from about 48% to 74%.&lt;ref name="Moffitt2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Loprest 2001"&gt;Loprest, Pamela. 2001.

===Marriage and fertility===

A major impetus for welfare reform was concern about increases in out-of-wedlock births and declining marriage rates, especially among low-income women.  The major goals of the 1996 legislation included reducing out-of-wedlock births and increasing rates and stability of marriages.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt;

Studies have produced only modest or inconsistent evidence that marital and cohabitation decisions are influenced by welfare program policies.  Schoeni and Blank (2003) found that pre-1996 welfare waivers were associated with modest increases in probabilities of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoeni |first=Robert F. |first2=Rebecca M. |last2=Blank |title=What Has Welfare Reform Accomplished? Impacts on Welfare Participation, Employment, Income, Poverty, and Family Structure |work=PSC Research Report |volume=No. 03-544 |date=December 2003 |url=http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/pdf/rr03-544.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a similar analysis of post-TANF effect revealed less consistent results. Nationally, only 0.4% of closed cases gave marriage as the reason for leaving welfare.&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt; Using data on marriage and divorces from 1989-2000 to examine the role of welfare reform on marriage and divorce, Bitler (2004) found that both state waivers and TANF program requirements were associated with reductions in transitions into marriage and reductions from marriage to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Bitler, Marianne. 2004. "The Impact of Welfare Reform on Marriage and Divorce". ''Demography'' 41(2):213-236&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals who were not married were more likely to stay unmarried, and those who were married were more likely to stay married. Her explanation behind this, which is consistent with other studies, is that after reform single women were required to work more, increasing their income and reducing their incentive to give up independence for marriage, whereas for married women, post-reform there was potentially a significant increase in the number of hours they would have to work when single, discouraging divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Harknett, K. and L.A. Gennetian. 2003. "How An Earning Supplement Can Affect Union Formation Among Low-Income Single Mothers." Demography 40:451-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, D. T. and C. Jencks. 2001. "The Growing Differences in Family Structure: What Do We Know? Where Do We Look for Answers?" Unpublished manuscript, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to marriage and divorce, welfare reform was also concerned about unwed childbearing. Specific provisions in TANF were aimed at reducing unwed childbearing. For example, TANF provided cash bonuses to states with the largest reductions in unwed childbearing that are not accompanied by more abortions. States were also required to eliminate cash benefits to unwed teens under age 18 who did not reside with their parents. TANF allowed states to impose family caps on the receipt of additional cash benefits from unwed childbearing. Between 1994 and 1999, unwed childbearing among teenagers declined 20 percent among 15- to 17-year-olds and 10 percent among 18- and 19-year-olds.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt;  In a comprehensive cross-state comparison, Horvath-Rose &amp; Peters (2002) studied nonmarital birth ratios with and without family cap waivers over the 1986-1996 period, and they found that family caps reduced nonmarital ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath-Rose, A. and HE Peters. 2002. "Welfare waivers and nonmarital fertility". in ''For Better and For Worse: Welfare Reform and Well-Being of Children and Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 222-245&lt;/ref&gt;  Any fears that family caps would lead to more abortions was allayed by declining numbers and rates of abortion  during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, S. K. 2001. ''Birth and abortion data. In Data Needs for Measuring Family and Fertility Change After Welfare Reform'', ed. D. J. Basharov. College Park, MD: Welfare Reform Academy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child well-being===
Proponents of welfare reform argued that encouraging maternal employment will enhance children's [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and emotional development. A working mother, proponents assert, provides a positive role model for her children. Opponents, on the other hand, argued that requiring women to work at low pay puts additional stress on mothers, reduces the quality time spent with children, and diverts income to work-related expenses such as transportation and childcare.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt; Evidence is mixed on the impact of TANF on child welfare. Duncan &amp; Chase-Lansdale (2001) found that the impact of welfare reform varied by age of the children, with generally positive effects on school achievement among elementary-school age children and negative effects on adolescents, especially with regards to risky or problematic behaviors.&lt;ref name ="Duncan2001"&gt;Duncan, G. J. and L. Chase-Lansdale. 2002. ''For Better and For Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-Being of Children and Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found large and significant effects of welfare reform on educational achievement and aspirations, and on social behavior (i.e. teacher assessment of compliance and self-control, competence and sensitivity). The positive effects were largely due to the quality of childcare arrangement and afterschool programs that accompanied the move from welfare to work for these recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Mistry, R.S., D.A. Crosby, AC Huston, and DM Casey, M Ripke. 2002. Lessons from New Hope: the impact on children's well-being of a work-based [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]] for parents. See Duncan and Chase-Landsdale 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another study found that substitution from maternal care to other informal care had caused a significant drop in performance of young children.&lt;ref name ="BernalKeane"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernal |first=R. |first2=M. P. |last2=Keane |title=Child care choices and children's cognitive achievement: The case of single mothers |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=459–512 |doi=10.1086/659343 |citeseerx=10.1.1.378.9391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a program with less generous benefits, Kalili et al. (2002) found that maternal work (measured in months and hours per week) had little overall effect on children's antisocial behavior, anxious/depressed behavior or positive behavior. They find no evidence that children were harmed by such transitions; if anything, their mothers report that their children are better behaved and have better mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Kalili, Ariel et al. 2001. "Does Maternal Employment Mandated by Welfare Reform Affect Children's Behavior?"  In For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families. New York: Russell Sage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthesizing findings from an extensive selection of publications, Golden (2005) reached the conclusion that children's outcomes were largely unchanged when examining children's developmental risk, including health status, behavior or emotional problems, suspensions from school, and lack of participation in extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name="Golden2005" &gt;Golden, Olivia. 2005. Assessing the New Federalism, Eight Years Later. Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that contrary to the fears of many, welfare reform and an increase in parental work did not seem to have reduced children's well-being overall. More abused and neglected children had not entered the child welfare system. However, at the same time, improvement in parental earnings and reductions in child poverty had not consistently improved outcomes for children.

===Maternal well-being===
While the material and economic well-being of welfare mothers after the enactment of TANF has been the subject of countless studies, their mental and physical well-being has received little attention. Research on the latter has found that welfare recipients face mental and physical problems at rates that are higher than the general population.&lt;ref name="Danziger2001"&gt;Danziger, S. K. 2001. ''Why some fail to achieve economic security: Low job skills and mental health problems are key barriers''. Forum 4(2):1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems which include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[domestic violence]] mean that welfare recipients face many more barriers to employment and are more at risk of welfare sanctions due to noncompliance with work requirements and other TANF regulations&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt;  Research on the health status of welfare leavers have indicated positive results. Findings from the Women's Employment Study, a [[longitudinal survey]] of welfare recipients in Michigan, indicated that women on welfare but not working are more likely to have mental health and other problems than are former welfare recipients now working.&lt;ref name="Danziger2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollack |first=H. |first2=S. |last2=Danziger |first3=R. |last3=Jayakody |first4=K. |last4=Seefeldt |title=Drug Testing Welfare Recipients—False Positives, False Negatives, Unanticipated Opportunities |journal=Women's Health Issues |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=23–31 |doi=10.1016/S1049-3867(01)00139-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, interviews with now employed welfare recipients find that partly as a result of their increased material resources from working, the women felt that work has led to higher [[self-esteem]], new opportunities to expand their [[social support]] networks, and increased feelings of [[self-efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;London, A. S., Scott, E. K., Edin, K. and Hunter, V. (2004), "Welfare Reform, Work-Family Tradeoffs, and Child Well-Being". ''Family Relations'' 53: 148–158&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they became less socially isolated and potentially less prone to depression. At the same time, however, many women were experiencing stress and exhaustion from trying to balance work and family responsibilities.

==Reauthorization==
Enacted in July 1997, TANF was set for reauthorization in Congress in 2002. However, Congress was unable to reach an agreement for the next several years, and as a result, several extensions were granted to continue funding the program. TANF was finally reauthorized under the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005|Deficit Reduction ACT (DRA) of 2005]]. DRA included several changes to the original TANF program. It raised work participation rates, increased the share of welfare recipients subject to work requirements, limited the activities that could be counted as work, prescribed hours that could be spent doing certain work activities, and required states to verify activities for each adult beneficiary.&lt;ref name="Zedlewski2010"&gt;Zedlewski, Sheila and Olivia Golden.  2010. "Next Steps for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families." The Urban Institute: Brief(11) accessed December 12/2011 from http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412047_next_steps_brief11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), Congress created a new TANF Emergency Fund (TANF EF), funded at $5 billion and available to states, territories, and tribes for federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  The original TANF law provided for a Contingency Fund (CF) funded at $2 billion which allows states meeting economic triggers to draw additional funds based upon high levels of state MOE spending. This fund was expected to (and did) run out in FY 2010.  The TANF Emergency Fund provided states 80 percent of the funding for spending increases in three categories of TANF-related expenditures in FYs 2009 or 2010 over FYs 2007 or 2008.  The three categories of expenditures that could be claimed were basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term benefits, and subsidized employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

TANF was scheduled for reauthorization again in 2010. However, Congress did not work on legislation to reauthorize the program and instead they extended the TANF block grant through September 30, 2011, as part of the [[Claims Resolution Act of 2010|Claims Resolution Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Law and Social Policy. 2010. "TANF Reauthorization." Accessed 12/12/2011 from http://www.clasp.org/federal_policy/pages?id=0021&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Congress once again did not reauthorize the program but passed a three-month extension through December 31, 2011.

== Exiting The TANF Program ==
When transitioning out of the TANF program, individuals find themselves in one of three situations that constitute the reasons for exiting:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irving|first=Shelley K.|date=2008-12-01|title=State Welfare Rules, TANF Exits, and Geographic Context: Does Place Matter?*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1526/003601108786471549/abstract|journal=Rural Sociology|language=en|volume=73|issue=4|pages=605–630|doi=10.1526/003601108786471549|issn=1549-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first situation involves work related TANF exit, in which individuals no longer qualify for TANF assistance due to acquired employment.
# The second type of situation is non- work TANF related exit in which the recipient no longer qualifies for assistance due to reaching the maximum time allowed to be enrolled in the assistance program. Once their time limit has been reached, individuals are removed from receiving assistance.
# The third type of situation is continued TANF receipt in which employed recipients earning a wage that does not help cover expenses continue receiving assistance.
It has been observed that certain situations of TANF exit are more prominent depending on the geographic area which recipients live in. Focusing the comparison between metropolitan (urban) areas and non-metropolitan (rural) areas, the number of recipients experiencing non work TANF related exit is highest among rural areas (rural areas in the South experience the highest cases of this type of exiting the program).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Information asymmetry or lack of knowledge among recipients on the various TANF work incentive programs is a contributor to recipients experiencing non work related TANF exits. Not being aware of the offered programs impacts their use and creates misconceptions that influence the responsiveness of those who qualify for such programs, resulting in longer time periods requiring TANF services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven G.|date=2002-01-01|title=Ensuring the Stability of Welfare-to-Work Exits: The Importance of Recipient Knowledge about Work Incentives|jstor=23717936|journal=Social Work|volume=47|issue=2|pages=162–170|doi=10.1093/sw/47.2.162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients who exit TANF due to work are also affected by information asymmetry due to lack of awareness on the "transitional support" programs available to facilitate their transitioning into the work field. Programs such as childcare, food stamps, and Medicaid are meant increase work incentive but many TANF recipients transitioning into work do not know they are eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven G.|last2=Schuldt|first2=Richard|last3=Halter|first3=Anthony P.|last4=Scott|first4=Jeff|date=2003-01-01|title=Employment Experiences and Support Services Use Following TANF Exits|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J185v02n01_04|journal=The Social Policy Journal|volume=2|issue=1|pages=35–56|doi=10.1300/J185v02n01_04|issn=1533-2942}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that TANF-exiting working women who use and maintain the transitional incentive services described above are less likely to return to receiving assistance and are more likely to experience long term employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/research/publication/helping-women-stay-welfare|title=Helping Women Stay Off Welfare: The Role of Post-Exit Receipt of Work Supports|last=Acs|first=Gregory|date=August 2007|website=[[The Urban Institute]]|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Peter Edelman]], an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned from the Clinton administration in protest of Clinton signing the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], which he called, "The worst thing Bill Clinton has done."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/us/two-clinton-aides-resign-to-protest-new-welfare-law.html Two Clinton Aides Resign to Protest New Welfare Law] by Alison Mitchell, ''The New York Times'', September 12, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; According to Edelman, the 1996 welfare reform law destroyed the safety net. It increased poverty, lowered income for single mothers, put people from welfare into homeless shelters, and left states free to eliminate welfare entirely. It moved mothers and children from welfare to work, but many of them aren't making enough to survive. Many of them were pushed off welfare rolls because they didn't show up for an appointment, when they had no transportation to get to the appointment, or weren't informed about the appointment, said Edelman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=fac_lectures Poverty &amp; Welfare: Does Compassionate Conservatism Have a Heart? Peter B. Edelman 64 ''Alb. L. Rev.'' 1076 2000-2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97mar/edelman/edelman.htm The worst thing Bill Clinton has done], Peter Edelman, ''The Atlantic'', March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics later said that TANF was successful during the Clinton Administration when the economy was booming, but failed to support the poor when jobs were no longer available during the downturn, particularly the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]], and particularly after the lifetime limits imposed by TANF may have been reached by many recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/As_Progressives_Predicted_Clinton_Welfare_Reform_Law_Fails_Families_8029.html As Progressives Predicted, Clinton Welfare Reform Law Fails Families] by Randy Shaw in BeyondChron (April 19‚ 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The series begins in Boston in 1906, prior to [[John F. Fitzgerald]] being sworn in as city mayor. The Kennedys, as well as Fitzgerald's daughters, most notably [[Rose Kennedy|Rose]] attend the swearing in ceremony. [[Joseph P. Kennedy|Joe Kennedy]] is shown to be smitten with Rose. The first episode covers their courtship, education, marriage and growth of their family, as well as Joe's affair with actress [[Gloria Swanson]]. Although Rose briefly leaves Joe, John persuades his daughter to return to her husband.

The second episode focuses on the eldest Kennedy children [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe Jr]], [[John F. Kennedy|Jack]] and [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen]], as well Joe's appointment as Ambassador to England. Joe Jr's academic success and his father's favouritism bothers Jack, who feels he is equally as intelligent as his brother.

==Background and education==
