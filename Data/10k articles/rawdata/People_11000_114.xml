'''Annie Land O'Berry''' (1885-1944) was an activist, relief worker, and philanthropist from [[North Carolina]]. O'Berry was a native to North Carolina, growing up in [[Edgecombe County, North Carolina|Edgecombe County]] on a farm with her family. She was involved in women's clubs and an open member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]]. More specifically, O’Berry's endeavors in the North Carolina Emergency Relief Association, [[North Carolina Democratic Party]], [[League of Women Voters]], and the Women's Missionary Society at her local [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] demonstrated her dedication to serving her community. As an academic, O'Berry was named the first honor graduate from Peace University.

== Early Life and Education ==
Annie Land O’Berry was born on May 28th 1885 in [[Edgecombe County, North Carolina|Edgecombe County]], North Carolina to V.W. and Mary Dawson Mayo Land. O’Berry grew up on her family plantation and enjoyed playing outdoor sports until the age of 13, when her parents died and she moved to live with her her older sister in [[Littleton, North Carolina|Littleton]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/oberry-annie-land|title=O'Berry, Annie Land|last=|first=|date=|website=[[NCpedia]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, O’Berry was interested in and excelled at school. In grammar school O’Berry attained high marks and continued on to study at Littleton College.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Harriette Hammer |title=Busy North Carolina women |date=1931 |publisher=H.H. Walker |url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll37/id/3372 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|23-24}} She then attended the [[William Peace University]], graduating as the first honor graduate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nchistorytoday.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/annie-oberry-new-deal-administrator/|title=Annie O’Berry, New Deal Administrator|last=|first=|date=2014-02-04|work=[[North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources|This Day in North Carolina History]]|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After graduation, O’Berry moved in with her brother, Edward Land, in [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]]. There, O’Berry was an active member of the [[Presbyterian Church]] where she organized Sunday School and was chairman of the Women's Missionary Society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|23-24}} On December 14th, 1909 Annie Land married Thomas O’Berry and soon after they moved to [[Goldsboro, North Carolina|Goldsboro]], North Carolina.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Throughout her career, O’Berry advocated for education and aspired to end adult illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOAqWMwsgFcC&amp;dq=annie+o'berry+unc&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=O'Berry&amp;f=false|title=The Power of Femininity in the New South: Women's Organizations and Politics in North Carolina, 1880-1930|last=Sims|first=Anastatia|date=1997|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=9781570031786|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as O’Berry focused on relief in her own community, she took a course on social work at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
While living with her brother in Kinston, Annie Land O’Berry was very active in the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She became the first chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of [[Wayne County, North Carolina|Wayne County]] where she was the president for two years. O’Berry gave her time and effort to what was then called the Charity Organization of Goldsboro.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tar Heel Women|last=Rogers|first=Lou|publisher=Warren Publishing Co.|year=1949|isbn=|location=Edwards and Broughton Co., Raleigh, North Carolina|pages=273-277}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later went to Columbia University in order to learn more about this type of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; O’Berry also helped her father-in-law, Captain Nathan O’Berry of Goldsboro, raise over $5,000.00 to help white collar people during the depression. As a result, Governor Angus McLean appointed her to the Commission to Study County Government and the North Carolina Historical Commission. O’Berry also worked in the Goldsboro Club in Women's Club Work. She was elected vice-president of the State Federation in 1923 and, in 1927, was elected president. 

O’Berry's literacy committee sponsored an Educational Pilgrimage to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. It was recognized as one of the most outstanding projects of adult education in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was later named the vice-chair of the state executive committee of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGuire|first=John Thomas|date=2012|title=The Boundaries of Democratic Reform: Social Justice Feminism and Race in the South, 1931–1939|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23795647|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume=78|issue=4|pages=887–912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 1933, O’Berry became one of the few women to administer a state emergency relief agency as she became the administrator of the Civil Works Commission. The Civil Works Commission later became the North Carolina Emergency Relief Administration (NCERA).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; O’Berry continued to remain in-charge of an offshoot of NCERA, called the Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, until her death. This offshoot provided loans to farmers. Through her diplomacy, O’Berry provided both direct and indirect relief to many citizens.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncdcr.gov/blog/2016-12-21/annie-oberry-new-deal-administrator|title=Annie O'Berry, New Deal Administrator|last=|first=|date=|website=NC.GOV|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469629018/dictionary-of-north-carolina-biography/|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography {{!}} William S.

== Legacy ==
Annie Land O’Berry worked to help clubwomen overcome indifference to civic responsibility. She inspired them to be civic-minded and to work for the advancement of adult education. She was viewed as ‘the little soldier,’ ‘relief lady,’ and a symbol of ‘food for the hungry, homes for the weary and a new chance for the discouraged.’&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although she had no children of her own, O’Berry raised her grand-nephew and grand-niece as her own. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Ataa Oko''' (c. 1919 - 9 December 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artbrut.ch/en/21034/vie-collection|title=Collection de l'Art Brut|website=Art Brut|access-date=2018-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130061054/http://www.artbrut.ch/en/21034/vie-collection/|archive-date=2016-11-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Ghana|Ghanaian]] builder of [[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|figurative palanquins]] and [[fantasy coffin]] and at over 80 years of age he became a painter of [[Art Brut]].

==Biography==
[[File:Drawing by Ataa Oko 2010.jpg|thumb|Figurative palanquin, drawing of Ataa Oko 2010]]
Ataa Oko was born around 1919 in the coastal town of La, [[Ghana]]. He never went to school, but worked since he was about 13 years old as a fisherman. Later his family sent him on the cocoa plantations in the Ashante Region. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. From 1939 to 1970 he worked in numerous temporary employments. 

According to [[Regula Tschumi]], Ataa Oko started to build figurative coffins around 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lepoignardsubtil.hautetfort.com/tag/cercueils%20du%20ghana|title=cercueils du ghana : Le Poignard Subtil|website=lepoignardsubtil.hautetfort.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been inspired by the [[Figurative palanquin|figurative palanquins]] he had seen in Accra. These palanquins were used by the Ga chiefs already at the beginning of the 20th century. The palanquins were built in the form of the respective family symbols which the Ga chiefs were using.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: "The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance", in: ''[[African Arts (journal)|African Arts]]'', Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, pp. 60-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1960 Ataa Oko opened his own coffin and palanquin workshop in La. 

The last years of his life, Ataa Oko was retired and hardly built coffins any more. Around 2005 the former carpenter started to draw. His graphic art practice was boorn as a result of his meeting with Regula Tschumi who was making a research about the figurative coffins of the Ga. Looking for information about this art form the ethnologist asked Ataa Oko to draw his former works he had made some 50 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Lucienne Peiry: The Flute of Ataa Oko. In: Outsider Art, Vol. 3, Shanghai University Press, 2016, p. 22-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Ataa Oko's graphic work developed continuously. When he died in 2012, he left behind a comprehensive body of work that give a fascinating insight not only into the life of the artist, but also into the religious life and culture of the Ga people.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: Ataa Oko. A glimpse inside the amazing world of Ghanaian funerals and how the carpenter Ataa Oko became an artist, online magazine Interwoven: the fabric of things.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ataa Oko's coffins and drawings were first exhibited in the group show "Six Feet Under" at the Kunstmuseum Berne 2006 and 2010/11 he had first one-man show in the well known [[Collection de l'art brut]] in Lausanne.&lt;ref&gt;''Ataa Oko'', exhibition catalogue, 2010, ed.

Each book is dedicated to the rappers' mothers.

Her brother is scientist and author [[J. Michael Scott]]. Her [[twin]] sister is antique store owner [[Cordelia Mendoza]].

==Career==
Scott wrote poetry as a teenager and worked on the [[Helix High School]] yearbook during her senior year. Her first full-time newspaper position was as a reporter for the ''Beach &amp; Bay Press'' in Mission Beach and [[Pacific Beach, San Diego, California|Pacific Beach]], in 1987. She also freelanced for the ''Mira Mesa Scripps Ranch Sentinel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mtxf11g/sentinel-mira-mesa-scripps|title=Sentinel Mira Mesa Scripps, San Diego, CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|work=manta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then became business editor of the ''[[La Jolla]] Light'' weekly newspaper after winning a Best of Show journalism award out of 1,200 entries from the San Diego Press Club.  She then moved to a daily paper, the ''Vista Press'', in North San Diego County. She left the ''Vista Press'' to string as a correspondent for the Associated Press and ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]''. While reporting in San Diego, she was a member of the San Diego Press Club.

In 1993, she moved to the [[Mojave Desert]] as a crime beat reporter for the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'', where she worked until 1998, then freelanced for ''The New York Times'' and the Reuters news service and wrote true-crime books and biographies. While still at the ''Sun'', in 1997, her first book, ''The Killing of Tupac Shakur'', was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/090497tupacbook.html Review, ''The Killing of Tupac Shakur'']&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington Press released the book on the first anniversary of Shakur's death, issuing a 25,000-copy first printing, according to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19970825/28268-pw-on-the-trail-of-tupac.html|title=PW: On the Trail of Tupac|work=PublishersWeekly.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a second edition released in 2002.

In January 2011, [[Anderson Cooper]]'s 360° blog included Scott in an update on the Tupac and [[Biggie Smalls|Smalls]] cases, quoting her as saying that "the failure to secure the actual scene of the shooting and interview witnesses immediately doomed the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/06/an-ac360%C2%B0-cold-case-mystery-still-surrounds-rappers-deaths/?hpt=T2|title=An AC360° Cold Case: Mystery still surrounds rappers' deaths|work=cnn.com|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Scott lodged a complaint with [[YouTube]] over a re-created image included in rapper [[Wyclef Jean]]'s music video "April Showers."

'''Charles Derber''' is an American Professor of [[Sociology]] at [[Boston College]].

==Early life and education==
Derber was born in Washington DC in January 1944, the son of New Deal economist [[Milton Derber]].  Routine evenings in the Derber household featured dinner discussions of politics and economics, imprinting a New Deal ideological framework upon young Derber.  Reaching adulthood in the 1960s, Derber buried himself within the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]] while in jail for protesting the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Slagle, N.P. "Conversations with Activists II: The Sociologist Charles Derber", Scire Populum et Potentiam[https://scirepopulumetpotentiam.info/2018/11/08/conversations-with-activists-ii-the-sociologist-charles-derber/]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Yale University]], where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1965 and was a member of [[Manuscript Society]]. He attended the [[University of Chicago]], and obtained his PhD in political science.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;[https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/sociology/people/faculty-directory/charles-derber.html Charles Derber ] Boston College Faculty, accessed April 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Derber started at Brandeis University in 1979 and switched to Boston College in 1980. He became a professor in 1991 and has been teaching in the graduate program on social economy and social justice ever since.&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;

Derber's work falls into three major categories. One is a critique of individualism and American culture. His 1980 book ''The Pursuit of Attention'' focuses on [[Egocentrism|ego-centeredness]] and "[[conversational narcissism]]" in everyday life as structured by class, gender and America’s individualistic culture. In 2000, Oxford University Press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/PopularCulture/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195135497 Oxford University Press; The Pursuit of Attention - Power and Ego in Everyday Life]&lt;/ref&gt; printed a 20th year commemorative edition of the book, making it a classic sociological work. ''The Wilding of America'', in its fifth edition, is a widely used text in American sociology. It offers a sharp critique of the [[American Dream]] and the crisis of hyper-[[individualism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
  	
Derber is best known to the general public for his analysis of [[Corporation|corporate]] power and globalization.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His book ''Corporation Nation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillanacademic.com/Academic/book/BookDisplay.asp?BookKey=274379 Macmillan Books; Corporation Nation - How Corporations are Taking Over Our Lives and What We Can Do About It]&lt;/ref&gt; is an study of how corporations penetrate and control every sector of American life. ''People Before Profit'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillanacademic.com/Academic/book/BookDisplay.asp?BookKey=1106348 Macmillan Books; People Before Profit - The New Globalization in an Age of Terror, Big Money, and Economic Crisis]&lt;/ref&gt; a treatment of corporate globalization and its alternatives, has been published in five languages.

His books, ''Regime Change Begins at Home'' and ''Hidden Power'', deal with the marriage of political and economic power in America. In 2006, the Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY) nominated ''Hidden Power''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkpub.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=157675345X Berrett-Koehler Publishers; Hidden Power - What You Need to Know to Save Our Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the three best American books on current events.
	
Derber's interests evolved to focus on ideology and political morality, as well as the new dynamics of global capitalism and of the movements, such as the Occupy Movement, that challenge it. His 2008 book, ''Morality Wars''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=180319 Paradigm Publishers; Morality Wars - How Empires, the Born Again, and the Politically Correct Do Evil in the Name of Good]&lt;/ref&gt; (co-authored with Yale Magrass), analyzes hegemonic discourses from the Roman Empire to the present. It also examines religious and "born again" ideologies, from German fascism to contemporary evangelical politics in the United States. Another 2008 book, with Katherine Adam, ''The New Feminized Majority'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=180321 Paradigm Publishers; The New Feminized Majority - How Democrats Can Change America with Women's Values]&lt;/ref&gt; examines the gendered character of values and politics in America. It shows that a new electoral majority has embraced progressive values historically associated with women; values now shared by millions of men.

In 2010, Derber published Greed to Green: Solving Climate Change and Remaking the Economy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=180329 Paradigm Publishers;Greed to Green: Solving Climate Change and Remaking the Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; (Paradigm Publishers, 2010), that shows that [[climate change]] is a symptom of a dysfunctional lifestyle that can be solved only through a transformation of American capitalism and [[neo-liberal]] globalization. He argues that we are seeing a third wave environmentalism that is inseparable from the broader social and economic justice movements. In 2011, he published Marx's Ghost: Midnight Conversations on Changing the World,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=180333 Paradigm Publishers; Marx's Ghost: Midnight Conversations on Changing the World]&lt;/ref&gt; also translated also into Korean and Chinese. In an imaginative encounter, Derber engages Marx's ghost in a provocative conversation about today's crises, relying extensively on Marx's own quotations. Turning to a genre of literary social science, based on conversation, Derber lays out alternative visions and political strategies for movements such as the [[Occupy Movement]].

Derber's 2012 book ''The Surplus American: How the 1% Is Making Us Redundant'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=321345 Paradigm Publishers; The Surplus American: How the 1% Is Making Us Redundant]&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Yale Magrass, continues Derber's evolution into new genres of political writing. The Surplus American features not only a careful analysis of "surplus people," those without jobs or any meaningful place in society, but a concluding play already performed at [[Boston College]]. The book describes a [[dystopia]] in 2020, where the majority of Americans have been rendered redundant through [[outsourcing]], technological change and a corporate strategy to abandon the entire US economic infrastructure. While first drafted before the rise of the Occupy Movement the analysis is, prophetically, structured around a confrontation on Wall Street between financial elites and surplus people protesters.

Derber’s 2017 book is ''Welcome to the Revolution: Universalizing Resistance for Social Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Welcome-to-the-Revolution-Universalizing-Resistance-for-Social-Justice/Derber/p/book/9781138648203 Routledge; Welcome to the Revolution: Universalizing Resistance for Social Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the anti-Trump resistance movement and the anti-systemic universalizing movement needed to transform contemporary militarized capitalism. In conjunction with that book, Derber has brought together leaders of unions and many social justice movement, to analyze where we go from here. With Routledge Publishers, Derber is editing a new Universalizing Resistance Book Series where leading critical public intellectuals and activists analyze and flesh out stories of mass anti-systemic resistance that moves beyond the siloes of our current Left and Progressive movements. Derber is also helping direct a series of films and books about and with Noam Chomsky, funded by the Wallace Action Fund.
 	
Derber is known as a [[public sociologist]] who writes for general audiences, offering not only sociological critiques but alternative visions. He appears frequently on talk shows, has written opinion pieces for media including the International Herald Tribune, the Boston Globe, the Christian Science Monitor, Newsday and [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]], and is a regular contributor to ''Cognoscenti'', the opinion page of [[WBUR]], Boston's NPR station.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He is one of the most prominent contemporaries of the sociological imagination{{according to whom|date=April 2018}} as championed by [[C. Wright Mills]], and, like Mills, he believes in the importance of melding critical scholarship with social justice activism.

==Personal life==
Derber has long been active in the peace, environmental and labor movements, from his 1960s work to register African-American voters in the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] and his opposition to the Vietnam War to current movements such as Occupy and the struggle to prevent climate change and transform global [[corporate capitalism]] into a robust economic and political democracy.{{according to whom|date=April 2018}}

==Works==
Derber’s work focuses on the crises of capitalism, globalization, corporate power, American militarism, the culture of hegemony, the climate crisis, and the new peace and global justice movements. Derber is persuaded that the overwhelming economic and cultural power of global corporations, increasingly melded with the political and military hegemonic power of the American government and the crises of global capitalism and global climate change, are together an integrated crisis that is now the pre-eminent social issue of the 21st century, and that a new vision and political movement is needed. Derber’s research is oriented toward 1) the systemic analysis of the intertwined crises we face and 2) analysis of the transformative potential of social movements arising to create a more democratic and egalitarian order.

{{Spanish name|Vargas|Lizano}}

'''Isabel Vargas Lizano''' ({{IPA-es|tʃaˈβel ˈβaɾɣas}}; 17 April 1919 – 5 August 2012), better known as '''Chavela Vargas''', was a Costa Rican-born Mexican singer. She was especially known for her rendition of Mexican [[ranchera]]s, but she is also recognized for her contribution to other genres of popular Latin American music. She has been an influential interpreter in the Americas and Europe, muse to figures such as [[Pedro Almodóvar]], hailed for her haunting performances, and called "la voz áspera de la ternura", the rough voice of tenderness.&lt;ref name="Boccanera, Jorge 1999"&gt;Boccanera, Jorge, Entrelineas: Dialogos con Jorge Boccanera, ed. Mario José Grabivker (Buenos Aires: Ediciones instituto movilizador fondos cooperativos C.L., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, presented her with a Latin GRAMMY Statuette in 2007 after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of that organization.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Chavela Vargas 060701.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vargas during a concert in Spain, 2006.]]
She was born in [[Costa Rica]], in [[San Joaquín de Flores]], as Isabel Vargas Lizano, daughter of Francisco Vargas and Herminia Lizano. She was baptized on 15 July 1919 with the forenames "María Isabel Anita Carmen de Jesús." She had a difficult childhood: her parents divorced and left her under the care of an uncle, and she contracted poliomyelitis. She went by ''Chavela'', which is a [[Hypocorism|pet name]] for Isabel. At age 17,&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Chavela, ''Y si quieres saber de mi pasado'', ed. J.C. Vales, 2nd ed (Madrid: Santillana Ediciones Generales, 2002). In the interview with Jorge Boccanera, Vargas is quoted as saying she arrived in Mexico at 17.&lt;/ref&gt; she abandoned her native country due to lack of opportunities for a musical career, seeking refuge in Mexico, where an entertainment industry was burgeoning. There she resided for almost eight decades and obtained Mexican nationality. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For many years she [[street performance|sang on the streets]], but in her thirties she became a professional singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrido|first=Isaac|title=Chavela Vargas Dead At Age 93, Famed Mexican Singer Challenged Catholic And Chauvinist Preconceptions|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/05/chavela-vargas-dead-age-93_n_1744910.html|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her youth, she dressed as a man, smoked cigars, drank heavily, carried a gun, and was known for her characteristic red [[poncho|jorongo]], which she donned in performances until old. Vargas sang the [[ranchera|canción ranchera]], which she performed in her own peculiar style. The typical ranchera, as represented by [[José Alfredo Jiménez]], was a masculine but emotional song about love and its mishaps, usually mediated by alcohol, since in a [[macho]] culture, the display of feelings by men is allowed only to the drunk. The ranchera is sung from a man's perspective and with a mariachi accompaniment. Chavela sang this type of song as a solo, using only guitar and voice, evoking the singing style of a drunk man. She often slowed down the tempo of melodies to draw more dramatic tension out of songs, so they could be taken as naughtily humorous.

Towards the end of the 1950s, she became known within artistic circles, due in part to her performances in Acapulco, center of international tourism, where she sang at the Champagne Room of the restaurant La Perla. Her first album, ''Noche de Bohemia'' (Bohemian Night), was released in 1961 with the professional support of [[José Alfredo Jiménez]], one of the foremost singer/songwriters of Mexican ranchera music.&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Música Española e Hispanoamericana.'' 5 vols. Madrid: Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, 2002. s.v. "Vargas, Chavela".&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually recorded more than 80 albums.&lt;ref&gt;Yarbro-Bejarano, Yvonne. "Crossing the Border with Chabela Vargas: A Chicana Femme's Tribute" [sic] Chap. 3, ''Sex and Sexuality in Latin America'' (New York: New York University Press, 1997)&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vargas was hugely successful during the 1950s, the 1960s, and the first half of the 1970s, touring in Mexico, the United States, France, and Spain&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario de la Música Española e Hispanoamericano. 5 vols. Madrid: Sociedad General de Autores y Editores, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and was close to many prominent  artists and intellectuals of the time, including [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Agustín Lara]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Dolores Olmedo]] and [[José Alfredo Jiménez]].&lt;ref name="Boccanera, Jorge 1999"/&gt;

==Partial retirement and return to the stage==

In the late 1970s Vargas partially retired from performing due to a 15-year battle with alcoholism, which she described in her autobiography (''Y si quieres saber de mi pasado'' [And if you want to know about my past], published in 2002) as "my 15 years in hell."&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Chavela, ''Y si quieres saber de mi pasado'', ed. J.C. Vales, 2nd ed (Madrid: Santillana Ediciones Generales, 2002), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Chavela couldn't keep on with her heavy drinking and intense lifestyle. In 1970, "submerged in an alcoholic haze" as she described it, she was taken in by an [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indian]] family who nursed her back to health without knowing who she was. In 2003, she told ''The New York Times'' that she had not had a drink in 25 years.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/arts/music/chavela-vargas-mexican-ranchera-singer-dies-at-93.html?_r=0 Obituary in the ''New York Times''], 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Vargas returned to the stage in 1991, performing at a bohemian nightclub called "El Hábito" in Coyoacán, Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Boccanera, Jorge 1999"/&gt; Her career started to recover international prominence, with performances in Latin America, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Vargas debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 2003 at age 83&lt;ref&gt;Vargas, Chavela. (2006) Chavela at Carnegie Hall, CD recording, Tommy Boy&lt;/ref&gt; at the behest and promotion of Spanish director [[Pedro Almodóvar]], an admirer and friend.

At age 81, she publicly [[Coming out|came out]] as a lesbian in her autobiography titled ''And If You Want to Know about My Past''.

But it wasn't really a surprise to her fans. For years Vargas refused to change the genders in her songs. In "Paloma Negra" ("Black Dove"), Vargas accuses a woman of partying all night long and breaking her heart.

==Appearances in film==
Vargas is featured in many of Almodóvar's films, including ''[[The Flower of My Secret|La flor de mi secreto]]'' in both song and video.  She said, however, that acting was not her ambition, although she had previously participated in films such as the 1967 movie ''La Soldadera.''&lt;ref name="Boccanera, Jorge 1999"/&gt;  Vargas also appeared in ''[[Frida]]'', singing "[[La Llorona (song)|La Llorona]]" (The Weeping Woman).&lt;ref name="Vargas, Chavela 2002"&gt;Vargas, Chavela, Y si quieres saber de mi pasado, ed. J.C. Vales, 2nd ed (Madrid: Santillana Ediciones Generales, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Her classic "Paloma Negra" (Black Dove) was also included in the soundtrack of the film.  Vargas herself, as a young woman, was alleged to have had an affair with Frida Kahlo during Kahlo's marriage to [[mural]]ist Diego Rivera.&lt;ref&gt;Sofía Ruiz-Alfaro PhD (2012) From Chavela to Frida: Loving from the Margins,Journal of Homosexuality, 59:8, 1131-1144, DOI: 10.1080/00918369.2012.712818&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vargas, Chavela 2002"/&gt; She appeared in [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]'s ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', singing "Tú me acostumbraste" ("I got used to you"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://odeo.com/show/6748053/view Tu Me Acostumbraste - Chavela Vargas on Odeo]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a bolero by [[Frank Domínguez]].

On February 10, 2017, the biographical film ''Chavela'' debuted. Directed by [[Catherine Gund]] and [[Daresha Kyi]], the film features [[Pedro Almodóvar]], [[Elena Benarroch]] and [[Miguel Bosé]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6217664/ ''Chavela'' on IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in literature and music==
[[Joaquín Sabina]]'s song "Por el Boulevard de los Sueños Rotos" ("Down the Boulevard of Broken Dreams") is dedicated to Vargas.&lt;ref name="Boccanera, Jorge 1999"/&gt; [[Sergio Ramírez Mercado]], a Nicaraguan writer, published in 2011 the novel ''La Fugitiva'', a fictionalized account of the life of Costa Rican writer [[Yolanda Oreamuno]]. In Ramírez' work, Oreamuno's life is told by three women who met her. According to many critics, one of the female characters telling Oreamuno's history is a singer who resembles Chavela Vargas. The character talks about her own life and her non-reciprocated lesbian love for Yolanda Oreamuno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sergio Ramírez: política y ficción|url=http://www.sigueleyendo.es/sergio-ramirez-politica-y-ficcion/|publisher=Sigueleyendo|language=Spanish|date=April 8, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411164803/http://www.sigueleyendo.es/sergio-ramirez-politica-y-ficcion/|archivedate=April 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Chavela Vargas had been hospitalized for several weeks as a result of respiratory problems. She died in Cuernavaca, Mexico. According her official Facebook page, her last words were "I leave with Mexico in my heart."

'''Chen Qimei''' ({{zh|t=陳其美|s=陈其美|p=Chén Qíměi}}; 17 January 1878 – 18 May 1916) was a Chinese revolutionary activist, close political ally of [[Sun Yat-sen]], and early mentor of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. He was as one of the founders of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and the uncle of [[Chen Guofu]] and [[Chen Lifu]].

Born in [[Wuxing District|Wuxing]], [[Zhejiang]], [[China]], he went to [[Japan]] for studies in 1906, and there joined the Chinese [[Tongmenghui]]. Befriended by fellow Zhejiang native [[Chiang Kai-shek]], in 1908, Chen brought Chiang into the [[Tongmenghui]]. 

In 1911, after the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Chen's  forces occupied [[Shanghai]]. He was then made military governor of the region. He fled to Japan with [[Sun Yat-sen]] upon the failure of the revolution against [[Yuan Shikai]]'s dictatorship.  They subsequently formed the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]], which later became the [[Kuomintang]], or the Chinese Nationalist Party. As he was returning to Shanghai for another round of revolution, Yuan had him assassinated on May 18, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Nelson |last2=Chang |first2=Laurence |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UI3_-7dMPIoC&amp;pg=PA197 |title=The Zhangs from Nanxun |publisher=CF Press |page=197 |isbn=9780692008454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergère |first=Marie-Claire |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7M1u4IGFkC&amp;pg=PA268 |title=Sun Yat-sen |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=268 |isbn=9780804740111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination was believed to have been carried out by [[Zhang Zongchang]], a general loyal to Yuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Patricia Buckley |first=Ebray |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUcdH6opOlcC&amp;pg=PA374 |title=Chinese Civilization, A Sourcebook |edition=2nd |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=374 |isbn=9781439188392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen is perceived as one of the early revolutionary heroes and one of the founding fathers of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. He was also the eldest member of which later came to be known as the [[Chen Family]], one of the four most powerful and influential families at the time. The university which had been originally named after him has become a part of today's [[Fudan University]] and [[Zhejiang University]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]]. A monument of him is located in [[Huzhou]], [[Zhejiang]], [[China]].

'''Doll Tearsheet''' is a fictional character who appears in Shakespeare's play ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]''. She is a prostitute who frequents the [[Boar's Head Inn]] in Eastcheap. Doll is close friends with [[Mistress Quickly]], the proprietor of the tavern, who procures her services for [[Falstaff]]. 

Doll is noted for her wide repertoire of colourful insults and her sudden switches from wild tirades to sentimental intimacy and back again.

==In the play==
Doll is introduced by name when [[Mistress Quickly]] asks [[Falstaff]] whether he would like her company that evening. The Page later mentions to [[Prince Hal]] and [[Poins]] that Falstaff will be seeing her, primly referring to her as "a proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's", though Hal quickly concludes that she is probably "some road" (meaning a whore: accessible to anyone, as in the phrase "as common as the cart-way").&lt;ref name = "ren"/&gt;

Doll is first seen about to be sick after drinking too much "[[Sack (wine)|canaries]]" (fortified wine from the Canary islands). When Falstaff arrives they exchange lewd banter about [[venereal disease]]. Informed that [[Ancient Pistol]] is at the door, Doll insists that he should not be allowed in because he's "the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England." After Pistol enters, Doll berates him with a string of insults: "I scorn you, scurvy companion. What! you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen
mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away!" She then threatens him with a knife, and Pistol pulls his sword. In the ensuing fight, Falstaff and [[Bardolph (Shakespeare character)|Bardolph]] force him out. 

After his display of fighting prowess, Doll becomes very solicitous to Falstaff, calling him a "whoreson little valiant villain". She sits on his knee and kisses him. She asks him what Prince Hal is like; Falstaff gives a rather unflattering picture of him, unaware that Hal and Poins are nearby. When they reveal themselves, Falstaff claims he was intentionally "dispraising" the prince in the presence of "the wicked". Hal professes to be shocked, describing Doll as a "virtuous gentlewoman", to the enthusiastic agreement of Mistress Quickly. But Falstaff says Doll is "in hell already, and burns poor souls" (a reference to the burning sensation of venereal disease).&lt;ref&gt;René Weis (ed), ''Henry IV, Part 2'': Oxford University Press, 1997, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt; When Falstaff is called away to the war, Doll becomes tearful. He leaves, but then calls on her to join him.

She next appears, apparently heavily pregnant, with Mistress Quickly. They are being arrested because Pistol has beaten up a man in a brawl in which they were involved. The man has since died. The officer says she will probably be whipped. Doll says that she should not be manhandled because she might have a miscarriage, but the arresting officer insists she has stuffed a cushion up her dress. Doll unleashes a stream of insults directed at the arresting officer's skinniness.

After the death of [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], Falstaff learns about Doll's arrest and promises to have her released. But Hal, now king, refuses to listen to him.

==References in ''Henry V''==
Though she does not appear in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Doll is mentioned several times, though in contexts which appear to be inconsistent with one another. Pistol marries Mistress Quickly, whose first name is Nell. He gets into an argument with [[Corporal Nym]], who himself wanted to marry her, and tells Nym to go to the hospital ('spital) and find Doll in the ward for sexually transmitted diseases ("the powdering tub of infamy") and marry her: "Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,/ Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse". After the [[Battle of Agincourt]] he receives a letter, from which he learns that "my Doll is dead in the 'spital" from "malady of France", i.e. [[syphilis]]. It is unclear whether this refers to Doll Tearsheet or Mistress Quickly, since the next line says he has lost his home, implying that the woman referred to is the person he lives with. It is often amended to "Nell" in modern editions. The Quarto version says "Doll is sick", not "dead", leaves out the "my", and makes no reference to losing a home.&lt;ref name = "doc"&gt;Andrew Griffin, ''Locating the Queen's Men, 1583–1603'', Ashgate, 2013, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that a version of ''Henry V'' existed in which Falstaff appeared, perhaps married to Quickly (which he said he would do in ''Henry IV, Part 2'').&lt;ref name = "doc"/&gt; At the epilogue to ''Henry IV, Part 2'' Shakespeare had promised another play to "continue the story, with Sir John in it", but Falstaff does not appear in existing versions of ''Henry V''. If such a version existed Pistol may have married Doll. If this highly speculative hypothesis is true, when Falstaff was cut out, much of his part was reassigned to Pistol, but the passage apparently referring to Doll as his wife was accidentally left unchanged.&lt;ref name = "doc"/&gt;

==Character==
[[File:Fuseli Henry IV part 2 act II scene 4.jpg|thumb|Falstaff with Doll Tearsheet, print after [[Henry Fuseli]]]]
Doll's name is obviously emblematic of her trade. A contraction of [[Dorothy (given name)|Dorothy]], the name "Doll", with its connotation of "plaything", was often given to prostitute characters, as with Doll Common in Jonson's play ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''.&lt;ref name = "dict"&gt;Alison Findlay, "Dorothy" and "Jane", ''Women in Shakespeare: A Dictionary'', A&amp;C Black, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her surname is suggestive of her activities, as is that of the other "loose woman" mentioned in the play, Jane Nightwork.&lt;ref name = "dict"/&gt; [[Stanley Wells]] and [[Eric Partridge]] say she is "so called, either because she tore the bed-sheets in her amorous tossings or because her partners did so while consorting with her".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells &amp; Eric Partridge, ''Shakespeare's Bawdy'', Routledge, p.258.&lt;/ref&gt; According to René Weis, {{quote|"Tearsheet' has been read as a misprint for 'Tearstreet' (i.e. street-walker) in the light of Hal's anticipating to meet 'some road' ( 2. 2.158), but a 'sheet-walker' or 'tearer' is equally plausible, in view particularly of Beaumont and Fletcher Valentinian 3. 1.340-1, where Maximus says 'If my wife for all this should be a whore now, / A kind of kicker out of sheets'"&lt;ref name = "ren"&gt;René Weis (ed) ''Henry IV, Part 2'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p.158, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harold Bloom]] says that Doll's eccentric compliments to Falstaff ("thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig") complement Hal's own apparently affectionate insults, with the difference that Doll's are sincere, since "Falstaff the Bartholomew boar-pig has just proved himself to his doxy as being, in her words, a 'whoreson little valiant villain', and is fully to her taste. Falstaff the Manningtree ox, however, has just been unmercifully made game of by the Prince for running away at Gadshill in a fashion that could only, by everyone in the tavern company except Falstaff, be taken as showing downright cowardice."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Falstaff'', Chelsea House, 1992, p.158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other literature==
Doll appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play ''[[Falstaff's Wedding]]'' (1766), a comedy by [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]], which is set in the period between the end of ''Henry IV, Part 2'' and the beginning of ''Henry V''. Doll and Mistress Quickly, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting [[Robert Shallow]] and Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so Doll ends up married to Nym.

[[James White (1775–1820)|James White]]'s book ''Falstaff's Letters'' (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his cronies, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. Several letters from Quickly to Falstaff complain about his treatment of Doll.&lt;ref&gt;White, James, ''Falsteff's Letters'', London, Robson, 1877, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]]'s poem "Applied Poetry" Doll is invoked. The poet tells his beloved that she is filled with the beauties of springtime, and like the breeze that sways a field of buttercups, "As if Doll Tearsheet lay / And leapt again". When she expresses outrage at being compared to a whore, he explains, 
&lt;poem&gt;
But she was meant to show,
(If Will gave lessons)
That only women know
The human essence,
And see beneath a part,
Though clothed upon
By Evil, the rich heart
Of gross Sir John;
Which no one else perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver St. John Gogarty, ''Selected Poems'', The Macmillan Company, 1933, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Doll also appears as a character in [[Gustav Holst]]'s 1925 opera ''[[At the Boar's Head]]''. A soprano role, it was first performed by Constance Willis, conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Ross Griffel]], Adrienne Fried Block, ''Operas in English: A Dictionary'', Greenwood Press, Westport, 1999, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fernando Lamikiz Garai''' (born 1959 in [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]], [[Biscay]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain) is a lawyer, economist and former president of [[Athletic Bilbao]].

Lamikiz studied economic law at the [[University of Deusto|Deusto University]]. After further studying in [[Munich]], he returned to [[Deusto]] as a lecturer in [[Civil Rights]]. He was member of the board of directors of Athletic from 1994 to 2001, heading the legal department. 

He was president of Athletic from September 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2004/09/10/futbol/1094850743.html|title=Lamikiz, presidente del Athletic |trans-title=Lamikiz, Athletic president|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=10 September 2004|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his resignation in September 2006. He stepped down following Athletic's poor performance in the 2005-06 [[La Liga]] season and uninspired beginning of the 2006-07 season, combined with prolonged negative press surrounding his involvement in the illegal attempt to sign defender [[Iban Zubiaurre]] from rivals [[Real Sociedad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://as.com/futbol/2005/07/02/mas_futbol/1120285630_850215.html|title=El Athletic presentó ayer a Zubiaurre y la Real estalla|trans-title=Athletic presented Zubiaurre yesterday and Real explodes |publisher=Diario AS|language=Spanish|date=2 July 2005|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604102846/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=383084&amp;cc=5739|archivedate=4 June 2011|title=The honest lawyer |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=383084&amp;cc=5739 |work=[[ESPN Soccernet]] |author=[[Phil Ball (writer)|Phil Ball]]|date=2 October 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation, widely believed to have come as the result of sustained protest by vocal supporters of Athletic, was effected on 27 September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lamikiz quits as Bilbao president |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/football/09/27/spain.bilbao/ |work=[[CNN.com]] |date=27 September 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His deputy, [[Ana Urkijo]], took on the role until 2007, becoming the club's first female president.&lt;ref name=seriousness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2006/09/27/futbol/1159382907.html|title=Ana Urkijo, seriedad y firmeza en Ibaigane|trans-title=Ana Urkijo, seriousness and firmness in Ibaigane|language=Spanish|newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=27 September 2006|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harmodius''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἁρμόδιος, ''Harmódios'') and '''Aristogeiton''' (Ἀριστογείτων, ''Aristogeíton''; both  died 514 BC) were two lovers from  ancient Athens.  They became known as the [[Tyrannicide]]s (τυραννοκτόνοι, ''tyrannoktonoi'') after they killed the Peisistratid [[tyrant]] [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]], and were the preeminent symbol of  democracy to ancient Athenians.

==Background==
The two principal historical sources covering Harmodius and Aristogeiton are the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (VI, 56–59) by [[Thucydides]], and ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|The Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (XVIII) attributed to [[Aristotle]] or his school. However, their story is documented by a great many other ancient writers, including important sources such as [[Herodotus]] and [[Plutarch]].  Herodotus&lt;ref name=Herodotus-Book-v-55&gt;{{Harvnb|Herodotus|1920|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D55 Book V. 55]}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Harmodius and Aristogeiton presumably were "Gephyraeans" ([[:el:Γεφυραίοι|el]]) i.e. [[Boeotia]]ns of Syrian or Phoenician origin. Plutarch, in his book ''[[On the malice of Herodotus]]'' criticized Herodotus for prejudice and misrepresentation and he argued that Harmodius and Aristogeiton were [[Euboea]]ns or [[Eretria]]ns.{{sfn|Plutarch|1878|loc=The Malice of Herodotus}}

[[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] had become tyrant of Athens after his third attempt in 546/7 BCE. In Archaic Greece, the term [[tyrant]] did not connote malevolence.  A tyrant was simply one who had seized power and ruled outside of a state's constitutional law. When Peisistratus died in 528/7 BC, his son [[Hippias (son of Pisistratus)|Hippias]] took the position of Archon and became the new tyrant of Athens, with the help of his brother, Hipparchus, who acted as the minister of culture. The two continued their father's policies, but their popularity declined after Hipparchus began to abuse the power of his position.

Following Hipparchus' rejection by Harmodius, for whom he had unrequited feelings, Hipparchus invited Harmodius' young sister to be the [[kanephoros]] (to carry the ceremonial offering basket) at the [[Panathenaea]] festival, and then publicly chased her away on the pretext she was not a virgin, as required. This publicly shamed Harmodius' family; then he, with his lover Aristogeiton, resolved to assassinate both Hippias and Hipparchus and thus to overthrow the tyranny.{{sfn|Lavelle|1986|p=318}} The assassination attempt succeeded and Hipparchus was killed in 514/3, but Hippias remained in power. The truly tyrannical (by today's standards) actions in the remaining years of his reign are typically attributed by contemporary scholars as paranoia and anger over the assassination.

According to Aristotle, however, it was [[Thessalos]], the hot-headed son of Peisistratus' [[Argos|Argive]] [[concubine]], and thus half-brother to Hipparchus, who was the one to court Harmodius and drive off his sister.{{sfn|Aristotle|loc=XVIII, 2}}

==The assassination==
[[File:Stamnos with death of the tyrant Hipparchus, Syriskos Painter, Athens, 475-470 BC, L 515 - Martin von Wagner Museum - Würzburg, Germany - DSC05785.jpg|thumb|right|Death of the tyrant Hipparchus, by the Syriskos Painter, 475-470 BC]]
The plot – to be carried out by means of daggers hidden in the ceremonial [[Myrtus|myrtle]] wreaths on the occasion of the [[Panathenaic Games]] – involved a number of other co-conspirators. Thucydides claims that "this was the only day on which it was possible for the citizens who formed the parade to assemble armed without arousing suspicion".{{sfn|Thucydides|loc=VI, 56, 2}}{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--which translation for the quote?--&gt; Aristotle disagrees, asserting that the custom of bearing weapons was introduced later, by the democracy.{{sfn|Aristotle|loc=XVIII, 4}}

Seeing one of the co-conspirators greet Hippias in a friendly manner on the assigned day, the two thought themselves betrayed and rushed into action, ruining the carefully laid plans. They managed to kill Hipparchus, stabbing him to death as he was organizing the Panathenaean processions at the foot of the [[Acropolis]]. Herodotus expresses surprise at this event, asserting that Hipparchus had received a clear warning concerning his fate in a dream.&lt;ref name=Herodotus-Book-v-55/&gt; Harmodius was killed on the spot by spearmen of Hipparchus' guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested shortly thereafter. Upon being told of the event, Hippias, feigning calm, ordered the marching Greeks to lay down their ceremonial weapons and to gather at an indicated spot. All those with concealed weapons or under suspicion were arrested, gaining Hippias a respite from the uprising.

Thucydides' identification of Hippias as the two's purported main target, rather than Hipparchus who was Aristogeiton's rival [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastes]], has been suggested as a possible indication of bias on his part.{{sfn|Lavelle|1993|p={{page needed|date=October 2011}}}}

===Aristogeiton's torture===
[[Aristotle]] in the ''Constitution of Athens'' preserves a tradition that Aristogeiton died only after being tortured in the hope that he would reveal the names of the other conspirators. During his ordeal, personally overseen by Hippias, he feigned willingness to betray his co-conspirators, claiming only Hippias' handshake as guarantee of safety. Upon receiving the tyrant's hand he is reputed to have berated him for shaking the hand of his own brother's murderer, upon which the tyrant wheeled and struck him down on the spot.{{sfn|Aristotle|1952|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Ath.+Pol.+18.1 18.1]}}

===Leæna===
{{main article|Leaena}}
Likewise, there is a tradition that Aristogeiton (or Harmodius)&lt;ref&gt;Alciato, ''Emblemata;'' EMBLEMA XIII&lt;br&gt;
''Cecropia effictam quam cernis in arce Leaenam, &lt;br&gt;
''Harmodii (an nescis hospes?) amica fuit.&lt;br&gt;
''Sic animum placuit monstrare viraginis acrem&lt;br&gt;
''More ferae, nomen vel quia tale tulit.&lt;br&gt;
''Quòd fidibus contorta, suo non prodidit ullum&lt;br&gt;
''Indicio, elinguem reddidit Iphicrates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
was in love with a courtesan (see [[hetaera]]) by the name of [[Leæna]] (Λέαινα – meaning [[lion]]ess) who also was kept by Hippias under torture – in a vain attempt to force her to divulge the names of the other conspirators – until she died. One version holds that previous to being tortured she had bitten off her tongue, afraid that her resolve would break from the pain of the torture. Another is that the Athenians, unwilling to honour a courtesan, placed a statue of a lioness without a tongue in the vestibule of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] simply to honor her fortitude in maintaining silence.{{sfn|Polyaenus|loc=VIII.xlv}}{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|loc=XXXIV 19.72}}{{sfn|Plutarch|1878g|loc=On Talkativeness 505E}}  The statue was made by the sculptor Amphicrates.{{sfn|Smith|1870|p=149}} It was also in her honor that Athenian statues of Aphrodite were from then on accompanied by stone lionesses [after [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]].{{sfn|Athenaeus|loc=XIII, 70}}

===Aftermath===
His brother's murder led Hippias to establish an even stricter dictatorship, which proved very unpopular and was overthrown, with the help of an army from [[Sparta]], in 508. This was followed by the reforms of [[Cleisthenes]], who established a [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] in Athens.

==Apotheosis==
Subsequent history came to identify the figures of Harmodius and Aristogeiton as martyrs to the cause of Athenian freedom, possibly for political and class reasons, and they became known as "the Liberators" (''eleutherioi'') and "the Tyrannicides" (''tyrannophonoi'').{{sfn|Law|2009|p=18}} According to later writers, descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton's families were given hereditary privileges, such as ''sitesis'' (the right to take meals at public expense in the town hall), ''ateleia'' (exemption from certain religious duties), and ''proedria'' (front-row seats in the theater).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Demosthenes|title=Against Leptines|page=503f.}}{{page needed|cate=October 2011|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of years after the event, it had become a received tradition among the Athenians to believe that Hipparchus was the elder of the brothers, and to fashion him as the tyrant.{{sfn|Demosthenes|Kennedy|1856|p=264}}

===Statues and artistic depictions===
After the establishment of democracy, Cleisthenes commissioned the sculptor [[Antenor]] to produce a bronze&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]] refers to this "χαλκοῦς" (''of copper'') statue in ''Περὶ Παρασίτου'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0449%3Asection%3D48 48].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmodius and Aristogeiton (sculpture)|statue group of Harmodius and Aristogeiton]]. It was the first commission of its kind, and the very first statue to be paid for out of public funds, as the two were the first Greeks considered by their countrymen worthy of having statues raised to them.{{sfn|Lecky|1898|pages=274–295}}
According to [[Pliny the Elder]], it was erected in the [[Kerameikos]] in 509,{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|loc=XXXIV,17}} as part of a [[cenotaph]] of the heroes. However, a far more probable location is in the Agora at Athens, and many later authors such as Pausanius and Timaeus attest to this. Annual offerings ''(enagismata)'' were presented there by the [[polemarch]], the Athenian minister of war.{{sfn|Spivey|1996|pp=114–115}} There it stood alone as special laws prohibited the erection of any other statues in their vicinity. Upon its base was inscribed a verse by the poet [[Simonides]]:

{{cquote|A marvelous great light shone upon Athens when Aristogeiton and Harmodios slew Hipparchus.{{sfn|Edmonds|1931|p=377}} }}

The statue was taken as war booty in 480 BC by [[Xerxes I]] during the early [[Greco-Persian Wars]] and installed by him at [[Susa]]. As soon as the Greeks vanquished the Persians at [[Salamis Island|Salamis]], a new statue was commissioned. It was sculpted this time by [[Kritios]] and Nesiotes, and set up in 477/476 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Marm. Par. Ep. 54.70; Pausanias, 1.8.5{{Full citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|loc=XXXIV 70}} It is the one which served as template for the group we possess today, which was found in the ruins of [[Hadrian's Villa|Hadrian's villa]] and is now in [[Naples]]. According to [[Arrian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]] ''De Exp. Alex.'' III.xiv{{Full citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Persian empire, in 330, he discovered the statue at Susa and had it shipped back to Athens.{{sfn|Worthington|2003|p=45}} When the statue, on its journey back, arrived at [[Rhodes]] it was given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], II.x{{Full citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several comments of the ancients regarding the statue have come down to us. When asked, in the presence of [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]], the tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], which type of bronze was the best, [[Sophistic works of Antiphon|Antiphon the Sophist]] replied, {{cquote|That of which the Athenians made the statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, De Adulat et Amici Discrimine&lt;!-- 
Would this title correspond to: On Having Many Friends ? --&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
[[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], in his oration against Leocrates, asserts that, {{cquote|In the rest of Greece you will find statues erected in the public places to the conquerors in the games, but amongst you they are dedicated only to good generals, and to those who have destroyed tyrants.{{sfn|Lycurgus|loc={{page needed|date=October 2011}}}} }} 
Other sculptors made statues of the heroes, such as [[Praxiteles]], who made two, also of bronze.{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|loc=XXXIV ix}}

The statue group has been seen, in modern times, as an invitation to identify erotically and politically with the figures, and to become oneself a tyrannicide. According to Andrew Stewart, the statue {{cquote|not only placed the homoerotic bond at the core of Athenian political freedom, but asserted that it and the manly virtues ''(aretai)'' of courage, boldness and self-sacrifice that it generated were the only guarantors of that freedom’s continued existence.{{sfn|Stewart|1997|p=73}} }}
The configuration of the group is duplicated on a painted vase, a Panathenaic [[amphora]] from 400,&lt;ref&gt;British Museum: London B 605. Beazley, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=0E04E6B54E503BDB5676A928674632F7?name=London+B+605&amp;object=Vase Attic Black-figure Vases]'', 411.4.&lt;/ref&gt; and on a bas-relief on the Elgin throne, dated to ca. 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceremonial Chair (The Elgin Throne|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=8235|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|id=74.AA.12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918163733/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=8235|archivedate=2006-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skolia===
Another tribute to the two heroes was a hymn ([[skolion]]) praising them for restoring [[isonomia]] (equal distribution of justice) to the Athenians. The skolion may be referred to 500 BC or thereabouts,{{sfn|Smyth|1900|p=478}}  
and is ascribed to Callistratus, an Athenian poet known only for this work. It is preserved by [[Athenaeus]].{{sfn|Athenaeus|loc=XV, 695}} Its popularity was such that {{cquote|at every [[symposium|banquet]], nay, in the streets and in the meanest assembly of the common people, that convivial ode was daily sung,{{sfn|Lowth|1839}} }} 
When sung, the singer would hold a branch of [[Myrtus|myrtle]] in his hand.{{sfn|Larcher|1844|p=453}} This ode has been translated by many modern poets such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who composed his ''[[:Wikisource:Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius (Poe)|Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius]]'' in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_harmodius.html glbtq: Harmodius and Aristogeiton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006094023/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_harmodius.html |date=2014-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following translation was judged to be the best and most faithful of a number of versions attempted in Victorian England.{{sfn|Demosthenes|Kennedy|1856| p=266}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In myrtles veil'd will I the falchion wear,
For thus the patriot sword
Harmodius and Aristogiton bare,
When they the tyrant's bosom gored, 
And bade the men of Athens be 
Regenerate in equality.

Oh! beloved Harmodius! never 
Shall death be thine, who liv'st for ever. 
Thy shade, as men have told, inherits 
The islands of the blessed spirits,
Where deathless live the glorious dead,
Achilles fleet of foot, and Diomed.

In myrtles veil'd will I the falchion wear, 
For thus the patriot sword
Harmodius and Aristogiton bare,
When they the tyrant's bosom gored; 
When in Minerva's festal rite 
They closed Hipparchus' eyes in night.

Harmodius' praise, Aristogiton's name, 
Shall bloom on earth with undecaying fame; 
Who with the myrtle-wreathed sword 
The tyrant's bosom gored, 
And bade the men of Athens be 
Regenerate in equality.{{sfn|Elton|1833|pp=885}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Importance to the erastes-eromenos tradition==
The story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and its treatment by later Greek writers, is illustrative of attitudes to [[pederasty in ancient Greece]]. Both Thucydides and [[Herodotus]] describe the two as lovers, their love affair was styled as moderate ''(sophron)'' and legitimate ''(dikaios)''.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Fisher, Aeschines, ''Against Timarchos'' p.27; 2001, Oxford University Press; {{ISBN|0198149026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further confirming the status of the two as paragons of pederastic ethics, a domain forbidden to slaves, a law was passed prohibiting slaves from being named after the two heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Aul. Gel. 9.2.10; Lib. Decl. 1.1.71&lt;/ref&gt;

The story continued to be cited as an admirable example of heroism and devotion for many years. In 346 BC, for example, the politician [[Timarchus (4th century BC)|Timarchus]] was prosecuted (for political reasons) on the grounds that he had prostituted himself as a youth. The orator who defended him, [[Demosthenes]], cited Harmodius and Aristogeiton, as well as [[Achilles]] and [[Patroclus]], as examples of the beneficial effects of same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Aeschines, trans. Charles Darwin Adams, (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd., 1919), [132] &amp; [133] {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeschines]] offers them as an example of ''dikaios erōs,'' "just love", and as proof of the boons such love brings the lovers – who were both improved by love beyond all praise – as well as to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Wohl, ''Love among the Ruins: The Erotics of Democracy in Classical Athens'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Condell''' (5 September 1576 ([[Baptism|baptised]]) – December 1627) was an actor in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the playing company for which [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. With [[John Heminges]], he was instrumental in preparing and editing the [[First Folio]], the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, Kate. ''Shakespeare's Friends''. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) {{ISBN|9780275989569}} pp. 129-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from [[East Anglia]], as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of [[New Buckenham|newe Buckenham]]’.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|993|p=159}} According to Edmond:{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, he is associated with the "Harry" who appears in the cast list for [[Richard Tarlton]]'s [[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|''The Seven Deadly Sins'']], but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in [[Lord Strange's Men]] alongside [[John Heminges]] and [[Augustine Phillips]]. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at [[St Laurence Pountney]], Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the [[Strand, London|Strand]], gentleman.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} They settled in [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as [[churchwarden]] in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=158}}

Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lord Chamberlain's]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's]] companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; [[Nicholas Tooley]] and [[Alexander Cooke]] named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at [[Fulham]] in [[Middlesex]] and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in [[Snowshill]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.{{sfn|Barnard|1930|p=1}}

In addition to ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] plays: ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' (1603), ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (1611). He was the original Cardinal in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1679 in literature|1679]]:

Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627.{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=160}} He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] and [[Blackfriars Theatre]]s.

Although today's meaning is usually a place where a [[hermit]] lives in seclusion from the world, '''hermitage''' was more commonly used to mean a building or settlement where a person or a group of people lived religiously, in seclusion.  When included in the name of continental European properties or churches, any meaning is often imprecise, and may refer to some distant period of the history of what is today a property that is either a normal parish church, or ceased to have any religious function some time ago.  Secondary churches or establishments run from a monastery were often called "hermitages".   
[[File:Painshill Park hermits hut.jpg|thumb|The "hermitage" at [[Painshill Park]]]]
In the 18th century, some owners of [[English country house]]s equipped their gardens with a "hermitage", sometimes a Gothic ruin, but sometimes, as at [[Painshill Park]], a romantic hut which a "hermit" was recruited to occupy.  The so-called [[Ermita de San Pelayo y San Isidoro]] is the ruins of a Romanesque church from [[Ávila, Spain]], that eventually ended several hundred miles away, as a garden feature in the [[Buen Retiro Park]] in Madrid.

==Western Christian tradition==
[[File:Kerkzomerpiep.jpg|thumb|Hermitage "[[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden]]" in [[Warfhuizen]], [[the Netherlands]]]]
A hermitage is any type of domestic dwelling in which a [[hermit]] lives. While the level of isolation can vary widely, more often than not it is associated with a nearby [[monastery]]. Typically, hermitages consist of at least one detached room, or sometimes a dedicated space within an open floor plan building, for religious devotion, basic sleeping accommodations, and a domestic cooking range, suitable for the [[ascetic]] lifestyle of the inhabitant. Depending on the work of the hermit, premises such as a studio, workshop or chapel may be attached or sited in proximity.

Originally, the first hermitages were located in natural caves, temple ruins, and even simple huts in forests and deserts. Around the time of early fourth century (around 300 AD), the spiritual retreats of the [[Desert Fathers]], who had chosen to live apart from society in the relative isolation of the [[Nitrian Desert]] of [[Egypt]], began to attract the attention of the wider Christian community. The piety of such hermits often attracted both laity and other would-be ascetics, forming the first [[Cenobium|cenobitic]] communities called "sketes", such as [[Nitria (monastic site)|Nitria]] and [[Kellia]]. Within a short time, more and more people arrived to adopt the teachings and lifestyle of these hermits, and there began by necessity a mutual exchange of labour and shared goods between them, forming the first monastic communities.

In the later feudal period of the [[Middle Ages]], both monasteries and hermitages alike were endowed by royalty and nobility in return for prayers being said for their family, believing it to beneficial to the state of their soul.

[[Carthusian]] monks typically live in a one-room cell or building, with areas for study, sleep, prayer, and preparation of meals. Most Carthusians live a mostly solitary life, meeting with their brethren for communion, for shared meals on holy days, and again irregularly for nature walks, where they are encouraged to have simple discussions about their spiritual life.

In the modern era, hermitages are often abutted to monasteries, or located on their grounds, being occupied by monks who receive dispensation from their [[abbot]] or [[prior]] to live a semi-solitary life. However, hermitages can be found in a variety of settings, from isolated rural locations, houses in large cities, and even high-rise blocks of flats, depending on the hermit's means.

Examples of hermitages in Western Christian tradition:
#The [[Grande Chartreuse]] in [[Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse]], France, [[motherhouse]] of the [[Carthusian]] Order.
#[[New Camaldoli Hermitage]] in [[Big Sur]], [[California]], United States
#[[Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Krakow|Camaldolese Hermitage]] in [[Bielany, Kraków]], Poland
#[[Hermitage of Santa María de Lara]], a Visigothic building in northern Spain, probably built as a normal church, it later passed to a monastery before being abandoned.

'''Honoré Muraire''', (5 November 1750 - 20 November 1837) was a [[France|French]] statesman of the [[French Revolution]].  Under the [[Ancien Régime]] he held the title of [[seigneur]] of Favas; later under the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] he held a title of [[comte de l'Empire]].

==Biography==

Born in [[Draguignan]], [[Provence]], he was the son of Augustin Muraire, a lawyer of the court, and of Madeleine Castillon.  Muraire became a lawyer and built up a practice in his home town. He was appointed in 1785, at the age of 35, mayor and first consul of Draguignan, and in 1785 and in 1786, he was designated a representative to [[States Provincial (France)|provincial states]] of the [[pays d'etat]] of Provence.

==French Revolution==

When the social and political movements of the [[French Revolution]] started in 1789, Honoré Muraire was charged by the municipality of [[Draguignan]] to participate in the preparation of the [[cahiers de doléances]], and assisted in writing up a plan for the reform of the courts and a draft regulation concerning the bourgeois militia.

In 1790, he went on a mission to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] to promote his hometown for the coveted designation as chef-lieu for the new department of [[Var (department)|Var]] instead of [[Toulon]], as Draguignan was more centrally located.  He would return from his mission to take the position of president of the district. It was during this period that he became involved in [[freemasonry]].

The voters of the district of Draguignan elected him to the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] on 8 September 1791 (elected second out of eight, by 250 votes on 489 voting). He sat on the Legislative Committee, and reported to the assembly on 15 February 1792, in his capacity as rapporteur, a series of recommendations for [[Legislative Assembly (France)#Marriage Reform|marriage reform]].  He was appointed president of the Assembly (13–27 May 1792).

As the [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy|fall of the French monarchy]] unfolded in the summer of 1792, Muraire took the side of the doomed [[Louis XVI]].  On 13 July 1792, Muraire requested action be taken against [[Jerome Pétion|Pétion]] and [[Louis Pierre Manuel|Manuel]], respectively mayor and attorney of the [[Paris Commune]], as conspirators and accomplices of [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy#Protests of 20 June|the protests of 20 June 1792]], and later defended the actions of the monarchist general [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|La Fayette]].

For adopting these unpopular positions, he is not returned to the Convention in the elections of September 1792. This setback turned to his advantage as he avoided the excesses and purges of the [[French Terror]], although he did spend some time imprisoned in Sainte-Pelagie.  He was released during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]

==Directory, Consulate, and Empire==

Under the [[French Directory]], he was elected in September 1795 (23 Vendémiaire IV) as a member of the [[Council of Ancients]] by the department of the [[Seine (department)|Seine]] by 364 votes out of 876 voters. Following the [[18 Fructidor|18 Fructidor V coup]] (4 September 1797), several deputies came under the threat of arrest and deportation. Muraire, who had spoken in favor of émigré and deported priests, appeared along with such conservatives as [[Claude-Emmanuel de Pastoret|de Pastoret]], [[Camille Jordan]], and [[François Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas|Boissy d'Anglas]], on the list of suspects.  Sentenced to be deported to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]], he instead found a way to hide, and ended up sentenced to detention at the island of [[Oléron]], where he remained more than two years.

By a decree dated 5 Nivose year VIII (25 December 1799), he is pardoned, along with his companions in exile, by the newly appointed [[first consul]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and permitted to come to Paris and to remain there under the supervision of the department of the police.

Highly recommended by [[Joseph Bonaparte]], a fellow [[freemason]], Muraire was appointed as the first commissioner to the Paris Prosecutor by the first consul, before being appointed to the [[Court of Cassation (France)|tribunal of cassation]] as a counselor 11 Germinal VIII (1 April 1800). When the original president of this institution (created in 1790), [[François Denis Tronchet]], was appointed senator in 1801, Muraire succeeded him. Muraire received further promotions, appointed adviser to state the 14 Floreal X (4 May 1802), then the first First President of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] on 29 Floreal XII (19 April 1804). He requested of the Emperor, who agreed, that the court of cassation, just as the [[Parlement]]s before 1789, would inaugurate its work by a religious ceremony.

His daughter Elisabeth married [[Élie, duc Decazes]] (future [[Prime Minister of France]] 1819-1820), 1 August 1805, but she died shortly thereafter.

In 1809, Napoleon I appointed him to the [[comte de l'Empire]]. He named a senator in 1811, and became a [[Order of the Reunion|Chevalier de l'ordre de la Reunion]] 3 April 1812, an honour just below the [[Legion of Honour]].  In recognition of such honors, Muraire served Bonaparte with much zeal.

==Restoration, Hundred Days, and later life==

Alas, when the Emperor first fell from power, Muraire and his Court of Cassation declared that they would abide by the proclamation of [[Talleyrand|Talleyrand's]] Provisional Government and support "the stronger side."  Muraire personally complimented [[Charles X (France)|Comte d'Artois]] soon after.  It is not enough to preserve him in his lofty position, and he is replaced as President of the Court by [[Raymond Desèze|de Sèze]] 16 February 1815.

The [[Hundred Days]] (beginning in March 1815) briefly resurrected his fortunes, and Muraire, retaking his position at the head of the Court of Cassation, personally proclaimed the restoration of Napoleon as Emperor at the [[Tuileries]]. Of course, with the [[Battle of Waterloo]], his political career is ruined.

Muraire spent the rest of his days in social life, literary pursuits and Masonic activities. He died 20 November 1837, at the age of 87 years, in Paris. A posthumous portrait, painted by [[Georges Cain]], has sat since 1892 in a place of honour in the gallery of the first Civil Chamber of the Court of Cassation.

'''Ibrahim Bushati''' or '''Ibrahim Bushat [[Pasha]]''' (died 1810) was a noble of the [[Bushati]] family in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] controlled [[Albania]] near the city of [[Shkodër]]. Brother of [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]], the Ottoman appointed governor of [[Shkodër]], [[Albania]].During his rule in Shkodra, Ibrahim was appointed Beylebey of Rumelia in 1805 and took part in the attempt to crush the [[First Serbian Uprising]] under [[Karađorđe Petrović]] after the [[Battle of Ivankovac]]. Ibrahim Bushati is also known to have aided [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]] on various occasions. In fact Ali Pasha's two sons Muktar Pasha and Veil Pasha are known to have served under the command of Ibrahim Bushati in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Srbija i Albanci u XIX i početkom XX veka: ciklus predavanja 10-25. November 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim Bushati inherited a very turbulent position at [[Shkodër]], especially after the events of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] and consistently worked closely with the Ottoman Empire right up until his death in 1810. He was succeeded by [[Mustafa Reshit Pasha]].

'''Ji Dengkui''' ({{zh|s=纪登奎}}; 17 March 1923 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1988) was a prominent Chinese political figure during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He was a member of the 10th and 11th Politburos of the Communist Party and was a protégé of [[Mao Zedong]] in Mao's later years. He served in a number of important government and military posts, including member of the [[Central Military Commission]], [[Political Commissar]] of the [[Beijing Military Region]], and Vice Premier of the State Council. After Mao's death in 1976, he supported Mao's designated successor, [[Hua Guofeng]], in purging the [[Gang of Four]]. Two years later, [[Deng Xiaoping]] ousted Hua from his leadership position, and Ji, labelled the "Little Gang of Four" together with other prominent Hua supporters, was forced out of politics.

==Early life==
Ji Dengkui was born in [[Wuxiang County]], [[Shanxi]] province on 17 March 1923. After the eruption of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, he joined the anti-Japanese resistance before turning 15, and the [[Communist Party of China]] the following year.&lt;ref name=xiafei&gt;{{cite web |author=Xiafei |script-title=zh:纪登奎所经历的人生风浪 |url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/68742/70423/70424/5280335.html |publisher=People's Daily |language=Chinese |date=2007-01-14 |accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Song2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Yuwu Song |title=Biographical Dictionary of the People's Republic of China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnsjAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148 |date=8 July 2013 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3582-1 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Anti-Japanese War and the subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]], he served in various party positions including Party Secretary of [[Lushan County, Henan|Lushan County]] in [[Henan]] province. Although he participated in some battles during the wars, he frankly admitted that he had little military experience, even after [[Mao Zedong]] appointed him to top military posts of China in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;

==Early People's Republic==
After Mao's Communist Party won the Civil War and established the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, Ji continued to serve as a local party official in Henan.&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt; In 1951, Ji met Mao for the first time during Mao's tour of Henan. Ji, then Deputy Party Secretary of [[Xuchang]] prefecture, reportedly gained the favour of Mao by giving straightforward answers to Mao's questions, and frankly admitted that he had killed innocent people by mistake during the Communist Revolution. Mao praised his work and Ji was soon promoted to Party Secretary of Xuchang, at the age of only 28.&lt;ref name=peng&gt;{{cite web |title=毛泽东赏识的纪登奎因何退出政治舞台 |url=http://view.news.qq.com/a/20140308/004634.htm |publisher=Tencent |date=2014-03-08 |author=Peng Jinxiu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the Party Secretary of [[Luoyang]] prefecture during the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958 to 1961), and avoided implementing the catastrophic policies of other local leaders which caused extensive famine in Henan, especially in [[Xinyang]] prefecture. Few people died of hunger in Luoyang, while more than a million people starved to death in the infamous "Xinyang Incident".&lt;ref name=peng/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thaxton2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ralph Thaxton |title=Catastrophe and Contention in Rural China: Mao's Great Leap Forward Famine and the Origins of Righteous Resistance in Da Fo Village |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14A1qPQOgQMC&amp;pg=PA197 |date=5 May 2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72230-8 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao Zedong visited Henan more than ten times before the start of the [[Cultural Revolution]], and summoned Ji Dengkui for reporting whenever he was in the province. Although Mao was 30 years older than Ji, he publicly referred to Ji as his "old friend". Ji rose quickly within the party ranks, first to the provincial party committee as an alternate party secretary, and later to the national government.&lt;ref name=peng/&gt;

==Cultural Revolution==
When the [[Cultural Revolution]] erupted in 1966, Ji was a deputy director of the Henan Cultural Revolution Committee, effectively the deputy head of the provincial government. When the so-called [[January Storm]] swept through China in January 1967, China fell into anarchy and the radical Rebel Faction (''Zaofanpai'' 造反派) of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] took over many local governments, including that of Henan. Ji was persecuted and imprisoned by the Rebels for six months, and endured numerous [[struggle session]]s.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt; In July 1967, however, Ji was released and restored as the deputy director of the Henan Revolutionary Committee, and the ''de facto'' top leader in Henan. His release was announced after a visit to Henan from representatives of the central government, and was believed to be partly due to his relationship with Mao.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;

In 1969, Ji was designated by Mao to speak as a representative of the "revolutionary cadres" at the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], at which he was elected a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]]. Soon afterward he was elected an alternate member of the [[9th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], catapulting him into the ranks of national leaders.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;

As one of Mao's loyal supporters, Ji became a member of the [[Central Military Commission]] in September 1970 as part of Mao's strategy to "mix the sand" by inserting officials loyal to him into the ranks of [[Lin Biao]]'s military staff to keep a check on Lin. He was also appointed [[Political Commissar]] of the crucial [[Beijing Military Region]].&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;

After Lin Biao's death in a 1971 plane crash, Ji was elected a full member of the [[10th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|10th Politburo]] in 1973, and became Vice-Premier in January 1975.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt;

==After the Cultural Revolution==
After Mao died in 1976, Ji supported Mao's designated successor [[Hua Guofeng]], and helped Hua purge the [[Gang of Four]], including Mao's widow [[Jiang Qing]], from the CPC leadership.&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt; He was instrumental in taking over the influential newspaper ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', which had been controlled by the Gang of Four.&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt; In 1977, he was re-elected a full member of the [[11th Politburo of the Communist Party of China|11th Politburo]].&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;

Ji was a member of the "[[Two Whatevers|Whatever Faction]]" that allied with Hua Guofeng, who was eventually to be outmaneuvered by [[Deng Xiaoping]] to resign from the highest command of party leadership. &lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt;{{rp|62–63}} Leading up to the watershed events in 1978, Ji had served as the Executive Vice Premier of the Council in charge of agriculture. Although initially playing a key role in setting the agenda and drafting documents on agricultural development, Ji quickly found himself subject to criticisms from all sides for "mistakes" he made during the Cultural Revolution at the [[3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Third Plenum of the Eleventh Party Congress]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt; Taken over from [[Hua Guofeng]] by [[Chen Yun]] and [[Hu Yaobang]], the subsequent discussion sessions turned to the historical cases of [[Liu Shaoqi]], [[Peng Dehuai]], [[Tao Zhu]], and [[Bo Yibo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Shukai |title=The Hinge of Fate after 1978 |journal=China Development Observation |date=26 September 2015 |issue=9 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/drc/2016-07/18/content_26130083.htm |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Yu Guangyuan]], who was in the same Northwest Group at the Conference, Ji remained noticeably passive throughout these sessions. “Among the 35 members in northwest group," recounts Yu, "34 of them spoke actively." Ji was also named, after his fellow Vice Premier [[Wang Dongxing]] was criticized by Hu Yaobang and Yu Guangyuan's reformist camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yu |first1=Guangyuan |last2=Vogel |first2=Ezra |last3=Levine |first3=Stevine |title=Deng Xiaoping Shakes the World: An Eyewitness Account of China's Party Work Conference and the Third Plenum (November-December 1978) |date=2004 |publisher=EastBridge |isbn=978-1891936531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Ji Dengkui, [[Wang Dongxing]], [[Wu De]], and [[Chen Xilian]], the four high-ranking allies of Hua, were labelled the "Little Gang of Four" and dismissed from the most important of their political posts.&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt; Although the decision was made in 1978, it was not made public until February 1980, at the Fifth Plenum of the Party Congress.&lt;ref name=xiafei/&gt;&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt;

Ji was reassigned a researcher at the Research Center of Rural Development in China in 1982.&lt;ref name="Song2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=peng/&gt; He died of an illness on 13 July 1988, at the age of 65.&lt;ref name=peng/&gt;

In its October 25, 2010, issue, Amash was named one of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s "40 under 40 – Rising Stars of U.S. Politics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023831_2023829_2025197,00.html TIME Magazine, "40 under 40 – Rising Stars of U.S. Politics – Justin Amash], time.com; accessed March 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 30, Amash was the youngest federal officeholder in the United States on ''Time'''s list.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amashforcongress.com/news/time-magazine-names-justin-amash-one-its-40-rising-stars|title=TIME Magazine names Justin Amash one of its 40 Rising Stars|publisher=Justin Amash for Congress|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=October 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028234600/http://amashforcongress.com/news/time-magazine-names-justin-amash-one-its-40-rising-stars|archivedate=October 28, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2010, Amash won the five-way Republican primary for the seat vacated by retiring Republican [[Vern Ehlers]] with over 40% of the vote.  He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Connolly|first=Michael|title=Club for Growth PAC Endorses Justin Amash in Michigan-03|url=http://www.clubforgrowth.org/perm/?postID=13599|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20100621006749/en Ron Paul Endorses Justin Amash for Congress], eon.businesswire.com, June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FreedomWorks|FreedomWorks PAC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FreedomWorks PAC Endorses Justin Amash, Candidate in Michigan`s Third Congressional District|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/29/idUS269196+29-Jul-2010+BW20100729|accessdate=March 12, 2012|newspaper=Business Wire|date=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his primary campaign.

During the general election, Amash campaigned on a conservative platform.&lt;ref name="Profile 3rd"/&gt; Amash defeated Democrat [[Patrick Miles, Jr.]] 60%–37% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/10GEN/06003000.html|title=2010 Official Michigan General Election Results – 3rd District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position|publisher=Michigan Department of State|accessdate=March 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129155051/http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/10GEN/06003000.html|archivedate=January 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amash won [[United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2012#District 3|re-election to the U.S. House in 2012]] for his second term, defeating [[Steve Pestka]] 53%–44%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Michigan Generaral Candidate Listing|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/candlist/12GEN/12GEN_CL.HTM|website=Miboecfr.nuctusa.com|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/MI 2012 Election Results Map by State – Live Voting Updates], Politico.com, June 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2014#District 3}}
After initial speculation that he might run for the [[United States Senate election in Michigan, 2014|U.S. Senate]], Amash confirmed that he would run for re-election to the House of Representatives in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alberta|first=Tim|title=Justin Amash Will Not Run for Senate in Michigan|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/justin-amash-will-not-run-for-senate-in-michigan-20130917|accessdate=January 16, 2014|newspaper=National Journal|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=Brian|title=Justin Amash Targeted by Michigan GOP Business Establishment for Lacking Party Discipline|url=http://reason.com/blog/2013/11/10/justin-amash-targeted-by-michigan-gop-bu|accessdate=January 16, 2014|newspaper=Reason|date=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amash was endorsed by the fiscally conservative [[Club for Growth]] PAC, which spent over $500,000 supporting Amash in his Republican primary against former East Grand Rapids School Trustee Brian Ellis, who was endorsed by the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] and spent more than $1 million of his own money on the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Amash (MI-03) profile|url=http://www.clubforgrowth.org/pac-candidates|work=PAC Candidates|publisher=Club for Growth PAC|accessdate=January 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208012452/http://www.clubforgrowth.org/pac-candidates|archivedate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Abby|title=Club For Growth Back on TV for Justin Amash|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/club-for-growth-justin-amash-brian-ellis-tv-primary/?dcz=|accessdate=August 4, 2014|publisher=Roll Call|date=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Races {{ndash}} Michigan District 03 Race {{ndash}} Summary Data|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary.php?cycle=2014&amp;id=MI03|website=Open Secrets|publisher=The Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Amash defeated Ellis in the August primary, with 57.4% of the vote to Ellis' 42.6%, Amash was highly critical of Ellis and former Congressman [[Pete Hoekstra]], who had backed Ellis. Of Hoekstra, Amash said, "You are a disgrace. And I'm glad we could hand you one more loss before you fade into total obscurity and irrelevance." Amash took exception to one of Ellis' television ads that quoted California Republican Congressman [[Devin Nunes]] calling Amash "[[Al Qaeda]]'s best friend in Congress"; he demanded an apology from Ellis for running what he called a "disgusting, despicable smear campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blake, Aaron|date=2014-08-06|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|format=major news org. online blog|title=Justin Amash's absolutely amazing victory speech|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/08/06/justin-amash-won-on-tuesday-and-then-things-got-interesting-video/?tid=pm_politics_pop|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedersdorfAtlantic6Aug14&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedersdorf, Conor|date=2014-08-06|journal=[[The Atlantic]]|format=online staff comment|title=Why Justin Amash's Primary Victory Matters|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/why-rep-justin-amashs-primary-victory-matters/375634|accessdate=March 15, 2016|quote=Representative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican, is one of the most important civil libertarians in the House of Representatives.

In the general election, Amash defeated Democrat Bob Goodrich and Green Party candidate Tonya Duncan with 58% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/2014GEN_CENR.html|title=2014 Michigan Election results|work=Michigan Department of State|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
Amash has been noted for his attendance. From January 2011 to February 2017, Amash missed none of the 4,243 roll call votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/justin_amash/412438|title=Justin Amash|publisher=govtrack.us|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mold/&gt;

==Political positions==
===Economic issues===
Amash supports [[free market]]s with limited government regulation. He advocates for [[economic freedom]] and believes that stimulus programs and government bailouts are ineffective ways to energize the economy. He supports adopting a [[flat tax]] in lieu of targeted tax breaks and subsidies. Amash opposes central [[economic planning]], which he believes contributes to unemployment, inflation, and unstable business cycles.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

He was one of four Republicans who joined 161 Democrats to oppose a [[Constitutional amendment]] that would require a yearly [[balanced budget amendment|balanced budget]], due to serious concerns {{clarify|date=March 2017}} with that specific proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/194511-balanced-budget-amendment-fails-in-house|title=Balanced-budget amendment comes up short in House vote|work=TheHill|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, Amash had introduced H.J.Res. 81, an alternative balanced budget amendment that addressed those concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-joint-resolution/81|title=H.J.Res.81 – 112th Congress (2011–2012): Proposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States - Library of Congress|work=congress.gov|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
Amash supports decreased federal intervention in energy-related issues. He wants to eliminate government-sponsored subsidies for energy production and decrease overall regulation. He believes that no form of energy production should be specially favored or restricted. In addition, Amash supports minimizing federal environmental regulations. He voted in favor of the [[Energy Tax Prevention Act|Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011]], which would have amended the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act of 1963]] to prohibit the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] from regulating specified [[greenhouse gasses]] as [[air pollutants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/House/Michigan/Justin_Amash/Views/Energy_and_the_Environment Justin Amash – Energy and the Environment], Thepoliticalguide.com, June 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/910|title=H.R.910 - 112th Congress (2011-2012): Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flint water crisis===
Amash was the only representative from Michigan to oppose federal aid in response to the [[Flint water crisis]], arguing that "the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one." Instead Amash contended that "the State of Michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of Flint."&lt;ref&gt;Nate Reens, [http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/01/justin_amash_stands_alone_oppo.html#incart_story_package Justin Amash stood alone opposing Flint water federal aid bid], MLive.com, January 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerrymandering===
Amash has expressed opposition to political gerrymandering.  He said in 2018, "I firmly believe there should be an independent process for drawing districts. They should be based on geographic considerations, and they should be as compact and contiguous as possible...I always felt the maps should be drawn in a way that is less political and more based on geographic considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oosting |first1=Jonathan |title=Amash: Partisan redistricting an ‘ugly’ process |url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/10/03/justin-amash-gerrymandering-ugly-process/1511884002/ |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |work=The Detroit News |date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
On May 4, 2017, Amash voted in favor of repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare) and to pass a revised version of the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/ahca-house-vote|title=How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amash initially opposed the American Health Care Act, describing it as "Swampcare",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amash|first1=Justin|url=https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/847671405244145664|title= Didn't vote for #Swampcare because it's just another version of #Obamacare ....|date=March 31, 2017|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=May 4, 2017}} Accessible if registered.&lt;/ref&gt; tweeting that "It didn't take long for the swamp to drain @realDonaldTrump"&lt;ref&gt;Kamisar, Ben, [http://thehill.com/homenews/house/326479-freedom-caucus-member-fires-back-the-swamp-drained-trump "Freedom Caucus member fires back: The swamp drained Trump"], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', March 30, 2017; retrieved 2017-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticizing House leadership for attempting to "ram it through."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shelbourne|first1=Mallory|title=Amash: GOP wants to 'ram' ObamaCare plan through Congress|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/322932-amash-gop-wants-to-ram-obamacare-plan-through-congress|accessdate=4 May 2017|publisher=The Hill|date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Amash voted for the updated AHCA plan before the [[Congressional Budget Office]] could determine its impact or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah|title=Congress is voting Thursday on a bill to replace Obamacare.

===Immigration===
In July 2018 House Republicans introduced a resolution “supporting the officers and personnel” of [[U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)]].  Amash was the only Republican in the chamber to vote against the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weigel |first1=David |title=The new ‘Dr. No’: Rep.

The resolution makes several dubious claims and denounces calls to abolish ICE. I wouldn’t abolish ICE without an alternative, but there’s no reason to treat a federal agency as though it’s beyond reproach and reform.”&lt;ref name="WBCKFM" /&gt;

===Security and surveillance===
Amash has been a frequent critic of the [[National Security Agency]]'s anti-terrorism surveillance programs.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fung, Brian|date=2013-07-25|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|format=major news org. online blog|title=Justin Amash almost beat the NSA.

He voted against the 2011 reauthorization of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h376|title=S. 990 (112th): PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 – House Vote #376|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2012 reauthorization of the [[FISA Amendments Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h569|title=H.R. 5949 (112th): FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012 – House Vote #569|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[USA Freedom Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll224.xml|format=XML|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 224|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amash opposed President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated: "Like Pres. Obama's executive actions on immigration, Pres. Trump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system."&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban|website=Denver Post|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amash proposed an amendment to the reauthorization bill of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.&lt;ref&gt;https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/FISA_amd_01_xml18180933373337.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Amash amendment would have required the government in criminal cases to seek a warrant based on probable cause before searching surveillance data for information about Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By CHARLIE SAVAGEJAN. 10, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/nsa-surveillance-privacy-section-702-amendment.html |title=Surveillance and Privacy Debate Reaches Pivotal Moment in Congress - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2018-01-10 |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published 10:43 a.m. ET Jan. 11, 2018 |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/11/house-amash-warrantless-surveillance-reform/109357826/ |title=House rejects Amash measure on warrantless surveillance |publisher=Detroitnews.com |date=2018-01-11 |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Amash amendment received bipartisan support as well as support from civil liberties groups including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/01/11/house-vote-privacy-advocates-offer-changes-controversial-surveillance/1020930001/ |title=House votes to renew a surveillance law that collects Americans' emails |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2018-01-11 |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amendment ultimately failed by a vote of 183 to 233.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2018/roll014.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social issues===
====Abortion====
Amash is [[United States pro-life movement|pro-life]]. He opposes [[abortion]] and the use of federal funding for abortion.&lt;ref name="ontheissues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/MI/Justin_Amash.htm|title=Justin Amash on the Issues|website=Ontheissues.org|accessdate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Amash opposes government funding for abortion, he voted "present", rather than "yes" or "no" on the 2011 Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act, which provided for the cessation of federal funding to [[Planned Parenthood]]. He explained, "Legislation that names a specific private organization to defund (rather than all organizations that engage in a particular activity) is improper and arguably unconstitutional".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/us/politics/15freshman.html|work=The New York Times|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|title=Justin Amash, Republican Freshman, Bucks His Party|date=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' asked him to explain his approach to voting on legislation, he replied, "I follow a set of principles, I follow the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. And that's what I base my votes on. [[Limited government]], [[economic freedom]], and individual liberty."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

====Same-sex marriage====
He supported a repeal of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] as per his Twitter account, stating that the "real threat" to traditional marriage and religious liberty is government, and not gay couples.&lt;ref name="ontheissues"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/justin-amash-doma-repeal_n_2981622.html Justin Amash Backs DOMA Repeal On Twitter], ''Huffington Post'', March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suicide prevention hotline====
In July 2018 Amash was the only member of the U.S. House to vote against creating a three-digit suicide prevention hotline.  He wrote on Twitter, “It’s another good idea without a constitutional basis.  I swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I take that oath seriously. Constitutional limits are meaningless if we ignore them whenever we like the policy outcome.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burr |first1=Thomas |title=House passes Rep.

In 2016 Amash made headlines by joining the [[List of Republicans who opposed Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|list of Republicans who opposed the GOP nominee]] for President, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="Oppose Trump"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/278141-republicans-who-vow-to-never-back-trump|title=Republicans who vow to never back Trump|last1=Britzky|first1=Haley|last2=Barr|first2=Luke|last3=Dunn|first3=Andrew|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsWSJ4343&gt;{{cite news|first=Natalie|last=Andrews |date=February 20, 2017 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/justin-amash-emerges-as-leading-critic-of-fellow-republican-donald-trump-1487599201 |title=Justin Amash Emerges as Leading Critic of Fellow Republican Donald Trump|newspaper=wsj.com|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsNewsmax494&gt;{{cite web|first=Theodore|last=Bunker|date=February 20, 2017|website=[[Newsmax]] |url=https://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Justin-Amash-Trump-Critic-GOP/2017/02/20/id/774589/ |title=WSJ: Justin Amash Becoming Trump's Leading Critic in the GOP|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Trump was elected president, the ''Huffington Post'' profiled him in an article with the following title, "The One House Republican Who Can't Stop Criticizing Donald Trump."  Amash said, "I'm not here to represent a particular political party; I'm here to represent all of my constituents and to follow the Constitution."&lt;ref name="CBS1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Kathryn|title=Trump aide calls for primary challenge against Freedom Caucus member|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-aide-dan-scavino-calls-for-amash-primary-challenger/|website=CBS News|accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Matt|title=The One House Republican Who Can't Stop Criticizing Donald Trump|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-amash-donald-trump_us_58406d7ae4b017f37fe35a9e|accessdate=March 11, 2018|work=Huffington Post|date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2017, Trump sent out a series of tweets criticizing [[John Lewis (civil rights leader)|Rep. John Lewis (D-GA)]], one of the main leaders in the 1960s [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]]. Amash responded with a quick quip, "Dude, just stop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan Congressman Justin Amash to Donald Trump: 'Dude, just stop'|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/michigan_congressman_justin_am.html|website=MLive.com|publisher=MLive Media Group|accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2017, senior White House aide [[Dan Scavino Jr.|Dan Scavino]] tweeted that Amash was "a big liability" and urged followers to "defeat him in primary."  Amash later referred to Trump as a "childish bully," saying that his attacks would be "constructive in the fifth grade. It may allow a child to get his way, but that's not how our government works."&lt;ref name="CBS1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House aide calls for primary challenge against Rep.

In May 2017 Trump was accused of pressuring fired FBI director [[James Comey]] to end an investigation into former national security adviser [[Michael Flynn]].  
Amash was reported as the first Republican congressman to publicly state that the allegations, if proven true, merited impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/333803-first-republican-raises-impeachment-for-trump|title=First Republican raises impeachment for Trump|first=Elliot|last=Smilowitz|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report is contested by the office of [[Carlos Curbelo (politician)|Rep.

In June 2018 the ''Huffington Post'' asked House Republicans, "If the president pardoned himself, would they support impeachment?"  Amash was the only Republican who said "definitively he would support impeachment..."&lt;ref name="HuffPost2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reilly|first1=Ryan|last2=Delaney|first2=Arthur|last3=Fuller|first3=Matt|title=What Will House Republicans Do If Trump Pardons Himself?

Amash tweeted, "The impression it left on me, a strong supporter of the meeting, is that 'something is not right here.' The president went out of his way to appear subordinate. He spoke more like the head of a vassal state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/397787-gop-lawmaker-trump-went-out-of-his-way-to-appear-subordinate-at-putin-press|title=GOP lawmaker: Trump 'went out of his way to appear subordinate' at Putin press conference|work=TheHill|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana legalization and forfeiture===
Amash and fellow [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Ted Lieu|Ted W. Lieu]] (D-CA) introduced a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ted W. Lieu, Justin Amash|title=Introduction of the Bill.|url=https://lieu.house.gov/sites/lieu.house.gov/files/documents/LIEU_015_xml.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=Mr. Ted W. Lieu, Mr. Justin Amash|date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to block the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) from financing its Cannabis Eradication Program through [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil asset forfeitures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mark Ram|title=Civil Forfeiture for Marijuana Businesses|url=http://marijuanainvestments.org/civil-forfeiture-for-marijuana-businesses|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=Mark Ram|date=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a DEA performance budget submitted to Congress for the [[fiscal year]] (FY) 2014, the DEA received $18 million in FY 2013 funding for cannabis eradication from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s Asset Forfeiture Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=U.S. Department of Justice|title=FY 2014 Performance Budget Congressional Submission.|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/05/16/dea-justification.pdf|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=U.S Department of Justice|date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amash took aim at civil asset forfeiture in a statement, saying that the practice allows for "innocent people to have their property taken without sufficient [[Due Process Clause|due process]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steven Nelson|title=Congressmen Want to Save Pot Plants From DEA Sickle.|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/23/congressmen-want-to-save-millions-of-pot-plants-from-dea-sickle|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=Steven Nelson|date=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amash co-sponsored H.R. 1227, also known as the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017. The bill was introduced by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Thomas Garrett (American politician)|Thomas Garrett]] (R-VA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1227/text |title=Text - H.R.1227 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017 &amp;#124; Congress.gov &amp;#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign affairs===
[[File:Justin Amash (28430150180).jpg|thumb|Amash speaking at the 2016 [[Young Americans for Liberty]] National Convention in Washington, D.C.]]
Amash supports decreasing [[Military budget of the United States|U.S. military spending]], and believes there is significant waste in the military spending of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-split-over-expected-obama-request-for-more-defense-outlays-1422491129|title=GOP Split Over Expected Obama Request for More Defense Outlays|author1=Kristina Peterson|author2=Julian E. Barnes|date=January 29, 2015|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He believes only [[United States Congress|Congress]] has the [[War Powers Clause|power to declare war]], criticizing President Obama's [[Military intervention against ISIL|military intervention]] against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[American-led intervention in Syria|intervention in Syria]], for proceeding without a Congressional declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/19102-lawmakers-slam-obama-for-skirting-congress-constitution-on-isis|title=Lawmakers Slam Obama for Skirting Congress, Constitution on ISIS|work=thenewamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedersdorfAtlantic29Aug13&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedersdorf, Conor|date=2013-08-29|journal=[[The Atlantic]]|format=online article|title= President Obama Faces Mounting Pressure to Stay Out of Syria|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/president-obama-faces-mounting-pressure-to-stay-out-of-syria/279154|quote=President Obama faces increasing pressure from lawmakers, foreign-policy experts, constitutional scholars, and anti-war activists to refrain from striking Syria. Opponents of war worry that an insular group of hawkish Washington, D.C., elites will succeed in prompting an intervention the consequences of which they cannot anticipate, despite widespread public opposition to U.S. involvement. The concerns of Syria anti-interventionists vary, but all agree that the president should not unilaterally decide to attack tyrant Bashar al-Assad's regime, even granting that recent chemical weapons attacks on civilians were atrocious.|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Amash was one of six members of Congress who voted "Nay" on House Resolution 268 reaffirming U.S. commitment to a negotiated settlement of the [[Israel–Palestine relations|Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] through direct Israeli–Palestinian negotiation, which passed with 407 members in support.&lt;ref name="timmak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Washington Post Staff|date=2011-07-07|journal=[[The Washington Post]]|format=online database entry|title=The U.S. Congress Votes Database: Vote 524, H RES [House Resolution] 268|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/112/house/1/votes/524|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, he was one of eight members of Congress who voted "Nay" on a $225 million package to restock [[Israel]]'s [[Iron Dome]] [[missile defense]]s, which passed with 398 members in support.&lt;ref name=KlapperHuffPost1Aug14&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klapper, Bradley|date=2011-08-01|journal=[[The Huffington Post]]|format=online article|title=Senate Approves Additional Iron Dome Funding For Israel|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/senate-iron-dome-funding_n_5641627.html|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports a [[two-state solution]] to the Palestinian–Israeli conflict.&lt;ref name="timmak"/&gt;

Amash joined 104 Democrats and 16 Republicans in voting against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|2012 National Defense Authorization Act]] (NDAA), which specified the budget and expenditures of the Department of Defense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOUSE VOTE No. 291 IN 2012|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h291|publisher=govtrack.us|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "one of the most anti-liberty pieces of legislation of our lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Jack|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/12/02/the-terrorists-have-won/#ixzz1guuJTL4Qh|title=The terrorists have won|publisher=The Daily Caller Opinion|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amash co-sponsored an amendment to the NDAA that would ban indefinite military detention and military trials so that all terror suspects arrested in the United States would be tried in civilian courts. He expressed concern that individuals charged with [[terrorism]] could be jailed for prolonged periods of time without ever being formally charged or brought to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2012/05/11/the-smith-amash-amendment-what-it-says-and-means How Smith-Amash NDAA Amendment Bans Indefinite Detention (FACT SHEET)], Human Rights First, November 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2016, Amash joined the unanimous vote in the House to approve a resolution declaring the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) to be committing genocide against religious minorities in the Middle East (passed 383–0), but joined Representatives [[Tulsi Gabbard]] (D-HI) and [[Thomas Massie]] (R-KY) in voting "Nay" on a separate measure creating an international tribunal to try those accused of participating in the alleged atrocities (passed 392–3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shaw, Adam|author2=Pergram, Chad|date=2016-03-16|title=House declares ISIS committing genocide against Christians, other minorities|journal=Fox News|format=online news report|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/03/15/house-declares-isis-committing-genocide-against-christians-other-minorities.html?intcmp=trending|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Amash criticized U.S. involvement in [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], highlighting that "Al Qaeda in Yemen has emerged as a de facto ally of the Saudi-led militaries with whom [Trump] administration aims to partner more closely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-support-for-saudi-arabias-war-on-yemen-must-end|title=America's Support for Saudi Arabia's War on Yemen Must End|date=April 5, 2017|work=[[The Nation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Amash joined Reps. [[Thomas Massie]] (R-KY), [[John Duncan Jr.]] (R-TN) and Sens. [[Rand Paul]] (R-KY) and [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-VT) in opposing a bill that would impose new economic sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea. President Trump opposed the bill, pointing out that relations with Russia were already "at an all-time and dangerous low." He did, however, sign the bill though likely out of political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ivn.us/2017/08/03/meet-5-lawmakers-voted-against-russia-sanctions-bill/|title=Meet the 5 Lawmakers Who Voted Against the Russia Sanctions Bill|date=August 3, 2017|website=IVN.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Steering and Policy Committees of the United States House of Representatives#House Republican Steering Committee|House Republican Steering Committee]] removed Amash from the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.&lt;ref&gt;Wing, Nick, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/tim-huelskamp-john-boehner_n_2285196.html  "Tim Huelskamp: John Boehner Guilty Of 'Petty, Vindictive Politics' In Committee Ousters"], ''The Huffington Post'', December 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP01&gt;Weiner, Rachel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2012/12/05/conservatives-bite-back-at-gop-leadership-over-purge/ "Conservatives bite back over House GOP purge"], washingtonpost.com, December 5, 2012; retrieved January 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Tim Huelskamp]] (R-[[Kansas]]) and [[David Schweikert]] (R-[[Arizona]]) in a letter to [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]], demanding to know why they had lost their committee positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Booted from plum committee seats, three GOP reps want answers|date=December 8, 2012|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/08/booted-from-plum-committee-seats-three-gop-reps-want-answers|first=Gregory|last=Wallace|publisher=CNN|work= Political Ticker (blog)|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirk Baptiste''' (born June 20, 1962) is a retired [[United States|American]] track and field athlete, who mainly competed in the 200 metres. He was born in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. He competed for the United States at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]], where he won the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 19.96 seconds. This was the first time anyone had broken 20 seconds and come second in the race. Baptiste was diagnosed with [[HIV]] in the 1990s, spending a decade abusing drugs to escape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">'''Lady Mary Dering''' (née '''Mary Harvey''') (''bap.'' 3 September 1629 &amp;ndash; 7 February 1704) was an English composer.

She was born in Croydon on 3 September 1629, daughter of Daniel Harvey and Elizabeth Kynnersley. Daniel Harvey was a wealthy London merchant and member of the [[Levant Company]], his eldest brother being the anatomist [[William Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakula|first1=Alex|title=The Betchworth Portraits; Members of the Family of William Harvey|journal=Medical History|date=1980|volume=24|pages=333–341|doi=10.1017/S0025727300040357|pmc=1082658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At school in 1640, at Hackney's "Ladies university of the female arts"&lt;!--?--&gt;, she began a friendship with [[Katherine Philips]] (''the Matchless Orinda''). Mary studied with [[Henry Lawes]], who dedicated his book to her; in the dedication he highly praises her compositions, and says that few of any sex have matched their perfection. Some of her music was published in [[John Playford]]'s ''Select Ayres and Dialogues'', and three of her songs were published in Lawes' ''Second book of airs''; these are the first known published works by a woman in England.&lt;ref&gt;Women in Music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--published works total or published musical works?--&gt;

On 5 April 1648 Mary Harvey married to [[Edward Dering, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]. They had seventeen children, seven of whom died young. She survived her husband by twenty years, dying in February 1704 (1705 [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]); she also outlived her eldest son [[Sir Edward Dering, 3rd Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;Haslewood, Rev. Francis (1876): ''Genealogical Memoranda relating to the Family of Dering''. London; privately printed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Dering was buried at [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]], and has a memorial inscription in the church there.

The '''Lincoln family''' includes all the descendants of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].
There are ten known descendants of Lincoln. The family line is believed to have been extinct since its last undisputed descendant, [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died on December 24, 1985, without any children.{{refn|Robert's second wife did have a son, named [[Timothy Lincoln Beckwith]], and listed Robert as the father, which would make Timothy Abraham Lincoln's great-great-grandson and only living descendant. Robert denied paternity of the child, claimed he had undergone a [[vasectomy]] years earlier, and a divorce court ruled that Robert was not the father.|group=nb}} It is rumored that there may be additional living descendants, but scholars disagree as to the legitimacy of these claims. However, the Lincoln family does have other surviving relatives who share common ancestors with the former president. One example is [[Ben Miller]], who after doing research has found a genealogical link to the Lincolns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038xdzt |title=Ben Miller finds out an amazing fact, Series 10, Coming Home |first=Ben |last=Miller |publisher=BBC One |website=BBC |access-date=May 16, 2017 |date=November 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisa Marie Nowak''' (née '''Caputo''', born May 10, 1963) is an American former [[Naval Flight Officer|naval flight officer]] and [[NASA]] astronaut. Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], she was selected by NASA in 1996 and qualified as a [[mission specialist]] in [[robotics]]. Nowak flew aboard {{OV|103}} during the [[STS-121]] mission in July 2006, where she was responsible for operating the [[Canadarm|robotic arms]] of the shuttle and the [[International Space Station]].

On February 5, 2007, she was arrested in [[Orlando, Florida]], and subsequently charged with the attempted kidnapping of [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] Colleen Shipman, who was romantically involved with astronaut [[William Oefelein]]. Nowak was released on bail, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to the space agency as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a [[Plea bargain|plea deal]] with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery.

Nowak remained a Navy [[Captain (naval)|captain]] until August 2010, when a [[naval board of inquiry]], composed of three admirals, voted unanimously to [[Reduction in rank|reduce Nowak in rank]] to [[Commander (United States)|commander]] and to discharge her from the Navy under [[Military discharge#Other Than Honorable (OTH)|other than honorable conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/08/gan-nowak-discharged-082010/ |title=Navy to discharge ex-astronaut in stalking case |agency=[[Gannet]] |newspaper=[[Navy Times]] |date=August 20, 2010 |location=[[Jacksonville, Florida]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lisa Nowak is the daughter of Alfredo and Jane Caputo of [[Rockville, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

In 1969, as a six-year-old watching the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo]] [[moon landing]]s, Nowak first became interested in the [[space program]]. While growing up, she continued to follow the [[Space Shuttle program]], particularly the introduction of female astronauts.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

In 1981, Nowak graduated from [[Charles W. Woodward High School]] in Rockville, Maryland.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

In 1985, Nowak received her [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[aerospace engineering]] from the [[United States Naval Academy]].&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt; 

In 1992, Nowak earned both a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[aeronautical engineering]] and a degree in aeronautical and [[astronautical engineering]] from the U.S. [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]].&lt;ref name="NASAbio"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/nowak.html |title=Astronaut Bio: Lisa M.

==Military career==
In 1985, Nowak received her commission in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

In 1987, Nowak became a [[Naval Flight Officer]] via the Tactical Navigation syllabus at Training Squadron 86 ([[VT-86]]) at [[NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. Nowak was then assigned to Electronic Warfare Aggressor Squadron 34 ([[VAQ-34]]) at [[NAS Point Mugu]], [[California]], where she flew both the [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|EA-7L]] and [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|ERA-3B]] aircraft, supporting the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] in small and large-scale exercises with [[electronic warfare|jamming]] and missile profiles.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

In 1993, Nowak was selected for transfer to the [[Restricted Line Officer|Restricted Line]] as an Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, and to attend the [[United States Naval Test Pilot School|U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]] at [[NAS Patuxent River]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

After graduating from the Naval Postgraduate School, Nowak stayed at Patuxent River working as an aircraft systems project officer at the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility and at Strike Aircraft Test Squadron, flying in the [[F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]] and [[EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B]]. She was then assigned to the [[Naval Air Systems Command]], working on acquisition of new systems for naval aircraft, when she was selected for the astronaut program.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

Nowak logged over 1,500 hours of flight in over 30 different aircraft during her career in the Navy.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

While in the Navy, Nowak was awarded{{when|date=June 2018}} the [[Defense Meritorious Service Medal]], the [[Navy Commendation Medal]], the [[Navy Achievement Medal]], and other service awards.&lt;ref name="NASAbio" /&gt;

On 20 August 2010, after a review of the circumstances of the legal case, a panel of three U.S. Navy admirals recommended that she be discharged from the Navy and her rank reduced from Captain to Commander. Her service was classified as "other than honorable".&lt;ref name="miltimes2011"&gt;Staff (2011-07-28). "Navy OKs ex-astronaut Nowak's retirement". ''[[Military Times]]'', 28 July 2011.

==NASA career==
[[File:Lisa Nowak.jpg|thumb|Lisa Nowak during astronaut training in 2005.]]
Nowak was selected to be an astronaut in 1996 and entered the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] at [[Johnson Space Center]] in August of that year.&lt;ref name=NASAbio /&gt; She qualified as a mission specialist in robotics, and was assigned to a future mission designated [[STS-118]]. After schedule changes, she instead went into space on July 4, 2006, as a member of the [[STS-121]] crew assigned to the [[International Space Station]]. Nowak served as mission flight engineer, operated the Shuttle's robotic arm during several [[spacewalks]], and logged almost 13 days in space.&lt;ref name=NASAbio /&gt; For her work as a member of the crew of STS-118, Nowak was awarded the [[NASA Space Flight Medal]] at Johnson Space Center on June 5, 2007.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=22730 |title=2007 NASA Honor Awards Ceremony at JSC |date=May 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2009 |publisher=SpaceRef.com |author=NASA Johnson Space Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2007, following an arrest in Florida for attempted kidnapping, Nowak was placed on 30-day leave by NASA.&lt;ref name="status"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/mar/HQ_07026_Nowak_Status.html |title=Statement Regarding the Status of Lisa Nowak |publisher=NASA |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to [[Houston]], Texas, on a commercial airline flight the next day and upon arrival was reportedly taken immediately under police escort to the Johnson Space Center for medical and psychiatric evaluation. Nowak's assignment to NASA as a serving Navy officer was terminated by the space agency on March 7, 2007.&lt;ref name="status" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fired"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17502655/ |title=NASA fires astronaut Lisa Nowak |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=MSNBC |year=2007 |author=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Stone |first=Andrea |title=In Houston, concern for Nowak—and little affection for reporters |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-02-07-astronaut-houston_x.htm |publisher=USA Today |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After NASA==
Nowak remained on active duty with the Navy and was subsequently ordered to work on the staff of the chief of Naval Air Training at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], Texas. There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Doukopil |first=Tony |title=Lisa Nowak's Strange Spacewalk |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19695788/site/newsweek/ |publisher=Newsweek |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2007-07-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713230924/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19695788/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval officials waited for her kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/science/space/08astronaut.html?ex=1331010000&amp;en=bc9edf1400e47963&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=NASA Fires Arrested Astronaut |author=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times |date=2007-03-08 |accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military law experts have stated that, while the Navy rarely brings charges against officers for adultery, it is seen as [[Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman|conduct unbecoming an officer]], as it demonstrates bad judgment.&lt;ref name="email"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-06-astronaut-nowak_N.htm |title=E-mails offer clues to astronauts' triangle |accessdate=2008-01-21 |publisher=USA Today |author=Traci Watson |date=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, at the age of 54, Nowak was reported to be living in Texas and working in the "private sector". Her attorney stated: "She's doing well."&lt;ref name="people2017"&gt;Helling, Steve (2017-10-24). Astronaut Love Triangle: Lisa Nowak's Life 10 Years Later. Crime, People, 24 October 2017.

Immediately following William Oefelein's divorce, he and Lisa Nowak became involved with each other. Their affair lasted two years, with Oefelein beginning to break it off gradually near the end of 2006.

==Charges of attempted kidnapping at Orlando Airport==
Nowak drove from Houston to Orlando, Florida, on February 4&amp;ndash;5, 2007.  She packed latex gloves, a black wig, a [[BB gun|BB pistol]] and ammunition, [[pepper spray]], a hooded tan trench coat, a {{convert|2|lb|adj=on}} drilling hammer, black gloves, rubber tubing, plastic garbage bags, approximately {{US$|585|2007}} in cash, her computer, an {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]] folding knife and several other items before driving the {{convert|900|mi}} to Florida.

Shipman said that after arriving, she was aware of someone following her to an airport satellite parking area.&lt;ref name="tsgInitialReportP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/astronaut-nabbed-murder-plot?page=1 |title=Astronaut Nabbed in Murder Plot |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she got into her car, she heard running footsteps and quickly locked the door. Nowak slapped the window and tried to open the car door, asked for a ride, then started crying. Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several [[Orlando Police Department]] Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and [[destruction of evidence]].&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/orl-pdf-nowakaffidavit,0,1599643.acrobat?coll=orl-home-headlines |title=Second charging affidavit, Orlando Police |author=Orlando Police Department |format=PDF |publisher=Orlando Sentinel/Orlando Police |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Orlando Police Department forensic examination report |author=Orlando Police Department |publisher=Orlando Police/KHOU.com |url=http://www.khou.com/images/0704/nowak1.pdf |format=PDF |date=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/06/national/main2438514.shtml |title=Astronaut Nabbed In Bizarre Kidnap Plot |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |author=[[CBS]]/[[Associated Press]] |date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a handwritten request for a [[restraining order]] against Nowak after her arrest, Shipman referred to Nowak as an acquaintance of a boyfriend but did not identify Oefelein, and also claimed Nowak had been stalking her for two months.&lt;ref name="bond"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/06/astronaut.arrested/index.html |title=Astronaut granted bond on attempted murder charge |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=CNN |year=2007 |author=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak told investigators she was involved in a relationship with Oefelein which she described as being "more than a working relationship but less than a romantic relationship".

===Arraignment===
Two fellow astronauts traveled to Florida for Nowak's arraignment to assist authorities and NASA personnel as needed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Curtis |first=Henry Pierson |title=Astronaut's victim claims she was stalked |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-mastmain0707feb07,0,4924087.story |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=February 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031030225/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-mastmain0707feb07,0,4924087.story |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[Christopher Ferguson]], the senior active duty Naval Officer in the NASA Astronaut Corps at the time, went as Nowak's commanding officer, and retired Air Force Colonel [[Steven Lindsey]], who was the commander of Nowak's shuttle mission, STS-121, went as [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]], the senior astronaut at NASA. On February 6, 2007, both appeared before a judge on her behalf. The state's attorney argued that the facts indicated a well thought out plan to kidnap and perhaps to injure Shipman.&lt;ref name=NYT01 /&gt; While arguing for pre-trial release Nowak's attorney remarked, "One's good works must count for something". Nowak was ordered released on $15,500 bail under the condition she wear a [[GPS]] [[Electronic tagging|tracking device]] and not contact Shipman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=NASA Astronaut Lisa Nowak Charged With Attempted Kidnapping, Released on Bail |last=Associated Press |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,250415,00.html |work=FoxNews.com |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Nowak could be released, however, Orlando police charged Nowak with attempted first-degree murder and announced she would not be released on bail.

[[NASA Administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] commissioned the NASA Astronaut Health Care System Review Committee, an independent panel, to examine how well NASA attended to the mental health of its astronauts. The initial report released by the panel raised questions in regards to possible alcohol use prior to flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-07-26-astronauts-drinking_n.htm |title=Report uncovers allegations of astronauts drunk on flights |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=USA Today |author=Traci Watson |date=July 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, however, offered no specifics, no facts to substantiate the claims, and stated that no attempt to confirm or investigate the allegations had been performed.&lt;ref name="drink3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="drink1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/space/08/08/shuttle.commander/index.html |title=Shuttle commander: Alcohol report lacks facts |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=CNN |author=Miles O'Brien |date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clear"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/29/tech/main3215705.shtml |title=NASA Probe Likely To Clear Drinking Charge |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=CBS |author=CBS News/Associated Press |date=August 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuttle Commander [[Scott Kelly (astronaut)|Scott Kelly]] was vocal in his criticism of the report during interviews prior to STS-118, stating it was beyond his comprehension that astronauts would ever consider what was suggested.&lt;ref name="drink1" /&gt; Following the release of the independent panel report, NASA ordered an internal review, The Space Flight Safety Review.&lt;ref name="clear" /&gt;

On August 29, 2007, Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer [[Bryan O'Connor]] reported that after the month-long review, NASA found there was no evidence to verify the independent panel's report that astronauts have been allowed to fly drunk.&lt;ref name="drink3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-08-29-nasa-drinking-astronauts_N.htm |title=NASA: No evidence of drunk astronauts |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=USA Today |year=2007 |author=Traci Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drink2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/08/28/nasa.astronauts/index.html |title=NASA report: No evidence astronauts flew drunk |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=CNN |author=Miles O'Brien |date=August 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/astronautreport.html |title=Findings of NASA Safety Review Following Astronaut Health Reviews |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, investigation into all incident reports dating from 1984 to 2007, found no incident involving alcohol or drug use.&lt;ref name="report2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/188111main_Astronaut_Alcohol_Use_Report_final.pdf |title=Space Flight Safety Review (Alcohol Use In The Preflight Period) |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |publisher=NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance |year=2007 |author=Bryan O'Conner |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's findings specifically stated:

{{quote|The culture of professionalism in today's astronaut corps, along with the highly visible, structured and supervised schedule during the last several days prior to launch, provide reasonable controls to avoid flying an alcohol-impaired crewmember. In light of all the other controls in place on launch day, the L-0 flight surgeon check provides a reasonable likelihood of identifying signs of illness or impairment of the level that would threaten flight safety.&lt;ref name="report2" /&gt;}}

In response to the internal review, policies at NASA would be changed in a variety of ways: flight surgeons would be present during the pre-mission suit-up activities, flight surgeons would receive additional training in psychiatric evaluation, and although there was an unofficial code of conduct in place, an official "Code of Conduct" would be written up for employees.&lt;ref name="report2" /&gt;

===Evidence released before trial===
On April 10, 2007, Florida prosecutors released additional material in the case. The previous week, the trial judge had agreed to unseal some of the documents that described items found in Nowak's car after her arrest. Among these items were a handwritten note on {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} stationery listing Shipman's flight information and "Flight Controller's Log" paper with a handwritten list of more than 24 items, including sneakers, plastic gloves, contacts, cash, an umbrella, and black sweats. A [[floppy disk]] contained two photographs of Nowak riding in a bicycle race, and 15 images depicting an unidentified woman in different stages of undress. An evidence report dated March 15 indicated that nearly all of the photographs and drawings depicted scenes of bondage.&lt;ref name="bondage"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,265170,00.html |title=Police Discover Bondage Images in Car of Lovesick NASA Astronaut Lisa Nowak |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=Fox News |author=Fox News |date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found were $585.00 (USD) and £41.00 ([[British pound|GBP]]) in cash and 4 brown paper bags with 69 orange pills that were not publicly identified. Investigators also examined two [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] found in the car. They contained family pictures, digital movies, and NASA-related materials. Investigators concluded that the information on the disk and USB drives did not have any direct relationship to the alleged kidnapping attempt.&lt;ref name="Sun-Sentinel"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ellis |first=Jim |title=Nowak's Car Had Bondage Photos, Pills |work= |pages= |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oefelein reportedly provided Nowak with a cell phone to communicate with him. Phone records show that she called him at least 12 times, and sent 7 text messages the day after he returned from his shuttle flight on December 22 that he did not retrieve until December 24 when they had a 7-minute conversation. During December and January, over 100 calls were recorded, although it is unclear who called whom. Under questioning by NASA and military investigators, Oefelein reportedly stated that he had broken off the relationship with Nowak. He did, however, have her to lunch in his apartment at least once in January, they continued to train together for a bicycle race, and they also went to the gym together.&lt;ref name="abclocal.go.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sunseri |first=Gina |title=Ex-astronaut Lisa Nowak's lawyer considers insanity plea |work= |publisher=ABC13.com |date=May 11, 2007 |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=local&amp;id=5296676 |accessdate=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schneider |first=Mike |title=New Documents Paint Portrait of Fallen NASA Astronaut |work= |publisher=Space.com |date=May 2, 2007 |url=http://www.space.com/news/ap_070502_nowak_documents.html |accessdate=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2007, authorities released a surveillance video from the Orlando International Airport terminal purporting to show Nowak waiting for nearly an hour, standing near the baggage claim, then donning a trench coat and later following Shipman after she retrieved her bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |coauthors= |title=Ex-astronaut Lisa Nowak's lawyer considers insanity plea |work= |agency=Associated Press |date=May 11, 2007 |url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=local&amp;id=5297758 |accessdate=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments in case===
On February 13, 2007, Nowak pleaded not guilty to the charges of attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. On March 2, Florida prosecutors filed three formal charges against Nowak: (1) attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm or terrorize, (2) burglary of a conveyance with a weapon, and (3) battery.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/4598826.html |title=Astronaut won't face attempted murder |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |publisher=Houston Chronicle |year=2007 |author=Kim Cobb, Mark Carreau}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors declined to file the attempted murder charge that had been recommended by Orlando police. Nowak formally entered a plea of not guilty to the kidnapping charges on March 22 at an arraignment hearing although she was not present in person. Nowak's attorney, who filed the plea with the Orange County court, requested a jury trial. The trial was originally due to commence on July 30, 2007, but was postponed until April 7, 2008, to allow the prosecution time to prepare for an anticipated [[insanity defense]]. On January 16, 2008, a judge postponed the trial, as well as the pre-trial hearing to be held on March 12, 2008, indefinitely, pending the outcome of the state's appeal of an earlier decision to suppress evidence obtained on the day of her arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Kimberley C. |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070217/NEWS02/702170336/1007 |title=Judge Sets Nowak's Trial Date |publisher=Central Florida News 13 |date=February 18, 2007 |accessdate=February 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315032420/http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070217%2FNEWS02%2F702170336%2F1007 |archivedate=March 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indefpostpone&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lundy |first=Sarah |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/volusia/orl-nowak1708jan17,0,7794393.story |title=Appeal freezes trial for ex-astronaut Lisa Nowak |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2008, the [[Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal]] held that her statements were taken in violation of her ''Miranda'' rights, but that the search of her car was still valid under the inevitable discovery exception to the search warrant requirement because the police would have inevitably found it in the normal course of the investigation despite her illegal statement. The case was sent back for trial. A pre-trial status hearing was scheduled for June 22, 2009. On April 1, 2009, the judge ordered Nowak to undergo two psychiatric evaluations before June 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.5dca.org/Opinions/Opin2008/120108/5D07-3833.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the district court of appeal of the state of Florida, fifth district |date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20090302/BREAKINGNEWS/90302013/1006/NEWS01 |title=Court schedules hearing in Nowak case |accessdate=March 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721111651/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20090302/BREAKINGNEWS/90302013/1006/NEWS01 |archivedate=July 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2009, it was reported that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case.&lt;ref name="navytimes1" /&gt; On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for it. If it was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial began. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hauser |first=Christine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/us/06cnd-astronaut.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=e460bff9d1a01979&amp;ex=1328418000&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Astronaut Charged with Attempted Kidnapping |publisher=New York Times |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="click2houston.com"&gt;[http://www.click2houston.com/news/21570150/detail.html Ex-Astronaut Nowak Pleads Guilty – Houston News Story – KPRC Houston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112021659/http://www.click2houston.com/news/21570150/detail.html |date=November 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,573623,00.html?test=latestnews |work=Fox News |title=Ex-Astronaut Lisa Nowak Pleads Guilty to Burglary, Battery but Gets Light Sentence |date=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gWQm10mFUVswAuT1qGmomy6HLkDAD9BSRAUO0 |accessdate=November 10, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Navy mulls punishment"&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/02/01/Navy-mulls-punishment-for-ex-astronaut/UPI-76311265039417/ Navy mulls punishment for ex-astronaut – UPI.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2010, a Naval administrative panel of three admirals voted to recommend Nowak be separated from the U.S. Navy with an "other than honorable" discharge and that her rank be reduced from Captain to Commander.&lt;ref name="careerover" /&gt; The panel's recommendation would be reviewed by the [[Bureau of Naval Personnel|Naval Personnel Command]] and would ultimately be determined by the [[Secretary of the Navy]].&lt;ref name="careerover"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ex-Astronaut Lisa Nowak May be Dishonorably Discharged from Navy |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20014259-504083.html |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |work=CBS News |date=August 20, 2010 |first=Caroline |last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Nowak petitioned the court to seal the record of her criminal proceedings, citing harm to her family and their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/rss/article/196697/3/New-Former-Astronaut-Lisa-Nowak-wants-Record-Sealed |title=Former Astronaut Lisa Nowak wants Record Sealed |newspaper=First Coast News |date=March 17, 2011 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |accessdate=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904134454/http://www.firstcoastnews.com/rss/article/196697/3/New-Former-Astronaut-Lisa-Nowak-wants-Record-Sealed |archivedate=September 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Lisa Nowak: Records sealed in NASA astronaut's love-triangle arrest|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-01-18/news/os-lisa-nowak-love-triangle-sealed-20120118_1_lisa-nowak-shipman-with-pepper-spray-shipman-and-oefelein|publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''|date=January 18, 2012}}. Retrieved April 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 28, 2011, [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)|Assistant Secretary of Navy]] [[Juan M.

{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Nowak's love triangle crimes were the subject of an episode of the US TV news series ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' entitled "Over the Line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20/20 - Over the Line|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/2020-on-id-2012/episode-9-season-2/over-the-line/326793/|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional episode "Rocket Man" of the police procedural ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' was also loosely based on Nowak's story. In the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episode "[[The Fighting Irish]]", [[Liz Lemon]] makes a joke about traveling from Houston to Orlando in under 9 hours.

In the movie ''[[Rough Night]]'', the male protagonist Peter is recommended by his friends to enact the "Sad Astronaut", clearly referencing Nowak's road journey from Houston to Florida. A specific element of Nowak's journey (wearing of the adult diapers, which Nowak has since denied), is a plot point utilized in the movie, that has been cited as one of the film's most defining moments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=20/20 - Rough Night's Best Gag is the Sad Astronaut|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/06/rough-nights-best-gag-is-a-tribute-to-the-diaper-astronaut.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The song "Road Trip" by [[Molly Lewis]] is about Nowak's trip to Orlando and is  sung from the inferred perspective of Nowak. Spanish punk pop band [[:es:Airbag (banda española)|Airbag]] wrote a song about Nowak's road trip, "Usted morirá en el espacio" ("You will die in space"), included in their fifth studio album ''Alto Disco'' (Wild Punk Records, 2008). Nowak is also referenced in the [[Ben Folds]] song "Cologne" and the [[Common (rapper)|Common]] song "[[Drivin' Me Wild]]" ("drivin' herself crazy / like the astronaut lady"). In 2017, [[Katie Stelmanis]] portrayed Nowak in the music video for the [[Austra]] single "I Love You More Than You Love Yourself".

That year, Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] lobbied to move the ceremony to [[New York City]], but San Francisco Mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] convinced the organization to remain in San Francisco by promising city support.

'''Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre, Duchess of Orléans''' (13 March 1753 &amp;ndash; 23 June 1821), was the daughter of [[Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthièvre]] and of [[Maria Teresa Felicitas d'Este|Princess Maria Theresa Felicitas]] of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]]. At the death of her brother, [[Louis Alexandre, Prince of Lamballe|Louis Alexandre de Bourbon-Penthièvre, ''prince de Lamballe'']], she became the wealthiest [[heir]]ess in France prior to the [[French Revolution]]. She married [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], the "regicide" ''Philippe Égalité'', and was the mother of France's last king, [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe I, King of the French]]. She was sister-in-law to ''[[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|the princesse de Lamballe]]'', and was the last member of the ''[[Bourbon-Penthièvre]]'' family.

==Biography==
Marie-Adélaïde was born on 13 March 1753 at the [[Hôtel de Toulouse]], the family residence in Paris since 1712, when her grandfather, [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse]], bought it from [[Louis Phélypeaux (1672-1725)|Louis Phélypeaux de La Vrillière]]. Her mother died in childbirth the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Lenotre, G., ''Le Château de Rambouillet: six siècles d'histoire'', Denoël, Paris, 1984, chapter 5: ''Le prince des pauvres'', p. 71.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Style (manner of address)|Style]]d ''Mademoiselle d'Ivoy''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0q4FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA233&amp;lpg=RA1-PA233&amp;dq=Ivoy-Carignan&amp;source=web&amp;ots=MTOhNUrhiE&amp;sig=004PFu90FObaquloHJiGbZXgKsw&amp;hl=fr from seigneurie d'Ivoy-Carignan], books.google.com; accessed 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; initially and, as a young girl, until her marriage, ''Mademoiselle de Penthièvre'' (derived from the duchy inherited by her father). The style of ''Mademoiselle de Penthièvre'' had been previously borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon (1751–1753), who died six months after Marie-Adélaïde's birth.

==Education==
At birth, she was put in the care of ''Madame de Sourcy'' and, as was the custom for many girls of the nobility, she was later raised at the [[Abbaye de Montmartre]] convent, overlooking [[Paris]],&lt;ref name="castelot"&gt;Castelot, André, ''Philippe Égalité le Régicide'', éd. Jean Picollec, Paris, 1991, pp. 22-35, 73–80, 86–87, 95, 124, 206–210,   213, 271-274&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histoire-en-ligne.com/spip.php?article452&amp;artsuite=1 Le quartier Montmartre], L'Histoire en Ligne (in French); accessed 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where she spent twelve years. As a child, she was encouraged to take an active part in the [[Charity (practice)|charities]] for which her father had become known as "Prince of the Poor".&lt;ref&gt;Lenotre, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation for [[Wiktionary:beneficence|beneficence]] made him popular throughout France and, subsequently, saved him during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Lenotre, chapter 8, ''L'ouragan'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Upon the death, on 8 May 1768, of her brother and only sibling, the Prince de Lamballe, Marie-Adélaïde became heiress to what was to become the largest fortune of France.&lt;ref&gt;In 1775, the Duc de Penthièvre was to inherit the fortune and estates of his cousin, the Comte d'Eu, son of the Duc du Maine, making him the richest man in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her marriage to Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orléans, [[Duke of Chartres]], son of the [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]], had been envisaged earlier and, while the Duke of Penthièvre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry the First Prince of the Blood Royal, the Orléanses did not want [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|another]] union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family. However, when the Prince de Lamballe's death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune, the [[bar sinister]] on her [[inescutcheon]] was "overlooked". Although Marie-Adélaîde was much in love with her Orléans cousin, Louis XV warned Penthièvre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a [[libertine]]. Louis XV was also fearful of the powerful leverage given the Orléans branch should it inherit the Penthièvre fortune.&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''You are wrong, my cousin, said Louis XV to Penthièvre, the Duke of Chartres has a bad temper, bad habits: he is a libertine, your daughter will not be happy. Do not rush, wait!''&lt;ref&gt;''Vous avez tort, mon cousin, lui dit-il, le duc de Chartres a un mauvais caractère, de mauvaises habitudes; c'est un libertin, votre fille ne sera pas heureuse. Ne vous pressez pas, attendez!'', Castelot, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Mademoiselle de Penthièvre'' was presented to the King on 7 December 1768, in a ceremony called ''de nubilité'',&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nubile]]&lt;/ref&gt; by her maternal aunt, [[Maria Fortunata d'Este]], Comtesse de la Marche. She was greeted by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], the [[Louis XVI of France|Dauphin]] and other members of the [[Fils de France|royal family]]. On that day, she was baptised by Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon, [[Grand Almoner of France]], and given the names ''Louise Marie Adélaïde''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2oEBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=SAS+madame+la+duchesse+d'Orl%C3%A9ans&amp;source=web&amp;ots=daOmOckb35&amp;sig=jto7BmTs1ufUm8w9KozaChODb64&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA52,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the [[Palace of Versailles]] on 5 April 1769 in a ceremony which all of the ''[[Prince du Sang|princes du sang]]'' attended. The marriage contract was signed by all members of the royal family. Afterwards, Louis XV hosted a wedding supper which included the entire royal family. ''Mlle de Penthièvre'' brought to the already wealthy [[House of Orléans]] a [[dowry]] of six million ''[[French livres|livres]]'', an annual income of 240,000 livres (later increased to 400,000), and the expectation of much more upon her father's death. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===The ''Comtesse de Genlis''===

During the first few months of their marriage, the couple appeared devoted to each other, but the duke went back to the life of ''libertinage'' he had led before his marriage.

In the summer of 1772, a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter, Philippe's secret liaison began with one of her ladies-in-waiting, [[Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, Comtesse de Genlis]], the niece of [[Charlotte-Jeanne Béraud de la Haye de Riou, Marquise de Montesson|Madame de Montesson]], the [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife of Philippe's father. Passionate at first, the liaison cooled within a few months and, by the spring of 1773, was reported to be "dead".&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt; After the romantic affair was over, Félicité remained in the service of Marie-Adélaïde at the [[Palais-Royal]], a trusted friend to both Marie-Adélaïde and Philippe. They both appreciated her intelligence and, in July 1779, she became the governess of the couple's twin daughters born in 1777.&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt;

In 1782, the young Louis Philippe was nine and in need of discipline. However, the Duke of Chartres could not think of someone better qualified to "turn his sons over to" than Mme de Genlis. Thus she became the "''gouverneur''" of the Duc and Duchesse de Chartres' children. Teacher and pupils left the Palais-Royal and went to live in a house built specially for them on the grounds of the Couvent des Dames de Bellechasse in Paris. Mme de Genlis was an excellent teacher, but like those of her former lover, the Duc de Chartres, her liberal political views made her unpopular with [[Marie Antoinette|Queen Marie Antoinette]]. In the dissemination of her ideas, de Genlis managed to alienate her charges from their mother. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Marie-Adélaïde began to object to the education given her children by her former lady-in-waiting. The relationship between the two women became unbearable when Louis-Philippe, on 2 November 1790, one month after his seventeenth birthday, joined the revolutionary [[Jacobin Club]]. Marie-Adélaïde's relationship with her husband was also at its worst at this point, and the only way the two would communicate was through letters.&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt; In the memoirs of the Baronne d'Oberkirch, Marie-Adélaïde is described as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...always wearing a melancholic expression which nothing could cure. She sometimes smiled, she never laughed....''&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of Baronne d'Oberkirch'' (Paris, 1869, II, 67–68)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon the death of her father-in-law [[Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Louis Philippe d'Orléans]] in November 1785, her husband became the new Duke of Orléans, and [[Prince du Sang|First Prince of the Blood]], taking [[Nobility|rank]] only after the immediate family of the king. As the wife of a ''[[Prince du Sang|prince du sang]]'' she was entitled to be addressed as ''Your [[Serene Highness]]'', a style to which her own [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] branch of the Bourbons had no right.

==Revolution==
On 5 April 1791, Marie-Adélaïde left her husband,&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt; and went to live with her father at the ''château de Bizy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://giverny.org/castles/chateaux.htm Giverny Vernon Chateau]; accessed 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; overlooking [[Vernon, Eure]] in [[Normandy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://giverny.org/vernon Vernon, France website]; accessed 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1792, having sided with the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], the Duke of Orléans was elected to the [[National Convention]] under the name of ''Philippe Égalité''. Siding with the radical group called [[The Mountain|La Montagne]], he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the [[Girondists]], who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France. The fate of the Orléans family was sealed when Marie-Adélaïde's eldest son, the duc de Chartres, "Général Égalité" in the Army of the North commanded by [[Charles François Dumouriez]], sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793. On 6 April, all the members of the Orléans family still remaining in France were arrested. After their arrest in Paris, Philippe Égalité and his son, the comte de Beaujolais, were imprisoned in the prison de l'Abbaye in Paris.&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt;

Later, the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint-Jean in [[Marseille]], where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps. The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France, the duc de Chartres rushed to [[Tournai]], near the French border,&lt;ref&gt;Tournai, within the Netherlands, which had become Austrian territory at the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, was occupied by French troops since 1792.&lt;/ref&gt; where his sister Adélaïde and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe Égalité had made them emigrate in November 1792. The duc de Chartres accompanied them to safety in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="castelot"/&gt;

In the meantime, due to her poor health, Marie-Adélaïde was allowed to stay in France, under guard, at the château de Bizy, where her father had died a month earlier. Her inheritance, however, was [[confiscation|confiscated]] by the revolutionary government.
Despite having voted for the death of his cousin [[Louis XVI of France]], and having [[Denunciation|denounced]] his son's [[defection]], Philippe Égalité was [[guillotine]]d on 6 November 1793. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Widow Égalité==
[[Image:Palais Luxembourg Sunset Edit.JPG|thumb|right|260px|The [[Luxembourg Palace|Palais du Luxembourg]] where Marie-Adélaïde was imprisoned from November 1793 to July 1794.]]
Upon the execution of her husband, Marie-Adélaïde, now known as the "Veuve Égalité" ("Widow Égalité"), was incarcerated at the [[Luxembourg Palace]], which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution. There she met the man who was to become the "love of her life", a former member of the [[National Convention]] named [[Jacques-Marie Rouzet]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5yEIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271&amp;dq=coll%C3%A8ge+de+l'Esquille+Toulouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DiVN4VNCPi&amp;sig=7IcUhTPOMB6Ro-CNtCajfe0TS48&amp;hl=fr#PPA338,M1 Étienne Léon de La Mothe-Langon, Jean Théodore Laurent-Gousse, ''Biographie toulousaine, ou Dictionnaire historique des personnages qui, par des vertus, des talens, des écrits, de grandes actions, des fondations utiles, des opinions singulières, des erreurs, etc. se sont rendus célèbres dans la ville de Toulouse, ou qui ont contribué à son illustration'', Paris, Chez L. G. Michaud, 1823, tome 2, pp. 338–343]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been imprisoned at the fall of the ''Girondins''. Nearly executed before the fall of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]], in July 1794 at the end of the [[Reign of Terror]], she was transferred to the "[[Pension Belhomme]]", a former mental institution turned into a "prison for the rich" during the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dufresne, Claude, ''Les Orléans'', Criterion, Paris, 1991, p. 314.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rouzet, who after his liberation had become a member of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], succeeded, in 1796, to secure her liberation and that of her two sons still imprisoned in Marseille,&lt;ref&gt;Upon their liberation, Montpensier and Beaujolais joined their brother Chartres in the United States until sailing for England, where they landed in January 1800 (Dufresne, pp. 325–326)&lt;/ref&gt; the two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797, when a decree banished the remaining members of the [[House of Bourbon]] from France. Marie-Adélaïde was exiled to Spain, as was her sister-in-law [[Bathilde d'Orléans]], the last ''[[Princes of Condé|princesse de Condé]]''. Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor, and she obtained for him the title of ''comte de Folmont''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Étienne Léon de La Mothe-Langon, Jean Théodore Laurent-Gousse&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie-Adélaïde was never to see her two younger sons again, Montpensier and Beaujolais, who died in exile before the 1814 [[Bourbon Restoration]]. She, Rouzet and the Orléans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first [[Bourbon Restoration]]. After legal battles which lasted until her death, the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered. She died in her castle at Ivry-sur-Seine&lt;ref&gt;Ivry-sur-Seine, a former village a little over 5 km south of the center of Paris, which is now a suburb of the French capital.&lt;/ref&gt; on 23 June 1821, after battling  [[breast cancer]]. Rouzet had died nine months before, on 25 October 1820, and she had him [[burial|inhumed]] in the new family chapel she had built in Dreux in 1816, as the final resting place for the two families, Bourbon-Penthièvre and Orléans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Robert, Gaston Cougny, ''Dictionnaire des parlementaires français de 1789 à 1889'', Paris, Bourloton, 1889, tome 5, [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/1789-1889/Tome_5/ROUSSIN_ROYER.pdf de Roussin à Royer], pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; The original Bourbon-Penthièvre family crypt in the [[Dreux|Collégiale de Saint-Étienne de Dreux]] had been violated during the Revolution and the bodies thrown together into a grave in the Chanoines Cemetery of the Collégiale. She was buried in the new chapel which, after the accession to the throne of her son Louis Philippe, was enlarged, embellished and renamed ''[[Chapelle royale de Dreux]]'', becoming the [[necropolis]] for the now royal Orléans family. Marie Adélaïde did not live to see her son Louis Philippe become ''King of the French'' in 1830.

==The painting==
On the eve of the [[French Revolution]], in 1789, she was painted by [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun]], the favourite portrait painter of Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. The painting was titled ''Madame la Duchesse d'Orléans''. Vigée-Le Brun made use of the lonely duchess' [[melancholia]] in the pose. Dressed in white, a reminder of her candor, the head of the duchess is supported on her upraised arm. She is shown with a languid, sad expression. Below the breast is a [[Wedgwood]] medallion which [[Colin Eisler]] has identified as ''Poor Maria'', possibly a reference to the life of the duchess, which was later destroyed because of the Revolution. The painting is now at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. There is another copy in the ''musée de Longchamp'', [[Marseille]]. Versailles has a third copy which has been incorrectly described as a [[replica]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

'''Dame Madge Kendal''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}}&lt;!-- leave DBE; do not add GBE; see talk page --&gt; (born '''Margaret Shafto Robertson'''; 15 March 1848 – 14 September 1935) was an English actress of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] eras, best known for her roles in [[Shakespeare]] and English comedies. Together with her husband, [[William Hunter Kendal|W. H. Kendal]], she became an important theatre manager.

==Early years==
Kendal was born in [[Cleethorpes]], reportedly the youngest of 22 children of Margharetta Elisabetta Robertson (née Marinus; died 1876), a native of [[Denmark]], and her English husband, William Robertson (died 1872), who joined his wife's family of actors and became their manager in 1830. One of Kendal's brothers was [[Thomas William Robertson|T.W. Robertson]], a dramatist who led the movement toward naturalistic acting and design in theatre.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb&gt;Foulkes, Richard. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34274 "Kendal, Dame Madge (1848–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 27 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One of her sisters, Fanny Robertson, was also an actress.&lt;ref name=Stagebeauty&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/kendal/kendal-m2.html Profile of Madge Kendal], stagebeauty.net, accessed 22 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Kendal was [[home-schooled]] by a governess and her father, who read Shakespeare to her from an early age.&lt;ref name=foot&gt;Mrs. Alec-Tweedie (1904) ''Behind the Footlights'', Dodd Mead and Co., New York&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1854, Kendal had her first speaking role as Marie in the drama ''The Struggle for Gold'' by [[Edward Stirling]] under her father's management.  She next appeared with her family as a blind girl, Jeannie, in the stage adaptation of ''The Seven Poor Travellers'' by [[Charles Dickens]]. Her family was engaged by in [[Bristol]] the next year, where Kendal played in an adaptation of ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' as Eva. Although she sang well as a child, she contracted [[diphtheria]], and her voice suffered after the removal of her tonsils. Nevertheless, she played a singing role in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', with songs by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], at the Bath Theatre in 1863, starring sisters [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]] and [[Kate Terry]] as [[Titania]] and [[Oberon]], respectively. Throughout this period, she performed with her family in Bristol and [[Bath, England|Bath]].&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

In 1865, Kendal was playing adult roles in London, beginning with [[Ophelia]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Blanche in ''King John'' and [[Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London.  She was Mary Meredith in ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' with [[Edward Askew Sothern|Sothern]], and Pauline to his Claud Melnotte. But her most notable early successes were at the Haymarket in Shakespearian revivals and the old English comedies. At the Haymarket, she starred with and met her future husband, [[William Hunter Kendal|W. H. Kendal]], whom she married in 1869. Kendal played Rosalind, Lady Teazle, Lydia Languish and Kate Hardcastle, while her husband played [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]], Charles Surface, Jack Absolute and Young Marlowe. The two thereafter acted mostly together. She then toured the provinces, joining the playwright and theatre manager [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]]&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6fU_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA43 p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt; and the actor [[Samuel Phelps]] in 1866 at the Theatre Royal, Hull.  She substituted in the role of [[Lady Macbeth]], for an actress who was ill, opposite Phelps, who engaged her to appear as Lady Teazle at the Standard Theatre, [[Shoreditch]], opposite his Sir Peter in ''[[The School for Scandal]]''. During the following years, her reputation grew during engagements with F. B. Chatterton at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], [[E. A. Sothern]] at the Haymarket, and [[John Hollingshead]] at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], London, as well as provincial appearances.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

==Peak years==
[[Image:Pygmalion and Galatea.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The Kendals in ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', 1872]]
In 1868, Kendal joined the company of [[J. B. Buckstone]] on tour and then at the Haymarket, continuing with this troupe until 1874.  She married William Hunter Grimston, an actor in the company who appeared under the name [[W. H. Kendal]], on 7 August 1869, and adopted his stage name. With Buckstone's company, Madge Kendal enjoyed a string of successes, usually opposite her husband, playing as Lilian Vavasour in ''New Men and Old Acres'' by [[Tom Taylor]] (1869), Lydia Languish in ''[[The Rivals]]'' (1870), Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1871),&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt; and a series of "fairy comedies" by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including Princess Zeolide in ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), Galatea in ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1871), Selene in ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873) and the Lady Hilda in ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), and Mrs Van Brugh in his drama ''[[Charity (play)|Charity]]'' (1874).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, passim&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Kendal played at the [[Opera Comique]] and the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], which they managed for a time before joining the company of the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]].  There, she played Dora in ''Diplomacy'' by [[B. C. Stephenson]] and [[Clement Scott]] (1878, adapted from [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Dora''), among other roles.  Between 1879 and 1888, Kendal and her husband managed the [[St. James's Theatre]] with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] and presented a large number of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] plays, among many others.  Mrs. Kendal played Lady Giovanna in ''The Falcon'' by [[Tennyson]] (1879), Susan in ''William and Susan'', Kate Verity in ''The Squire'' by Pinero (1881), repeated her Rosalind in ''As You Like It'' (1885).  The Kendals restored the St. James's to popularity and helped to improve the respectability of the Victorian theatre, which had fallen into disrepute among the middle classes.  They imposed a high moral code both on stage and behind the scenes.&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

[[File:Falstaff and the Wives.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration for 1902 revival, featuring [[Ellen Terry]] as Mistress Page, Kendal as Mistress Ford, and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Falstaff]]
Some of the Kendals' other notable successes in the 1880s included ''The Squire'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], ''Impulse'' by [[B. C. Stephenson]], ''The Ironmaster'', an English version by Pinero of ''Le Maitre des Forges'' by [[Georges Ohnet]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0711FD3F5E1A738DDDA10994D8415B8984F0D3 "Amusements – 'The Ironmaster{{'"}}], ''The New York Times'', 18 October 1889&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Scrap of Paper'' by [[John Palgrave Simpson]], an adaptation of ''Les Pattes de mouche'' by Sardou. In 1888, the Hare and Kendal partnership ended. [[George Bernard Shaw]] wrote of her 1886 performance in ''The Greatest of These'' by [[Sydney Grundy]] at the [[Garrick Theatre]], "her finish of execution, her individuality and charm of style, her appetisingly witty conception of her effects, her mastery of her art and of herself … are all there, making her still supreme among English actresses in high comedy."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, George Bernard. ''The Saturday Review'', 10 June 1886&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Kendal learned of the case of [[Joseph Merrick]], referred to as the Elephant Man. Although she probably never met him in person, she helped to raise funds and public sympathy for him. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft, and she arranged for him to see a Christmas [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell, pp. 109–112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
The Kendals made their American debut in ''A Scrap of Paper'' in 1889, and the success of their first tour in the United States was repeated in several successive American seasons, where they spent most of the next five years. In 1902, she appeared as Mistress Ford opposite the Mistress Page of her childhood friend [[Ellen Terry]] in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company. The Kendals continued to appear in popular plays without interruption until 1908, when they both retired, though Mrs Kendal reprised her Mistress Ford at the coronation gala of 1911 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]].&lt;ref name=MKendaldnb/&gt;

The Kendals had five children, but they reportedly were estranged from them. Her husband died in 1917. In retirement, Madge Kendal became active with many theatre charities, becoming president of the actors' retirement home, [[Denville Hall]]. She was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) in 1926.

Kendal died at her home in [[Chorleywood]], Hertfordshire, in 1935, aged 87, after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 16 September 1935&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at [[East Finchley Cemetery|St Marylebone cemetery]] in [[East Finchley]].

==In fiction==
Kendal is a featured character in the 1979 play ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-elephant-man-3938 ''The Elephant Man''], Internet Broadway Database, accessed 14 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the unrelated 1980 [[The Elephant Man (film)|film of the same name]], both based on the life of [[Joseph Merrick]]. In the film, Kendal was portrayed by [[Anne Bancroft]].

On January 3, 1967, Kerry began a ten-week Officer [[Damage Control]] Course at the Naval Schools Command on [[Treasure Island, California|Treasure Island]], California. On March 22, 1967, he reported to the U.S. Fleet Anti-Air Warfare Training Center for training as a Combat Information Center Watch Officer.

==Tour of duty on the USS ''Gridley''==
Kerry's first tour of duty was as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] on the [[guided missile]] [[frigate]] [[USS Gridley (DLG-21)|USS ''Gridley'']], beginning June 8, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/kerry/cron.html|title=John F. Kerry - Chronology - The Choice 2004 - FRONTLINE - PBS|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 1968, the ''Gridley'' set sail for a Western Pacific deployment. The next day, Kerry requested duty in [[Vietnam]], listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a [[Fast Patrol Craft]] (PCF), also known as a "Swift boat." These 50-foot boats have [[aluminum]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s and have little or no armor, but are heavily armed and rely on speed.  "I didn't really want to get involved in the war," Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. "When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061603.shtml|title=Boston Globe Online - John Kerry: A Candidate in the Making|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Kerry's second choice of billet was in a river patrol boat, or [[Patrol boat, rigid|PBR]], squadron, which at the time was performing the more dangerous river duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-15 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65109EQir?url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/rqstswiftboat.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gridley'' traveled to several places, including [[Wellington]] in [[New Zealand]], [[Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]], and the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] off North Vietnam. The executive officer of the ''Gridley'' has described the deployment: "We deployed from San Diego to the Vietnam theatre in early 1968 after only a six-month turnaround and spent most of a four month deployment on rescue station in the Gulf of Tonkin, standing by to pick up downed aviators. It was a fairly grueling tour of duty. Our helicopter was shot up trying to rescue a downed pilot and the door gunner was killed. The crew performed well and John Kerry's performance in all aspects of his duty was outstanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.nycap.rr.com/pwcarter/the%20kerry%20page.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820132350/http://home.nycap.rr.com/pwcarter/the%20kerry%20page.html |archivedate=2004-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship departed for the U.S. on May 27, 1968, and returned to port at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]] on June 6. Ten days after returning, on June 16, Kerry was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant, junior grade]]. On June 20, he left the ''Gridley'' for special Swift boat training at the Naval Amphibious Base in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]].

==Commander of a Swift boat==
On November 17, 1968, Kerry reported for duty at Coastal Squadron 1 in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] in [[South Vietnam]]. Kerry took part in [[Operation Sealords|Operation Sea Lords]], the brainchild of [[Admiral]] [[Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.|Elmo Zumwalt]]. The goal was to project a U.S. military presence more aggressively into an area that had long been a [[Viet Cong]] stronghold.  As part of that plan, the Swift boats were assigned to patrol the narrow waterways &amp;mdash; inlets, canals, and coves &amp;mdash; of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]] [[River delta|delta]], to monitor enemy movements, interdict enemy river-based supply lines, invite attack and otherwise draw out hostile forces.

During his tour of duty as an Officer in Charge of Swift boats, Kerry led five-man crews on patrols into enemy-controlled areas.  His first command was Swift boat PCF-44, from December 6, 1968, to January 21, 1969, when the crew was disbanded. They were based at Coastal Division 13 at [[Cat Lo Naval Base|Cat Lo]] from December 13 to January 6. Otherwise, they were stationed at Coastal Division 11 at An Thoi. On January 30, Kerry took charge of PCF-94 and its crew, which he led until he departed An Thoi on March 26 and the crew was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/index.html#vietnam_service|title=John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|work=kerryvietnam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Purple Heart===
During the night of December 2, 1968, and early morning of December 3, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating in and around a peninsula north of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). Kerry's boat surprised a group of men unloading [[sampan]]s at a river crossing, who began to run. When the men refused to obey an order to stop running, Kerry and his crew of two enlisted men opened fire, destroyed the sampans, and took off. During this encounter, Kerry suffered a wound from a small piece of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] in the left arm above the elbow.

Dr. Louis Letson, a member of the anti-Kerry group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), claimed to have treated Kerry for this wound, but the sick bay report is signed by medical corpsman J.C. Carreon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040830-686045,00.html|title=Kerry In Combat: Setting The Record Straight|date=23 August 2004|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Letson's account and the sick bay report, shrapnel was removed and the wounded area was treated with [[bacitracin]] antibiotic and bandaged. Kerry returned to duty the next day on a regular Swift boat patrol. Kerry was later awarded his first [[Purple Heart]] for this injury.

Kerry's opponents, including the SBVT, have contended that this wound was too minor to merit a Purple Heart.  However,  guidelines for a Purple Heart do not distinguish between degrees of injury;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmcvta.org/pheart/phcriteria.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905184244/http://www.usmcvta.org/pheart/phcriteria.htm |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, a 2004 review by the Navy inspector general concluded that Kerry's awards, including his first Purple Heart, were properly approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-09-17-kerry-navy-awards_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Navy says Kerry's service awards were properly approved|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with Zumwalt and Abrams===
At the time, the U.S. military command in Vietnam had an established policy of "[[free-fire zone]]s": areas in which soldiers were to shoot anyone moving around after curfew, without first making sure that they were hostile. Such encounters could result in the deaths of innocent civilians.  Kerry has stated that he never thought he or his crew were at fault: "There wasn't anybody in that area that didn't know you don't move at night, that you don't go out in a [[sampan]] on the rivers, and there's a curfew."  Nevertheless, he soon concluded that the policy should be changed.

On January 22, 1969, Kerry and several other officers had an unusual meeting in [[Saigon]] with [[Admiral]] [[Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.|Elmo Zumwalt]], the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Vietnam, and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General]] [[Creighton Abrams]], the overall commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam.  Kerry and the other officers reported that the "free-fire" policy was alienating the Vietnamese and that the Swift boats' actions were not accomplishing their ostensible goal of interdicting Viet Cong supply lines. According to some who retell the story, Kerry and the other visiting officers' concerns were dismissed with what amounted to a pep talk.  One of the other officers who participated later recalled, "We all looked at each other and thought, 'What is this crap?'" Kerry later said that the Saigon meeting left him "more depressed than when I came."

===Second Purple Heart===
Kerry received his second Purple Heart for action on the Bo De river on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters.  On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked.  They returned to their base to refuel and were unable to return to the mission for several hours.  Kerry recorded the situation in his notebook: "We therefore had a choice: to wait for what was not a confirmed return by the helos [and] give any [[sniper]]s more time to set up an ambush for our exit or we could take a chance and exit immediately without any cover.  We chose the latter."

As the Swift boats reached the Cua Lon river, Kerry's boat was hit by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] round, and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg.  Thereafter, they had no more trouble, and reached the [[Gulf of Thailand]] safely.  Kerry still has [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] in his left thigh because the doctors tending to him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with [[surgical suture|suture]]s rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.  Kerry received his second Purple Heart for this injury, but he did not take any time off from duty.

===Silver Star===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Kerry with crew3.jpg|right|thumb|248px|Kerry with his crew after the medal ceremony, March 6, 1969. Top, from left: Del Sandusky, John Kerry, Gene Thorson, Thomas Belodeau. Bottom, from left: Mike Medeiros and Fred Short.]] --&gt;

Only eight days later, on February 28, came the incident for which Kerry was awarded the [[Silver Star]].  On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two others.  Their mission included bringing a demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese soldiers to destroy enemy [[sampan]]s, structures and bunkers.  Along the Bay Hap river, they ran into an ambush.  Kerry directed the boats "to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions" and he "expertly directed" his boat's fire and coordinated the deployment of the South Vietnamese troops, according to Admiral [[Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.|Zumwalt]]'s original [[Wikisource:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry|medal citation]].

After the South Vietnamese troops and a team of three U.S. Army advisors that were with them had disembarked at the ambush site, Kerry's boat and another headed up river to look for the fleeing enemy. The two boats came under fire from a Viet Cong [[RPG-2|B-40]] [[rocket-propelled grenade]], shattering the crew cabin windows of PCF-94.  Kerry ordered the boats to turn and charge the second ambush site. As they reached the shore, a Viet Cong soldier jumped out of the brush, carrying a loaded B-40 launcher. With the enemy soldier only a short distance away from the boat and crew, forward gunner Tommy Belodeau shot him in the leg with the boat's 7.62×51mm caliber [[M60 machine gun|M-60]] [[machine gun]]. "Tommy in the pit tank winged him in the side of the legs as he was coming across," Fred Short said. "But the guy didn't miss a stride. I mean, he did not break stride." Belodeau's machine gun jammed after he fired, and while crewmate Michael Medeiros attempted to fire, he was unable to do so. Kerry leaped ashore and, followed by Medeiros, pursued the man and killed him. The medal citation notes that Kerry "then led an assault party and conducted a sweep of the area" until the enemy had "been completely routed." The mission was judged highly successful for having destroyed numerous targets and confiscated substantial combat supplies while sustaining no casualties.

Kerry's commanding officer, [[Lieutenant]] George Elliott, joked that he didn't know whether to court-martial him for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original [[Wikisource:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry|medal citation]] signed by Zumwalt. In addition, the after-action reports for this mission are available, along with the original press release written on March 1, a historical summary dated March 17, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/index.html#silver_star|title=John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|work=kerryvietnam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources close to Kerry say the incident had a profound effect on him: "It's the reason he gets so angry when his patriotism is challenged. It was a traumatic experience that's still with him, and he went through it for his country." It affects the way Kerry lives his life every day, the source said, since "he knows he very well would not be alive today had he not taken the life of another man [he] never ever met."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/sections/Nightline/Politics/kerry_medal_040624-1.html|title=Nightline|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Star and third Purple Heart===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Kerrycrew.jpg|right|thumb|248px|Kerry (far right) with four of the five members of his crew in March 1969. The others are (from left) [[gunner]] Gene Thorson, David Alston, Thomas Belodeau, and Del Sandusky, Kerry's second-in-command. The fifth crewman, Michael Medeiros, took the photograph.]] --&gt;
On March 13, five Swift Boats were returning to base together on the Bay Hap river from their missions that day. A mine detonated directly beneath one of the boats (PCF-3), lifting it into the air. Shortly thereafter, another mine exploded near Kerry's boat (PCF-94). [[James Rassmann]], a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] advisor who was sitting on the deck of the pilothouse eating a cookie, was knocked overboard. Just afterwards, the boat came under attack from both sides of the bank. Rassmann dived to the bottom of the river. Repeatedly, when he came back up for air, the enemy fired at him. Rassmann was heading to the north bank, expecting to be taken prisoner, when Kerry realized he was gone and came back for him.

The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in his medal citation:

:''Lt. Kerry directed his gunners to provide [[Suppressive fire|suppressing fire]], while from an exposed position on the bow, his arm bleeding and in pain, with disregard for his personal safety, he pulled the man aboard. Lt. Kerry then directed his boat to return and assist the other damaged craft and towed the boat to safety. Lt. Kerry's calmness, professionalism and great personal courage under fire were in keeping with the highest traditions of the US Naval Service.'' ([[Wikisource:Bronze Star Citation - John Kerry|Wikisource]])

PCF-94 received special recognition from [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Roy Hoffmann]], the commander of Task Force 115 (which included Coastal Division 11), on March 14 in his weekly report to his men:

:''Special recognition is due to the following unit this week, for exceptional performance: To PCF 94 for providing extraordinary assistance to PCF 3 which was seriously damaged by a mine explosion while proceeding down the Bay Hap [river]. PCF 94 picked up the MSF advisor out of the water and towed PCF 3 out of the danger area. PCF 43, 51, and 23 all assisted in suppression of automatic weapons and small arms fire, evacuation of wounded in action, and damage control effort on PCF 3.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/index.html#bronze_star|title=John Kerry's Vietnam Medals|work=kerryvietnam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dazed and injured crew of PCF-3 had been rescued, PCFs 43 and 23 left the scene to evacuate the four most seriously wounded sailors. PCFs 51 and 94 remained behind and helped salvage the stricken boat together with a damage-control party that had been immediately dispatched to the scene.

Kerry was slightly injured earlier in the day by shrapnel from a grenade tossed into a rice bin; he received contusions on his right [[forearm]] from hitting the bulkhead when the mine exploded near his boat during the later action. He received his third Purple Heart at this time.

==Return from Vietnam==
On March 17, 1969, shortly after Kerry's third wound, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Charles Horne, the commander of Coastal Squadron 1, filed for Kerry's reassignment to the U.S. per Kerry's request. He was entitled to this early departure from Vietnam (subject to approval by the Bureau of Naval Personnel), because those who had been wounded three times, "regardless of the nature of the wound or treatment required ... will not be ordered to serve in Vietnam and contiguous waters or to duty with ships or units which have been alerted for movement to that area." According to the Navy regulation that governed this (BUPERS Instruction 1300.39), the request for the "thrice-wounded reassignment" was optional at the request of the wounded party and required requesting reassignment. Kerry requested reassignment and was granted his request.

On March 26, after a final patrol at night on March 25, Kerry was transferred to Cam Ranh Bay to await his orders. He was there for five or six days and left Vietnam in early April. On April 11, he reported to the [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]-based Atlantic [[Military Sea Transportation Service]], where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral [[Walter Schlech]]. On January 1, 1970, Kerry was promoted to full [[Lieutenant]]; on January 3, he requested discharge. He was released from active duty on March 1.

All told, John Kerry was on active duty in the U.S. Navy for three years and eight months, from August 1966 until March 1970. He continued to serve in the Navy Reserves until February, 1978. He lost five close friends in the war, including Yale classmate Richard Pershing, who was [[killed in action]] on February 17, 1968.

==Honorable Discharge==
On November 21, 1969, Kerry requested an early release from active duty in order to become a candidate for Congress. The request was approved and he was released from active duty effective January 3, 1970, and transferred to the Ready Reserve (inactive).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/releaseactduty.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/dd214.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 1, 1972, the Navy offered Kerry the option of executing a written request to remain in the Ready Reserve or automatically being transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive; Kerry was subsequently transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive effective July 1, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/trnsfr2stndyrsrv.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerry had no obligation to attend drills or contact the Navy other than to keep his address current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/articles/2004/09/10/critics_countered_on_kerry_record_of_inactive_service/|title=Critics countered on Kerry record of inactive service|work=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 1978, Kerry received an "Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Naval Reserve," pursuant to former Section 1162 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code&lt;ref name="cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1162-|title=10 U.S. Code §§ 1162, 1163 - Repealed.

With respect to Kerry's discharge from the Naval Reserve,  Rowan Scarborough of the Washington Times wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A second charge is that Mr. Kerry did not successfully fulfill his time in the Reserves, so a special board had to be convened 
to determine what type of discharge he should receive.

Navy documents show that in 1978, he received an "honorable discharge certificate" after a board of officers convened and reviewed his record.

Navy officials say today that the board was standard operating procedure at that time for all reservists and does not indicate Mr. Kerry did 
anything wrong.

After service just short of four years on active duty, Mr. Kerry transferred to the Ready Reserve and then in 1972 to the standby Reserve. 
He was not required to attend drills under those two designations, says a Navy official who asked not to be named.The controversy remains active however, because Kerry's discharge was issued years after Kerry's reserve obligation ended, and occurred during the time of President Jimmy Carter's blanket amnesty and discharge upgrade program for Vietnam-era veterans who were discharged under less-than -honorable conditions for misconduct. Additionally, the discharge was processed by a Naval Board of Review, a procedure only utilized to upgrade less-than-honorable discharges, so the fact that Kerry's discharge went through such a process shows that it was a proverbial "fresh coat of paint," over a bad discharge, according to veterans. Detractors contend that Kerry's ties to his fellow liberal political ally, then-President Carter, was behind the upgraded discharge. Carter was very sympathetic to the anti-war movement and had pardoned US deserters and draft-dodgers. Thus, he was suspected to have ordered an upgrading of the discharge. Otherwise, Kerry would have remained on record as a non-honorably discharged veteran. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scarborough, Rowan|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/oct/18/20041018-124856-1545r/?page=all|title=Records indicate Kerry did his duty|work=The Washingtion Times|date=October 18, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020230751/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/oct/18/20041018-124856-1545r/?page=all|archivedate=October 20, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism of military service and awards==
{{main|John Kerry military service controversy}}
Critics have questioned several aspects of Kerry's military service.
As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, around 200 Vietnam-era veterans formed the group [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]] (SBVT) and held press conferences, ran ads (financed in part by a major Republican party donor in Texas) and endorsed a book ''Unfit for Command'' questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. Several SBVT members were in the same unit with Kerry. SVPT member Stephen Gardner served on the same boat. Other SBVT members included two of Kerry's former commanding officers, Grant Hibbard and George Elliott. Hibbard and Elliott have alleged, respectively, that Kerry's first Purple Heart and Silver Star were undeserved. In addition, members of SBVT have questioned his other medals and his truthfulness in testimony about the war. Defenders of John Kerry's war record, who include nine of the ten living crewmen who served under him,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/24/politics/campaign/24COMB.html?ei=5007&amp;en=760c0e92cabf648c&amp;ex=1392958800&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=]&lt;/ref&gt; have charged that organizers of SBVT had close ties to the Bush presidential campaign and that the accusations were false and politically motivated .

=== UN Women===
Naciri is an outspoken supporter of women's rights in the region, and the engagement of women in peace processes in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-economy-women/violence-against-women-hurts-arab-economies-u-n-says-idUSKBN1C92M7|title=Violence against women hurts Arab economies, U.N. says|last=Kanso|first=Heba|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership, the regional office supported the convening of 45 Yemeni women from different factions to call for an engendered peace process, in his remarks to the meeting, Naciri said, "Yemeni women have an opportunity to contribute in building peace, revitalizing dialogue, and helping Yemen get out from this dark tunnel. We are counting on Yemeni women’s wisdom to create a model that people will follow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/10/yemeni-women-call-for-their-inclusion-in-peace-efforts "Yemeni women call for their inclusion in peace efforts."] UNWomen.org - 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been appointed immediately after the [[Arab Spring|Arab spring]], much of Naciri's work on [[gender equality]] in the region focused on participation and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765579888/Writing-history-Muslim-women-reshape-their-destiny-with-newfound-freedom.html?pg=all "Muslim women reshape their destiny with newfound freedom."] -  Deseret News - Published: Thursday, May 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; "We need to look on how can we sustain this participation," Naciri said. "With women, with men, with the country at large, and the government, how can we prove that women's participation is of interest and benefit to the whole society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://arabic.cnn.com/middleeast/2016/06/11/women-iraq-syria-conflict-opinion "Womenin Iraq Syria Conflict."] CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his leadership, UN Women and [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia]] (ESCWA) launched regional research on the costing of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/world/un-women-and-escwa-launch-project-estimate-cost-violence-against-women-arab-region|title=UN Women and ESCWA launch project to estimate the cost of violence against women in the Arab Region|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has spearheaded work on engaging men and boys as agents of change in the region, including through issuing a report on masculinities – the first of its kind in the Arab World.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://imagesmena.org/en/|title=Men and Gender Equality in the Middle East and North Africa|website=Understanding Masculinities|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/09/middleeast/gender-equality-study-mena/index.html|title=Do Arab men support gender equality?|last=CNN|first=Bianca Britton,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naciri has worked on expanding both the scope and partnerships of the regional office. A new concept note for a partnership initiative between [[Union for the Mediterranean]] (UfM), [[UN Women|U.N. Women]] and the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] on Women and ICTs is already under discussion and, according to Naciri, new expertise in this area will definitely be in demand in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.devex.com/news/full-speed-ahead-5-ways-to-optimize-women-s-economic-potential-86361 "Full speed ahead: 5 ways to optimize women’s economic potential."] www.Devex.com -19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Naciri has successfully established several partnerships with bilateral development partners, including the EU MADAD trust fund for [[Syria]] response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabstates.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/12/european-union|title=European Union -  UN Women partnership bolsters efforts in response to Syrian crisis|work=UN Women {{!}} Arab States/North Africa|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arabstates.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/men-and-women-for-gender-equality|title=Men and Women for Gender Equality|work=UN Women {{!}} Arab States/North Africa|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finland]], [[Japan]] and the government of [[Norway]] to mention a few.

'''Nicole Sanders''' is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Ali Larter]] in the television series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. Niki is the wife of [[D. L. Hawkins]] ([[Leonard Roberts]]) and mother of [[Micah Sanders]] ([[Noah Gray-Cabey]]). Niki, a sufferer of [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]], displays superhuman strength, being able to literally rip others in half. Initially, she is able to access this power only when her [[alter ego]] "Jessica" is in control. Killed in an explosion to save Monica.

[[Tim Kring]], the creator of the show, stated that he originally created Niki with the power to be in two places at once, which stems from her life as a single mother.&lt;ref name="Heroes Execs"&gt;{{cite web|author=Standler |title=Heroes Execs discuss show’s future, LOST, more |publisher=OgMog |date=2007-02-07 |url=http://www.ogmog.com/2007/02/07/heroes-execs-discuss-shows-future-lost-more/ |accessdate=2007-03-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223233531/http://www.ogmog.com/2007/02/07/heroes-execs-discuss-shows-future-lost-more/ |archivedate=2007-02-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Niki was also originally written to be a [[showgirl]]. However, [[Ali Larter]] did not have the proper physique to portray a showgirl, so the character's profession was changed to [[cam whore|internet stripper]].&lt;ref name="Jeff Loeb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Caylo |first=Mel |title=TV Q&amp;A: Heroes-Jeff Loeb |publisher=Wizard Universe |date=2007-01-20 |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/heroes/003137244.cfm?page=3 |pages=3 |accessdate=2007-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194407/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/television/heroes/003137244.cfm?page=3 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coleite, Niki was written out of the series and replaced with [[Tracy Strauss]] so that Larter could play a different role, as they realized that they could not go further with the character. The change also allowed them to tell an origin story, where the character discovers that she has powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18343 |title=Behind the Eclipse: Week 2 |accessdate=2008-11-04 |author=Pokaski, Joe |author2=Coliete, Aron  |date=October 6, 2008 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
One of three [[identical twins|identical triplets]] injected with [[Arthur Petrelli]]'s formula as babies, Niki was adopted by a wealthy father named [[List of characters in Heroes#Hal Sanders|Hal Sanders]]. An [[child abuse|abusive]] [[alcoholic]], Hal would often beat Niki and her sister, Jessica, during his drunken rages. Eventually, Hal strangled Jessica to death and abandoned his remaining daughter. As an adult, Niki had no memory of her father's actions and simply believed he ran out on her. At some point in her life, Niki herself became an alcoholic and a problem gambler, but she managed to overcome her problems. On her first anniversary of [[sobriety]], Niki attended an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting. There, she was reunited with her father, Hal, who wanted to make amends. Niki introduced Hal to her husband, D. L., and her son, Micah. Hal gave the boy a computer, but when he became angry at his grandson for taking the expensive gift apart, Niki demanded that he leave. After her father's departure, Niki went to confront him as Jessica, claiming to remember everything he did to her, including his responsibility in her death (a memory Niki had apparently been suppressing). After assaulting him, she forced the [[check (finance)|check]] Hal gave Niki into his mouth and ordered him never to contact her again.&lt;ref name="SixMonths"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Six Months Ago | episodelink = Six Months Ago | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Genesis===
As of October 2006, Niki resides in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and struggles to raise her ten-year-old son, [[Micah Sanders|Micah]]. She has been working as an [[Cam whore|internet stripper]] to pay the bills. Her husband, [[D. L. Hawkins]], is in [[prison]], accused of stealing two million [[dollar]]s from a sports booker and murdering his own gang.

To help pay for Micah's [[tuition]] at a very expensive school that Niki believed would encourage his gifts, Niki borrowed money from [[List of Heroes characters#Daniel Linderman|Mr. Linderman]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), a [[gangster|mobster]] who once employed her husband.

Not having enough money to continue paying tuition or repay the loan, she withdraws Micah from the school.&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Genesis | episodelink = Genesis (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = Director: David Sernel, Writer: Tim Kring | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two go [[on the lam|on the run]], as they attempt to elude thugs and police that Linderman sends after her.

During times of stress, Niki begins seeing her reflection in mirrors and other reflective surfaces moving differently from herself, leading her to be concerned about her sanity. After Linderman sends two thugs to her house to collect the money she owed him, an altercation occurs, with Niki apparently blacking out after being hit by one of the thugs. When Niki recovers consciousness some time later, she is shocked to find the two thugs dead and horribly mutilated.&lt;ref name="DontLook"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Don’t Look Back | episodelink = Don't Look Back (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = Director: Alan Arkush, Writer: Tim Kring | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niki has other blackout spells over the following days, one time losing four hours, always with no recollection of what has transpired. Niki eventually realizes that she possesses a [[split personality]] named Jessica, the other being far more sinister and amoral than her usual self, and which possesses [[superhuman strength]].

Niki is reunited with her husband D. L. after he escaped from jail in order to clear his name. Later, Jessica reveals that she was the one who stole the money, killed D. L.'s crew, and framed him, planning to use the money to give her son a better life and keep him away from D. L.'s influence. After a short but violent fight, in which D. L. reveals the phasing powers that he had used to escape from jail, Niki is defeated and lies unmoving on the floor while D. L. takes Micah away.&lt;ref name="BetterHalves"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Better Halves | episodelink = Better Halves | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = Director: Greg Beeman, Writer: Natalie Chadez | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Niki recovers from her injuries and confides in her friend Tina about her dreams and her alternate personality. Jessica then resurfaces and tells Tina that Niki will no longer need Tina's help. That night Jessica answers a telephone call from Micah. She persuades Micah, who knows that she is not his mother, to tell her where he and D. L. are staying.&lt;ref name="NothingToHide"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Nothing to Hide | episodelink = Nothing to Hide (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = Director: Donna Dietch, Writer: Jesse Alexander | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, Jessica purchases a sniper rifle, and goes in search of D. L. and Micah. When she finally finds them, she takes aim at D. L. from a hidden location across the street and attempts to kill him.&lt;ref name="Homecoming"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Homecoming | episodelink = Homecoming (Heroes) | series = Heroes | serieslink = Heroes (U.S. TV series)| credits = Director: Greg Beeman, Writer: Adam Armus &amp; Kay Foster | network = NBC | airdate = 2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first shot hits D. L. in the shoulder, but Jessica is unsuccessful at killing him. After a short chase through the woods, during which Niki fights Jessica for dominance, Jessica attempts to kill D. L. again. She inadvertently throws Micah against some rocks when he tries to restrain her. Horrified, Niki regains control. She apologizes to D. L. and Micah and explains to them her problem. Niki reveals that Jessica is stronger than she is, and that as a result, she can't be trusted. Concerned that Jessica will eventually take over and put her family in danger, Niki turns herself in to the police and confesses to murder.

Two weeks later, Niki is in prison, awaiting trial. She is returned to her cell after being in [[solitary confinement]]. The prison staff is very cautious, as Jessica has emerged previously and injured one of the guards during an attempted escape. During a meeting with the [[public defender]] assigned to her case, Niki is informed that the prosecution seeks the [[death penalty]]. Her lawyer asks Niki about the two million dollars, but she feigns ignorance. A rowdy Jessica then emerges to state that Niki is lying. Soon, Jessica recommends the lawyer bring in a "[[psychologist|shrink]]" to analyze her apparent [[multiple personality disorder]]; Niki insists she's not crazy. Later, a meeting with D. L. and Micah indicates that D. L. gave Linderman back the two million dollars. D. L. regrets the whole situation, but Niki believes that it's for the best. She states that she still thinks of Jessica as a completely separate person and not an alter ego. Micah is very distressed by the whole situation and Niki asks the guard for permission to hug him. The guard denies her request, but Niki asks persistently, advancing on the guard as she does so. When the guard attempts to strike her with his [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]], Niki grabs it and breaks it in half with her bare hands. She appears to be surprised after she does so, as there was no clear indication that the superhuman strength came from Jessica. A now [[straitjacket]]ed Niki is [[sedative|sedated]] and placed in a room with padded walls.

In "[[The Fix (Heroes)|The Fix]]," Niki awakes to find the straitjacket removed, the drugs wearing off, and a psychologist, [[List of characters in Heroes#Dr. Witherson|Dr. Witherson]], looking at her. Niki insists that while the straitjacket is useless, the drugs make Jessica weak. The psychologist isn't interested in sedating Niki further, and believes she can help Niki. Niki is visited by D. L., who used his powers to enter her room and proposes breaking her out. D. L. states that he is having trouble raising Micah alone, but Niki is still resigned to her fate.

After Niki gives him a bit of advice, D. L. leaves. Later, the psychologist comes back and Niki agrees to talk to her. The psychologist insists on talking to Jessica. Niki is opposed at first, but the thought of being able to see Micah and D. L. again eventually leads her to give it a chance.  Niki reminisces about her sister Jessica's piano playing abilities due to the metronome that the psychologist is using to bring Jessica out.  Jessica eventually comes out and attacks the psychologist repeatedly with the [[Taser]] that the other woman brought for protection. Later, while in her padded cell, a man walks into her cell and tells her to get dressed.  When asked for an explanation, he tells Niki that a death row inmate has admitted to the killings for which she was being held and that DNA evidence verifies the inmate's story. Once home, Micah is clearly ecstatic to have his mother home and asks her to play a game with him.  Appearing to be his mother, Jessica replies that she would enjoy that, and Niki is shown to be hitting a mirror, begging for release.  Jessica merely looks at Niki and replies, "You were the one who wanted to be locked up, Niki."

Jessica becomes Linderman's new assassin, and it is revealed that Linderman arranged to have Niki/Jessica released from prison. On Linderman's orders, Jessica kills a man by tearing him in two, throwing [[Matt Parkman]] ([[Greg Grunberg]]) out of the window in the process. (When Niki and Jessica are fighting for dominance when Jessica is about to kill the target, [[Matt Parkman]] who possesses the power of [[telepathy]], is able to hear them both in his mind, a fact which surprises Jessica. "You heard Niki?".)

Niki manages to gain control a few times. She puts the photo of Nathan Petrelli, Jessica's next target, on D. L.'s pillow, which causes D. L. to question Jessica, who is still pretending to be Niki. Jessica lies and tells him that Linderman called to ask her to be a "dealer" at the casino. Jessica kisses D. L. and assures him that it is nothing more. He leaves the room but is still suspicious.

Jessica murders the two FBI agents, who are working with Nathan to take down Linderman. Later, Niki, who has managed to gain control once again, confronts Nathan in his room and confesses everything to him. She then advises Nathan to either take his family and run or to accept Linderman's offer. Nathan refuses, so Niki suggests that he kill Linderman instead. She gives Nathan a gun, which Jessica had intended to use on him. She tells Nathan that she does not have much time and begs him to knock her out so that Jessica can see that she is not in control anymore. Nathan complies.

In "[[.07%]]", Jessica returns home from her failed assignment only to be confronted by D. L who questions her about which personality is dominant. However, Jessica is unsure. Linderman asks if he can borrow Micah for a few hours, given that he let the debt slide and he saved her from the gas chamber. Jessica coldly informs him that Micah stays out of all their affairs, and leaves. Linderman, however, sends [[Candice Wilmer]] to impersonate Jessica and give Micah permission to go with Linderman.

In "[[The Hard Part]]", Jessica and D. L. argue about their son Micah's whereabouts, and D. L. blames Jessica for his disappearance. He leaves, intending to rescue Micah without help. Niki pleads with Jessica to assist him, saying that he will die without her help.

D. L. and Jessica phase through walls and into Linderman's office. They find detailed files on their whole family, including Micah. D. L. is angered to find that they had been used. The pair attempts to determine Micah's whereabouts, and find a painting of Micah in what appears to be a burning New York City.

D. L. and Jessica make it to New York, where they work with [[Matt Parkman]] and [[Mr. Bennet (Heroes)|Mr. Bennet]] to find Linderman. When D. L. and Jessica corner him, Linderman offers Jessica $20 million to kill D. L. Jessica seriously considers the offer, turning to D.L. and saying that she would kill him for that amount of money... but then she states "Niki wouldn't" and lets Niki take control once more. Niki hugs D. L. and apologizes. Linderman shoots at her but D. L. anticipates him and steps in front of Niki to protect her, taking the bullet. D. L. phases Niki out of the room after he kills Linderman.  Niki then confronts [[Candice Wilmer]], who impersonates Jessica. However, the real Jessica appears in a mirror shard to tell Niki she is not fighting her. Rather than take control, Jessica encourages Niki to fight herself and she is able to finally access her super strength as Niki and defeat Candice. Jessica then disappears from the mirror for good. As Niki later leaves the building with D. L., Molly, Mohinder, and Micah, she discovers [[Sylar]] and Peter in a showdown. When Sylar summons a parking meter with his telekinesis and strikes Peter down, Niki disarms him and slams his torso with the weapon. Peter, now capable of using Niki's super-strength, tells her to go back to her family. She does so, and then watches with D. L., Micah, and Molly Walker as Nathan flies Peter into the stratosphere to safely explode.

===Generations===
[[Image:Niki Faces Gina.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Niki faces Gina's reflection for the first time (''[[Four Months Ago...]]'')]]
After the events in the season finale, Bob from The Company approaches Niki in fear other personalities may emerge. She refuses his treatment so that she can be with Micah and D. L., who survived a gunshot wound to the chest. She begins taking medication, but stops when she experiences unpleasant side effects. On what is meant to be her first day of work at a new job, Gina, a new personality, appears, sealing Niki away. When D. L. tracks down Gina in L.A., whom he believes to be Jessica, she is dancing with another man. Upon seeing D. L., Niki returns. The two begin to leave, exchanging declarations of love for each other, when the same man dancing with Gina shows up and suddenly shoots D. L., killing him.

Niki and Micah then leave Las Vegas. Niki leaves Micah with Nana Dawson, a relative of D. L.'s, and travels to The Company to seek a cure for her condition.  A promise of service is extracted as payment. In "[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]", she attacks a company worker and Bob, forcing Mohinder to shoot her with a Taser.  When Mohinder offers to help her escape, she stops him, explaining that she came to the Company voluntarily and they are trying to help her ("I gave up my son to be here"). Later, in the episode "[[The Line (Heroes)|The Line]]", she joins Mohinder as his partner, claiming to be cured. When [[Maury Parkman]] mounts an assault on the Company, he manages to corrupt her by using her nightmares against her. To stop herself, she injects herself with a modified form of the Shanti virus, which is soon discovered to be immune to the antibodies in Mohinder's blood. In the present at the end of "[[Four Months Ago...]]" she is released into the general population.

In "[[Truth and Consequences]]", Niki returns to Nana Dawson's house to be with Micah. One night, she gets a call from Mohinder saying he has found a cure and that he is coming to give it to her. She goes to tell Micah who is supposed to be sleeping, but finds an empty bed. In "[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]", Micah convinces her to help save Monica from the gang that kidnapped her. Niki succeeds in rescuing Monica, but is unable to escape herself as the building explodes.

=== Villains ===
In "[[One of Us, One of Them]]", Niki is revealed to have died. In "[[I Am Become Death]]", it is revealed that Niki, [[Tracy Strauss]], and [[List of characters in Heroes#Barbara|Barbara]] are identical triplets that were separated at birth and had their genes modified to give them superhuman abilities.

==Alternate future==
In the graphic novel "[[List of Heroes graphic novels|Walls, Part 1]]", it is revealed that sometime after the explosion, Niki was placed in a prison for evolved humans and put under maximum security until [[Peter Petrelli]] and [[Hiro Nakamura]] rescued every prisoner, including her. She is also shown to have taken complete control over her body. Sometime after being freed in "[[Five Years Gone]]" it is revealed that her son and husband have been killed, Micah by the explosion and D. L. by Sylar. Because of this, Jessica has simply disappeared. Niki is involved in a relationship with [[Peter Petrelli]] and works as a barroom stripper under the stage name of "Jessica". She is often emotional and in pain, which only grows when she discovers that Peter caused the explosion and not Sylar, as she originally thought.

== Powers and abilities ==
[[Image:Nikki's enhanced strength.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Jessica (Niki) easily lifts [[List of characters in Heroes#Bob Bishop|Bob Bishop]] in "[[Fight or Flight (Heroes)|Fight or Flight]]".]]
Niki was not born with the genetic code for abilities, but was synthetically given powers under the Company's orders by [[List of characters in Heroes#Dr. Zimmerman|Dr. Zimmerman]]. She has the ability of enhanced strength, allowing her to pull out the door of a safe box with her bare hands,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/downloads/Heroes_novel_006.pdf Stolen Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201093121/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/downloads/Heroes_novel_006.pdf |date=2006-12-01 }}," sixth chapter of [[List of Heroes graphic novels|''Heroes'' webcomic]].&lt;/ref&gt; throw her husband several feet across a small area with a single hit, break away from restraining cuffs that are "strong enough to hold down an elephant", and literally tear her opponents apart. She also displays signs of increased physical durability, being able to endure a blow from a shovel in "[[Fallout (Heroes)|Fallout]]", only to stand back up again relatively unharmed, as well as able to endure the stress inflicted upon her body by her own strength (she does not, for example, injure her hand when punching through a solid wooden door). The ability is originally only used by her alter-ego, Jessica. In "[[How to Stop an Exploding Man]]", however, Niki is able to fully use her strength after some encouragement from Jessica.

As a side effect of her ability, Niki has [[Dissociative identity disorder#terms|"alternate" personalities]]. Jessica is one of these, named after Niki's late adoptive sister. At the start of the series, Jessica surfaces during times of great stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gregbeeman.blogspot.com/2006/10/episode-6-better-halves.html Episode 6: Better Halves], "Beaming Beeman," blog of Greg Beeman, Director/Producer of ''Heroes''. Retrieved 31 Oct 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but surfaces with increasing ease as the series moves on. When Jessica surfaces, the transformation is instantaneous and almost unnoticeable, but is made apparent by Niki's sudden violent and strong-willed behavior. Jessica also freely demonstrates the superhuman strength Niki has only recently unlocked. She also gains a peculiar [[tattoo]] resembling an [[RNA]] helix on her right shoulder. This [[Mythology of Heroes#Helix|helix symbol]] has been a recurring element in the series.

Jessica seems to have been aware that she is sharing Niki's body for longer than Niki realizes, leaving notes, gifts, and instructions for Niki, and telling a thug not to "threaten ''our'' son." Niki becomes aware of Jessica with the aid of reflective surfaces such as mirrors, and begins communicating with her. Jessica's ability to surface seems to increase over time, as Jessica is able to actively surface more often and more easily than she does in early episodes. The blackout effect on Niki also seems to lessen over time; the two personalities often directly fight each other for control and seem aware of what is said even when they are not active.

It is revealed in "[[Four Months Ago...]]" that Jessica is not Niki's only personality. A third personality emerges: Gina, a pseudonym Niki assumed after she ran away to L.A. when she was younger. Whereas Jessica was originally triggered by the stresses of being a single mother and the need to protect herself and Micah, Gina seems to be a manifestation of Niki's suppressed desire to escape her responsibilities as a mother and wife.

==History==
Based in Central Laos, particularly [[Vientiane]], the Sananikone family were often referred as the "[[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]" or the Kennedys of Laos. The Sananikones' owned an airline, Veha Akhat, which leased planes and pilots from [[Taiwan]] for paramilitary operations, which lend themselves easily to commerce with opium-growing tribes people, where some of their wealth came from. They are very private people and very little is known about them. Many of the Sananikone clan have changed their last name to avoid execution during the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg32780.html |title=[CTRL&amp;#93; The CIA and the New Opium War - from Ramparts (May 1971) |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=2000-01-04 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seneb''' was a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] who served as a high-ranking court official in the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Ancient Egypt]], ''circa'' 2520 BC. Seneb was a person of considerable importance and wealth who owned thousands of cattle, held twenty palaces and religious titles and was married to a high-ranking priestess of average size with whom he had three children. His successful career and the lavishness of his burial arrangements are indicative of [[Dwarfs and pygmies in Ancient Egypt|the acceptance given to dwarfs in ancient Egyptian society]], whose texts advocated the acceptance and integration of those with physical disabilities.

Seneb is depicted with his wife and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Junker]]: ''Gîza V: Die Mastaba des Snb (Seneb) und die umliegenden Gräber.'' Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien: Philosophisch-historische Klasse, Denkschriften 71.2, Wien/ Leipzig 1941, p. 3-127 ([http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/junker_giza_5.pdf PDF; 25,7 MB]; the excavation report, in German)&lt;/ref&gt; It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with [[achondroplasia]], a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.

==Discovery and location of Seneb's tomb==
[[File:Giza pyramid complex (map).svg|left|thumb|alt=Map of Giza Necropolis|Map of the Giza Necropolis. Seneb's tomb was found in the western cemetery (the West Field)]]
Seneb was buried in a ''[[mastaba]]'' - a flat-roofed brick tomb – located in the [[Giza West Field|West Field]] of the [[Giza Necropolis]] near modern [[Cairo]], where a large complex of ancient Egyptian royal tombs and mortuary structures was built, including the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]. It was rediscovered by the German archaeologist [[Hermann Junker]] in 1926. The tomb is situated close to that of another dwarf, Perniankhu, a high-ranking royal courtier who may have been Seneb's father.&lt;ref name="Hawass"&gt;Zahi Hawass, Sandro Vannini. ''Inside the Egyptian Museum with Zahi Hawass: Collector's Edition'', p. 88. American University in Cairo Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-977-416-364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its date was long uncertain but is now firmly attributed to the reign of [[Djedefre]] (2528–2520 BC).&lt;ref name="MMA-62"&gt;''Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids'', p. 62. Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-87099-906-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife's name also appears in the nearby tomb of an official, Ankh-ib, suggesting that the families of Seneb, Perniankhu and Ankh-ib may have been related.&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;''Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneb was apparently buried with his wife, but no trace remains of the bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Betty M. Adelson. ''The lives of dwarfs: their journey from public curiosity toward social liberation'', p. 5. Rutgers University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-8135-3548-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tomb was looted long ago, like most of the others at Giza. It was one of the first known attempts at building a ceiling dome over a square chamber, with the dome resting on jutting bricks at the corners of the room.&lt;ref name="Croce"&gt;Alessandro Bongioanni, Maria Sole Croce (eds.) ''The Treasures of Ancient Egypt'', p. 81. White Star, 2003. {{ISBN|88-8095-235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rectangular interior of Seneb's ''mastaba'' contained two cult niches with a [[false door]] and cavities containing stone chests.&lt;ref&gt;''Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Three statues were found within the chests – the painted limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family and two other statues in wood and granite. The wooden one disintegrated when it was discovered but Junker recorded that it had been about {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and depicted Seneb standing with a walking-staff in one hand and a sceptre in the other.&lt;ref name="Dasen130"&gt;Véronique Dasen. ''Dwarfs in ancient Egypt and Greece'', p. 130. Clarendon Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-19-814699-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of the wooden statue are now in the [[Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim]] in [[Germany]], in a very fragmentary state; the outline of a curled wig can still be made out, as can the pose of the left arm, which was held forward at the elbow.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Carol Harvey. ''Wooden statues of the Old Kingdom: a typological study'', p. 79. BRILL, 2001. {{ISBN|978-90-04-12357-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneb's 1.5 ton sarcophagus is part of the collection of the Egyptian Museum of the [[University of Leipzig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leipzig-fernsehen.de/Aktuell/Leipzig/Artikel/1013222/Sarg-des-Seneb-wieder-in-Leipzig/|title=Sarg des Seneb wieder in Leipzig|work=Leipzig Fernsehen|language=German|date=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture of Seneb and his family==

The limestone sculpture of Seneb and his family is part of the collection of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref name="Atiya"&gt;Farid Atiya, Abeer El-Shahawy, Matḥaf al-Miṣrī, Farid S. Atiya. ''The Egyptian Museum in Cairo: a walk through the alleys of ancient Egypt'', pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76. {{ISBN|978-977-17-2183-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower [[Register (sculpture)|register]]. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a [[scribe]]. His wife Senetites sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt;

Two of the couple's children, one boy and one girl, stand below Seneb where the legs of an ordinary person would be. They are depicted nude with their index fingers placed in their mouths and a lock of hair falling on one side of their heads, indicating that they were below the age of puberty, when Egyptian children were given an "adult" haircut. Seneb and his son are shown with darker skin colouring than his wife and daughter. This was a standard artistic convention used to indicate gender and status, reflecting the fact that high-ranking females would remain indoors and retain a light skin colour while males would gain a darker skin from the hot Egyptian sun.&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt; The names of three children are recorded,&lt;ref&gt;Adelson, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; though the third child was not depicted on the sculpture - presumably for reasons of symmetry. They were named after Seneb's royal masters; his son was called Radjedef-Ankh ("May Radjedef live"), his eldest daughter was Awib-Khufu ("Happy is Khufu") and his younger daughter was Smeret-Radjedef ("Companion of Radjedef").&lt;ref name="Dasen127" /&gt; They are depicted with normal proportions, suggesting that they did not inherit their father's condition.&lt;ref name="Dasen130" /&gt;

The sculpture's roughly cubical arrangement cleverly ensures that the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating [[negative space]] into the piece.&lt;ref name="MMA-62" /&gt; By putting the children in the place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry.&lt;ref name="Hawass" /&gt; He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure,&lt;ref name="Adelson141"&gt;Adelson, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique.&lt;ref name="Dasen130" /&gt; The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed on either side of the children and on the horizontal face of the base.&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt;

Seneb's dwarfism is depicted realistically in the sculpture. It portrays him with a large head but small arms and legs.&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt; This possibly indicates that he had [[achondroplasia]], a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing parts of the body – particularly the [[femur]] and [[humerus]], which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Filer. ''Disease'', p. 53. University of Texas Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-292-72498-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative diagnosis is [[dysmelia]] – a condition that produces short arms and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Henschen, Folke. ''The history of diseases'', p. 255. Longmans, 1966. {{OCLC|245893008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Yoyotte. ''Treasures of the pharaohs'', p. 36. Skira, 1968. {{OCLC|100919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and position==
{{Hiero|Seneb|&lt;hiero&gt;S29-n:D58&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=ok}}
Seneb's name means "healthy" – perhaps given by his mother as a wish for survival when he was a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Hilary. ''Understanding hieroglyphs: a complete introductory guide'', p. 43. Passport Books, 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-8442-4604-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Egyptians possessed similar names, not to denote an absence of disease but to convey a positive message of healthiness and vigour.&lt;ref&gt;Ghalioungui, Paul. ''Magic and medical science in ancient Egypt'', p. 150. B.M. Israel, 1973. {{ISBN|978-90-6078-062-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwarfism was not seen as a defect in ancient Egypt, unlike in many other cultures. Egyptian texts advised the acceptance of those with physical or mental disabilities, and there were even two dwarf gods, [[Bes]] and [[Ptah]].&lt;ref&gt;Mona L. Russell, ''Egypt'', p. 245. ABC-CLIO, 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of dwarfs gained prestigious roles and were given lavish burials in proximity to their royal masters.&lt;ref&gt;Natan Slifkin. ''Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash'', p. 152. Zoo Torah, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-933143-18-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seneb's career is documented on his false door and the plinths of his statues, which record twenty titles&lt;ref name="Dasen127"/&gt; including "beloved of the lord [king]", "overseer of weaving in the palace", "overseer of dwarfs" (presumably indicating that there were others in the palace), "overseer of the crew of the ''ks'' ship"&lt;ref&gt;Chahira Kozma. "Genetic Disorders in Ancient Egypt", in Ahmad S. Teebi (ed). ''Genetic Disorders Among Arab Populations'', p. 288. Springer, 2010. {{ISBN|978-3-642-05079-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to a ceremonial or cult boat), "overseer of the ''jwḥw''" (possibly referring to animal-tenders), and "keeper of the God's seal of the ''Wn-ḥr-b3w'' boat" (referring to a papyrus bark used in certain festivals). His titles suggest that he might have started his career as an official in charge of royal linen and possibly also pets, a role in which other dwarfs are known to have served, and subsequently gained higher-ranking posts in charge of royal or cult boats. Alternatively, he could have been born into a high-ranking family and was given roles appropriate to his birth rank.&lt;ref name="Dasen127"&gt;Dasen, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Seneb also carried out religious rites in his dual role as a priest. He was titled "Priest of [[Wadjet]]", priest of "the large bull which is at the head of ''Sṯpt''" and of the bull ''Mrḥw''. He participated in the funeral services for the [[Pharaoh]]s [[Khufu]], the builder of the Great Pyramid, and his successor Djedefre (Radjedef).&lt;ref name="Dasen127" /&gt; His wife Senetites, a woman of normal stature, was likewise a priestess, serving the goddesses [[Hathor]] and [[Neith]].&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt;
[[File:False door of seneb.JPG|thumb|Seneb in a boat; scene from the false door of Seneb.]]
Seneb's tomb reliefs and the [[false door]] of his tomb indicate his wealth and power. Seneb is described as the owner of several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the [[Nile Delta]], or receiving his children.&lt;ref name="Atiya" /&gt; The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name.&lt;ref name="Dasen129"&gt;Dasen, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.&lt;ref name="Dasen130" /&gt;

As with the sculpture, Seneb's size required the creator of the reliefs to make some unusual artistic choices. The standard convention of depicting higher status through physical size was maintained by portraying Seneb as being larger than his retainers, although this was clearly the opposite of the situation that actually existed.&lt;ref name="Adelson141" /&gt; On the other hand, he is still shown with the physical characteristics of a dwarf. Unusually for such a relief, his wife is not pictured alongside him but appears separately. This may have been done to avoid the complications that would have arisen from needing to depict the couple's relative sizes realistically while still portraying Seneb as the larger party, as convention would have dictated. Seneb is also not shown carrying out typical male activities such as hunting, which was presumably impractical for someone of his stature, although one relief shows him pulling on papyrus reeds to guide his boat through the marshes of the Nile Delta.&lt;ref name="Dasen130" /&gt;

'''Ganga and Jamuna Mondal''' (born Ayara and Jayara Ratun, 1969 or 1970), known professionally as '''The Spider Girls''' and '''The Spider Sisters''', are [[conjoined twins]] from a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family in [[Basirhat]], [[West Bengal]], India.&lt;ref name="navhindtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navhindtimes.in/planet-j/spider-girls |title=Spider girls &amp;#124; iGoa |publisher=Navhindtimes.in |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
They work at the travelling "Dreamland Circus" in India.&lt;ref name=Morningstarr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/10/26/spider-sisters/#axzz2Fc5UGGXS |title=Spider Sisters &amp;#124; The Morningstarr* |publisher=|date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their "act" consists of them sitting on a [[charpoy]] in a tent, with paying spectators allowed entry to view and converse with them. In 2009, they were reported to have earned [[GBP]]26 for five hours a night. They are married to a single man named Gadadhar, a carnival worker.&lt;ref name="navhindtimes1"/&gt;

==Anatomy==
The twins are joined at the abdomen and pelvis, have four arms, and three legs, two of which are fused into a single, nine-toed limb, which remains concealed behind their body. They share a stomach,&lt;ref name="twinstuff1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twinstuff.com/conj-1950.htm |title=Twinstuff Conjoined Twins Timeline, 1950-1969 |publisher=Twinstuff.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have two hearts, two kidneys, one liver,&lt;ref name="twinstuff1"/&gt; and one reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="navhindtimes1"/&gt; 

The twins have been examined by doctors to determine whether or not they can be separated. However, they have no plans to do so because they feel it would be against God's will, carry too great a medical risk,&lt;ref name="navhindtimes1"/&gt; and would rob them of their employment. They have stated ''"We are happy as we are. The family will starve if we are separated."''&lt;ref name="express1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/117686/Circus-twins-refuse-to-be-parted |title=Circus twins refuse to be parted &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; Express.co.uk - Home of the Daily and Sunday Express |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
The twins were born Ayara and Jayara Ratun, but their parents changed their names at the age of five to honour the [[Ganga]] and [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] rivers.&lt;ref name="express1"/&gt;

Although they both have separate ration cards, they share the same plate at meals. They each vote separately in elections, but when attempting to open a joint bank account, were refused.&lt;ref name="navhindtimes1"/&gt;

==Daughter==
In 1993, they gave birth to a daughter by [[Caesarean section]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elizabeth J. Anderson |url=http://www.phreeque.com/jandal_sisters.html |title='+windowtitle+' |publisher=Phreeque.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she died hours after being born.&lt;ref name=Morningstarr/&gt;

'''The Yes Men''' are a [[culture jamming]] activist duo and network of supporters created by [[Jacques Servin]] and [[Igor Vamos]].&lt;ref name="chron.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Douglas |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/6983925.html |title=The Yes Men infiltrate DiverseWorks |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through actions of [[tactical media]],{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} the Yes Men primarily aim to raise awareness about problematic social and political issues. To date, the duo have produced three films: ''[[The Yes Men (film)|The Yes Men]]'' (2003), ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'' (2009)&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; and ''[[The Yes Men Are Revolting]]'' (2014). In these films, they impersonate entities that they dislike, a practice that they call "identity correction". The Yes Men operate under the mission statement that lies can expose truth. They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof, which have led to numerous interview, conference, and TV talk show invitations.  They espouse the belief that [[corporation]]s and governmental organizations often act in [[dehumanizing]] ways toward the public. Elaborate props are sometimes part of the ruse (e.g. [[The Yes Men#New York Post and SurvivaBall|Survivaball]]), as shown in their 2003 DVD release ''The Yes Men''. The Yes Men have collaborated with other groups of similar interest, including [[Improv Everywhere]], Andrew Boyd and [[Steve Lambert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/ |title=The Yes Men |publisher=The Yes Men |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to Servin, the Yes Men concept initially sprang from their creation of a fake website spoofing the [[World Trade Organization]]. To the surprise of Servin and Vamos, many believed the site to be authentic, and the two were consequently contacted to speak at a conference in Austria. Since this time, the Yes Men have continued performing large-scale hoaxes, in what they describe as a collaborative effort with journalists to help the media tell stories which they believe are important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fay3RNXI8 |title=The Yes Men Fix the World's Andy Bichlbaum on How The Yes Men Got Started |publisher=YouTube |date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yes Men often deploy a satirical approach: they pose as a powerful entity (typically a corporate or government representative or executive) and make ridiculous and shocking comments that caricature the ideological position of the organisation or person. Furthermore, they acknowledge the idea that many corporate or government entities manipulate their ideology using [[Spin (public relations)|spin]]; in response, the Yes Men use this power of spin to their own advantage, and use media outlets to disseminate their personal interpretation of the situation. A sense of humor and shock value is usually employed to make these issues more palatable to the general public and to call greater media attention to stories of interest.&lt;ref name="chron.com"/&gt; Some of these outrageous ideas include the prospect of selling one's vote or a proposition that the poor should consume recycled human waste. On most occasions, little to no shock or outrage is publicly evoked in response to their prank.

On occasion, the Yes Men's phony spokesperson will make announcements that represent fictitious scenarios for the [[anti-globalization movement]] or opponents of [[corporate crime]]. This has often resulted in false news reports, such as those covering the demise of the [[World Trade Organization]], or [[Dow Chemical]] paying compensation to the victims of the [[Bhopal disaster]].

The Yes Men have posed as spokespeople for the WTO, [[McDonald's]], Dow Chemical, and the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]. The two leading members of the Yes Men are known by a number of aliases, most recently, and in film, [[Andy Bichlbaum]] and [[Mike Bonanno]] ([[Jacques Servin]]&lt;ref name="simcopter"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-12-08/news/18024496_1_simcopter-helicopter-simulation-game-maxis | title=PIXEL GAIETY COSTS JOB | publisher=[[Daily News (New York)]] | date=1996-12-08 | accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Igor Vamos]], respectively). Servin is an author of experimental fiction, and was known for being the man who inserted images of men kissing in the computer game ''[[SimCopter]]''. Vamos is an associate professor of media arts at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], New York. They are assisted by numerous people across the globe. There are other full-time members, such as Whitney Black and Rocco Ferrer, who take a more behind-the-scenes approach.

Their experiences were documented in the film ''The Yes Men'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379593/ The Yes Men (2003)] IMDB.com&lt;/ref&gt; distributed by United Artists, the film documentary ''[[info wars]]'', and the book ''[[The Yes Men: The True Story of the End of the World Trade Organization]]'' ({{ISBN|0-9729529-9-3}}). Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno also directed a [[2009 in film|2009]] film entitled ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'', which premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theyesmenfixtheworld.com/index.htm |title=NOW AVAILABLE ON DVD - THE YES MEN FIX THE WORLD - The new movie that exposes the world of big business and the outrageous pranks that highlight the ways that corporate greed is destroying the planet.

Their third film, ''[[The Yes Men Are Revolting]]'', premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]].

== Projects ==

=== George W. Bush ===
One of the Yes Men's first pranks was the satirical website www.gwbush.com, established for the [[2000 US presidential election]] to draw attention to alleged hypocrisies on Bush's actual website. When asked about the site in a press conference on May 21, 1999, Bush responded that the website had gone too far in criticizing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-11/29/002r-112999-idx.html |title=Satirical Web Site Poses Political Test |first=Terry M. |last=Neal |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rtmark.com/more/articles/bushdallas0522bush1bushsite.htm | title=Bush criticizes Web site as malicious | publisher=The Dallas Morning News | date=May 22, 1999 | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | last=Slater | first=Wayne | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911165539/http://www.rtmark.com/more/articles/bushdallas0522bush1bushsite.htm | archivedate=September 11, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyesmen.org/hijinks/bush/ |title=The Yes Men: Bush |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69TEbgvxn?url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/bush |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Yes Men went on tour posing as the group "Yes, Bush Can!" and encouraged supporters to sign a "Patriot Pledge" agreeing to keep [[nuclear waste]] in their back yards and send their children off to war. They appeared at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] and drove across the country at first in an RV with a George W. Bush body wrap, and then in a painted van.

==== Ice Age Petition ====
The Yes Men posed as working as part of the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|Bush-Cheney campaign]]. They carried around a petition asking for signatures to support [[global warming]] because America's competing countries will suffer while America only bears minor side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Yes Men on Ice Age Petition |publisher=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_kqsuOxKFY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dow Chemical ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dow apologizes.jpg|left|thumb|Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the Yes Men, appears on [[BBC World]] to take full responsibility for the [[Bhopal disaster]].]] --&gt;

On December 3, 2004, the twentieth anniversary of the [[Bhopal disaster]], Andy Bichlbaum appeared on [[BBC World]] as "Jude Finisterra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="The Yes Men Fix the World": In New Film, Anti-Corporate Pranksters the Yes Men Continue to Jolt Polluters and Profiteers|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/23/yes_men|accessdate=2010-12-04|newspaper=Democracy Now!|date=July 23, 2009|first=Mike |last=Bonanno|first2=Andy |last2=Bichlbaum|first3=Juan |last3=Gonzalez|quote= ANDY BICHLBAUM: Well, Jude is the patron saint of the impossible, and there’s absolutely no way a company like Dow will ever do the right thing in Bhopal, unless we force it. And Finisterra, of course, end of the world, end of the earth. It’s just never going to happen. }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiWlvBro9eI |title=YouTube: Bhopal Disaster - BBC - The Yes Men |publisher=BBC World News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dow is the owner of [[Union Carbide]], the company responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India on December 3, 1984. An estimated 3,800 people died immediately from the hazardous chemicals and thousands more were killed by the plume from the UCC plant during the next few days.&lt;ref name="Fortun"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortun |first=K |title=Advocacy after Bhopal |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government reported that more than half a million people were exposed to the gas, leading to numerous early and late health defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassells |first=J |title=Sovereign immunity: Law in an unequal world |journal=Social and legal studies |year=1996 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=431–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhopal Disaster became one of the worst chemical disasters in history and the name Bhopal became synonymous with industrial catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacKenzie |first=D |title=Fresh evidence on Bhopal disaster |journal=New Scientist |year=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the disaster, UCC began attempts to dissociate itself from responsibility for the gas leak.&lt;ref name="Fortun"/&gt; The Indian Supreme Court eventually mediated a settlement in which UCC accepted moral responsibility and agreed to pay $470 million to the Indian government to be distributed to claimants as a full and final settlement. The average amount to families of the dead was $2,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumar |first=S |title=Victims of gas leak in Bhopal seek redress on compensation |journal=BMJ |year=2004 |volume=329 |issue=7462 |page=366 |doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7462.366-b |pmid=15310593 |pmc=509368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On their fake Dow Chemical website, the Yes Men said that Dow Chemical Company had no intention whatsoever of repairing the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dow Ethics website |url=http://www.dowethics.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real company received considerable backlash, and both the real Dow and the phony Dow denied the statements, but Dow took no real action.

The Yes Men decided to pressure Dow further, so as "Finisterra," Bichlbaum went on the news to claim that Dow planned to liquidate Union Carbide and use the resulting $12 billion to pay for medical care, clean up the site, and fund research into the hazards of other Dow products. After two hours of wide coverage, Dow issued a press release denying the statement, ensuring even greater coverage of the phony news of a cleanup. In Frankfurt, Dow's share price fell 4.24 percent in 23 minutes, wiping $2 billion off its market value. The shares rebounded in Frankfurt after the BBC issued an on-air correction and apology. In New York, Dow Chemical's stock were little changed because of the early trading.&lt;ref name="CNNWorld"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-12-03/world/bhopal.hoax_1_dow-chemical-dow-stock-bhopal?_s=PM:WORLD | title=Bhopal hoax sends Dow stock down | work=CNN.com | date=December 3, 2004 | accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the original interview was revealed as a hoax, Bichlbaum appeared in a follow-up interview on the United Kingdom's Channel 4 news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelgum.com/4024557/yes-men-the-legendary-bbc-bhopal-hoax.html |title=Yes Men: The legendary BBC Bhopal Hoax |publisher=Babelgum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607150127/http://www.babelgum.com/4024557/yes-men-the-legendary-bbc-bhopal-hoax.html |archivedate=2010-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the interview he was asked if he had considered the emotions and reaction of the people of Bhopal when producing the hoax. According to the interviewer, "there were many people in tears" upon having learned of the hoax. Bichlbaum said that, in comparison, what distress he had caused the people was minimal to that for which Dow was responsible. The Yes Men claim on their website that they have been told by contacts in Bhopal that once they had got over their disappointment that it wasn't real, they were pleased about the stunt and thought it had helped to raise awareness of their plight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyesmen.org/faq#falsehopes |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=The Yes Men |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[International Payments Conference]] on April 28, 2005, 'Dow representative' "Erastus Hamm" unveiled Acceptable Risk, the Acceptable Risk Calculator, and the Acceptable Risk mascot — a life-sized golden skeleton named Gilda — to an audience of about 70 banking professionals.

In February 2012, it was widely reported in the [[2012 Stratfor email leak]] that Dow Chemical Company hired private intelligence firm [[Stratfor]] to monitor the Yes Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Stratfor-was-Dows-Bhopal-spy-WikiLeaks/articleshow/12062587.cms |title=Stratfor was Dow’s Bhopal spy: WikiLeaks |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=February 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WTO ===
One of the Yes Men's most famous pranks is placing a "corrected" [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] website at http://www.gatt.org/ ([[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]). The fake site began to receive real emails from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite groups on behalf of the WTO, to which they responded as if they were the actual WTO. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Appearing in newly purchased suits, the Yes Men gave speeches encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from citizens. They argued that the US Civil War was a waste of money because Third World countries now willingly supply equivalent slaves. They also urged people to listen to the WTO instead of the facts.  They then unveiled a gold spandex body suit that they claimed would allow productivity to increase, as managers would not have to oversee workers in person but could keep track of them via images on an attached screen as well as implanted sensors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== New Orleans and HUD ===
{{Wikinews|HUD hoaxer calls attention to lack of affordable housing}}
The Yes Men appeared on August 28, 2006 at a "Housing Summit" in New Orleans, taking the stage along with New Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] and Louisiana Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]]. Before an audience composed mostly of real estate developers, one of the Yes Men gave a speech in which he claimed to be Rene Oswin, a fictitious "assistant under-secretary" at the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).  In his speech he claimed that HUD would reopen public housing facilities that had been closed since [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck in August 2005.  He announced this false claim because HUD had recently decided to only rebuild a third of the subsidized housing stock after hurricane Katrina, and made plans to demolish four of New Orleans’ ten public housing developments, leaving thousands of New Orleans residents without homes. This decision was contested locally, nationally, and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luft |first=Rachel E. |title=Looking For Common Ground: Relief Work In Post-Katrina New Orleans As An American Parable Of Race And Gender Violence |journal=NWSA Journal |volume=20 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=5–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, the Yes Men proclaimed that HUD had changed its mind about tearing down the undamaged housing units, and would not tear down the housing projects, as they had planned to do in order to replace them with mixed-income developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Oops: Impostor scams Louisiana officials |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/28/hud.hoax/index.html |date=2006-08-28 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HUD has called this prank, which brought attention to the lack of affordable housing,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} a "cruel hoax." A former resident of the community was quoted by Bichlbaum as saying, "do whatever's most effective, do it, don't worry about how it affects us," however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/08/29/yes_men |title=The HUD Hoax |first=Alex |last=Koppelman |publisher=Salon |date=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUD spokeswoman Donna White said no one named "Rene Oswin" works for the department. White commented, "I'm like, who the heck is that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2006/08/fake_hud_official_punkd_louisi.php | title=Fake HUD Official Punk'd Louisiana Pols | work=TPM Muckraker | date=August 28, 2006 | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | last=Rood | first=Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictitious Oswin also announced that the big oil companies would contribute some of their record profits to rebuild the wetlands destroyed by the construction of oil tanker canals to prevent the city from being inundated by future hurricanes.

=== ExxonMobil ===
[[Image:The Yes Men.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Bichlbaum]] and [[Mike Bonanno]] pose as [[ExxonMobil]] executives.]]
On June 14, 2007, the Yes Men acted during [[Canada]]'s largest oil conference in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], posing as [[ExxonMobil]] and [[National Petroleum Council (US)|National Petroleum Council]] (NPC) representatives. In front of more than 300 oilmen, the NPC was expected to deliver the long-awaited conclusions of a study commissioned by [[United States Secretary of Energy|U.S. Energy Secretary]] [[Samuel Bodman]]. The NPC is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO [[Lee Raymond]], who is also the chair of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's At Stake? Don't Let Exxon Decide Our Energy future! |url=http://ga3.org/campaign/lee_raymond/explanation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102073241/http://ga3.org/campaign/lee_raymond/explanation |archivedate=2006-11-02 |publisher=The Exxpose Exxon campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Yes Men arrived at the conference they said that [[Lee Raymond]] (the promised speaker) was unable to make it due to a pressing situation with the president. The Yes Men then went on to give a presentation in place of Lee Raymond.

In the actual speech, the "NPC rep" announced that current U.S. and Canadian energy policies (notably the massive, carbon-intensive processing of [[Alberta's oil sands]], and the development of [[liquid coal]]) are increasing the chances of huge global calamities. But he reassured the audience that in the worst-case scenario, the oil industry could "keep fuel flowing" by transforming the billions of people who would die into oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0706/S00281.htm |title=Exxon Proposes Burning Humanity for Fuel |publisher=The Yes Men |date=June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project, called '''Vivoleum''', would work in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production. The oilmen listened to the lecture with attention, and then lit "commemorative candles". At this point, event security recognized the Yes Men and forced them off stage, and the 'punchline' — that the candles were made of Vivoleum obtained from the flesh of an "Exxon janitor" who died as a result of cleaning up a toxic spill — was not delivered to the audience, but only to reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070615.RTICKERMN15/TPStory/ |title=Pranksters disrupt oil patch conference |first=Norvall |last=Scott |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=June 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822190312/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070615.RTICKERMN15/TPStory/ |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milton Friedman documentary ===
In July 2007, in order to obtain interviews with right wing think tanks, the Yes Men pretended to be filming a documentary about [[Milton Friedman]]. (In fact, their documentary, ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]'', did end up speaking about Friedman at length.) After interviewing members of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], several of whom appear in the film, the Yes Men were foiled at the [[Cato Institute]] by libertarian activists [[Bureaucrash]], one of whose members had been hanging around the Competitive Enterprise Institute two days before and recognized the duo. On their way out, Bureaucrash members threw colored powder at the Yes Men in a reference to the rainbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pranks.com/2007/07/14/cato-institute-kos-yes-men-attempt/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023215659/http://pranks.com/2007/07/14/cato-institute-kos-yes-men-attempt/|archivedate=October 23, 2007|title=Just Say No to the Yes Men|date=July 13, 2007|first=Richard |last=Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BP ===
On March 10, 2008, the Yes Men responded to a letter from [[BP]] (merged from British Petroleum and [[Amoco]]) accusing them of [[copyright violation]], with a letter apologizing for having forgotten BP with the spoof site half-completed and that "BP does every bit as much damage to this planet as does Exxon, [[Halliburton]], or any other more obviously nefarious company" and deserves its own properly completed spoof site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/agribusiness/beyondpetrol/|title=Apology to BP|last=Bichlbaum|first=Andy|date=March 10, 2008|publisher=The Yes Men|accessdate=June 8, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608114230/http://theyesmen.org/agribusiness/beyondpetrol/|archivedate=June 8, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captain Euro ===
In 1999, the Yes Men visited the offices of [[Corporate Vision Strategists|Twelve Star Communications]], creators of the [[Europhile|Eurofederalist]] superhero [[Captain Euro]], "a comic book character designed to promote European unification with young children." Inside, the impostors discover the hidden, dark truth about European Unification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/euro|title=Making Europe Fun and Interesting|year=2000|accessdate=April 22, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324195156/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/euro|archivedate=March 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''New York Times'' ===
The Yes Men (along with the Anti-Advertising Agency) also claimed partial responsibility for a prank on November 12, 2008, where approximately 80,000 copies of a fake edition of the July 4, 2009 edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' were handed out on the streets of New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Lambert |url=http://fillip.ca/content/best-case-scenario |title=Fillip / Best Case Scenario |publisher=Fillip.ca |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobnik |first=Verena |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-11-12-new-york-times_N.htm |title='New York Times' spoof circulated |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fake edition shows their ideas for a better future with headlines such as ''Iraq War Ends'' and ''Nation Sets Its Sights on Building Sane Economy''. The front page contained a spoofed motto, "All the News We Hope to Print" from the famous phrase "All the news that's fit to print".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Pilkington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/12/new-york-times-spoof |title=New York Times 'special edition' spoof perplexes readers |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in the paper announce dozens of new initiatives, including an establishment of national health care, a [[maximum wage]] for C.E.O.s and an article wherein [[George W.

[[Alex Jones (journalist)|Alex S. Jones]], a former ''Times'' reporter and media scholar, said of the paper, "I would say if you’ve got one, hold on to it...it will probably be a collector’s item. I’m just glad someone thinks ''The New York Times'' print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax. A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier. But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations? That takes a lot of effort."&lt;ref name="sewell"/&gt;

=== ''New York Post'' and SurvivaBall ===
On September 21, 2009, one day before a UN summit lead-up to the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]], over 2,000 volunteers distributed throughout New York City a 32-page "special edition" ''[[New York Post]]'', blaring headlines (cover story "We're Screwed") that the city could face deadly heat waves, extreme flooding, and other lethal effects of global warming within the next few decades. The paper had been created by the Yes Men and a coalition of activists as a wake-up call to action on climate change.  Other articles describe the Pentagon's alarmed response to [[global warming]], the U.S. government's minuscule response, China's advanced alternative energy program, and how the [[COP15]] in Copenhagen could be a "Flopenhagen".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6676567 "SPECIAL EDITION" NEW YORK POST] by the Yes Men&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a fake website.&lt;ref&gt;http://nypost-se.com/ "WE'RE SCREWED" climate change special edition New York Post online edition September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A "climate change horoscope" satire on the Sally Brompton horoscope in the Post was commissioned from an environmental activist horoscope writer but was not published.

On September 22, 2009 the Yes Men demonstrated on the alleged behalf of [[Halliburton]] and dozens of other climate threatening corporations an inflatable ball-shaped costume known as the SurvivaBall, claiming it was a self-contained living system for surviving disasters caused by global warming. Over two dozen people wore the SurvivaBall costumes as it was demonstrated in the East River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babelgum.com/4005324/balls-across-america.html |title=Balls Across America |publisher=Babelgum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811210656/http://www.babelgum.com/4005324/balls-across-america.html |archivedate=2010-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police shut down the demonstration for lack of a permit. Co-founder of the Yes Men, Andy Bichlbaum, was arrested on an outstanding parking ticket charge and a handful of other Yes Men were served with summons and tickets for disorderly behavior and creating hazardous conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The SurvivaBall was also used in a protest at the steps of the capitol. The protesting balls demanded action be taken on global warming to achieve the [[350.org]] goal. Their strategy was to block the entrance until the government comes to a binding agreement on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/survivaball Survivaball] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324234513/http://theyesmen.org/hijinks/survivaball |date=2013-03-24 }} from TheYesMen.org, retrieved 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Chamber of Commerce ===
On October 19, 2009, the Yes Men spoofed the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], declaring a U-turn on their climate change policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/19/chamber-commerce-climate-hoax|title=US Chamber of Commerce falls victim to 'fraud' over climate hoax|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne |date=19 October 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-10-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYGcIhNGSIY |title=Will the real chamber of Commerce please stand up? |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yes Men were not able to complete the conference without being exposed as a hoax, although their message that the United States Chamber of Commerce needs to reevaluate their direction in terms of clean energy was their primary concern and was received. Major TV and news organisations carried this story briefly before the hoax was uncovered. The US Chamber of Commerce two weeks later did change their official policy though, according to [[Al Gore]] it was "not because of" the Yes Men's stunt. The Chamber launched a trademark and copyright infringement lawsuit against The Yes Men, who were defended by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The suit was dropped in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grist.org/news/yes-men-prank-the-chamber-of-commerce-and-get-away-with-it | publisher=Grist | title=Yes Men prank the Chamber of Commerce — and get away with it|last=Upton|first=John|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/202401/chamber-of-commerce-drops-lawsuit-against-parodist.html |publisher=Online Media Daily| title=Chamber Of Commerce Drops Lawsuit Against Parodists|last=Davis|first=Wendy|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This action appears in their film, ''The Yes Men Are Revolting''.

=== Canadian environment minister ===
During the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Copenhagen]], the Yes Men put out a statement in which they purported to be the Canadian environment minister, [[Jim Prentice]]. The statement pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2020. The statement was followed by a response from the Ugandan delegation, praising the statement, that was also faked. Another fake statement was then put out blasting the falsehoods of the original fake statement. A fake story in a European edition of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' was also posted online. Jim Prentice described the hoax as "undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/dec/14/environment-canada-spoof|title=Copenhagen spoof shames Canada on the truth about its emissions|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne |date=December 14, 2009 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=December 14, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babelgum.com/4021000/yes-men-canada-takes-stand-climate-change-not.html|title=Yes Men: Canada Takes Stand on Climate Change.

=== Niger Delta Hoax ===
On March 28, 2010, a video was released on [[YouTube]] with the title "Shell: We are sorry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zciWUOrIUqo|title=Shell: We are sorry|date=28 March 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A man called Bradford Houppe, from the Ethical Affairs Committee at [[Royal Dutch Shell]] gave a four-minute-long apology to the people of the [[Niger Delta]] for ruining their land, water, and communities.
This video was created in response to the numerous environmental problems and human rights violations that have occurred in the Niger Delta region of [[Nigeria]] since Shell began oil exploration in the region decades ago. Shell has yet to make any official statement about this video.

=== GE Tax Refund Hoax reported by the AP ===

On April 13, 2011, a hoax website with a [[URL]] similar to that of the [[GE]] press domain (genewscenter.com) designed to look like the GE news center website. The hoax site posted the claim "GE Responds to Public Outcry – Will Donate Entire $3.2 Billion Tax Refund to Help Offset Cuts and Save American Jobs." and it seems that the [[Associated Press|AP]] reported the story as fact, as reported by [[Good (magazine)|''Good'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Shell Oil and ArcticReady.com ===

In June 2012, the Yes Men collaborated with [[Greenpeace]] and members of the [[Occupy Seattle]] movement to create ArcticReady.com, a parody website criticizing Shell Oil's drilling activities in the arctic circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== The Action Switchboard ===

The Action Switchboard is a platform the Yes Men launched to link up people who want to be involved in activism events with people organising them. As it says&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://actionswitchboard.net/about-action-switchboard|title=About the Action Switchboard|work=Action Switchboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Action Switchboard is a platform that helps activists find each other, come up with direct action ideas, and get the resources they need to pull them off."

=== Edward Snowden Politicon interview ===
In October 2015, at the annual [[Politicon]] non-partisan political convention, the Yes Men promoted an interview with whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]], known to be living in exile in Russia. As they introduced the interview, they announced that Snowden had been pardoned and would join the group - in person! As Snowden appeared before them, people cheered, applauded and many rushed the stage for photos. A short time later, another Edward Snowden appeared on the giant screen - the real Edward Snowden… from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/12/inside-the-comiccon-for-politics/|title=Inside the ‘ComicCon for Politics’|last=Weigel|first=Dave|date=2015-10-12|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politicon: new DNC platform ===
In July 2017, The Yes Men pranked the Democratic Party at Politicon. Following up the "Better Deal" agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-offer-up-a-better-deal_us_5976906ce4b0c6616f7ce4ae|title=Democrats Offer Up 'A Better Deal'|last=Weigant|first=Chris|date=2017-07-25|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; released by the party a week earlier, prankster Andy Bichlbaum posed as Frank Spencer, Deputy Vice Chair for Civic Engagement of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC). As part of the new #DNCTakeBack campaign, Spencer pushed a more ambitious and progressive Democratic agenda, including: Medicare for all, tuition-free college, public campaign financing, stronger unions, an end to corporate lobbying and the end of for-profit prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Yes-Men-blend-laughs-progressive-activism-12195329.php|title=Yes Men blend laughs, progressive activism|date=2017-09-13|work=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2017/08/01/activists-call-dncs-bluff-dnctakeback|title=Activists Call DNC's Bluff With #DNCTAKEBACK|website=Common Dreams|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== VW/Dieselgate apology ===
In November 2018, Motherboard/Vice released a video about The Yes Men and their fake VW "Emissions Anonymous" project. In the prank, they apologize to the public for the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|Dieselgate emissions scandal]], in which several models and years of VW car family diesel autos were engineered and built with a rigged emissions system that ran clean only while under test conditions, but otherwise released high levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Motherboard|title=Faking Volkswagen's Dieselgate Apology with the Yes Men|date=2018-11-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-7631xaJQ|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Houston Chronicle even covered the pranksters' April 2018 entry in Houston's annual [[Houston Art Car Parade|Art Car Parade]] as if an official VW PR campaign: "The marketing department has even turned the crisis into a publicity shtick".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/columnists/tomlinson/article/Response-to-VW-diesel-emissions-scandal-will-12888576.php|title=Response to VW diesel emissions scandal will define former CEO|date=2018-05-07|work=HoustonChronicle.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">'''Thomas J. Mahon''' (March 1882 &amp;ndash; September 24, 1927) was an American politician and jurist.

Born in the town of [[Liberty, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Liberty]], [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin]], Mahon suffered from [[poliomyelitis]] during childhood. He went to public school in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Mahon then received his bachelor's degree from what was then the  [[University of Wisconsin]] and his law degree from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]. Mahon then practiced law in [[Eland, Wisconsin|Eland]], [[Shawano County, Wisconsin]]. While practicing law in Eland, Wisconsin, Mahon served in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] and was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].

After being released by Reading, Hateley featured in a pre-season friendly for Basingstoke against [[Carshalton Athletic F.C.|Carshalton Athletic]]. He went on trial at [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] before being offered a trial with [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]]. Manager [[Jim Gannon]] offered the youngster a twelve-month deal with the option of a further year. He joined Motherwell on 13 August 2009, on a one-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8200812.stm "Well deal-in midfielder Hateley"] [[BBC Sport]]. 13 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Set to start on the bench against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], Hateley made his league debut unexpectedly as a late replacement for [[Paul Slane]] in a 2–2 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8200795.stm|title=St Johnstone 2–2 Motherwell|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hateley became an integral part of the Motherwell midfield during the 2009–10 season, offering additional defensive cover when required. He scored his first Motherwell goal with a free-kick against his father's former club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8505966.stm|title=Motherwell 1–1 Rangers|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Hateley said scoring against Rangers was the best goal of his career and that his dad even congratulated him.&lt;ref name=GoalBestCareer/&gt; At the end of the season, he signed a new three-year contract, running until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/8731195.stm|title=Tom Hateley signs new three-year Motherwell contract
|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010–11 season, Hateley made his European debut, in the first round; first leg of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] campaign, in a 1–0 win over [[Breiðablik UBK|Breiðablik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Motherwell 1 – 0 Breidablik|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8822386.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in the second leg, Hateley provided an assist for [[Jamie Murphy (footballer, born 1989)|Jamie Murphy]] to send the club through to the next round. In the first leg of the Play-off round, Hateley scored his first European goal, in a 2–1 loss against Danish side [[Odense Boldklub|OB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odense BK 2–1 Motherwell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8925896.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring his first European goal, Hateley described it as a "perfect moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hateley: My goal has given Motherwell a slight advantage over Odense|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/hateley-my-goal-has-given-motherwell-a-slight-1067668|publisher=Daily Record|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the second leg, Motherwell would be eliminated after losing 1–0. Later in the season, Hateley would score twice in the league, against [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. Hateley was also in the starting up for the [[2011 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]] against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], but Motherwell lost 3–0. After the match, he said the match had left him lost for words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish Cup Final: Late sucker pucnhes leave Motherwell ace Hateley sick|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/scottish-cup-final-late-sucker-1103700|publisher=Daily Record|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the 2010–11 season, Hateley had scored three goals in fifty-three appearances.

In the 2011–12 season, Hateley scored four goals in all competitions in forty-three appearances. In the 2012–13 season, Hateley made his Champions League debut, in a 3–0 loss against Greek side [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]. Hateley played in both-legs for the Champions League match. With his contract running out, Hateley said that he would consider staying at the club, saying that the prospect of the club qualifying for European football again could be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My ticket to Europe|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/spl/article4861297.ece|publisher=The Scottish Sun|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Motherwell qualified for the Europa League; however, Hateley was soon linked with a move to English side [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poles fight for Henrik|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/4957612/Lech-Poznan-and-Legia-Warsaw-fight-for-Henrik-Ojamaa.html|publisher=The Scottish Sun|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract talks with Motherwell soon broke down as he continued to be linked with many European clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Hateley has warned Motherwell his son Tom is wanted by English clubs as club stall on new deal for out-of-contract star|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mark-hateley-warned-motherwell-son-1956283|publisher=Daily Record|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2013, Hateley left Motherwell after informing manager [[Stuart McCall]] that he would not return for pre-season training. This would end his four-year association with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23082470|title=Michael Higdon &amp; Tom Hateley leave Motherwell|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer transfer window, Hateley was linked a move back to Motherwell, something that was denied by McCall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transfer deadline: Stuart McCall shocked at date difference|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23905100|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 August 2013|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Untersberg''' is the northernmost [[massif]] of the [[Berchtesgaden Alps]], a prominent spur straddling the border between [[Berchtesgaden]], [[Germany]] and [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. The highest peak of the [[Table (landform)|table-top]] mountain is the [[Berchtesgadener Hochthron|Berchtesgaden Hochthron]] at {{convert|1973|m|ft}}. 

==Geography==
The Untersberg rises at the rim of the [[Northern Limestone Alps]], immediately at the Salzburg Basin and the broad [[Salzach]] Valley. Neighbouring peaks are the [[Hoher Göll]] in the southeast and Mt. [[Watzmann]] in the south, beyond the Berchtesgaden Basin. In the northwest, the [[Saalach]] Valley with [[Bad Reichenhall]] separates it from the [[Hochstaufen]] massif of the [[Chiemgau Alps]]. About two-thirds of the area, including the Berchtesgaden Hochthron peak, is located in Germany, while the northernmost steep edge above Salzburg belongs to Austria.

The mountain is a landmark popular with tourists, due to its proximity to the City of Salzburg: less than {{convert|16|km|mi}} south of the city centre and within easy reach, e.g. by bus lines running to the southern suburbs of [[Grödig]] and [[Großgmain]]. 

Several trails lead to the top, though most people prefer the ''Untersbergbahn'' [[Aerial tramway|cable car]]. Constructed over a period of over two years, and opening in April 1961, the eight and a half minute journey lifts passengers from the lower terminus at the village of Sankt Leonhard at {{convert|456|m|ft|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1320|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the top station on the Geiereck spur at an altitude of {{convert|1776|m|ft|abbr=on}}, transporting them a horizontal distance of almost {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} with a maximum height above the ground of {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The first recorded ascent was in the first half of the 12th century, by Eberwein, a member of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monastery at Berchtesgaden.

==Geology==
The Untersberg massif is mainly made up of [[limestone]], a [[Bed (geology)|bed]] of [[Hoher Dachstein|Dachstein]] chalk—mined as "Untersberg [[marble]]"—on a [[dolostone]] basis, and of small deposits of [[bauxite]]. Untersberg marble also forms the facade of notable buildings such as [[Salzburg Cathedral]].

The [[Karst]] topography of the limestone includes numerous caves. So far, more than 400 have been explored—including the [[Marktschellenberg|Schellenberg]] [[ice cave]] at an elevation of {{convert|1570|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a [[show cave]] since 1925, and the [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|Kolowrat]] Cave with  a {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} high dome. The [[Riesending cave]] with a depth of {{convert|1148|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a length of {{convert|19.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} is the largest known in Germany. There also is a lake at {{convert|930|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth. An expedition in August 2008 revealed that its lowest point had not yet been reached.

==Legend==
[[File:Barberousse.Untersberg-XIXe siècle-14.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Girardet]] (1813 – 1871): ''Frédéric Barberousse dans la grotte de l'Untersberg'']]
First mentioned as ''Vndarnsperch'' ("[[Noon mark|Noon]] Mountain") in a 1306 deed issued by the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg archbishops]], the prominent spur has been the subject of numerous myths and legends. According to a popular [[king in the mountain]] tale, Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] is asleep inside Mt. Untersberg until his resurrection. His beard is said to be growing longer and longer around a round table and to have grown round two times. Myth says that when the beard has grown three times around the table the end of the world has come. When Frederick leaves the mountain, there will be no further [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the last great battle of humankind will be fought at the pear tree on the Walserfeld, a pasture near [[Wals-Siezenheim|Wals]], west of Salzburg. There is a similar legend for the [[Kyffhäuser]] Mountain in [[Thuringia]] and [[Trifels Castle]].

Other legends say that it is [[Charlemagne]] waiting inside the Untersberg,&lt;ref name="Speer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken care of by the ''Untersberger Mandln'', small dwarf-like creatures. Every hundred years he awakes and when he sees the ravens (actually [[Alpine chough|choughs]]) still flying around the Untersberg he sleeps for another century. Indeed, Charlemagne had held a [[synod]] at Salzburg in 803 AD, where he met with Bishop [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno]]. The [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Alpine tradition]] of the Untersberg [[Wild Hunt]] (''Perchten'') has recently been revived. There are also several legends about the cave system below the mountain.

== In popular culture ==
The landmark gained international fame as the "distinctive, lopsided peak" featured at the beginning and end of the 1965 movie ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'',&lt;ref name=Whitley2015&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/salzburg-and-the-sound-of-music-touring-von-trapp-country-10074648.html | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | last = Whitley | first = David | date = February 27, 2015 | title = Salzburg and The Sound of Music: Touring von Trapp country | accessdate = August 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the filming was done on the German side, not the Austrian side. It was where [[Julie Andrews]] sang ''The Hills Are Alive'' at the opening scene and where the family climbed the mountain on their escape to Switzerland at the end of the film.&lt;ref name=Whitley2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.panoramatours.com/en/salzburg/salzburg-highlights/sound-of-music/scenes-locations/untersberg/|website=Panorama Sound of Music Tour|publisher=Panorama Tours|accessdate=14 August 2015 |title=Scenes &amp; Locations: Untersberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain also lends its name to an 1829 opera, ''Der Untersberg,'' by [[Johann Nepomuk von Poißl]] (1783–1865).

==Marble ball mills==
{{details|topic=Untersberger marble ball mills in the German Wikipedia|:de:Untersberger Marmorkugelmühlen}}
[[File:Kugelmühle Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|Ball mills by [[Marktschellenberg]]]]
[[File:Untersberger Marmorkugelmühlen.webm|thumb|Video]]
The Untersberger marble ball mills are located in [[Marktschellenberg]] in [[Berchtesgaden]], at the opening of the Almbachklamm valley.

The ''Kügelmühlen'' (ball mills) were established in 1683. Once popular children's toys, these marbles were shipped all over the world. Through Rotterdam and London, marble shipping was directed toward the East and West Indies and exported at the rate of 60,000 to 80,000 (and sometimes as high as 100,000) pounds per year. Marbles were welcome as cargo in sailing ships, as they were suitable as ballast because of their high density. The last marbles went from Untersberg to London in 1921.

As late as the 1850s, the Almbach valley had 40 ball mills with another 90 in the surrounding region, worked mainly by poor mountain farmers. Today, a single ball mill operates primarily as a tourist attraction.

The ball mills were driven by the waters of the [[Almbach (Salzach)|Almbach]] river. The lower fixed grinding stones are made of hard sandstone and the upper turntables from beech wood. Grinding of the balls varies from two to eight days according to their size. After course grinding on the sandstone, the marble balls underwent sanding and a polish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13922">'''Uvavnuk''' was an [[Inuit|Inuk]] woman born in the 19th century, now considered an [[oral poetry|oral poet]]. The story of how she became an ''[[angakkuq]]'' ([[Medicine man|spiritual healer]]), and the song that came to her, were collected by European explorers of [[Arctic Canada]] in the early 1920s. Her shamanistic poem-song, best known as  "Earth and the Great Weather". has been anthologised many times.

==Background==
Uvavnuk's story was written down by the explorer [[Knud Rasmussen]], who grew up speaking [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], which is closely related to [[Inuktitut]].&lt;ref&gt;Malaurie, Jean (1982). ''The Last Kings of Thule: With the Polar Eskimos, as They Face Their Destiny'', trans. Adrienne Folk.&lt;/ref&gt; Her story was told by [[Aua (angakkuq)|Aua]], a cousin of her son Niviatsian, both of whom were also spiritual healers. Aua acted as an [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]] for Rasmussen, who was collecting cultural material such as folktales and songs. 

The two men met in February 1922, in the vicinity of [[Hoppner Inlet|Lyon Inlet]], north of [[Hudson Bay]]. Given this location, Uvavnuk has been considered an ''Iglulingmiut'', a person from [[Igloolik|Iglulik]]. Aua was then living in a settlement of 16 people, all related to him and thus to Uvavnuk.&lt;ref&gt;''The Intellectual Culture of the Copper Eskimos'' (1932), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasmussen's version of her story appears in ''The Intellectual Culture of the Copper Eskimos'' (1932), also translated from the Danish as ''The Intellectual Culture of the Iglulik Eskimos''. This is the ninth in his ten-volume ''The Fifth Thule Expedition 1921-1924''. So the story was spoken in Inuktitut, written down and eventually published in Danish, and quickly translated into English for the publication of the international edition of his ''[[magnum opus]]''.

Another version of Uvavnuk's story was written by one of Rasmussen's companions on the Fifth Thule Expedition, [[Peter Freuchen]]. In his 1961 ''Book of Eskimos'', after half a century living in the Arctic, Freuchen tells the meteor story slightly differently, calling it "grotesque in its mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on page 2 of ''Dark Visions: Personal Accounts of the Mysterious in Canada'' by John Robert Colombo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her transformation story==
Rasmussen entitled this story "Uvavnuk is struck by a ball of fire", which he thinks is a meteor. This is the only story about her in that volume of the Thule Report; what is given below is the first translation from the Danish, by W. Worster.

{{quote|Uvavnuk had gone outside the hut one winter evening to make water. It was particularly dark that evening, as the moon was not visible. Then suddenly there appeared a glowing ball of fire in the sky, and it came rushing down to earth straight towards her. She would have got up and fled, but before she could pull up her breeches, the ball of fire struck her and entered into her. At the same moment she perceived that all within her grew light, and she lost consciousness. But from that moment also she became a great shaman. She had never before concerned herself with the invocation of spirits, but now ''imiEru'jap inua'', the spirit of the meteor, had entered into her and made her a shaman. She saw the spirit just before she fainted. It had two kinds of bodies, that rushed all glowing through space; one side was a bear, the other was like a human being; the head was that of a human being with the tusks of a bear. 

Uvavnuk had fallen down and lost consciousness, but she got up again, and without knowing what she was doing, came running into the house; she came into the house singing:[...] there was nothing that was hidden from her now, and she began to reveal all the offences that had been committed by those in the house. Thus she purified them all. [...]

But there was this remarkable thing about Uvavnuk, that as soon as she came out of her trance, she no longer felt like a shaman; the light left her body and she was once more quite an ordinary person with no special powers. Only when the spirit of the meteor lit up the spirit light within her could she see and hear and know everything, and became at once a mighty magician. Shortly before her death she held a grand seance, and declared it was her wish that mankind should not suffer want, and she "manivai", i. e. brought forth from the interior of the earth all manner of game which she had obtained from Takånakapsåluk. This she declared, and after her death, the people of her village had a year of greater abundance in whale, walrus, seal and caribou than any had ever experienced before.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Knud|title=Intellectual culture of the Hudson Bay Eskimos|date=1930|publisher=Copenhagen : Gyldendal|page=123|url=https://archive.org/stream/intellectualcult00rasm/intellectualcult00rasm_djvu.txt|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interpretations of the story==
Uvavnuk's story has been described and interpreted in detail from several angles. In a 1989 essay, [[Rudy Wiebe]] uses the story as "a possible way to understanding, to developing an appreciation of Canada's Arctic.".&lt;ref&gt;''Playing Dead: A Contemplation concerning the Arctic'', 1989, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist and critic [[Robert Kroetsch]] builds off this in "An Arkeology of (My) Canadian Post-modern", using it to justify sweeping statements such as "The Arctic for Wiebe announces marginality on a grand scale, and marginality is the stuff of the Canadian experience." &lt;ref&gt;''International Postmodernism: Theory and literary practice'' 1997, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kroetsch claims that Wiebe sees Uvavnuk "not as an agent of transcendence or control but rather as a presence in the world".&lt;ref&gt;p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Saladin D'Anglure]], a Canadian anthropologist and ethnographer who speaks Inuktitut, used Uvavnuk's story in 1994 as an example of "a relationship between shamanism and the '[[third gender]]' among the Inuit".&lt;ref&gt;"From Foetus to Shaman" by Bernard Saladin D'Anglure, in  ''Amerindian Rebirth: Reincarnation Belief Among North American Indians and Inuit'' 1994 University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian cultural anthropologist Barbara Tedlock links Uvavnuk's bodily possession (i.e. the unconsciousness) with the resulting shamanic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tedlock|first1=Barbara|title=The woman in the shaman's body : reclaiming the feminine in religion and medicine|date=2006|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=9780553379716|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mysticism: Experience, Response, and Empowerment'' (1996) describes Uvavnuk's experience in terms of "telepathic sensitivity" helping her know the "thoughts and hidden actions of others".&lt;ref name=tws01&gt;{{cite book

==Her poem or song==
The words that Uvavnuk sang are known by several names: "The Great Sea", "The Song of Uvavnuk", "Earth and the Great Weather". There are an unknown number of versions in English, some via the Danish intermediary and some direct from Inuktitut, but poet [[John Robert Colombo]] says "The song's power is such that its spirit vaults the hurdles of translation with ease."&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Visions: Personal Accounts of the Mysterious in Canada'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasmussen's companion Freuchen, mentioned above, translates "the longest and most moving" version of the song, according to Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Visions: Personal Accounts of the Mysterious in Canada'', p. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In part:
:''The great sea moves me, sets me adrift.''
:''It moves me like algae on stones in running brook water.''
:''The vault of heaven moves me.''
:''Mighty weather storms through my soul.''
:''It carries me with it.''
:''Trembling with joy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=edited|last2=Freuchen|first2=with a pref. by Dagmar|title=Peter Freuchen's Book of the Eskimos|date=1983|publisher=Fawcett Premier|location=New York|isbn=9780449300381|page=278|edition=[1st Ballantine books ed.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A translation by Tegoodlejak appears in ''Canadian Eskimo Art'' (1970) by [[James Archibald Houston|James Houston]]. [[Tom Lowenstein]], a British poet who for many years lived in the village of [[Point Hope, Alaska]], translated and reprinted Uvavnuk's song in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Eskimo Poems from Canada and Greenland''. Translated by Tom Lowenstein, from material originally collected by Knud Rasmussen. [[Allison &amp; Busby]], University of Pittsburgh Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uvavnuk's poem has appeared in collections such as ''Northern Voices: Inuit Writing in English'' (1992), ''Women in praise of the sacred: forty-three centuries of spiritual poetry by women'' (edited by [[Jane Hirshfield]] in 1994) and ''The Enlightened Heart: An Anthology of Sacred Poetry'' (edited by [[Stephen Mitchell (translator)|Stephen Mitchell]] in 2009).&lt;ref name=twsSEP04&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Northern Voices'' (which, despite the subtitle, draws on [[oral poetry]] as well) was edited by literary scholar [[Penny Petrone]] as a pioneer work in the critical study of aboriginal literature in Canada.

The poem has been used as a touchstone in contexts as diverse as archaeology ("The distance between an archeologist's experience of the world and that of a particular Inuk's in the past is vast." &lt;ref&gt;Peter Whitridge in "Invented Paces: Environmental Imaginaries and the Inuit Colonisation of Labrador" in ''Settlement, Subsistence, and Change Among the Labrador Inuit: The Nunatsiavummiut Experience'' 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) and a mystery novel set in modern Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;Village of the Ghost Bears: A Nathan Active Mystery Set in Alaska By Stan Jones&lt;/ref&gt;  Susan Greenwood, author of ''[[Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld|Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld: An Anthropology]]'', calls the poem "well-known" when she draws on it to describe her understanding of the [[otherworld]]&lt;ref&gt;"Of Worms, Snakes and Dragons: Can Magic Lead to an Ecological Worldview?" in ''Pagan Visions for a Sustainable Future''&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombo begins ''Dark Visions: Personal Accounts of the Mysterious in Canada'' with Uvavnuk's song, citing it as an example of "the interrelation between poetic impression and spiritual expression".&lt;ref&gt;1992, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor educators have used the poem to link nature and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction in Katheleen Osgood Dana in ''Nature First: Outdoor Life the Friluftsliv Way''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio adaptations==
Uvavnuk's song, in the original [[Inuktitut]], was incorporated into work by American composer [[John Luther Adams]], ''Earth and the Great Weather'' (1995), using her phrase as his title.

Another musical adaptation was in 2006, when Theodore Wiprud composed "Three Mystical Choruses" of five minutes each, based on texts by [[Rumi]], Uvavnuk, and [[Akka Mahadevi|Mahavediyakka]]. This was a commission from [[Francisco Núñez]] for the Young People’s Chorus of New York. Wiprud compares Uvavnuk's experience to that of the [[Virgin Mary]] at the [[Magnificat]].&lt;ref&gt;"I find in “The Song of Uvavnuk” an uncanny parallel to the Magnificat, the song of Mary accepting the Holy Spirit into her body to impregnate her with the Christ. I first encountered the text in John Luther Adams‘ pathbreaking music theatre work, Earth and the Great Weather. I have not been able to trace or attribute the translation, which is based on Knud Rasmussen’s account in Account of the Fifth Thule Expedition, 1921-1924, Volume VII."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiprud|first1=Theoore|title=Three Mystical Choruses|url=http://www.theodorewiprud.com/music/three-mystical-choruses/|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was used by the peace group ''Out Beyond Ideas'' for a 2009 benefit album.&lt;ref name=twsSEP07&gt;{{cite web
