In [[light frame construction]], a '''birdsmouth joint''' or '''bird's beak cut''' is a [[Woodworking joints|woodworking joint]] that is generally used to connect a roof [[rafter]] to the [[top plate]] of a supporting wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ultimate Guide to House Framing |last=Wagner |first=John D. |year=2009 |publisher=Creative Homowner |location=NJ |isbn=978-1-58011-443-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an indentation cut into the rafter which consists of a "seat cut" (the face of which rests on the top plate) and a "heel cut" or "plumb cut" (the face of which lies parallel to the supporting wall), forming a shape resembling a bird's mouth. The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior in order to maintain the structural integrity of the rafter because the unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by [[toenailing]] the rafter from the side into the top plate below.

The depth of a rafter cut varies according to local building code differences in different locations. As a general rule, no more than one third of the depth of the rafter should be removed, in order to maintain structural integrity.

In [[computer engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]], '''bit banging''' is slang for various techniques in which [[serial communications]] use software instead of dedicated hardware to process and make use of signals. Software directly sets and [[sampling (signal processing)|samples]] the state of pins on a [[microcontroller]], and is responsible for all parameters of the signal: timing, levels, synchronization, etc. In contrast to bit banging, dedicated hardware (such as a [[modem]], [[UART]], or [[shift register]]) handles these parameters and provides a ([[Data buffer|buffered]]) data interface in other systems, so software is not required to perform signal [[demodulation]]. Bit banging can be implemented at very low cost, and is used in [[embedded systems]].&lt;ref name="Predko_2000"/&gt;

Bit banging allows the same device to use different protocols with minimal or no hardware changes required. In many cases, bit banging is made possible because more recent hardware operates much more quickly than hardware did when standard communications protocols were created.

==C code example==
Sending a byte on an [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// transmit byte serially, MSB first
void send_8bit_serial_data(unsigned char data)
{
   int i;

   // select device (active low)
   output_low(SD_CS);

   // send bits 7..0
   for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
   {
       // consider leftmost bit
       // set line high if bit is 1, low if bit is 0
       if (data &amp; 0x80)
           output_high(SD_DI);
       else
           output_low(SD_DI);

       // pulse clock to indicate that bit value should be read
       output_low(SD_CLK);
       output_high(SD_CLK);

       // shift byte left so next bit will be leftmost
       data &lt;&lt;= 1;
   }

   // deselect device
   output_high(SD_CS);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Considerations==

The question whether to deploy bit banging or not is a trade-off between load, performance and reliability on the one hand, and the availability of a hardware alternative on the other. The software emulation process consumes more processing power than does supporting dedicated hardware. The microcontroller spends much of its time sending or receiving samples to and from the pins, at the expense of other tasks. The signal produced usually has more [[jitter]] or [[glitch]]es, especially if the processor is also executing other tasks while communicating. However, if the bit-banging software is [[interrupt]]-driven by the signal, this may be of minor importance, especially if control signals such as [[RS-232#RTS/CTS handshaking|RTS, CTS]], or [[Data Carrier Detect|DCD]] are available. The implementation in software can be a solution when specific hardware support is not available or requires a more expensive microcontroller.

[[File:Casing-Diagram.jpg|right|thumb|Casing Diagram]]
'''Casing''' is large diameter [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] that is assembled and inserted into a recently drilled section of a [[borehole]].  Similar to the bones of a spine protecting the spinal cord, casing is set inside the drilled borehole to protect and support the wellstream. The lower portion (and sometimes the entirety) is typically held in place with [[cement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=333&amp;c_id=23|title=How Does Casing Work?|website=www.rigzone.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeper strings usually are not cemented all the way to the surface, so the weight of the pipe must be partially supported by a [[casing hanger]] in the [[wellhead]]. 

==Purpose==

Casing that is cemented in place aids the drilling process in several ways:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil Well Drilling Engineering|last=Rabia|first=Hussain|publisher=springer|year=1986|isbn=0860106616|location=|pages=185-243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prevents contamination of [[fresh water]] well zones.
* Prevents unstable upper formations from caving in and sticking the drill string or forming large [[cavern]]s.
* Provides a strong upper foundation to allow use of high-density [[drilling fluid]] to continue drilling deeper.
* Isolates various zones, which may have different [[pressure]]s or fluids, in the drilled formations from one another.
* Seals off high pressure zones from the surface, minimizing potential for a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]
* Prevents fluid loss into or contamination of production zones.
* Provides a smooth internal bore for installing production equipment.

Optimum design of the casing program decreases the well construction costs, enhances the efficiency of operations and also diminishes the environmental impacts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/75e8/bf875c12326d872012831fdbd5f4815d5fc4.pdf|title=Using casing to drill directional wells|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Casing &amp; Temporary Home.JPG|thumb|Casing arranged on a rack at a drilling rig in preparation for installation]]
A slightly different [[metal]] string, called [[production tubing]], is often used without cement inside the final casing string of a well to contain [[production fluid]]s and convey them to the surface from an underground [[oil reservoir|reservoir]].

==Design==

In the planning stages of a well, a [[drilling engineer]], usually with input from [[geologist]]s and others, will pick strategic depths at which the hole will need to be cased in order for drilling to reach the desired total depth. This decision is often based on subsurface data such as [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] pressures and strengths, and is balanced against the cost objectives and desired drilling strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With the casing set depths determined, hole sizes and casing sizes must follow. The hole drilled for each [[casing string]] must be large enough to accommodate the casing to be placed inside it, allowing room for cement between the outside of that casing and the hole. Also, subsequent bits that will continue drilling obviously must pass through existing casing strings. Thus, each casing string will have a subsequently smaller diameter. The inside diameter of the final casing string (or penultimate one in some instances of a liner completion) must accommodate the [[production tubing]] and associated hardware such as packers, gas lift mandrels and subsurface safety valves.

Casing design for each size of designed pipes is done by calculating the worst conditions that may be faced during drilling and over the producing life of the well. Mechanical properties such as longitudinal tensile strength, and burst and collapse resistance (calculated considering biaxial effects of axial and hoop stresses), must be sufficient at various depths. Pipe of differing strengths often comprises a long casing string, which typically will have the greatest axial tension and perhaps highest internal burst pressure differentials in the upper parts, and the greatest collapsing loads deeper in the well from external pressure vs lowered internal pressure.

Casing strings are supported by [[casing hanger]]s that are set in the [[wellhead]], which later will be topped with the [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas tree]]. The lower members of the wellhead usually are installed on top of the first casing string after it has been cemented in place.

==Intervals==

Typically, a well contains multiple intervals of casing successively placed within the previous casing run.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The following casing intervals are typically used in an [[oil well|oil]] or gas well:

* Conductor casing
* Surface casing
* Intermediate casing (optional)
* Production casing
* Production liner

The conductor casing serves as a support during drilling operations, to flowback returns during drilling and cementing of the surface casing, and to prevent collapse of the loose [[soil]] near the surface. It can normally vary from sizes such as 18" to 30".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Petroleum Engineering Handbook, Volume II: Drilling Engineering|last=|first=|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55563-114-7|location=|pages=287-288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of surface casing is to isolate freshwater zones so that they are not contaminated during drilling and completion. Surface casing is the most strictly regulated due to these environmental concerns, which can include regulation of casing depth and cement quality. A typical size of surface casing is 13⅜ inches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Intermediate casing may be necessary on longer drilling intervals where necessary [[drilling mud]] weight to prevent blowouts may cause a [[hydrostatic pressure]] that can fracture shallower or deeper formations. Casing placement is selected so that the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling fluid remains at a pressure level that is between formation pore pressures and fracture pressures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US20120174581 Closed-Loop Systems and Methods for Geothermal Electricity Generation] - US 20120174581 A1 - '''www.google.com''' - Patents.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In order to reduce cost, a liner may be used which extends just above the shoe (bottom) of the previous casing interval and hung off downhole rather than at the surface. It may typically be 7", although many liners match the diameter of the [[production tubing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Few wells actually produce through casing, since producing fluids can corrode [[steel]] or form deposits such as [[asphaltene]]s or [[paraffin wax]]es and the larger diameter can make flow unstable. [[Production tubing]] is therefore installed inside the last casing string and the tubing annulus is usually sealed at the bottom of the tubing by a [[production packer|packer]]. Tubing is easier to remove for maintenance, replacement, or for various types of workover operations. It is significantly lighter than casing and does not require a [[drilling rig]] to run in and out of hole; smaller "service rigs" are used for this purpose.

==Cementing==
[[Cement]]ing is performed by circulating a [[cement]] slurry through the inside of the casing and out into the annulus through the [[casing shoe]] at the bottom of the [[casing string]]. In order to precisely place the cement slurry at a required interval on the outside of the casing, a plug is pumped with a displacement fluid behind the cement slurry column, which "bumps" in the casing shoe and prevents further flow of fluid through the shoe. This bump can be seen at surface as a pressure spike at the cement pump. To prevent the cement from flowing back into the inside of the casing, a float collar above the casing shoe acts as a [[check valve]] and prevents fluid from flowing up through the shoe from the annulus.

'''Chineasy''' is an Internet startup created with the purpose of teaching [[Chinese characters|characters]], created by the entrepreneur [[Shaolan Hsueh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/13/how-chineasy-inventor-shaolan-hsueh-used-beautiful-design-to-decode-mandarin-and-cantonese-4544739/|title=Want to speak Chinese?

The approach is to learn Chinese characters with the help of illustrations to help memorizing Chinese characters better. The 2014 book ''Chineasy: The New Way to Read Chinese'' contains about 400 characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chineasy: The New Way to Read Chinese|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0062332097|edition=Flexibound|url=https://www.amazon.com/Chineasy-The-Easy-Learn-Chinese-ebook/dp/B00IMHU7KQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was based on her 2013 [[TED talk]] &lt;ref name="Learn to read Chinese...with ease"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ted.com/talks/shaolan_learn_to_read_chinese_with_ease?language=en |title=Learn to read Chinese...with ease |publisher=TED.com |date=May 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funded via a crowdfunding campaign through [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shaolanchineasy/chineasy-begins-0 |title=Chineasy: The easiest way to learn Chinese |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book introduces common Chinese characters, it does not teach pronunciation or grammar, and thus does not teach how to read or use the language.Although it does use voice recordings for the users to mimic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chineasy?

==Set of characters==

Chineasy teaches sometimes [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] and sometimes [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified forms]]. [[ShaoLan Hsueh|Hsueh]] argued that traditional and simplified forms of Chinese still share a great number of characters, and in real life – just as in the case of [[British English]] and [[American English]] – you will come across both forms. Where they differ, she shows the other version as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Siobhan |url= http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/13/how-chineasy-inventor-shaolan-hsueh-used-beautiful-design-to-decode-mandarin-and-cantonese-4544739/ |title= How Chineasy inventor ShaoLan Hsueh used beautiful design to decode Mandarin and Cantonese |publisher= Metro.co.uk |date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''copyholder''' is a device that holds the hand written or printed material being typed by a [[copy typist]].  They were used in the past with [[typewriters]] and are now used with [[computers]] and [[word processors]] like [[OpenOffice.org Writer|Writer]] or [[Microsoft Office Word|Word]].

Some copyholders stand independently whilst others are attached to [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] based [[computer monitors]].  They can support entire booklets or a single page.  Elaborate varieties can even be adjusted by height or angle and some come with rulers and guides that appear over the front of the page.

'''DTU Roadrunners''' is a student driven project at the [[Technical University of Denmark]] competing in the [[Shell Eco-marathon]] races. The team participates in one or both of the two classes at Shell Eco-Marathon Europe: the UrbanConcept class and the Prototype class with the cars Dynamo and Innovator respectively. The team consists of 20 to 30 students. Project work in the course is based on the [[CDIO Initiative|CDIO]]-working form and students are thus responsible for the development, construction and operation of the vehicles.

== UrbanConcept ==
The UrbanConcept category in the Shell Eco-Marathon has the aim to create a very fuel-efficient car that looks similar to a small city car.

[[File:UCHSPhotoDarkRoom9.10.09ByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|right|A darkroom in [[Union City High School]], which is adjacent to the school's photography classroom.]]
[[File:Self portrait in the darkroom JPG01.jpg|thumb|right|In the darkroom.]]
A '''darkroom''' is a workshop used by photographers working with [[photographic film]] to make prints and carry out other associated tasks. It is a room that can be made completely dark to allow the processing of the [[light]]-sensitive photographic materials, including film and [[photographic paper]]. Various equipment is used in the darkroom, including an [[enlarger]], baths containing chemicals, and running water.

Darkrooms have been used since the inception of photography in the early 19th century. Darkrooms have many various manifestations, from the elaborate space used by [[Ansel Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danmassey.co.uk/darkroom/Darkroom_layout_and_equipment.htm |title=Black and White Photography - Darkroom Layout &amp; Equipment |publisher=Danmassey.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a retooled ambulance wagon used by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA99/paul/tim/forhistory.html |title=for history |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the initial development of the film to the creation of prints, the darkroom process allows complete control over the medium.

Due to the popularity of color photography and complexity of [[List of photographic processes|processing]] color film (''see [[C-41 process]]'') and printing color photographs and also to the rise, first of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] technology and later [[digital photography]], darkrooms are decreasing in popularity, though are still commonplace on college campuses, schools and in the studios of many professional photographers.

Other applications of darkrooms include the use in [[nondestructive testing]], such as [[Magnetic particle inspection#Magnetic particle powder|magnetic particle inspection]].

==Darkroom equipment==

[[Image:Micklethwaite Portable studio.jpg|thumb|right|A portable darkroom in 19th century [[Ireland]]. The wet collodion photography process, used at the time, required that the image be developed while the plate was still wet, creating the need for portable darkrooms such as this one.]]

In most darkrooms, an [[enlarger]], an optical apparatus similar to a slide projector, that projects light through the image of a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] onto a base, finely controls the focus, intensity and duration of light, is used for printmaking. A sheet of [[photographic paper]] is exposed to the light coming through the [[negative (photography)]], resulting in a positive version of the image on the paper.
 
When making black-and-white prints, a [[safelight]] is commonly used to illuminate the work area. Since the majority of black-and-white papers are sensitive to only blue, or to blue and green light, a red- or amber-colored light can be safely used without exposing the paper.

Color print paper, being sensitive to all parts of the visible spectrum, must be kept in complete darkness until the prints are properly fixed.

Another use for a darkroom is to load film in and out of cameras, development spools, or film holders, which requires complete darkness. Lacking a darkroom, a photographer can make use of a [[changing bag]], which is a small bag with sleeved arm holes specially designed to be completely light proof and used to prepare film prior to exposure or developing.

===Print processing===

{{main|Photographic printing}}

During exposure, values in the image can be adjusted, most often by "[[Dodging and burning|dodging]]" (reducing the amount of light to a specific area of an image by selectively blocking light to it for part or all of the exposure time) and/or "burning" (giving additional exposure to specific area of an image by exposing only it while blocking light to the rest). Filters, usually thin pieces of colored plastic, can be used to increase or decrease an image's contrast (the difference between dark tones and light tones). One method of photographic printing, called "split filter printing," is where the photographer determines two separate exposure times using two separate filters (typically a 0 or 00, and a 5) to create a single print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Split Filter Printing Darkroom Technique {{!}} Guide to Film Photography|url = http://www.guidetofilmphotography.com/split-filter-printing.html|website = www.guidetofilmphotography.com|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method allows the photographer to achieve a broad tonal range, with detailed highlights and rich blacks. After exposure, the photographic printing paper (which still appears blank) is ready to be processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/pdf/How-to-Print-BW-Photographs-in-a-Darkroom/How-to-Print-BW-Photographs-in-a-Darkroom.pdf |title=How to Print B&amp;W Photographs in a Darkroom |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographers generally begin printing a roll of film by making a [[contact print]] of their negatives to use as a quick reference to decide which images to enlarge. Some [[large format]] photographers, such as [[Edward Weston]], make only contact prints of their large (4x5", 5x7", 8x10" or larger) negatives. 

The paper that has been exposed is processed, first by immersion in a  [[photographic developer]], halting development with a [[stop bath]], and fixing in a [[photographic fixer]]. The print is then [[Washing (photography)|washed]] to remove the processing chemicals and dried. There are [[Photographic processing#Further processing|a variety of other, additional steps]] a photographer may take, such as toning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">The Gaia '''Data Processing and Analysis Consortium''' ('''DPAC''') is a group of over 400 European scientists and software engineers formed with the objective to design, develop and execute the data processing system for [[ESA]]'s ambitious [[Gaia probe|Gaia]] space astrometry mission. It was formally formed in June 2006 by European scientists, with the initial goal of answering an Announcement of Opportunity to be issued by ESA before the end of that year.  At a meeting in [[Paris]] on 24–25 May 2007, ESA's Science Programme Committee (SPC) approved the DPAC proposal submitted in response to the Announcement of Opportunity for the Gaia data processing. The proposal describes a complete data processing system capable of handling the full size and complexity of the Gaia data within the mission schedule. Following the SPC approval, the DPAC is officially responsible for all Gaia data processing activities.

On 1 January 2010, DPAC comprises 430 members coming from 24 European countries, with the largest contributions coming from [[France]], [[Italy]], [[UK]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]]. The [[consortium]] is organized around a set of nine Coordination Units (CUs), eight being each in charge of a particular aspect of the processing, and the last one being in charge of the publication of the Catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgfH6eBRjykC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=Data+Processing+and+Analysis+Consortium&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aFmjTNyJO8H7lwfrl-SVBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Data%20Processing%20and%20Analysis%20Consortium&amp;f=false Wenjing Jin, Imants Platais, Michael A.

'''Declared net capacity''' ('''DNC''') is a measure of the contribution that a [[power station]] makes to the overall capacity of a [[distribution grid]]. It is measured in [[megawatt]]s (MW), or in ''megawatts electrical'' ([[MWe]]) for a thermal power station.

'''DNC''' is sometimes expanded as '''''developed net capacity''''' in [[British English]]; The two expansions have exactly the same meaning.

In a conventional power station, the DNC rating is simply the maximum rated output minus the power consumed onsite. It is sometimes termed the ''switchyard'' output, and takes no account of transmission losses in the grid, which may be considerable in the case of a remote hydro station for example. Most but not all quoted power station ratings are DNC ratings rather than the simple capacity of the [[alternator]]s.

In the case of a [[wind power]] station, the situation is more complex. The alternator of a [[wind turbine]] is normally specified to match the strongest wind in which the turbine is designed to operate. This is because most of the cost of a wind turbine is in the rotor and the tower and bearings that support it, rather than in the alternator. It makes no economic sense to restrict the size of the alternator to anything less than the maximum that the rotor will deliver. However, this means that, unlike a conventional power station, a wind turbine rarely achieves its maximum rated output while operating.

While for conventional power stations, the station is only regarded as ''available'' if the full power output is achievable, for wind power stations no power at all may be available depending on the wind strength, and even if a turbine is operating it may be producing as little as a tenth of its maximum rated capacity. A typical average figure is between one-third and one-half of the maximum rated capacity.  

There are several suggested methods of allowing for this when quoting a DNC figure for a [[wind farm]], but none has gained general acceptance, and the capacity quoted for a wind farm is normally a simple total of the maximum rated capacities of the turbines, sometimes termed the ''peak capacity''. Many wind schemes now also quote their expected or actual annual output in [[GWh]], to allow more meaningful comparisons with other forms of generation than is possible just by considering this total rated output.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16682">'''Direct bonding''', or '''fusion bonding''', describes a [[wafer bonding]] process without any additional intermediate layers. The bonding process is based on chemical bonds between two surfaces of any material possible meeting numerous requirements.&lt;ref name="Bag2000" /&gt;
These requirements are specified for the wafer surface as sufficiently clean, flat and smooth. Otherwise unbonded areas so called voids, i.e. interface bubbles, can occur.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

The procedural steps of the direct bonding process of wafers any surface is divided into
# wafer preprocessing,
# pre-bonding at room temperature and
# annealing at elevated temperatures.
Even though direct bonding as a wafer bonding technique is able to process nearly all materials, '''''silicon''''' is the most established material up to now. Therefore, the bonding process is also referred to as silicon direct bonding or silicon fusion bonding. The fields of application for silicon direct bonding are, e.g. manufacturing of Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers, sensors and actuators.&lt;ref name="WFG2003" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The silicon direct bonding is based on intermolecular interactions including van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds and strong covalent bonds.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;
The initial procedure of direct bonding was characterized by a high process temperature. There is demand to lower the process temperature due to several factors, one is for instance the increasing number of utilized materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion. Hence, the aim is to achieve a stable and hermetic direct bond at a temperature below 450&amp;nbsp;°C. Therefore, processes for wafer surface activation i.e. plasma treatment or chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), are being considered and are actively being researched.&lt;ref name="WWGG2010" /&gt; The upper limit of 450&amp;nbsp;°C bases on the limitations of back-end CMOS processing and the beginning of interactions between the applied materials.&lt;ref name="BSY+2004" /&gt;

== History ==
The adhering effect of smooth and polished solid surfaces is first mentioned by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|Desaguliers]] (1734). His discovery was based on the friction between two surfaces of solids. The better the surfaces are polished the lower the friction is between those solids. This statement he described is only valid until a specific point. From this point on the friction starts to rise and the surfaces of the solids start to adhere together.&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt;
First reports of successful silicon direct bonding were published 1986 among others by J. B. Lasky.&lt;ref name="Las1986" /&gt;

== Conventional direct bonding ==

|}

Direct bonding is mostly referred to as bonding with silicon. Therefore process techniques are divided in accordance with the chemical structure of the surface in [[hydrophilic]] (compare to scheme of a hydrophilic silicon surface) or [[hydrophobic]] (compare to scheme of a hydrophobic silicon surface).&lt;ref name="Mac1997" /&gt;

The surface state of a silicon wafer can be measured by the contact angle a drop of water forms. In the case of a hydrophilic surface the angle is small (&lt; 5 °) based on the excellent wettability whereas a hydrophobic surface shows a contact angle larger than 90 °.

== Bonding of hydrophilic silicon wafers ==

=== Wafer preprocessing ===
[[File:B-d-irphotobondwave.png|thumb|right|Infrared photograph of initiation and propagation of bonding wave in wafer bonding of silicon wafers. (l) wafers are separated by an air layer and the bond process starts by pressure on top wafer. (m) bond wave moves to the edge. (r) a perfectly bonded wafer pair, not reflecting IR light.&lt;ref name="TG1998" /&gt;]]
Before bonding two wafers, those two solids need to be free of impurities that can base on particle, organic and/or ionic contamination. To achieve the cleanliness without degrading the surface quality, the wafer passes a dry cleaning, e.g. plasma treatments or UV/ozone cleaning, or a wet chemical cleaning procedure.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;
The utilization of chemical solutions combines sequential steps. An established industrial standard procedure is SC (Standard Clean) purification by RCA. It consists of two solutions
* SC1 (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; OH (29%) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (30%) + Deionized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [1:1:5]) and
* SC2 (HCl (37%) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (30%) + Deionized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [1:1:6]).
SC1 is used for removing organic contaminations and particles at a temperature of 70&amp;nbsp;°C to 80&amp;nbsp;°C for 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;min and SC2 is used for removing metal ions at 80&amp;nbsp;°C for 10&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref name="GD2008" /&gt;
Subsequently, the wafers are rinsed with or stored in deionized water. The actual procedure needs to be adapted to every application and device because of usually existing interconnects and metallization systems on the wafer.&lt;ref name="WW1994" /&gt;

=== Pre-bonding at room temperature ===
[[File:B-d-diagramsurfaceenergy.png|thumb|right|Diagram of the surface energy of hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonded wafers &lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;]]
Before contacting the wafers, those have to be aligned.&lt;ref name="Bag2000" /&gt; If the surfaces are sufficiently smooth, the wafers start to bond as soon as they get in atomic contact as shown in infrared photograph of a bond wave.

The wafers are covered with water molecules so the bonding happens between chemisorbed water molecules on the opposing wafer surfaces. In consequence a significant fraction of Si-OH (silanol) groups start to polymerize at room temperature forming Si-O-Si and water and a sufficient bonding strength for handling the wafer stack is assured. The formed water molecules will migrate or diffuse along the interface during annealing.&lt;ref name="TG1998" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;{Si-OH} + OH-Si -&gt;[\ce{polymerization}] {Si-O-Si} + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;{Si-OH} + OH-Si -&gt;[\ce{slow~fracture}] {Si-O-Si} + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

After the pre-bonding in air, in a special gaseous atmosphere or vacuum, the wafers have to pass an annealing process for increasing the bonding strength. The annealing therefore provides a certain amount of thermal energy which forces more silanol groups to react among each other and new, highly stable chemical bindings are formed. The kind of binding which forms directly depends on the amount of energy which has been delivered or the applied temperature respectively. In consequence the bonding strength rises with increasing annealing temperatures.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

=== Annealing at elevated temperatures ===
Between room temperature and 110&amp;nbsp;°C the interface energy remains low, water molecules diffuse at the bond interface, leading to a rearrangement, causing more hydrogen-bonds. At temperatures from 110&amp;nbsp;°C to 150&amp;nbsp;°C silanol groups polymerize to siloxane and water, but also a slow fracture takes place. This reaction equates a thermo dynamical equilibrium and a higher density of silanol groups results in a higher number of siloxane and an increasing bond strength.

:&lt;chem&gt;{Si-OH} + Si-OH &lt;=&gt; {Si-O-Si} + HOH&lt;/chem&gt;

No further processes are observed at the interface between 150&amp;nbsp;°C and 800&amp;nbsp;°C until all OH-groups are polymerized and the composite strength remains constant.

Above 800&amp;nbsp;°C native oxide gets viscous and starts to flow at the interface, which increases the area of contacted surfaces. So, the diffusion of trapped hydrogen molecules along the interface is enhanced and interface voids may reduce in size or disappear at all. The annealing process is finished by the cooling of the wafer stack.&lt;ref name="TG1998" /&gt; 
The interface energy increases to more than 2&amp;nbsp;{{frac|J|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} at 800&amp;nbsp;°C with a native oxide layer or at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C if the wafers are covered by thermal oxide (compare diagram of surface energy). In case one wafer contains a layer of thermal oxide and the other wafer is covered by a native oxide, the surface energy development is similar to a wafer pair both covered with a native oxide layer.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;{{-}}

== Bonding of hydrophobic silicon wafers ==

=== Wafer preprocessing ===
A hydrophobic surface is generated if the native oxide layer is removed by either plasma treatment or by fluoride containing etching solutions, e.g. hydrogen fluoride (HF) or ammonium fluoride (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F). This process enhances the formation of Si-F bonds of the exposed silicon atoms. For hydrophobic bonding it is important to avoid re-hydrophilization, e.g. by rinsing and spin-drying, since Si-F bonds contacted with water result in Si-OH.&lt;ref name="Bag2000" /&gt;

=== Pre-bonding at room temperature ===
Prior to bonding the surface is covered with hydrogen and fluorine atoms. The bonding at room temperature is mostly based on van-der-Waals forces between those hydrogen and fluorine atoms. Compared to bonding with hydrophilic surfaces, the interface energy is lower directly after contacting. This fact builds up the need for a higher surface quality and cleanliness to prevent unbonded areas and thereby to achieve a full-surface contact between the wafers (compare infrared photograph of a bond wave).&lt;ref name="Bag2000" /&gt; Similar to bonding of hydrophilic surfaces, the pre-bond is followed by an annealing process.

=== Annealing at elevated temperatures ===
From room temperature to 150&amp;nbsp;°C no important interface reactions occur and the surface energy is stable. Between 150&amp;nbsp;°C and 300&amp;nbsp;°C more Si-F-H-Si bonds are formed. Above 300&amp;nbsp;°C the desorption of hydrogen and fluoride from the wafer surface leads to redundant hydrogen atoms that diffuse in the silicon crystal lattice or along interface. As a result, covalent Si-Si bonds start to establish between opposing surfaces. At 700&amp;nbsp;°C the transition to Si-Si bonds is completed.&lt;ref name="TSGR1994" /&gt;
The bonding energy reaches cohesive strengths of bulk silicon (compare diagram of surface energy).&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

== Low temperature direct bonding ==
Even though direct bonding is highly flexible in processing numerous materials, the mismatch of CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) using different materials is a substantial restriction for wafer level bonding, especially the high annealing temperatures of direct bonding.&lt;ref name="TG1998" /&gt;

The focus in research is put on hydrophilic silicon surfaces. The increase of the bonding energy is based on the conversion of silanol- (Si-OH) into siloxane-groups (Si-O-Si). The diffusion of water is mentioned as limiting factor because water has to be removed from the interface before close contact of surfaces is established. The difficulty is that water molecules may react with already formed siloxane-groups (Si-O-Si), so the overall energy of adhesion gets weaker.&lt;ref name="PK1999" /&gt;

Lower temperatures are important for bonding pre-processed wafers or compound materials to avoid undesirable changes or decomposition. The reduction of the required annealing temperature can be achieved by different pretreatments such as:

* plasma activated bonding
* [[surface activated bonding]]
* ultra high vacuum (UHV)
* surface activation by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)
* surface treatment to achieve chemical activation in:
** hydrolyzed tetraalkoxysilanes Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
** hydrolyzed tetramethoxysilane Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
** nitride acid HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Furthermore, research has shown that a lower annealing temperature for hydrophobic surfaces is possible with wafer pre-treatment based on:
* As&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; implantation
* B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or Ar plasma treatment
* Si sputter deposition

== Examples ==
This technique is usable for the fabrication of multi wafer micro structures, i.e. accelerometers, micro valves and micro pumps.

'''Electronic funds transfer at point of sale''' ('''EFTPOS''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|f|t|p|ɒ|s}}) is an [[electronic payment system]] involving electronic funds transfers based on the use of [[payment card]]s, such as [[debit card|debit]] or [[credit card]]s, at [[payment terminal]]s located at points of sale. EFTPOS technology originated in the [[United States]] in 1981 and was adopted by other countries.  In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is also the brand name of a specific system used for such payments; these systems are mainly country specific and do not interconnect.

Debit and credit cards are [[paper embossing|embossed]] plastic cards complying with [[ISO/IEC 7810]] ID-1 standard. The cards have an embossed [[bank card number]] conforming with the [[ISO/IEC 7812]] numbering standard.

== History ==
{{main|Debit card#United States}}

EFTPOS technology originated in the United States in 1981 and was rolled out in 1982. Initially, a number of nationwide systems were set up, such as ''Interlink'', which were limited to participating correspondent banking relationships, not being linked to each other. Consumers and merchants were slow to accept it, and there was minimal marketing. As a result, growth and market penetration of EFTPOS was minimal in the US up to the turn of the century.

In a short time, other countries adopted the EFTPOS technology, but these systems too were limited to the national borders. Each country adopted various interbank co-operative models. In Australia, in 1984 Westpac was the first major Australian bank to implement an EFTPOS system, at BP petrol stations. The other major banks implemented EFTPOS systems during 1984, initially with petrol stations. The banks' existing debit and credit cards (but only allowed to access debit accounts) were used in the EFTPOS systems. In 1985, the State Bank of Victoria developed the capacity to host connect individual ATMS and helped create the ATM (Financial) Network.  Banks started to link their EFTPOS systems to provide access for all customers across all EFTPOS devices. Cards issued by all banks could then be used at all EFTPOS terminals nationally, but debit cards issued in other countries could not. Prior to 1986, the Australian banks organized a widespread uniform credit card, called [[Bankcard]], which had been in existence since 1974. There was a dispute between the banks whether Bankcard (or credit cards in general) should be permitted into the proposed EFTPOS system. At that time several banks were actively promoting MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Store cards and proprietary cards were shut out of the new system.

In New Zealand, [[Bank of New Zealand]] started issuing EFTPOS debit cards in 1985 with the first merchant terminals being installed in [[Filling station|petrol stations]].

=== First Mobile EFTPOS ===

In 1996, mobile EFTPOS arrived, with  hotels in Kuala Lumpur installing systems in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Citibank's 'mobile' service for customers|last=|first=|date=1997-09-04|work=The Star|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first example of a pizza delivery in Singapore accepting Visa card via cellular payment in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Home-delivered pizza now paid by credit card|last=|first=|date=June 1998|work=Singtel Staff Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Now, you can also charge your pizza|last=|first=|date=1998-04-29|work=The Straits Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(a collaboration between Signet, Visa, Citi Bank, and Dynamic Data Systems) beginning the rollout of mobile systems in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Visa plays the mobility card|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=1998-04-28|work=The Australian Financial Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=DDS sights Asian Eftpos market|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=1998-04-24|work=The Australian Financial Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mobile drive in Asia-Pacific|last=|first=|date=June 1998|work=Electronic Payments International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 Cellular based Eftpos infrastructure had really taken off, and by 2010 Cellular Eftpos had become the standard for the Global market.

Since 2002 the use of EFTPOS has grown significantly, and it has become the standard payment method, displacing the use of cash. Subsequently, networks facilitating the process of money transfer and payment settlement between the consumer and the merchant grew from a small number of nationwide systems to the majority of payment processing transactions. For EFTPOS, USA based systems allow the use of debit cards or credit cards.

{{main|Debit card#Australia}}

In Australia, debit and credit cards are the most common non-cash payment methods at “points of sale” (POS) or via [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]].&lt;ref name=cecs&gt;APCA: [http://apca.com.au/payment-systems/cards-accepting-devices Cards and Accepting Devices]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boq.com.au/business_merchant_eftpos.htm EFTPOS. Merchant banking services. EFTPOS. Bank of Queensland Australia&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all merchants provide EFTPOS facilities, but those who wish to accept EFTPOS payments must enter an agreement with one of the seven merchant service providers, which rent an EFTPOS terminal to the merchant. The EFTPOS system in Australia is managed by Eftpos Payments Australia Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/corporate/about|title=eftpos - the way Australia pays|publisher=eftpos Payments Australia Ltd|accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also sets the EFTPOS [[interchange fee]].&lt;ref name=ifee&gt;[http://www.rba.gov.au/payments-system/reforms/debit-card-systems/submissions-pro-interchg-stds/epal-23102009-1.pdf Proposed changes to the interchange fees standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428094413/http://www.rba.gov.au/payments-system/reforms/debit-card-systems/submissions-pro-interchg-stds/epal-23102009-1.pdf |date=2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For credit cards to be accepted by a merchant a separate agreement must be entered into with each credit card company, each of which has its own flexible merchant fee rate.

The clearing arrangements for EFTPOS are managed by [[Australian Payments Clearing Association]] (APCA). The system for ATM and EFTPOS interchanges is called Issuers and Acquirers Community (formerly Consumer Electronic Clearing System; CECS)&lt;ref name=cecs /&gt; also called CS3. CECS required authorisations from the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC), which was obtained in 2001 and reaffirmed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/906923 ACCC reap proves CECS]&lt;/ref&gt; ATM and EFTPOS clearances are the made under individual bilateral arrangements between the institutions involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austlii.edu.au/~alan/bflr-2000.html Australian Payment System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407004414/http://austlii.edu.au/~alan/bflr-2000.html |date=2012-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debit cards===
Australian financial institutions provide their customers with a plastic card, which can be used as a debit card or as an [[ATM card]], and sometimes as a credit card. The card merely provides the means by which a customer's linked bank or other accounts can be accessed using an EFTPOS terminal or ATM. These cards can also be used on some [[vending machine]]s and other automatic payment mechanisms, such as ticket vending machines. Australian debit cards cannot be used for [[online banking|online]] and [[telephone banking]] transactions, unless they are also a credit card.

Each Australian bank has given a different name to its debit cards, such as:
* [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]: Keycard
* [[Westpac|Westpac Banking Corporation]]: Handycard
* [[National Australia Bank]]: FlexiCard
* [[ANZ Bank]]: Access card
* [[Bendigo Bank]]: Cashcard

Some banks offer alternative debit card facilities to their customers using the Visa or MasterCard clearance system. For example, [[St George Bank]] offers a Visa Debit Card,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stgeorge.com.au/personal/bank-accounts/transaction-accounts/visa-debit-card Visa Debit Card - St.George Bank]. Stgeorge.com.au. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the National Australia Bank. The main difference with regular debit cards is that these cards can be used outside Australia where the respective credit card is accepted.

Those merchants that enter the EFTPOS payment system must accept [[debit card]]s issued by any Australian bank, and some also accept various [[credit card]]s and other cards. Some merchants set minimum transaction amounts for EFTPOS transactions, which can be different for debit and credit card transactions. Some merchants impose a surcharge on the use of EFTPOS. These can vary between merchants and on the type of card being used, and generally are not imposed on debit card transactions, and widely not on MasterCard and a Visa credit card transactions.

A feature of a debit card is that an EFTPOS transaction will only be accepted if there is an available credit balance in the bank cheque or savings account linked to the card.

Australian debit cards normally cannot be used outside Australia.  They can only be used outside Australia if they carry the MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus or Visa/Plus or other similar logos, in which case the non-Australian transaction will be processed through those transaction systems. Similarly, non-Australian debit and credit cards can only be used at Australian EFTPOS terminals or ATMs if they have these logos or the MasterCard or Visa logos. Diners Club and/or American Express cards will be accepted only if the merchant has an agreement with those card companies, or increasingly, if the merchant has modern alternative payment options available for those cards, such as through Paypal. The [[Discover Card]] is accepted in Australia as a Diners Club card [http://uat2.dinersclub.com.au/merchants.htm].

In addition, credit card companies issue [[Stored-value card|prepaid card]]s which act like generic gift cards, which are anonymous and not linked to any bank accounts. These cards are accepted by merchants who accept credit cards and are processed through the EFTPOS terminal in the same way as credit cards.

===Cash out===
A number of merchants permit customers using a debit card to withdraw cash as part of the EFTPOS transaction.&lt;ref name=NabEftpos&gt;[http://www.nab.com.au/Personal_Finance/0,,9493,00.html Nab — Eftpos&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, this facility (known as [[debit card cashback]] in many other countries) is known as "cash out". For the merchant, cash out is a way of reducing their net cash takings, saving on banking of cash. There is no additional cost to the merchant in providing cash out because banks charge a merchant a debit card transaction fee per EFTPOS transaction,&lt;ref name=ifee /&gt; and not on the transaction value. Cash out is a facility provided by the merchant, and not the bank, so the merchant can limit or vary how much cash can be withdrawn at a time, or suspend the facility at any time. When available, cash out is convenient for the customer, who can bypass having to visit a bank branch or ATM. Cash out is also cheaper for the customer, since only one bank transaction is involved. For people in some remote areas, cash out may be the only way they can withdraw cash from their personal accounts.  However, most merchants who provide the facility set a relatively low limit on cash out, generally $50, and some also charge for the service. Some merchants in Australia only allow cash out with the purchase of goods; other merchants allow cash out whether or not customers buy any goods. Cash out is not available in association with credit card sales because on credit card transactions the merchant is charged a percentage commission based on the transaction value, and also because cash withdrawals are treated differently from purchase transactions by the credit card company. (However, though inconsistent with a merchant's agreement with each credit card company, the merchant may treat a cash withdrawal as part of an ordinary credit card sale.)

===Cardholder verification===
EFTPOS transactions involving a debit, credit or prepaid card are primarily authenticated via the entry of a [[personal identification number]] (PIN) at the [[point of sale]]. Historically, these transactions were authenticated by the merchant using the cardholder's signature, as signed on their receipt. However, merchants had become increasingly lax in enforcing this verification, resulting in an increase in fraud. Australian banks have since deployed chip and PIN technology using the global [[EMV]] card standard; as of 1 August 2014, Australian merchants no longer accept signatures on transactions by domestic customers at point of sale terminals.&lt;ref name="cnet-emvaus"&gt;{{cite web|title=PINs now replace signatures on Australian card transactions|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/australian-credit-cards-boost-security-as-chip-and-pin-deadline-approaches/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet-nomoresig"&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit card signatures to be phased out in Australia|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/credit-card-signatures-to-be-phased-out-in-australia/|website=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a further security measure, if a user enters an incorrect PIN three times, the card may be locked out of EFTPOS and require reactivation over the phone or at a bank branch. In the case of an ATM, the card will not be returned, and the cardholder will need to visit the branch to retrieve the card, or request a new card to be issued.

All debit cards now have a [[Magnetic stripe card#Financial cards|magnetic stripe]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} on which is encoded the card's service codes, consisting of three-digit values.  These codes are used to convey instructions to merchant terminals on how a card should be processed. The first digit indicates if a card can be used internationally or is valid for domestic use only. It is also used to signal if the card is chip-enabled. The second digit indicates if the transaction must be sent online for authorization always or if transactions that are below floor limit can take place without authorization.  The third digit is used to indicate the preferred card verification method (e.g. PIN) and the environment where the card can be used (e.g. at point of sale only). Merchant terminals are required to recognize and act on service codes or send all transactions for online authorization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visa-asia.com/ap/au/merchants/productstech/visadebit.shtml Visa Australia | Visa Debit]. Visa-asia.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contactless smart card===
In the late 2000s, MasterCard and Visa introduced [[contactless payment|contactless]] smart debit cards under the brand names MasterCard [[PayPass]] and Visa [[payWave]]. These payments are made using either electronic payment networks separate from the regular EFTPOS payment networks, or newer EFTPOS with tap sensors, and is an alternative to the previous swipe or chip systems. These networks are operated by MasterCard and Visa, and not by the banks as is the EFTPOS network, through EFTPOS Payments Australia Limited (ePAL).

These cards are based on [[EMV technology]] and contain a [[RFID]] chip and antenna loop embedded in the plastic of the card. To pay using this system, a customer passes the card within 4&amp;nbsp;cm of a reader at a merchant checkout. Using this method, for transactions under $100, the customer does not need to authenticate his or her identity by PIN entry or signature, as on a regular EFTPOS machine. For transactions over $100, PIN verification is required.

The facility is only available for cards branded with the MasterCard PayPass or Visa payWave logos, indicating that they have the system-permitted embedded chip. ANZ has launched ATM solution based on Visa payWave in 2015, where the consumer tap the card on a reader at the ATM and insert a PIN to finalize the cash withdrawals, and not all merchants offer the facility. Bank debit cards and other credit cards do not currently offer a contactless payment facility. ePAL is developing a contactless payment system for debit cards based on EMV technology as well as an extension of debit cards for use for on-line transactions, and a [[mobile payment]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/docs/annual-reports/annual-report-2011.pdf Eftpos Annual Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323232617/http://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/docs/annual-reports/annual-report-2011.pdf |date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using contactless debit cards on tap-and-go terminals routes the transaction through the more expensive credit card system instead of the EFTPOS route, adding to the cost to the merchant, and ultimately the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/the-hidden-cost-of-the-tap-and-go-boom-20171007-gywcuj.html?_ga=2.230829725.344188306.1520894086-422518476.1516576290 The hidden cost of the tap-and-go boom]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The name and logo for EFTPOS in Australia were originally owned by the [[National Australia Bank]] and were [[trade mark]]s from 1986 until 1991. The ownership was for convenience and all the banks used the name and logo (commonly called "fat-E") on their cards and advertising.

In 1991 dialup EFTPOS was conceived by Key Corp (John Wood) and deployment of dialup commenced in 1993. Until 1993, communications, connections and transactions between banks, ATM banks and EFTPOS devices where conducted via leased lines (a specific power assisted communication line that detects any attempt to tamper with it) but in 1993 mobile wireless EFTPOS was conceived by Dynamic Data Systems (H. Daniel Elbaum). In 1995 Dynamic Data Systems and the banking industry worked together to implement, certify and introduce protocols and standards for cellular networks, and by 1998 the use of mobile EFTPOS began to appear in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A boost for EFTPOS|last=Cornell|first=Andrew|date=January 1997|work=Electronic Payments International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.decisive.com.au/html/110598_10.html|title=Optus to develop GSM-based mobile EFTPOS system|last=Sainsbury|first=Michael|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980612141247/http://www.decisive.com.au/html/110598_10.html|archive-date=1998-06-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Commonwealth Bank and MasterCard ran a six-month trial of the [[contactless smart card]] system [[PayPass]] in [[Sydney]] and [[Wollongong]],&lt;ref&gt;

In April 2009, a company, “EFTPOS Payments Australia Ltd” (ePal) was formed to manage and promote the EFTPOS system in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apca.com.au/PM/2009_Quarter2/index.html APCA PaymentsMonitor publication — Industry establishes new company to manage EFTPOS]&lt;/ref&gt;  ePal regulation commenced in January 2011.&lt;ref name=cecs /&gt; The initial members of EFTPOS Payments Australia Ltd were:

* [[Suncorp-Metway]]
* [[Tyro Payments]]
* [[Westpac|Westpac Banking Corporation]]
* [[Woolworths Limited]]

In Australia, store cards have been excluded from participation in the EFTPOS and ATM systems. Consequently, several larger store accounts have entered into co-branding arrangements with credit card networks for the store-based accounts to be widely accepted. This was the case with Coles (previously, Coles-Myer) which co-branded with MasterCard, and [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] which co-branded with American Express. Woolworths organized its credit card called [[Everyday Rewards (Australia)|Everyday Rewards]] (now Woolworths Money){{clarify|The Everyday Rewards (Australia) article says that the credit card was a separate card called "Everyday Money"|date=June 2012}} which initially was partnered with credit provider [[HSBC Bank]], but changed on 26 October 2014 to [[Macquarie Bank]].

=== Usage ===
As of June 2018, there were 961,247 EFTPOS terminals in Australia and 30,940 ATMs.&lt;ref&gt;APN [https://www.auspaynet.com.au/resources/device-statistics ATM and EFTPOS statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the terminals, over 60,000 offered cash withdrawals.&lt;ref name=NabEftpos/&gt; In 2010, 183 million transactions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apca.com.au/Public/apca01_live.nsf/WebPageDisplay/Stats_CardVolume APCA Card Transaction Volume]&lt;/ref&gt; worth [[Australian dollar|A$]]12 billion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apca.com.au/Public/apca01_live.nsf/WebPageDisplay/Stats_CardValue APCA Card Transaction Value]&lt;/ref&gt; were made using Australian EFTPOS terminals per month.

In 2011, these figures increased to 750,000 terminals, with 325,000 individual businesses, processing over 2 billion transactions with combined value of approximately $131 billion for the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftpos.net/merchant-services/eftpos/how-many-eftpos-transactions-and-volumes-get-processed/ The World of EFTPOS | Overview ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network ===
The EFT network in Australia is made up of seven proprietary networks in which peers have interchange agreements, making an effective single network.&lt;ref name="rba_payment_systems"&gt;[http://www.rba.gov.au/PaymentsSystem/Publications/BISCommitteeOnPaymentAndSettlementSystems/australia.pdf RBA paper on Australian Payment systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704234321/http://www.rba.gov.au/PaymentsSystem/Publications/BISCommitteeOnPaymentAndSettlementSystems/australia.pdf |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A merchant who wishes to accept EFTPOS payments must enter an agreement with one of the seven merchant service providers, which rent the terminal to the merchant. All the merchant's EFTPOS transactions are processed through one of these gateways. Some of these peers are:
* [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group]]
* [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]
* [[National Australia Bank]]
* [[Westpac|Westpac Banking Corporation]]
* Cuscal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuscal.com.au/ Home]. Cuscal. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First Data Network Australia (formerly Cashcard)
* Other

Other organisations may have peering agreements with the one or more of the central peers.

The network uses the [[AS 2805]] protocol, which is closely related to [[ISO 8583]].

EFTPOS is highly popular in New Zealand. The system is operated by two providers, Paymark Limited (formerly Electronic Transaction Services Limited) which processes 75% of all electronic transactions in New Zealand, and EFTPOS New Zealand. Although the term eftpos is popularly used to describe the system, EFTPOS is a trademark of EFTPOS New Zealand the smaller of the two providers. Both providers run an interconnected financial network that allows the processing of not only of debit cards at point of sale terminals but also [[credit card]]s and [[charge card]]s.

=== History ===
[[Image:Eftpos-nz-logo.gif|right|120px]]
The [[Bank of New Zealand]] introduced EFTPOS to [[New Zealand]] in 1985 through a pilot scheme with petrol stations.

In 1989 the system was officially launched and two providers owned by the major banks now run the system. The larger of the two providers, Paymark Limited (formerly Electronic Transaction Services Limited) is owned equally by [[ASB Bank]], [[Westpac]], Bank of New Zealand and [[ANZ Bank New Zealand]] (formerly ANZ National Bank).

In [[computer programming]], '''explicit parallelism''' is the representation
of concurrent computations by means of  primitives
in the form of special-purpose directives or function calls. Most parallel primitives are related to process synchronization, communication or task partitioning. As they seldom contribute to actually carry out the 
intended computation of the program, their computational cost is often considered
as [[parallelization overhead]].

The advantage of explicit [[parallel programming]] is the absolute programmer
control over the parallel execution. A skilled
parallel programmer takes advantage of explicit parallelism to produce
very efficient code.  However, programming with explicit parallelism is often difficult, especially for 
non computing specialists, because of the extra work involved in planning
the task division and synchronization of concurrent processes.  

In some instances, explicit parallelism may be avoided with the use of  an optimizing compiler that automatically extracts the parallelism inherent to computations (see [[implicit parallelism]]).

'''Figure of Insensitiveness''' (or ''F of I'') is an inverse scale of measure of the impact sensitivity of an explosive substance.  In this particular context the term 'Insensitiveness' refers to the likelihood of initiation/[[detonation]] by accidental means e.g. impact, friction, electrostatic discharge, application of flame, etc. It is a quantitative measure of the level of stimulus required to cause initiation, typically by shock/impact. 

The Figure of Insensitiveness is determined from impact testing, typically using a drop-weight tower. In this test, a small sample of the explosive is placed on a small steel anvil which  is slotted into a recess in the base of the drop tower. A cylindrical, 1 kilogram steel weight (mounted inside a tube to accurately guide its descent to the impact point in the centre of the anvil) is then dropped onto the test specimen from a measured height. The specimen is monitored both during and after this process to determine whether initiation occurs. This test is repeated many times, varying the drop height according to a prescribed method. Various heights are used, starting with a small distance (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and then progressively increasing it to as high as 3 metres. The series of drop heights and whether initiation occurred are analysed statistically to determine the drop height which has a 50% likelihood of initiating the explosives. The intention of these tests is to develop safety policies/rules which will govern the design, manufacturing, handling and storage of the explosive and any munitions containing it.

A reference standard sample of [[RDX]] is currently used to calibrate the drop tower, so that the drop height to produce 50% likelihood of initiation in this material is measured and recorded. The drop height required to initiate other explosives can then be related to the RDX standard, so that a ready comparison of impact sensitiveness between different explosives can be made.  By convention, explosives having a 50% initiation drop height equal to that of RDX are given a F of I of 80.

The scale was originally defined using [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] as the reference standard, with TNT having, by definition, an F of I of exactly 100. On this original scale, RDX yielded an F&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;I of around 80.  Following [[World War II]], when more complex explosive compositions replaced pure TNT as the most common energetic component of weapon systems, RDX was adopted as the reference standard.

Sensitiveness should not be confused with ''Sensitivity'' which is a measure of how easy it is to detonate an explosive, i.e. how sensitive it is to the mode of initiation to achieve a detonation.  In this context an explosive which has greater sensitivity, (like specificity) requires a more specific stimulus in order to detonate it.

A '''firearm''' is a portable gun (a [[Gun barrel|barreled]] [[ranged weapon]]) that inflicts damage on targets by launching one or more [[projectile]]s driven by rapidly expanding high-pressure gas produced ''chemically'' by exothermic combustion ([[deflagration]]) of [[propellant]] within an ammunition [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0188S1QXU/|title=Association of Firearm Instructors - Glossary of Firearm Terms|last=Cole|first=Suzanne N.|date=November 19, 2016|website=|publisher=Association of Firearm Instructors|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/firearm |title= Merriam-Webster Dictionary, "Firearm" |publisher= Merriam-webster.com |date= 2012-08-31 |accessdate= 2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|title= Firearm|dictionary= American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition= 4|year= 2000|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company}}{{cite dictionary|article= Firearm|dictionary= Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged|publisher= HarperCollins Publishers|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If gas pressurization is achieved through ''mechanical'' [[gas compression]] rather than through chemical propellant combustion, then the gun is technically an [[air gun]], not a firearm.&lt;ref name=atfairgun&gt;[http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/firearms-technology.html#air-gun-regulation US Federal Govt] does not consider an air gun to be a firearm and does not regulate airguns as firearms&lt;/ref&gt;

The first primitive firearms originated in 10th-century [[History of science and technology in China|China]] when [[bamboo]] tubes containing [[gunpowder]] and [[Lead shot|pellet]] projectiles were mounted on spears into the one-person-portable [[fire lance]],&lt;ref name=Helaine&gt;{{cite book|author= Helaine Selin|title= Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA389|accessdate= 30 July 2013|date= 1 January 1997|publisher= Springer|isbn= 978-0-7923-4066-9|page= 389}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was later used as a shock weapon to good effect in the [[Siege of De'an]] in 1132. In the 13th century the Chinese invented the metal-barrelled [[hand cannon]], widely considered{{by whom?|date=August 2018}} the true ancestor of all firearms.  The technology gradually spread through the rest of [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and Europe. Older firearms typically used [[Gunpowder|black powder]] as a [[propellant]], but modern firearms use [[smokeless powder]] or other propellants. Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of [[smoothbore]] [[shotgun]]s) have [[rifling |rifled]] barrels to impart spin to the [[projectile]] for improved flight stability.

Modern firearms can be described by their [[caliber]] (i.e. their bore diameter; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g. 7.5&amp;nbsp;mm, .357 in.) or in the case of shotguns their [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] (e.g. 12 ga.); by the type of action employed (muzzle, breech, lever, bolt, pump, revolver, semi-automatic, automatic etc.) together with the usual means of deportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and to the barrel length (24 inch), to the firing mechanism (e.g. [[matchlock]], [[wheellock]], [[flintlock]], [[percussion lock]]), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. [[Gatling gun]]). 

Shooters aim firearms at their targets with [[hand-eye coordination]], using either [[iron sights]] or [[Telescopic sight| optical sight]]s. The accurate range of pistols generally does not exceed {{convert|110|yd|m}}, while most rifles are accurate to {{convert|500|m|yd|order= flip}} using iron sights, or to longer ranges using optical sights (firearm rounds may be dangerous or lethal well beyond their accurate range; the minimum distance for safety is much greater than the specified range). Purpose-built [[sniper rifle]]s and [[anti-materiel rifle]]s are accurate to ranges of more than {{convert|2000|m|yd|order=flip}}.

====Handguns====

{{main|Handgun}}
[[File:Full cock3.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver]]
[[File:Glock17.jpg|thumb|A [[Glock|Glock 17]] semi-automatic [[pistol]]]]
The smallest of all firearms is the handgun. There are two common types of handguns: [[revolvers]] and [[semi-automatic pistol]]s. Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or "charge holes" in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the cylinder is loaded with a single cartridge or charge. Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine so they can be used to fire more than one round. Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate the mechanism so that the next cartridge may be fired immediately. This is opposed to "[[double-action]]" revolvers which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to the trigger pull.

Prior to the 19th century, virtually all handguns were single-shot muzzleloaders.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular. Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in military applications by the end of World War I. By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]], although revolvers were still widely used. Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one. Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for self-defense) and the strength, simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use. Revolvers, especially in [[.22 LR]] and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] in jurisdictions allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining reliable. Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner's intention (self-defense, hunting, target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).

====Long guns====
{{main|Long gun}}
A long gun is generally any firearm that is larger than a handgun and is designed to be held and fired with both hands, either from the hip or the shoulder. Long guns typically have a barrel between 10 and 30 inches (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a matter of practicality), that along with the receiver and trigger group is mounted into a wood, plastic, metal or composite ''stock'', composed of one or more pieces that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the ''butt''. Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called [[musket]]s or [[arquebus]] depending on caliber and firing mechanism.

=====Rifles and shotguns=====
{{main|Rifle|Shotgun}}
[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|right|Springfield Armory [[M1903 Springfield|M1903 rifle]]]]
Most modern [[long gun]]s are either [[rifle]]s or [[shotgun]]s. Both are the successors of the musket, diverging from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so named for the spiral fluting ([[rifling]]) machined into the inner surface of its barrel, which imparts a self-stabilizing spin to the single [[bullet]]s it fires. Shotguns are predominantly [[smoothbore]] firearms designed to fire a number of ''[[Shot (pellet)|shot]]''; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2&amp;nbsp;mm #9 birdshot and 8.4&amp;nbsp;mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single [[shotgun slug|slugs]], or specialty (often "[[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal]]") rounds such as [[Bean bag round|bean bags]], tear gas or [[breaching round]]s. Rifles have a very small impact area but a long range and high accuracy. Shotguns have a large impact area with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area can compensate for reduced accuracy, since [[Shotgun shell#Spread|shot spreads]] during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for flying game.

Rifles and shotguns are commonly used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.

There are a variety of types of rifles and shotguns based on the method they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism recocked, and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called 'pump-action') rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.

Both rifles and shotguns also come in break-action varieties that do not have any kind of reloading mechanism at all but must be hand-loaded after each shot. Both rifles and shotguns come in single- and double-barreled varieties; however due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing, double-barreled rifles are rare. Double-barreled rifles are typically intended for African big-game hunts where the animals are dangerous, ranges are short, and speed is of the essence. Very large and powerful calibers are normal for these firearms.

Rifles have been in nationally featured marksmanship events in Europe and the United States since at least the 18th century, when rifles were first becoming widely available. One of the earliest purely "American" rifle-shooting competitions took place in 1775, when Daniel Morgan was recruiting sharpshooters in Virginia for the impending [[American Revolutionary War]]. In some countries, rifle marksmanship is still a matter of national pride. Some specialized rifles in the larger calibers are claimed to have an accurate range of up to about {{convert|1|mi|m}}, although most have considerably less. In the second half of the 20th century, competitive shotgun sports became perhaps even more popular than riflery, largely due to the motion and immediate feedback in activities such as skeet, trap and sporting clays.

In military use, bolt-action rifles with high-power scopes are common as sniper rifles, however by the [[Korean War]] the traditional bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles used by infantrymen had been supplemented by select-fire designs known as "automatic rifles".

=====Carbines=====
{{main|Carbine}}
A carbine is a firearm similar to a rifle in form and intended usage, but generally shorter or smaller than the typical "full-size" hunting or battle rifle of a similar time period, and sometimes using a smaller or less-powerful cartridge. Carbines were and are typically used by members of the military in roles that are expected to engage in combat, but where a full-size rifle would be an impediment to the primary duties of that soldier (vehicle drivers, field commanders and support staff, airborne troops, engineers, etc.). Carbines are also common in law enforcement and among civilian owners where similar size, space and/or power concerns may exist. Carbines, like rifles, can be single-shot, repeating-action, semi-automatic or select-fire/fully automatic, generally depending on the time period and intended market. Common historical examples include the [[Winchester Model 1892]], Lee–Enfield "[[Jungle Carbine]]", [[SKS]], [[M1 carbine]] (no relation to the larger [[M1 Garand]]) and [[M4 carbine]] (a more compact variant of the current [[M16 rifle]]). Modern U.S. civilian carbines include compact customizations of the [[AR-15]], [[Ruger Mini-14]], [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]], [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], bolt-action rifles generally falling under the specifications of a [[scout rifle]], and aftermarket conversion kits for popular pistols including the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and [[Glock]] models.

=====Machine guns=====
{{main|Machine gun}}

[[File:MG42 Sideview.jpg|thumb|[[MG 42]] general-purpose machine gun with retracted bipod]]

A machine gun is a fully automatic emplaceable weapon, most often separated from other classes of automatic weapon by the use of belt-fed ammunition (though some designs employ drum, pan or hopper magazines), generally in a rifle-inspired caliber ranging between [[5.56×45mm NATO]] (.223 Remington) for a [[light machine gun]] to as large as [[.50 BMG]] or even larger for crewed or aircraft weapons. Although not widely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by militaries in the second half of the 19th century. Notables in the U.S. arsenal during the 20th century included the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun and [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] .30 caliber medium machine gun, and the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] [[7.62×51mm NATO]] general-purpose machine gun which came into use around the Vietnam War. Machine guns of this type were originally defensive firearms crewed by at least two men, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, their ammunition, and their tripod. In contrast, modern [[light machine gun]]s such as the [[FN Minimi]] are often wielded by a single infantryman. They provide a large ammunition capacity and a high rate of fire, and are typically used to give suppressing fire during infantry movement. Accuracy on machine guns varies based on a wide number of factors from design to manufacturing tolerances, most of which have been improved over time. Machine guns are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, and have been used since World War I as offensive firearms in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g. for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).

The definition of machine gun is different in U.S. law. The [[National Firearms Act]] and [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] define a "machine gun" in the United States code ''Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, § 5845'' as:
"... any firearm which shoots ... automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger". "Machine gun" is therefore largely synonymous with "automatic weapon" in the U.S. civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.

=====Submachine guns=====
{{main|Submachine gun}}
[[File:Normal skorpion 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Czechoslovak 7.65 mm [[submachine gun]] [[Škorpion vz. 61]] designed in 1959.]]
A submachine gun is a magazine-fed firearm, usually smaller than other automatic firearms, that fires [[pistol]]-caliber ammunition; for this reason certain submachine guns can also be referred to as ''machine pistols'', especially when referring to handgun-sized designs such as the [[Škorpion vz. 61]] and [[Glock#9×19mm Parabellum|Glock 18]]. Well-known examples are the Israeli [[Uzi]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]] which use the [[9×19mm Parabellum]] cartridge, and the American [[Thompson submachine gun]] which fires [[.45 ACP]]. Because of their small size and limited projectile penetration compared to high-power rifle rounds, submachine guns are commonly favored by military, paramilitary and police forces for close-quarters engagements such as inside buildings, in urban areas or in trench complexes.

Submachine guns were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can be used in fully automatic in a controllable manner due to the lighter recoil of the pistol ammunition. They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military. In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5. The MP5 is actually designated as a "machine pistol" by Heckler &amp; Koch (MP5 stands for ''Maschinenpistole 5'', or Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the MAC-10 and [[Glock#9×19mm Parabellum|Glock 18]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.

=====Automatic rifles=====
{{main|Automatic rifle}}
An automatic rifle is a magazine-fed firearm, wielded by a single infantryman, that is chambered for rifle cartridges and capable of automatic fire. The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] was the first U.S. infantry weapon of this type, and was generally used for suppressive or support fire in the role now usually filled by the [[light machine gun]]. Other early automatic rifles include the [[Fedorov Avtomat]] and the [[Huot Automatic Rifle]]. Later, German forces fielded the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] during [[World War II]], a light automatic rifle firing a reduced power "[[intermediate cartridge]]". This design was to become the basis for the "[[assault rifle]]" subclass of automatic weapons, as contrasted with "[[battle rifle]]s", which generally fire a traditional "full-power" rifle cartridge.

=====Assault rifles=====
{{main|Assault rifle}}
[[File:Marine AK-47.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Marine]]s train with the AK-47.]]
In [[World War II]], Germany introduced the [[StG 44]], and brought to the forefront of firearm technology what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military, the assault rifle. An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a [[battle rifle]] such as the [[Karabiner 98k]], but the chief differences defining an assault rifle are [[Selective_fire|select-fire capability]] and the use of a rifle round of lesser power, known as an [[intermediate cartridge]].   

Soviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the German concept, using a less-powerful 7.62×39mm cartridge derived from the standard 7.62×54mmR Russian battle rifle round, to produce the [[AK-47]], which has become the world's most widely used assault rifle. Soon after World War II, the Automatic Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began to be fielded by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies in the Eastern Bloc, as well as by nations such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam.

In the United States, the assault rifle design was later in coming; the replacement for the M1 Garand of WWII was another John Garand design chambered for the new [[7.62×51mm NATO]] cartridge; the select-fire [[M14 rifle|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil of the M14 when fired in full-automatic mode was seen as a problem as it reduced accuracy, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]'s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the powerful .30 caliber cartridges used by the U.S. military up until early in the Vietnam War to the much less powerful but far lighter and light recoiling .223 caliber (5.56mm) [[intermediate cartridge]]. The military later designated the AR-15 as the "[[M16 rifle|M16]]". The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although to conform to [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|B.A.T.F.E.]] regulations in the U.S., it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.

Variants of both of the M16 and AK-47 are still in wide international use today, though other automatic rifle designs have since been introduced. A smaller version of the M16A2, the [[M4 carbine]], is widely used by U.S. and NATO tank and vehicle crews, airbornes, support staff, and in other scenarios where space is limited. The [[IMI Galil]], an Israeli-designed weapon based on the action of the AK-47, is in use by Israel, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, and Colombia. [[Swiss Arms]] of Switzerland produces the [[SIG SG 550]] assault rifle used by France, Chile, and Spain among others, and [[Steyr Mannlicher]] produces the [[Steyr AUG|AUG]], a [[bullpup]] rifle in use in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia among other nations.

Modern designs call for compact weapons retaining firepower. The bullpup design, by mounting the magazine behind the trigger, unifies the accuracy and firepower of the traditional assault rifle with the compact size of the submachine gun (though submachine guns are still used); examples are the French [[FAMAS]] and the British [[SA80]].

=====Personal defense weapons=====
{{main|Personal defense weapon}}
A recently developed class of firearm is the [[personal defense weapon]] or PDW, which is in simplest terms a [[submachine gun]] designed to fire ammunitions with ballistic performance similar to rifle cartridges.  While a submachine gun is desirable for its compact size and ammunition capacity, its pistol cartridges lack the penetrating capability of a rifle round.  Conversely, rifle bullets can pierce light armor and are easier to shoot accurately, but even a [[carbine]] such as the Colt M4 is larger and/or longer than a submachine gun, making it harder to maneuver in close quarters.  The solution many firearms manufacturers have presented is a weapon resembling a submachine gun in size and general configuration, but which fires a higher-powered armor-penetrating round (often specially designed for the weapon), thus combining the advantages of a carbine and submachine gun.  This also earned the PDWs an infrequently used nickname — the submachine carbines.  The [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP7]] are most famous examples of PDWs.

===Function===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Firearm action}}
Firearms are also categorized by their functioning cycle or "action" which describes its loading, firing, and unloading cycle.

====Manual====
The earliest evolution of the firearm, there are many types of manual action firearms. These can be divided into two basic categories: [[single shot]] and [[Repeating rifle|repeating]].

A single shot firearm can only be fired once per equipped barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.

====Semi-automatic====
{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}
A semi-automatic, self-loading, or "auto loader" firearm is one that performs all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with "fully automatic" firearms.  (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified "Assault Weapons" which refers to those that continue to fire until the finger no longer depressed the trigger.

====Automatic====
An ''automatic'' firearm, or "fully automatic", "fully auto", or "full auto", is generally defined as one that continues to load and fire cartridges from its magazine as long as the trigger is depressed (and until the magazine is depleted of available ammunition. The first weapon generally considered in this category is the [[Gatling gun]], originally a carriage-mounted, crank-operated firearm with multiple rotating barrels that was fielded in the [[American Civil War]]. The modern trigger-actuated machine gun began with various designs developed in the late 19th century and fielded in [[World War I]], such as the [[Maxim gun]], [[Lewis Gun]], and [[MG 08|MG 08 "Spandau"]]. Most automatic weapons are classed as long guns (as the ammunition used is of similar type as for rifles, and the recoil of the weapon's rapid fire is better controlled with two hands), but handgun-sized automatic weapons also exist, generally in the "submachine gun" or "machine pistol" class.

====Selective fire====
{{main|Selective fire}}
'''Selective fire''', or "select fire", means the capability of a weapon's fire control to be adjusted in either semi-automatic or fully automatic firing modes.  The modes are chosen by means of a selector, which varies depending on the weapon's design.  Some selective-fire weapons have [[burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mechanisms built in to limit the maximum number of shots fired in fully automatic mode, with most common limits being two or three rounds per trigger pull.  The presence of selective-fire modes on firearms allows more efficient use of ammunition for specific tactical needs, either precision-aimed or [[suppressive fire]].  This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries, most notably the [[assault rifle]]s.

{{main|History of the firearm}}
{{see also|History of gunpowder}}
The first primitive firearms were invented about 1250 A.D. in [[History of science and technology in China|China]] when the man-portable [[fire lance]] (a bamboo or metal tube that could shoot ignited [[gunpowder]]) was combined with projectiles such as scrap metal, broken porcelain, or darts/arrows.&lt;ref name=Helaine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ho Peng Yoke |editor-first=Helaine |date=1 January 1997 |year= |editor-last=Selin |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures |title=Gunpowder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA389 |access-date=30 July 2013 |language= |edition= |publisher=Springer |volume= |location= |id= |isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9 |oclc= |doi= |page=389 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest depiction of a firearm is a sculpture from a cave in [[Sichuan]], China. The sculpture dates to the 12th century and is of a figure carrying a vase-shaped [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]], with flames and a [[Round shot|cannonball]] coming out of it.&lt;ref name=Chase&gt;{{Harvcolnb |Chase|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The oldest surviving gun, a [[hand cannon]] made of bronze, has been dated to 1288 because it was discovered at a site in modern-day [[Acheng District]], [[Heilongjiang]], China, where the ''Yuan Shi'' records that battles were fought at that time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 293 294"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Needham|1986|pp=293–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firearm had a 6.9 inch barrel of a 1-inch diameter, a 2.6 inch chamber for the gunpowder and a socket for the firearm's handle. It is 13.4 inches long and 7.8 pounds without the handle, which would have been made of wood.&lt;ref name=Chase /&gt;{{rp|32}}

The Europeans and Arabs (first Mamluks) obtained firearms in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Chase /&gt;{{rp|1}} The Koreans adopted firearms from the Chinese in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, (first Aq Qoyunlu and Safavids), and Indians (first Mughals) all got them no later than the 15th century. In each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.&lt;ref name=Chase /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

The development behind firearms accelerated during the 19th and 20th centuries. Breech-loading became more or less a universal standard for the reloading of most hand-held firearms and continues to be so with some notable exceptions (such as mortars). Instead of loading individual rounds into weapons, magazines holding multiple munitions were adopted&amp;mdash;these aided rapid reloading. Automatic and semi-automatic firing mechanisms meant that a single soldier could fire many more rounds in a minute than a vintage weapon could fire over the course of a battle. Polymers and alloys in firearm construction made weaponry progressively lighter and thus easier to deploy. Ammunition changed over the centuries from simple metallic ball-shaped projectiles that rattled down the barrel to bullets and cartridges manufactured to high precision. Especially in the past century has particular attention been devoted to accuracy and sighting to make firearms altogether far more accurate than ever before. More than any single factor though, firearms have proliferated due to the advent of mass production&amp;mdash;enabling arms manufacturers to produce large quantities of weaponry to a consistent standard.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The force of a projectile is related to the kinetic energy imparted to it, given by the formula &lt;math&gt;E_\text{k} =\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the projectile.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Generally, kinetic energy can be enhanced in two ways:

* By increasing the mass of the bullet, either by increasing caliber (and thus size and weight), or by using denser materials like uranium or tungsten.
* By increasing the projectile's velocity, through better or larger propellant charges, through better manufacturing tolerances and materials in bullet and barrel, or through longer barrels.

Velocities of bullets increased with the use of a "jacket" of a metal such as copper or copper alloys that covered a lead core and allowed the bullet to glide down the barrel more easily than exposed lead. Such bullets are designated as "full metal jacket" (FMJ). Such FMJ bullets are less likely to fragment on impact and are more likely to traverse through a target while imparting less energy. Hence, FMJ bullets impart less tissue damage than non-jacketed bullets that expand. (Dougherty and Eidt, 2009) This led to their adoption for military use by countries adhering to the Hague Convention in 1899.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

That said, the basic principle behind firearm operation remains unchanged to this day. A musket of several centuries ago is still similar in principle to a modern-day assault rifle&amp;mdash;using the expansion of gases to propel projectiles over long distances&amp;mdash;albeit less accurately and rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/07/the-inaccuracy-of-muskets/|title=The Inaccuracy of Muskets - Journal of the American Revolution|date=2013-07-15|work=Journal of the American Revolution|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
====Early models====
=====Fire lances=====
{{main|Fire lance}}
The Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} was the direct predecessor to the modern concept of the firearm. It was not a gun itself, but an addition to the soldiers' spears. Originally it consisted of paper or bamboo barrels that would have incendiary gunpowder within it, that could be lit one time and would project flames at the enemy. Sometimes the Chinese troops would place small projectiles within the barrel that would also be projected when the gunpowder was lit, but most of the explosive force would create flames. Later, the barrel was changed to be made of metal, so that a more explosive gunpowder could be used and put more force into the propulsion of the projectile.&lt;ref name=Chase /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}

=====Hand cannons=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Hand cannon}}
[[File:Lgehumble 1400.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] being fired from a stand, "Belli Fortis", manuscript, by Konrad Kyeser, 1400]]
The original predecessor of all firearms, the Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} and [[hand cannon]] were loaded with gunpowder and the shot (initially [[lead shot]], later replaced by cast iron{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}) through the muzzle, while a fuse was placed at the rear. This fuse was lit, causing the gunpowder to ignite and propel the cannonball. In military use, the standard hand cannon was tremendously powerful, while also being somewhat useless{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} due to relative inability of the gunner to aim the weapon, or control the ballistic properties of the projectile. Recoil could be absorbed by bracing the barrel against the ground using a wooden support, the forerunner of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Neither the quality or amount of gunpowder, nor the consistency in projectile dimensions were controlled, with resulting inaccuracy in firing due to [[windage]], variance in gunpowder composition, and the difference in diameter between the [[Caliber|bore]] and the shot. The [[hand cannon]]s were replaced by lighter carriage-mounted [[artillery]] pieces, and ultimately the [[arquebus]].

=====Muskets=====
{{main|Musket}}
[[Muzzleloader|Muzzle-loading]] muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first firearms developed.{{when|date=August 2018}} The firearm was loaded through the muzzle with gunpowder, optionally some wadding and then a bullet (usually a solid lead ball, but musketeers could shoot stones when they ran out of bullets). Greatly improved muzzleloaders (usually rifled instead of smooth-bored) are manufactured today and have many enthusiasts, many of whom hunt large and small game with their guns. Muzzleloaders have to be manually reloaded after each shot; a skilled archer could fire multiple arrows faster than most early muskets could be reloaded and fired, although by the mid-18th century, when muzzleloaders became the standard small armament of the military, a well-drilled soldier could fire six rounds in a minute using prepared cartridges in his musket. Before then, effectiveness of muzzleloaders was hindered by both the low reloading speed and, before the firing mechanism was perfected, the very high risk posed by the firearm to the person attempting to fire it.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

One interesting solution to the reloading problem was the "Roman Candle Gun" with [[superposed load]]s. This was a muzzleloader in which multiple charges and balls were loaded one on top of the other, with a small hole in each ball to allow the subsequent charge to be ignited after the one ahead of it was ignited. It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of "automatic" fire long before the advent of the machine gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm#3|title=Roman Candle Gun|work=Scotwars.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302211812/http://scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loading techniques====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Muzzleloader}}
[[File:Meyers b8 s0102a.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Percussion cap]] and early [[bolt action]] form]]
Most early firearms were muzzle-loading. This form of loading has several disadvantages, such as a slow rate of fire and having to expose oneself to enemy fire to reload as the weapon had to be pointed upright so the powder could be poured through the muzzle into the breech followed by the ramming the projectile into the breech. As effective methods of sealing the breech were developed through the development of sturdy, weatherproof, self-contained metallic cartridges, muzzle-loaders were replaced by single-shot breech loaders. Eventually single-shot weapons were replaced by the following repeater type weapons.

====Internal magazines====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Magazine (firearms)}}
Many firearms made in the late 19th century through the 1950s used internal magazines to load the cartridge into the chamber of the weapon. The most notable and revolutionary weapons of this period appeared during the U.S. Civil War and they were the [[Spencer rifle|Spencer]] and [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifles. Both used fixed tubular magazines, the former having the magazine in the buttstock and the latter under the barrel which allowed a larger capacity. Later weapons used fixed box magazines that could not be removed from the weapon without disassembling the weapon itself. Fixed magazines permitted the use of larger cartridges and eliminated the hazard of having the bullet of one cartridge butting next to the primer or rim of another cartridge. These magazines are loaded while they are in the weapon, often using a stripper clip. A clip is used to transfer cartridges into the magazine. Some notable weapons that use internal magazines include the [[Mosin–Nagant]], the [[Mauser Kar 98k]], the [[Springfield M1903]], the [[M1 Garand]], and the [[SKS]]. Firearms that have internal magazines are usually, but not always, rifles. Some exceptions to this include the Mauser C96 pistol, which uses an internal magazine, and the [[Breda 30]], an Italian light machine gun.

====Detachable magazines====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
Many modern firearms use what are called detachable or box magazines as their method of chambering a cartridge. Detachable magazines can be removed from the weapon without disassembling the firearms, usually by pushing the magazine release.

====Belt-fed weapons====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Belt (firearm)}}
A belt or ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due to the effects of oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.

====Firing mechanisms====
{{further|Trigger (firearms)|Firearm action}}

=====Matchlock=====
{{main|Matchlock}}
[[Matchlock]]s were the first and simplest firearms firing mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a "match". The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a "touch hole" at the base of the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel. The match usually had to be relit after each firing. The main parts to the matchlock firing mechanism are the pan, match, arm and trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/move/musket |title=&gt; Where Are You From? |publisher=Credo Reference |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benefit of the pan and arm swivel being moved to the side of the gun was it gave a clear line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, William. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare. Franklin Lakes, NJ: New Page, 2005. 71–74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage to the matchlock firing mechanism is that it did not misfire. However, it also came with some disadvantages. One disadvantage was if it was raining the match could not be kept lit to fire the weapon.  Another issue with the match was it could give away the position of soldiers because of the glow, sound, and smell.&lt;ref&gt;Saidel, Benjamin. "Matchlocks, Flintlocks, and Saltpetre: The Chronological Implications for the Use of Matchlock Muskets among Ottoman-Period Bedouin in the Southern Levant." ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'' 4 (2000): 191–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wheellock=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Wheellock}}
The [[wheellock]] action, a successor to the matchlock, predated the flintlock. Despite its many faults, the wheellock was a significant improvement over the matchlock in terms of both convenience and safety, since it eliminated the need to keep a smoldering match in proximity to loose gunpowder. It operated using a small wheel much like that on [[Lighter|cigarette lighters]] which was wound up with a key before use and which, when the trigger was pulled, spun against a flint, creating the shower of sparks that ignited the powder in the touch hole. Supposedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the Italian [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], the wheellock action was an innovation that was not widely adopted due to the high cost of the clockwork mechanism.

=====Flintlock=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{main|Flintlock}}
The [[flintlock]] action was a major innovation in firearm design. The spark used to ignite the gunpowder in the touch hole was supplied by a sharpened piece of flint clamped in the jaws of a "cock" which, when released by the trigger, struck a piece of steel called the "[[frizzen]]" to create the necessary sparks. (The spring-loaded arm that holds a piece of flint or pyrite is referred to as a cock because of its resemblance to a rooster.) The cock had to be manually reset after each firing, and the flint had to be replaced periodically due to wear from striking the frizzen. (See also [[flintlock mechanism]], [[snaphance]], [[Miquelet lock]]) The flintlock was widely used during the 18th and 19th centuries in both muskets and rifles.

=====Percussion cap=====
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{further|Percussion cap|Caplock mechanism}}
[[Percussion cap]]s ([[caplock mechanism]]s), coming into wide service in the 19th century, were a dramatic improvement over flintlocks. With the percussion cap mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding firearms was replaced by a completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass "cap". The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a "nipple") and ignited by the impact of the gun's "hammer". (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.) In the case of percussion caps the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap in order to keep the cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter.

Once struck, the flame from the cap in turn ignited the main charge of gunpowder, as with the flintlock, but there was no longer any need to charge the touch hole with gunpowder, and even better, the touch hole was no longer exposed to the elements. As a result, the percussion cap mechanism was considerably safer, far more weatherproof, and vastly more reliable (cloth-bound cartridges containing a premeasured charge of gunpowder and a ball had been in regular military service for many years, but the exposed gunpowder in the entry to the touch hole had long been a source of misfires). All [[muzzleloader]]s manufactured since the second half of the 19th century use percussion caps except those built as replicas of the flintlock or earlier firearms.

A major innovation in firearms and light artillery came in the second half of the 19th century when ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder, was combined in a single metallic (usually brass) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] containing a percussion cap, powder, and a bullet in one weatherproof package. The main technical advantage of the brass cartridge case was the effective and reliable sealing of high pressure gasses at the breech, as the gas pressure forces the cartridge case to expand outward, pressing it firmly against the inside of the gun barrel chamber.  This prevents the leakage of hot gas which could injure the shooter. The brass cartridge also opened the way for modern repeating arms, by uniting the bullet, gunpowder and primer into one assembly that could be fed reliably into the breech by a mechanical action in the firearm.

Before this, a "cartridge" was simply a premeasured quantity of [[gunpowder]] together with a ball in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder), which also acted as [[wadding]] for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called "primers") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is at the base of the cartridge, either within the rim (a "[[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]]" cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a "[[centerfire]]" cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.

Nearly all contemporary firearms load cartridges directly into their [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]]. Some additionally or exclusively load from a [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that holds multiple cartridges. A magazine is defined as a part of the firearm which exists to store ammunition and assist in its feeding by the action into the breech (such as through the rotation of a revolver's cylinder or by spring-loaded platforms in most pistol and rifle designs). Some magazines, such as that of most centerfire hunting rifles and all revolvers, are internal to and inseparable from the firearm, and are loaded by using a "clip".  A [[clip (ammunition)|clip]], often mistakingly used to refer to a detachable "magazine", is a device that holds the ammunition by the rim of the case and is designed to assist the shooter in reloading the firearm's magazine. Examples include revolver [[speedloader]]s, the [[stripper clip]] used to aid loading rifles such as the [[Lee–Enfield]] or [[Mauser 98]], and the [[En-bloc clip#En bloc|en-bloc clip]] used in loading the [[M1 Garand]]. In this sense, "magazines" and "clips", though often used synonymously, refer to different types of devices.

====Repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms====

Many firearms are "single shot": i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge. The classic single-barreled shotgun is a good example. A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the firearm is re-cocked is considered a "repeating firearm" or simply a "repeater". A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of repeating firearms. A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a semi-automatic or autoloading firearm.

The first "rapid firing" firearms were usually similar to the 19th century [[Gatling gun]], which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the "rapid" firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it, thus the operator needed only to pull a trigger (which made the firing mechanisms truly "automatic"). An [[automatic (firearm)|automatic]] (or "fully automatic") firearm is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. An automatic firearm is capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The [[Gatling gun]] may have been the first automatic weapon, though the modern trigger-actuated machine gun was not widely introduced until the [[World War I|First World War]] with the German "[[MG 08|Spandau]]" and British [[Lewis Gun]]. Automatic rifles such as the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared in this time. Many modern military firearms have a [[selective fire]] option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made [[M16 rifle|M16]], continuous fully automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic burst of three cartridges (this conserves ammunition and increases controllability). Automatic weapons are largely restricted to military and paramilitary organizations, though many automatic designs are infamous for their use by civilians.

'''Fischer Connectors''' designs and manufactures a  range of circular [[push–pull connector]]s.

Founded in 1954, the headquarters and manufacturing facility is based in [[St-Prex]], [[Switzerland]], with cable assembly facilities in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and subsidiaries and distributors worldwide. Fischer Connectors’ circular push-pull connectors and cable assembly solutions – both electrical and optical – are used in numerous applications.

Fisher connectors comply with international quality standards, including [[ISO 9001]], [[ISO 13485]], [[ISO 14001]], [[OHSAS 18001]], [https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach/understanding-reach REACH] and [[ROHS]].

==History==
Walter Werner Fischer, a pioneering Swiss engineer, founded the company in 1954 in [[Morges, Switzerland]]. The company developed the first sealed connector and, in 1962, took out an international patent on its proprietary push-pull locking system. In 1964 it developed a [[hermetic seal|hermetic]] connector.

Overseas expansion started with the first subsidiary being established in the UK in 1988, followed by other European countries, North America in 1991 and the first Asian subsidiary in Hong Kong in 2000.

In 2017, Fischer Connectors became partner to SolarStratos. In the PriceWaterHouseCoopers Study presented at the 18th Swiss Economic Forum in Interlaken on June 1, 2017, Fischer Connectors was designated Swiss Champion 2017 for its Industry 4.0 approach.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:FishingLight.ogv|thumb|In this video, dozens of 15-18 inch speckled trout are attracted to a 1000 W green light mounted on a pier.]]
A '''fishing light attractor''' is a [[fishing]] aid which uses [[light]]s attached to structure above water or suspended underwater to attract both [[fish]] and members of their [[food chain]] to specific areas in order to harvest them.

==Purpose==
Just as fisherman seek conditions where the chance of catching fish is optimized, fish seek areas where the chance of catching their food is optimal. Most game fish seek waters that are rich in food such as smaller fish, [[insect]]s or [[shrimp]]. And, it follows, that these smaller fish, insects and shrimp congregate where their food is most concentrated.

Scientific research shows that all members of this food chain have eyes sensitive to the colors [[blue]] and [[green]]. This probably evolved because the water absorbs longer wavelengths (Mobley 1994; Hou, 2013). The color of the body of the water is largely based on the constituents inside, combined with the absorption spectrum of the light in water. The colored dissolved organic matter in the water will absorb blue light very fast, then green, then yellow (exponential decay with wavelength), thus give the water a brownish look. Keep in mind that the transmission window of light in the water is very narrow and red light gets absorbed very fast. See above reference for details.

Fish and some members of their food chain have color receptors in their eyes optimized for the light of their “space”. Eyes that can see a single space color can detect changes in light intensity. This is equivalent to a world in black, white and shades of gray. In this simplest level of visual information processing, an animal can recognize that something is different in its space—i.e., that there is food or a predator “over there”. Most animals living in a lighted world have an additional visual resource: color vision.  By definition, that requires that they have color receptors containing at least two different visual pigments. To efficiently perform this function in water illuminated with light, an aquatic animal would have visual pigments sensitive to the background “space” color and one or more visual pigments offset from this blue-green region, say, in the red or ultraviolet region of the spectrum. This imparts a clear survival advantage to these animals because they can detect not only changes in light intensity but also contrasts in color.  Many fish, for example, have two color receptors, one in the blue region of the spectra (425-490&amp;nbsp;nm) and the other in the near UV (320-380&amp;nbsp;nm). Insects and shrimp, members of the fish food chain, have blue, green (530&amp;nbsp;nm) and near UV receptors.  In fact, some aquatic animals have up to ten different classes of visual pigment in their eyes. By comparison, humans have three with maximum sensitivities in the blue (442&amp;nbsp;nm), green (543&amp;nbsp;nm) and yellow (570&amp;nbsp;nm). It is the differential responses of these receptor cells that enable color vision.

It has been known for a long time that a light attracts fish, shrimp and insects at night. But what is the best color for a light attractor? Based on the biology of visual receptors discussed above, the light should be blue or green — the space colors of fish and members of their food chain. However, while blue or green light is desirable it is not essential. Even if the eyes of fish or members of its food chain have color receptors most sensitive to the blue or green, these same receptors have a broad but decreased sensitivity to other colors. So, if a fishing light source is intense enough, other light colors will also attract. For example, a sodium vapor light with its characteristic yellow color will attract fish — if intense enough. A fishing light attractor can also be white light because a portion of its total energy is in the blue to green region.

The perfect fishing light would have the following properties: 1) high intensity, 2) emit its light in a color similar to the fishes space (blue or green), 3) be powered by a portable electrical supply and 4) be submersible. The last attribute is desirable because significant amounts of light energy from land- or boat-mounted lights are lost by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] off the surface of the water. No commercial light satisfies all four of these criteria. For example, many high intensity lights such as [[tungsten-halogen bulb|tungsten-halogen]] (incandescent), medium pressure mercury or metal-halide discharge lights are so power hungry that they can only be operated for very short periods of time on a battery, thus compromising convenient portability. While [[LED]]s and [[fluorescent lights]] draw much less electrical energy, most are not very bright. Further, many of the above lights cannot be submerged in water without risk of electrical shock or damage to the light system.

==Types==
[[File:Underwater Fishing Light.JPG|thumb|right|A permanently [[Underwater|submerged]] lamp used as a fish attractant.]]
Fishing lights fall into two different groups: those that are portable and those that are permanently mounted. Generally, portable lights are powered by batteries and this sets practical limits to the kind of light that can be used. Most portable light sources are relatively low in light intensity and have short operating times. Lights drawing more than a few tens of watts are not practical. The old classic, a 12 volt automobile incandescent headlight mounted on a Styrofoam float ring, is probably the least expensive and lasts for a few hours before the battery is discharged. Battery-operated [[fluorescent lamp]]s are three times more efficient in converting electricity to light. Therefore, comparing lamps of similar brightness, they can be operated about three times longer before the battery is discharged. Also, the operating lifetime of fluorescent lights are about ten times longer than incandescent lights.  Commercial portable fishing lights based on fluorescent lamps vary widely in intensity. The best use 25-40 watt lamps that emit about 1000–3000 [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]] per tube.  Costing $100–$200, they are available through the internet, sport stores and catalogs.

Permanent lights are typically powered with 115 volt house current. Placed on poles at the end of a dock or pier, the least expensive lights for outdoor use are security or flood lights using a mercury vapor, high pressure sodium vapor, metal-halide discharge or fluorescent bulb. They cost $25 to $100.  While lower cost 115 V AC outdoor flood lights using standard tungsten ([[incandescent]]) or [[tungsten-halogen]] (quartz) bulbs can also be effective fish attractors, they are energy inefficient. It takes about five 100 watt tungsten lamps to deliver the light equivalent of one security lamp. Security lights are readily available from most hardware or farm supply stores. The fixture includes a photocell controller for automatic dusk-to-dawn operation and comes complete with an appropriate bulb. Most of these lights are bright (6-8 thousand lumens), efficient in converting electricity to light (operated daily for 8 hours, electrical supply costs $40–$100 per year), have long bulb lifetimes (24,000 hours) and stand up well to outside weather conditions. When used as a fishing light, light output can be redirected toward the water by installing a 5” X 10” piece of aluminum flashing or heavy foil bent into a half circle and placed next to the lamp's circular acrylic lens.  Flood lights made up of LED lights (Light Emitting Diodes) are an up-and-comer. They are extremely efficient in converting electrical energy to light. Their brightness, arranged as large arrays of LEDs, can now provide up to 36,000 Lumens per fixture, a value quite sufficient to function as a fishing light. Currently available via the internet and some specialty stores, they sell for $120 - $350.

Stadium spot lights are energy efficient and their superior brightness illuminates a large area of water. Rated at 250, 400, 1000 and 1500 watts, the high intensity metal-halide discharge lamp, parabola-shaped reflector and light ballast are each sold separately. A complete light fixture and lamp costs about $400–$500. The cost of lamps with different wattage ratings are similar, so most people chose higher wattage lamps. The bulbs in these lamps can emit white, blue-green, green or yellow light. For most fishing waters the lamp color of choice is green, but it should be emphasized that all colors are effective in attracting fish. They are available through specialty light stores. It takes two people to install these big lamps and the installation may also include a switch, timer, heavy gauge wiring and a circuit breaker, thus adding to the cost.

As mentioned earlier, a significant fraction of the light shining on the surface of the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet.  The power ballast and lamp housing is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of a submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough during operation to prevent establishment of marine growth on its surface.  If the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated every night for at least an hour, occasional manual cleaning is required.
 
A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the location of increasing concentrations of [[bait fish]] attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly — often arriving at predictable times of the evening.

"Sulfuric fire fishing" is a traditional technique practiced in [[Taiwan]] where acetylene is burned to attract fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jinshan Sulfuric Fire Fishing|url=http://fishery.ntpc.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&amp;flag=detail&amp;ids=102&amp;article_id=281|website=New Taipei City Government|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gasworks''' or '''gas house''' is an industrial plant for the production of flammable gas. Many of these have been made redundant in the [[Developed country|developed world]] by the use of [[natural gas]], though they are still used for storage space.

== Early gasworks ==
{{Main|History of manufactured gas}}
[[Coal gas]] was introduced to [[Great Britain]] in the 1790s as an [[illuminating gas]] by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] inventor [[William Murdoch]].

Early gasworks were usually located beside a [[river]] or [[canal]] so that [[coal]] could be brought in by [[barge]]. Transport was later shifted to [[railways]] and many gasworks had internal railway systems with their own locomotives.

Early gasworks were built for factories in the Industrial Revolution from about 1805 as a light source and for industrial processes requiring gas, and for lighting in country houses from about 1845. Country house gas works are extant at [[Culzean Castle]] in Scotland and [[Owlpen Manor|Owlpen]] in [[Gloucestershire]].

==Equipment==
A gasworks was divided into several sections for the production, purification and storage of gas.

===Retort house===
[[File:Launceston Gas Works.jpg|thumb|250px|Retort house at the [[Launceston Gasworks]], Launceston, Tasmania.]]
This contained the [[retort]]s in which coal was heated to generate the gas. The crude gas was siphoned off and passed on to the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. The waste product left in the retort was [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. In many cases the coke was then burned to heat the retorts or sold as smokeless fuel.

===Condenser===
This consisted of a bank of air-cooled gas pipes over a water-filled sump. Its purpose was to remove [[coal tar|tar]] from the gas by [[condensation|condensing]] it out as the gas was cooled. Occasionally the condenser pipes were contained in a water tank similar to a boiler but operated in the same manner as the air-cooled variant. The tar produced was then held in a tar well/tank which was also used to store [[Ammonium hydroxide|liquor]].

===Exhauster===
An impeller or pump was used to increase the gas pressure before scrubbing. Exhausters were optional components and could be placed anywhere along the purifying process but were most often placed after the condensers and immediately before the gas entered the gas holders.

===Scrubber===
A sealed tank containing water through which the gas was bubbled. This removed [[ammonia]] and [[ammonium]] compounds. The water often contained dissolved lime to aid the removal of ammonia. The water left behind was known as [[Ammonium hydroxide|ammonical liquor]]. Other versions used consisted of a tower, packed with coke, down which water was trickled.

===Purifier===
Also known as an Iron Sponge, this removed [[hydrogen sulfide]] from the gas by passing it over wooden trays containing moist [[ferric oxide]]. The gas then passed on to the gasholder and the [[iron sulfide]] was sold to extract the sulfur. Waste from this process often gave rise to [[blue billy]], a [[ferrocyanide]] contaminant in the land which causes problems when trying to redevelop an old gasworks site.

===Benzole plant===
Often only used at large gasworks sites, a [[benzole]] plant consisted of a series of vertical tanks containing petroleum oil through which the gas was bubbled. The purpose of a benzole plant was to extract benzole from the gas. The benzole dissolved into the petroleum oil was run through a steam separating plant to be sold separately.

===Gasholder===
The [[gas holder]] or gasometer was a tank used for storage of the gas and to maintain even pressure in distribution pipes. The gas holder usually consisted of an upturned steel bell contained within a large frame that guided it as it rose and fell depending on the amount of gas contained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/gasworks.htm|title=GANSG - Gas Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By-products==
The by-products of gas-making, such as [[coke (fuel)|coke]], [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]] and [[sulfur]] had many uses. For details, see [[coal gas]].

==British gasworks today==
Coal gas is no longer made in the UK but many gasworks sites are still used for storage and metering of [[natural gas]] and some of the old [[gasometers]] are still in use. [[Fakenham]] gasworks dating from 1846 is the only complete, non-operational gasworks remaining in England. Other examples exist at [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Carrickfergus]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

==Gasworks in popular culture==
Gasworks were noted for their foul smell and generally located in the poorest areas of metropolitan areas. Cultural remnants of gasworks include many streets named Gas Street or Gas Avenue and groups or gangs known as [[Gas House Gang (disambiguation)|Gas House Gang]], such as the [[Gashouse Gang|1934 St. Louis Cardinals]] baseball team. [[Ewan McColl]]'s  song "[[Dirty Old Town]]" (about his home town of [[Salford]]) famously begins "Found my love by the gaswork [[Croft (land)|croft]]…" (in cover versions often "I met my love by the gasworks wall…")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metrolyrics.com/dirty-old-town-lyrics-rod-stewart.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Railway gasworks ==
[[Image:Arhs gasworks.jpg|thumb|left|Eveleigh gasworks]]
Gas was used for many years to illuminate the interior of railway carriages. The [[New South Wales Government Railways]] manufactured its own oil-gas for this purpose, together with reticulated coal-gas to railway stations and associated infrastructure. Such works were established at the [[Macdonaldtown Carriage Sheds]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Junee]] and [[Werris Creek]]. These plants followed on from the works of a private supplier which the railway took over in 1884.

Gas was also transported in special travelling gas reservoir wagons from the gasworks to stationary reservoirs located at a number of country stations where carriage reservoirs were replenished.

With the spreading conversion to electric power for lighting buildings and carriages during the 1920s and 1930s, the railway gasworks were progressively decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;'''''A Brief History of NSW Railway Gasworks''''' Longworth, Jim [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], June, 2003 pp203-213&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gasworks Brisbane, Australia===
The [[Gasworks Newstead]] site in Brisbane Australia has been a stalwart of the river’s edge since its development in 1863. By 1890, the works were supplying gas to Brisbane streets from Toowong to Hamilton&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|7}} and over the next 100 years, it would grow to supply Brisbane city with the latest in gas technology until it was decommissioned in 1996.

In March 1866, the Queensland Defence Force placed an official request for town gas connection, evidence of the vital role the gasworks played in the economic development of colonial Brisbane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|9}} In fact, the gasworks were considered to be of such importance, that during World War II, genuine fears of attack from Japanese air raids motivated the installation of anti aircraft guns which vigilantly watched over the plant and its employees throughout the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The site itself has been synonymous with economic growth and benefit to Brisbane and Queensland with the success of the gasworks facilitating further development of the Newstead/Teneriffe area to include the James Hardie [[Fibro|fibro-cement]] manufacturing plant, Shell Oil plant, Brisbane Water and Sewerage Depot and even the “Brisbane Gas Company Cookery School” which operated in the 1940s. In 1954, a carbonizing plant was built, giving Brisbane the "most modern gas producing plant in Australia",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|10}} consuming 100 tonnes of coal every eight hours.

During its golden years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the site also played a vital role in providing employment to [[aboriginal Australians]] and many migrant workers arriving there from Europe after the second World War.

The fine tradition of the Brisbane Gasworks economic and employment-based successes will not be lost or forgotten with the Teneriffe Gasworks Village Development paying homage to the sites history and integrity in its pending urban development.

The gasholder structure at this site is set to become a hub of a new property development on the site – keeping the structural integrity of the pig iron structure. It will be a true reflection of urban renewal embracing its industrial past.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hackner, D., Ed. (1996). ''A Look Back In Time: A History of Bowen Hills - Newstead &amp; the Creek.'' Bowen Hills, Brisbane, [[Queensland Women's Historical Association]].

===Dunedin Gasworks Museum===
Located in [[South Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Dunedin Gasworks Museum]] consists of a conserved engine house featuring a working boiler house, fitting shop and collection of five stationary steam engines. There are also displays of domestic and industrial gas appliances.

===Technopolis (Gazi)===
Located in [[Athens, Greece]] [[Technopolis (Gazi)]] is a gasworks converted to an exhibition space.

===The Gas Museum, Leicester===
The [[Gas Museum (Leicester)|Gas Museum]] in Leicester, UK is operated by [[The National Gas Museum Trust]].

===Gas Works Park===
[[Gas Works Park]] is a public park in [[Seattle, Washington]].

===Warsaw Gasworks Museum===
The [[Warsaw Gasworks Museum]] is a museum in [[Warsaw, Poland]].

'''IM Flash Technologies, LLC''' is the [[semiconductor]] company founded in January 2006, by [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Micron Technology]], Inc. IM Flash produces [[3D XPoint]] used in data centers and high end computers. It has a 300mm wafer fab in [[Lehi, UT]], United States. 

It built a second 300mm wafer fab, [[IM Flash Singapore]], which opened in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383904,00.asp Intel, Micron Open Singapore NAND Flash Plant]&lt;/ref&gt; IM Flash took the leading edge in NAND flash scaling by moving to 34&amp;nbsp;nm design rules in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VMXMEYO0WV3MLQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=208400713 Intel, Micron roll 34-nm NAND device]&lt;/ref&gt; IM Flash has been able to devise 25-nm NAND chips with 193-nm immersion lithography, plus self-aligned double-patterning (SADP) techniques, where it is widely believed that it is using scanners from [[ASML Holding]]s NV and SADP technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=S4CM4U5BRHLMPQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=222600535 Intel, Micron take NAND lead, roll 25-nm chip]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 IM Flash moved to a 20&amp;nbsp;nm process– which was the smallest NAND flash technology at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/14/intel-and-micron-announce-new-22nm-nand-flash-manufacturing-proc/ Intel and Micron announce new 20nm NAND Flash manufacturing process] April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2018, Micron and Intel announced to cease joint development on 3D XPoint after the 2nd generation technology is finalized, which is expected to complete in the first half of 2019. Technology development beyond the 2nd gen. will be pursued independently by the two companies in order to optimize the technology for their respective product and business needs. The two companies will continue to manufacture memory based on 3D XPoint technology at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (IMFT) facility in Lehi, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Micron and Intel Announce Update to 3D XPoint Joint Development Program |url=http://investors.micron.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1072241 |website=Micron.com |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Oct. 18, 2018, Micron announced the intend to exercise its right to call the remaining interest in the parties' joint venture, IM Flash Technologies, LLC. Micron is to exercise the call option starting Jan. 1, 2019 and the timeline to close the transaction is between six and twelve months after the date Micron exercises the call. At the time of close, Micron expects to pay approximately $1.5 billion in cash for the transaction, dissolving Intel's non-controlling interest in IM Flash as well as IM Flash member debt, which was approximately $1 billion as of Aug. 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Micron Announces Intent to Acquire Remaining Interest in IM Flash Technologies Joint Venture |url=http://investors.micron.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1079408 |website=Micron.com |accessdate=19 October 2018 |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteriological incubator.jpg|thumb|right|A Bacteriological incubator|126x126px]]

Incubator is a device used to grow and maintain [[microbiological culture]]s or [[cell culture]]s. The incubator maintains optimal [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and other conditions such as the CO (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere inside. Incubators are essential for a lot of experimental work in [[cell biology]], [[microbiology]] and [[molecular biology]] and are used to culture both [[bacteria]]l as well as [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells.

[[Louis Pasteur]] used the small opening underneath his staircase as an incubator. Incubators are also used in the [[poultry industry]] to act as a substitute for hens. This often results in higher hatch rates due to the ability to control both temperature and humidity. Various brands of incubators are commercially available to breeders.

The simplest incubators are insulated boxes with an adjustable heater, typically going up to 60 to 65 °C (140 to 150 °F), though some can go slightly higher (generally to no more than 100 °C). The most commonly used temperature both for bacteria such as the frequently used [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] as well as for mammalian cells is approximately 37 °C (99 °F), as these organisms grow well under such conditions. For other organisms used in biological experiments, such as the budding yeast [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]], a growth temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) is optimal. 

More elaborate incubators can also include the ability to lower the temperature (via refrigeration), or the ability to control humidity or [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels. This is important in the cultivation of mammalian cells, where the relative [[humidity]] is typically &gt;80% to prevent evaporation and a slightly acidic [[pH]] is achieved by maintaining a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level of 5%.

== The History of the Laboratory Incubator ==
{{Advert section|date=October 2017}}
From aiding in hatching chicken eggs to enabling scientists to understand and develop vaccines for deadly viruses, the laboratory incubator has seen numerous applications over the thousands of years it has been in use. The incubator has also provided a foundation for medical advances and experimental work in cellular and [[molecular biology]]. 

An incubator is made up of a chamber with a regulated [[temperature]].  Some incubators also regulate [[Relative humidity|humidity]], gas composition, or ventilation within that chamber. While many technological advances have occurred since the primitive incubators first used in ancient Egypt and China, the main purpose of the incubator has remained unchanged: to create a stable, controlled environment conducive to research, study, and cultivation.

=== '''The Earliest Incubators''' ===
The earliest incubators were found thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt and China, where they were used to keep chicken eggs warm&lt;ref&gt;Paniago, Marcelo. [http://www.thepoultrysite.com/focus/contents/ceva/OnlineBulletins/ob_2005/Article-No2-Sept05.pdf "Artificial Incubation of Poultry Eggs - 3,000 Years of History -", CEVA Sante Animale, Malaysia, September 2005, Retrieved on 29 October  2018]
&lt;/ref&gt;.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Use of incubators revolutionized food production, as it allowed chicks to hatch from eggs without requiring that a hen sit on them, thus freeing the hens to lay more eggs in a shorter period of time. Both early Egyptian and Chinese incubators were essentially large rooms that were heated by fires, where attendants turned the eggs at regular intervals to ensure even heat distribution..

=== '''Incubators in the 16th and 17th Century''' ===
The incubator received an update in the 16th century when Jean Baptiste Porta drew on ancient Egyptian design to create a more modern egg incubator. While he eventually had to discontinue his work due to the Spanish Inquisition, Rene-Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur took up the challenge in the middle of the 17th century.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Reaumur warmed his incubator with a wood stove and monitored its temperature using the Reaumur thermometer, another of his inventions.

=== '''Incubators in the 19th Century''' ===
In the 19th century, researchers finally began to recognize that the use of incubators could contribute to medical advancements. They began to experiment to find the ideal environment for maintaining cell culture stocks. These early incubators were simply made up of bell jars that contained a single lit candle. Cultures were placed near the flame on the underside of the jar's lid, and the entire jar was placed in a dry, heated oven.

In the late 19th century, doctors realized another practical use for incubators: keeping premature or weak infants alive. The first infant incubator, used at a women's hospital in Paris, was heated by kerosene lamps. Fifty years later, Julius H. Hess, an American physician often considered to be the father of neonatology, designed an electric infant incubator that closely resembles the infant incubators in use today.

=== '''Incubators in the 20th Century''' ===
The next innovation in incubator technology came in the 1960s, when the CO2 incubator was introduced to the market. Demand came when doctors realized that they could use CO2 incubators to identify and study pathogens found in patients' bodily fluids. To do this, a sample was harvested and placed onto a sterile dish and into the incubator. The air in the incubator was kept at 37 degrees Celsius, the same temperature as the human body, and the incubator maintained the atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen levels necessary to promote cell growth.

At this time, incubators also began to be used in genetic engineering. Scientists could create biologically essential proteins, such as insulin, with the use of incubators. Genetic modification could now take place on a molecular level, helping to improve the nutritional content and resistance to pestilence and disease of fruits and vegetables.



=== '''Incubators Today''' ===

Incubators serve a variety of functions in a scientific lab.  Incubators generally maintain a constant temperature, however additional features are often built in.  Many incubators also control humidity.  Shaking incubators incorporate movement to mix cultures.  Gas incubators regulate the internal gas composition.  Some incubators have a means of circulating the air inside of them to ensure even distribution of temperatures.  Many incubators built for laboratory use have a redundant power source, to ensure that power outages do not disrupt experiments.  Incubators are made in a variety of sizes, from tabletop models, to warm rooms, which serve as incubators for large numbers of samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">The '''Indian Financial System Code''' (IFS Code or IFSC) is an [[alphanumeric code]] that facilitates [[electronic funds transfer]] in India. A code uniquely identifies each bank branch participating in the two main [[Payment and settlement systems in India]]: the [[Real Time Gross Settlement]] (RTGS) and the [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT) systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RTGS/NEFT - FAQ|url=https://www.onlinesbi.com/osbi_rtgs_faq.html|publisher=State Bank of India|accessdate=2 August 2012|page=question 9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416231117/https://www.onlinesbi.com/osbi_rtgs_faq.html|archivedate=16 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The IFSC is an 11-character code with the first four [[alphabetic]] characters representing the bank name, and the last six characters (usually numeric, but can be alphabetic) representing the branch. The fifth character is 0 (zero) and reserved for future use. Bank IFS Code is used by the NEFT &amp; RTGS systems to route the messages to the destination banks/branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FAQs : NEFT system |url= http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=60 |publisher= Reserve Bank of India |accessdate= 2 August 2012 |date= 31 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The format of the IFS Code is shown below.

[[File:Moulin maree brehat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tide mill]]s, along with riverine [[ship mill]]s, were a major [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] technological advance, allowing to tap the tidal power along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] for milling.]]

This list of '''early medieval watermills''' comprises a selection of European [[watermill]]s spanning the [[early Middle Ages]], from 500 to 1000 AD.

== Historical overview ==
[[File:Shipmills, Martyrdom of St Ursula at Cologne (detail).jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] ship mills on the [[Rhine]] at [[Cologne]], around 1411.]]

Largely unaffected from the [[Migration Period|turbulent political events]] following the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|demise of the Western Roman Empire]], the importance of [[watermill]]ing continued to grow under the new [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] lords. The sharp rise in numbers of [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] watermills coincided with the appearance of new documentary genres ([[legal code]]s, [[Monastery|monastic]] [[charter]]s, [[hagiography]]) which were more inclined to address such a relatively mundane device than the [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] urban-centered literary class had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partly explains the relative abundance of medieval literary references to watermills compared to former times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|pp=372f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantitative growth of medieval evidence appears to be more than a mere reflection of the changing nature of surviving sources. By [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] times, references to watermills  in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish Realm]] had become "innumerable".&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 170, 45"/&gt; At the time of the compilation of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086), there were an estimated 6,500 watermills in [[Norman England|England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the early 7th century, watermills were well established in [[Ireland]], and began to spread from the former territory of the empire into the non-romanized parts of [[Germany]] a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the [[ship mill]]  and [[tide mill]] in the 6th century, both of which yet unattested for the ancient period,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|pp=379 &amp; 383f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed for a flexible response to the changing water-level of rivers and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], thus demonstrating the technological innovativeness of early medieval watermillers.

==Overview==
Martyn Thomas founded the software engineering company [[Praxis High Integrity Systems|Praxis]] in 1983, based in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], southern England. He has a special interest in [[safety-critical system]]s and other high integrity applications. He has acted as an [[expert witness]] involving complex software engineering issues.

Thomas was born in [[Salisbury]], southern England. He studied [[biochemistry]] at [[University College London]], graduating in 1969, when he started working in the field of computing. Between 1969 and 1983, he was employed at universities in London and the [[Netherlands]], at [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]] working on telecommunications software, and at the [[South West Universities Regional Computer Centre]] in Bath.

In 1983, Thomas founded Praxis with David Bean, where he encouraged the use of [[formal methods]] within the company for [[software development]]. In 1986, Praxis became the first independent systems house to achieve BS 5750 (later ISO 9001) certification for all its activities. Praxis became internationally recognised as a leader in the use of rigorous software engineering, including formal methods, and grew to around 200 staff.

In December 1992, Praxis was sold to [[Deloitte and Touche]], an international firm of accountants and management consultants, and Martyn became a Deloitte Consulting international partner whilst remaining chairman and, later, managing director of Praxis. He left Deloitte Consulting in 1997.

He is currently director of '''Martyn Thomas Associates Limited''' and a visiting professor at the [[Oxford University Department of Computer Science]], and the [[University of Bristol]]. He lives in London.

The '''Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System''' ('''MIDAS''') is one of several instruments on the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'']] mission which studied ''in-situ'' the environment around the active [[comet]] [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] as it flew into the inner [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=Riedler&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedler, W. |display-authors=etal  |author2=Torkar, K. |author3=Jeszenszky, H. |author4=Romstedt, J.  |title=MIDAS The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System for the Rosetta Mission |journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=128 |issue=1–4 |pages=869–904 |date=2007 |doi=10.1007/s11214-006-9040-y |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/spac/2007/00000128/F0040001/00009040 |bibcode=2007SSRv..128..869R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="home 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=35061 |title=Rosseta — Orbiter Instruments |work=[[European Space Agency]] |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MIDAS is an [[Atomic force microscopy|atomic force microscope (AFM)]] designed to collect [[comet dust|dust particles]] emitted from the comet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stanglin |first=Doug |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/20/rosetta-comet-space-probe-european-space-agency/4661123/ |title=Comet-bound probe Rosetta wakes up: 'Hello, world! |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 20, 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/rosetta-00c.html |title=Rosetta EQM Engineering Model Comes Together |work=Space Daily |date=August 17, 2000 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then scan them with a very sharp needle-like tip to determine their 3D structure, size and texture with very high resolution (4 [[nanometers]]).&lt;ref name="home 2014"/&gt;

== Science goals ==

MIDAS is the first instrument capable of imaging the smallest cometary dust particles ''in-situ''.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt; Some [[Interplanetary dust|interplanetary dust particles]] collected in the Earth's stratosphere have been shown to have a cometary origin, but their precise provenance is typically unknown. The [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] mission returned many cometary dust particles, collected during a fast flyby of [[comet]] [[81P/Wild]] in [[aerogel]], but these were highly modified, crushed and melted during deceleration and return to Earth.&lt;ref name="ESA Blog"/&gt; MIDAS was be used primarily in particles a few [[micrometers]] in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref name="home 2014"/&gt;

By collecting and imaging dust particles —tiny pieces of rock, ice and [[Organic compound]]s&lt;ref name="ESA Blog"/&gt; — emitted from comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] as it passes through the inner Solar System, MIDAS address questions including:&lt;ref name="home 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=35969 |title=MIDAS - Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DIsplay 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=2004-006A-08 |title=Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System (MIDAS) |work=European Space Agency |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since comets are thought to be ancient, and contain material unchanged since their formation in the early Solar System, these questions will directly help support theories on the Solar System formation. The Principal Investigator is Mark Bentley from The Space Research Institute ([[Institut für Weltraumforschung (Space Research Institute)|IWF]]) in Austria.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA Blog"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/03/26/introducing-midas-rosettas-micro-imaging-dust-analysis-system/ |title=Introducing MIDAS: Rosetta's Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System |publisher=ESA Blog |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware is contributed by universities in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;

== Instrument description ==
MIDAS is mounted on the [[nadir]] panel of the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' spacecraft]] and is composed of three main subsystems and an electronics box:&lt;ref name=Riedler/&gt;&lt;ref name="home 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;
* a funnel, shutter and collimator to control dust collection
* a sample handling stage to collect and manipulate collected dust
* an atomic force microscope.

Dust collection is performed when close to the comet by opening the shutter and placing one of 61 targets directly behind the funnel. A collimator ensures that only one target at a time can be exposed. The targets are rectangular and {{nowrap|1.4 × 2.4 mm}} in size and are mounted around the circumference of a wheel. Rotating this wheel moves a target from the dust collection (exposure) position to the analysis (scanning) position. Once sufficient dust has been collected, the shutter is closed and the exposed target moved in front of one of 16 cantilevers. Each cantilever is fitted with a sharp tip; since these can be worn down in operation, the sixteen tips provide redundancy for the one year of nominal operation.

=== Cantilevers and tips ===
Each of the MIDAS cantilevers is piezo-resistive, meaning that its deflection is measured by a change in resistance, not by the reflection of [[laser]] light from the cantilever as in many commercial instruments. In this way the need for intricate optical alignment is avoided and the instrument could be made sufficiently robust to withstand launch. Sixteen cantilevers are carried for redundancy, each with a sharp tip of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;µm long. Four are coated with a cobalt alloy to allow [[magnetic force microscopy]] of collected dust.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;

=== Sample handling ===
The MIDAS targets, on which dust particles are collected, are made of [[silicon]] and are rectangular in shape, with a dimension of {{nowrap|1.4 × 2.4 mm}}. Most are coated with a [[sol gel]] coating which aids in sticking particles to the targets. Three calibration targets are also carried, which allow calibration of the scanner in XY and in Z, and allow imaging of the tip shape. All 64 targets are mounted on the circumference of a wheel, which rotates to select a sample, to provide coarse Y positioning, and to move samples from the exposure to scanning position. The wheel can also be moved laterally, moving the wheel in front of each of the 16 cantilevers, and allowing for coarse X positioning.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;

==== Coarse approach stage ====
Before a sample can be scanned, the microscope has to be brought close to the sample. This is achieved by a coarse approach stage driven by a [[brushed DC motor]] encased in a pressurised vacuum bellows. This motor drives a spindle which in turn raises or lowers a wheel placed in a spring-loaded wedge, as shown in the diagram.{{which|date=April 2014}} This allows the entire microscope stage to be moved by about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;

==== Sample stage ====
The heart of the instrument is a precision XYZ stage with a travel of approximately {{nowrap|100 × 100 µm}} in XY and 10&amp;nbsp;µm in Z directions. Driven by [[Piezoelectricity#Actuators|piezo actuators]] this stage moves the selected cantilever and tip across the sample in a raster pattern, measuring the height of the sample at each point.&lt;ref name="MIDAS 2013"/&gt;

== Results ==
Although MIDAS has been operated during the long (10 year) cruise phase, it has never been in an environment where significant dust was expected. Thus the only results available to date are reference scans of the calibration and blank targets. Scientific data should be available to the public when the mission starts its primary science phase in November 2014, subject to the usual 6 months proprietary period. Data was made available via the ESA [http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA Planetary Science Archive (PSA)], where a [http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA&amp;page=rosetta dedicated Rosetta section] is available.

A '''multi-core processor''' is a single [[computing]] component with two or more independent [[Central processing unit|processing units]] called cores, which read and execute [[Instruction set|program instructions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid80_gci1015740,00.html|publisher= TechTarget|title= Definition: multi-core processor|author= Margaret Rouse|date= March 27, 2007|accessdate= March 6, 2013|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100805052158/http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid80_gci1015740,00.html|archivedate= August 5, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions are ordinary [[Instruction set|CPU instructions]] (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run multiple instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs amenable to [[parallel computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/multicore/review.pdf|title=Multicore Processors - A Necessity|author=Bryan Schauer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125035151/http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/multicore/review.pdf|archive-date=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single [[integrated circuit]] [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] (known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP) or onto multiple dies in a single [[Chip carrier|chip package]].  The microprocessors currently used in almost all personal computers are multi-core.
&lt;!--This had Intel Core i3 listed as quad core when no Intel Core i3 is quad. It is very important to remember based on the definition you have given about multi-core being two separate core units on the same die or CMP that i3 only has 2 and that it is how the pipelines work on each core that gives it the appearence of a quadcore.--&gt;

A multi-core processor implements [[multiprocessing]] in a single physical package. Designers may couple cores in a multi-core device tightly or loosely. For example, cores may or may not share [[CPU cache|caches]], and they may implement [[message passing]] or [[shared memory|shared-memory]] inter-core communication methods. Common [[network topology|network topologies]] to interconnect cores include [[bus network|bus]], [[ring network|ring]], two-dimensional [[mesh networking|mesh]], and [[crossbar switch|crossbar]]. Homogeneous multi-core systems include only identical cores; [[heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] multi-core systems have cores that are not identical (e.g. [[ARM big.LITTLE|big.LITTLE]] have heterogeneous cores that share the same instruction set, while [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit]]s have cores that don't even share the same instruction set). Just as with single-processor systems, cores in multi-core systems may implement architectures such as [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]], [[Superscalar processor|superscalar]], [[Vector processor|vector]], or [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]].

Multi-core processors are widely used across many application domains, including [[Computer|general-purpose]], [[Embedded system|embedded]], [[Network processor|network]], [[digital signal processing]] (DSP), and [[Graphics processing unit|graphics]] (GPU).

The improvement in performance gained by the use of a multi-core processor depends very much on the [[software]] algorithms used and their implementation. In particular, possible gains are limited by the fraction of the software that can [[Parallel computing|run in parallel]] simultaneously on multiple cores; this effect is described by [[Amdahl's law]]. In the best case, so-called [[embarrassingly parallel]] problems may realize speedup factors near the number of cores, or even more if the problem is split up enough to fit within each core's cache(s), avoiding use of much slower main-system memory. Most applications, however, are not accelerated so much unless programmers invest a prohibitive amount of effort in re-factoring the whole problem.&lt;ref&gt;

The parallelization of software is a significant ongoing topic of research.

==Terminology==
The terms ''multi-core'' and ''dual-core'' most commonly refer to some sort of [[central processing unit]] (CPU), but are sometimes also applied to [[digital signal processor]]s (DSP) and [[system on a chip]] (SoC). The terms are generally used only to refer to multi-core microprocessors that are manufactured on the ''same'' integrated circuit [[die (integrated circuit)|die]]; separate microprocessor dies in the same package are generally referred to by another name, such as ''[[multi-chip module]]''. This article uses the terms "multi-core" and "dual-core" for CPUs manufactured on the ''same'' integrated circuit, unless otherwise noted.

In contrast to multi-core systems, the term ''multi-CPU'' refers to multiple physically separate processing-units (which often contain special circuitry to facilitate communication between each other).

The terms ''many-core'' and ''massively multi-core'' are sometimes used to describe multi-core architectures with an especially high number of cores (tens to thousands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/191/the-2048-core-pezy-sc2-sets-a-green500-record/|title=The 2,048-core PEZY-SC2 sets a Green500 record|author=David Schor|publisher=WikiChip}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSxa_anfiG0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=several+tens|title=Programming Many-Core Chips|author=András Vajda|page=3|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-9739-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems use many [[soft microprocessor]] cores placed on a single [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]. Each "core" can be considered a "[[semiconductor intellectual property core]]" as well as a CPU core.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Development==
While manufacturing technology improves, reducing the size of individual gates, physical limits of [[semiconductor]]-based [[microelectronics]] have become a major design concern. These physical limitations can cause significant heat dissipation and data synchronization problems. Various other methods are used to improve CPU performance. Some ''[[instruction-level parallelism]]'' (ILP) methods such as [[superscalar]] [[pipelining]] are suitable for many applications, but are inefficient for others that contain difficult-to-predict code. Many applications are better suited to ''[[thread-level parallelism]]'' (TLP) methods, and multiple independent CPUs are commonly used to increase a system's overall TLP. A combination of increased available space (due to refined manufacturing processes) and the demand for increased TLP led to the development of multi-core CPUs.

===Commercial incentives===
Several business motives drive the development of multi-core architectures. For decades, it was possible to improve performance of a CPU by shrinking the area of the integrated circuit (IC), which reduced the cost per device on the IC. Alternatively, for the same circuit area, more transistors could be used in the design, which increased functionality, especially for [[complex instruction set computing]] (CISC) architectures. [[Clock rate]]s also increased by orders of magnitude in the decades of the late 20th century, from several megahertz in the 1980s to several gigahertz in the early 2000s.

As the rate of clock speed improvements slowed, increased use of parallel computing in the form of multi-core processors has been pursued to improve overall processing performance. Multiple cores were used on the same CPU chip, which could then lead to better sales of CPU chips with two or more cores. For example, Intel has produced a 48-core processor for research in cloud computing; each core has an [[x86]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intel Shows 48-core x86 Processor as Single-chip Cloud Computer|url=http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/Intel-Shows-48-core-x86-Processor-Single-chip-Cloud-Computer|author=Ryan Shrout|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=May 17, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105080008/http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Processors/Intel-Shows-48-core-x86-Processor-Single-chip-Cloud-Computer|archivedate=January 5, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8392392.stm|title=Intel unveils 48-core cloud computing silicon chip|publisher=BBC|date=December 3, 2009|accessdate=March 6, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206054225/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8392392.stm|archivedate=December 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical factors===
Since computer manufacturers have long implemented [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) designs using discrete CPUs, the issues regarding implementing multi-core processor architecture and supporting it with software are well known.

Additionally:
* Using a proven processing-core design without architectural changes reduces design risk significantly.
* For general-purpose processors, much of the motivation for multi-core processors comes from greatly diminished gains in processor performance from increasing the [[frequency scaling|operating frequency]]. This is due to three primary factors:&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, David A. "Future of computer architecture." Berkeley EECS Annual Research Symposium (BEARS), College of Engineering, UC Berkeley, US. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*# The ''memory wall''; the increasing gap between processor and memory speeds. This, in effect, pushes for cache sizes to be larger in order to mask the latency of memory. This helps only to the extent that memory bandwidth is not the bottleneck in performance.
*# The ''ILP wall''; the increasing difficulty of finding enough [[instruction-level parallelism|parallelism in a single instruction stream]] to keep a high-performance single-core processor busy.
*# The ''power wall''; the trend of consuming exponentially increasing power (and thus also generating exponentially increasing heat) with each factorial increase of operating frequency. This increase can be mitigated by "[[Die shrink|shrinking]]" the processor by using smaller traces for the same logic. The ''power wall'' poses manufacturing, system design and deployment problems that have not been justified in the face of the diminished gains in performance due to the ''memory wall'' and ''ILP wall''.

In order to continue delivering regular performance improvements for general-purpose processors, manufacturers such as [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] have turned to multi-core designs, sacrificing lower manufacturing-costs for higher performance in some applications and systems. Multi-core architectures are being developed, but so are the alternatives. An especially strong contender for established markets is the further integration of peripheral functions into the chip.

===Advantages===
The proximity of multiple CPU cores on the same die allows the [[cache coherency]] circuitry to operate at a much higher clock rate than what is possible if the signals have to travel off-chip. Combining equivalent CPUs on a single die significantly improves the performance of [[cache snooping|cache snoop]] (alternative: [[Bus snooping]]) operations. Put simply, this means that [[Discrete signal|signals]] between different CPUs travel shorter distances, and therefore those signals [[Degradation (telecommunications)|degrade]] less. These higher-quality signals allow more data to be sent in a given time period, since individual signals can be shorter and do not need to be repeated as often.

Assuming that the die can physically fit into the package, multi-core CPU designs require much less [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) space than do multi-chip SMP designs. Also, a dual-core processor uses slightly less power than two coupled single-core processors, principally because of the decreased power required to drive signals external to the chip. Furthermore, the cores share some circuitry, like the L2 cache and the interface to the [[front-side bus]] (FSB). In terms of competing technologies for the available silicon die area, multi-core design can make use of proven CPU core library designs and produce a product with lower risk of design error than devising a new wider-core design. Also, adding more cache suffers from diminishing returns.

Multi-core chips also allow higher performance at lower energy. This can be a big factor in mobile devices that operate on batteries. Since each core in a multi-core CPU is generally more energy-efficient, the chip becomes more efficient than having a single large monolithic core. This allows higher performance with less energy. A challenge in this, however, is the additional overhead of writing parallel code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q &amp; A: Do multicores save energy? Not really.|url=http://www.futurechips.org/chip-design-for-all/a-multicore-save-energy.html|author=Aater Suleman|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216051010/http://www.futurechips.org/chip-design-for-all/a-multicore-save-energy.html|archivedate=December 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Maximizing the usage of the computing resources provided by multi-core processors requires adjustments both to the [[operating system]] (OS) support and to existing application software. Also, the ability of multi-core processors to increase application performance depends on the use of multiple threads within applications.

Integration of a multi-core chip can lower the chip production yields. They are also more difficult to manage thermally than lower-density single-core designs. Intel has partially countered this first problem by creating its quad-core designs by combining two dual-core ones on a single die with a unified cache, hence any two working dual-core dies can be used, as opposed to producing four cores on a single die and requiring all four to work to produce a quad-core CPU. From an architectural point of view, ultimately, single CPU designs may make better use of the silicon surface area than multiprocessing cores, so a development commitment to this architecture may carry the risk of obsolescence. Finally, raw processing power is not the only constraint on system performance. Two processing cores sharing the same system bus and memory bandwidth limits the real-world performance advantage. In a 2009 report, Dr Jun Ni showed that if a single core is close to being memory-bandwidth limited, then going to dual-core might give 30% to 70% improvement; if memory bandwidth is not a problem, then a 90% improvement can be expected; however, [[Amdahl's law]] makes this claim dubious.&lt;ref name="Enabling Technology of Multi-core Processing for Medical Imaging"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ni|first=Jun|title=Enabling Technology of Multi-core Computing for Medical Imaging|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/mihpclab/presentations/staffPresentations/2009_12_22_Multi-core%20Programming%20for%20Medical%20Imaging.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705213827/http://www.uiowa.edu/mihpclab/presentations/staffPresentations/2009_12_22_Multi-core%20Programming%20for%20Medical%20Imaging.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be possible for an application that used two CPUs to end up running faster on a single-core one if communication between the CPUs was the limiting factor, which would count as more than 100% improvement.

==Hardware==

===Trends===
The trend in processor development has been towards an ever-increasing number of cores, as processors with hundreds or even thousands of cores become theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Jack|title=Intel: Why a 1,000-core chip is feasible|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-why-a-1000-core-chip-is-feasible/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=6 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806181915/http://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-why-a-1000-core-chip-is-feasible/|archivedate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, multi-core chips mixed with [[simultaneous multithreading]], memory-on-chip, and special-purpose [[heterogeneous computing|"heterogeneous"]] (or asymmetric) cores promise further performance and efficiency gains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/18301534/A_Survey_Of_Techniques_for_Architecting_and_Managing_Asymmetric_Multicore_Processors|title=A Survey Of Techniques for Architecting and Managing Asymmetric Multicore Processors|journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]]|volume=48|issue=3|date=February 2016|author=Sparsh Mittal|doi=10.1145/2856125|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618200303/http://www.academia.edu/18301534/A_Survey_Of_Techniques_for_Architecting_and_Managing_Asymmetric_Multicore_Processors|archive-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in processing multimedia, recognition and networking applications. For example, a [[ARM big.LITTLE|big.LITTLE]] core includes a high-performance core (called 'big') and a low-power core (called 'LITTLE'). There is also a trend towards improving energy-efficiency by focusing on performance-per-watt with advanced fine-grain or ultra fine-grain [[power management]] and dynamic [[dynamic voltage scaling|voltage]] and [[dynamic frequency scaling|frequency scaling]] (i.e. [[laptop]] computers and [[portable media player]]s).

Chips designed from the outset for a large number of cores (rather than having evolved from single core designs) are sometimes referred to as [[manycore]] designs, emphasising qualitative differences.

===Architecture===
The composition and balance of the cores in multi-core architecture show great variety. Some architectures use one core design repeated consistently ("homogeneous"), while others use a mixture of different cores, each optimized for a different, "[[heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]]" role.

The article "CPU designers debate multi-core future" by Rick Merritt, EE Times 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4076123/CPU-designers-debate-multi-core-future|title=CPU designers debate multi-core future|author=Rick Merritt|publisher=[[EE Times]]|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=March 6, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114020257/http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4076123/CPU-designers-debate-multi-core-future|archivedate=November 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes these comments:
{{blockquote|Chuck Moore&lt;!-- No, this is not the Forth Chuck Moore, it's the Chuck Moore from IBM and then AMD - http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/080604.html --&gt; [...] suggested computers should be like cellphones, using a variety of specialty cores to run modular software scheduled by a high-level applications programming interface.

[...] Atsushi Hasegawa, a senior chief engineer at [[Renesas]], generally agreed. He suggested the cellphone's use of many specialty cores working in concert is a good model for future multi-core designs.

[...] [[Anant Agarwal]], founder and chief executive of startup [[Tilera]], took the opposing view. He said multi-core chips need to be homogeneous collections of general-purpose cores to keep the software model simple.}}

==Software effects==
An outdated version of an anti-virus application may create a new thread for a scan process, while its [[graphical user interface|GUI]] thread waits for commands from the user (e.g. cancel the scan). In such cases, a multi-core architecture is of little benefit for the application itself due to the single thread doing all the heavy lifting and the inability to balance the work evenly across multiple cores. Programming truly multithreaded code often requires complex co-ordination of threads and can easily introduce subtle and difficult-to-find bugs due to the interweaving of processing on data shared between threads (see [[thread-safety]]). Consequently, such code is much more difficult to debug than single-threaded code when it breaks. There has been a perceived lack of motivation for writing consumer-level threaded applications because of the relative rarity of consumer-level demand for maximum use of computer hardware. Although threaded applications incur little additional performance penalty on single-processor machines, the extra overhead of development has been difficult to justify due to the preponderance of single-processor machines. Also, serial tasks like decoding the [[entropy encoding]] algorithms used in [[video codec]]s are impossible to parallelize because each result generated is used to help create the next result of the entropy decoding algorithm.

Given the increasing emphasis on multi-core chip design, stemming from the grave thermal and power consumption problems posed by any further significant increase in processor clock speeds, the extent to which software can be multithreaded to take advantage of these new chips is likely to be the single greatest constraint on computer performance in the future. If developers are unable to design software to fully exploit the resources provided by multiple cores, then they will ultimately reach an insurmountable performance ceiling.

The telecommunications market had been one of the first that needed a new design of parallel datapath packet processing because there was a very quick adoption of these multiple-core processors for the datapath and the control plane. These MPUs are going to replace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multicorepacketprocessing.com/|title=Multicore Packet Processing Forum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221035434/http://www.multicorepacketprocessing.com/|archive-date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional Network Processors that were based on proprietary [[microcode]] or [[picocode]].

[[Parallel programming]] techniques can benefit from multiple cores directly. Some existing [[parallel programming model]]s such as [[Cilk Plus]], [[OpenMP]], [[OpenHMPP]], [[Algorithmic skeleton#FastFlow|FastFlow]], Skandium, [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]], and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] can be used on multi-core platforms. Intel introduced a new abstraction for C++ parallelism called [[Threading Building Blocks|TBB]]. Other research efforts include the [[Sieve C++ Parallel Programming System|Codeplay Sieve System]], Cray's [[Chapel (programming language)|Chapel]], Sun's [[Fortress programming language|Fortress]], and IBM's [[X10 (programming language)|X10]].

Multi-core processing has also affected the ability of modern computational software development. Developers programming in newer languages might find that their modern languages do not support multi-core functionality. This then requires the use of [[List of numerical libraries|numerical libraries]] to access code written in languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Fortran]], which perform math computations faster than newer languages like [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. Intel's MKL and AMD's [[ACML]] are written in these native languages and take advantage of multi-core processing. Balancing the application workload across processors can be problematic, especially if they have different performance characteristics. There are different conceptual models to deal with the problem, for example using a coordination language and program building blocks (programming libraries or higher-order functions). Each block can have a different native implementation for each processor type. Users simply program using these abstractions and an intelligent compiler chooses the best implementation based on the context.&lt;ref&gt;

Managing [[Concurrent computing|concurrency]] acquires a central role in developing parallel applications. The basic steps in designing parallel applications are:

; Partitioning : The partitioning stage of a design is intended to expose opportunities for parallel execution. Hence, the focus is on defining a large number of small tasks in order to yield what is termed a fine-grained decomposition of a problem.

; Communication : The tasks generated by a partition are intended to execute concurrently but cannot, in general, execute independently. The computation to be performed in one task will typically require data associated with another task. Data must then be transferred between tasks so as to allow computation to proceed. This information flow is specified in the communication phase of a design.

; Agglomeration : In the third stage, development moves from the abstract toward the concrete. Developers revisit decisions made in the partitioning and communication phases with a view to obtaining an algorithm that will execute efficiently on some class of parallel computer. In particular, developers consider whether it is useful to combine, or agglomerate, tasks identified by the partitioning phase, so as to provide a smaller number of tasks, each of greater size. They also determine whether it is worthwhile to replicate data and computation.

; Mapping : In the fourth and final stage of the design of parallel algorithms, the developers specify where each task is to execute. This mapping problem does not arise on uniprocessors or on shared-memory computers that provide automatic task scheduling.

On the other hand, on the [[server-side|server side]], multi-core processors are ideal because they allow many users to connect to a site simultaneously and have independent [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] of execution. This allows for Web servers and application servers that have much better [[throughput]].

===Licensing===
Vendors may license some software "per processor". This can give rise to ambiguity, because a "processor" may consist either of a single core or of a combination of cores.
* Initially, for some of its enterprise software, [[Microsoft]] continued to use a per-[[CPU socket|socket]] licensing system. However, for some software such as [[BizTalk|BizTalk Server 2013]], [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server 2014]], and [[Windows Server 2016]], Microsoft has shifted to per-core licensing.&lt;ref name=ars-2016license&gt;{{cite web|first= Peter|last= Bright|title= Windows Server 2016 moving to per core, not per socket, licensing|url= https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/windows-server-2016-moving-to-per-core-not-per-socket-licensing/|website= [[Ars Technica]]|publisher= [[Condé Nast]]|accessdate= 5 December 2015|date= 4 December 2015|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151204182323/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/windows-server-2016-moving-to-per-core-not-per-socket-licensing/|archivedate= 4 December 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embedded applications==
[[Embedded computing]] operates in an area of processor technology distinct from that of "mainstream" PCs. The same technological drives towards multi-core apply here too. Indeed, in many cases the application is a "natural" fit for multi-core technologies, if the task can easily be partitioned between the different processors.

In addition, embedded software is typically developed for a specific hardware release, making issues of [[software portability]], legacy code or supporting independent developers less critical than is the case for PC or enterprise computing. As a result, it is easier for developers to adopt new technologies and as a result there is a greater variety of multi-core processing architectures and suppliers.

{{As of | 2010}}, multi-core [[network processing]] devices have become mainstream, with companies such as [[Freescale Semiconductor]], [[Cavium Networks]], [[Wintegra]] and [[Broadcom]] all manufacturing products with eight processors. For the system developer, a key challenge is how to exploit all the cores in these devices to achieve maximum networking performance at the system level, despite the performance limitations inherent in an SMP operating system. To address this issue, companies such as [[6WIND]] provide portable packet processing software designed so that the networking data plane runs in a fast path environment outside the OS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6wind.com/products/6windgate/|title=6WINDGATE Software: Network Optimization Software - SDN Software - Control Plane Software {{!}} 6WIND}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[digital signal processing]] the same trend applies: [[Texas Instruments]] has the three-core TMS320C6488 and four-core TMS320C5441, [[Freescale]] the four-core MSC8144 and six-core MSC8156 (and both have stated they are working on eight-core successors). Newer entries include the Storm-1 family from [http://www.streamprocessors.com Stream Processors, Inc] with 40 and 80 general purpose ALUs per chip, all programmable in C as a SIMD engine and [[Picochip]] with three-hundred processors on a single die, focused on communication applications.

{{As of | 2016}} [[heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] multi-core solutions are becoming more common: [[Xilinx]] Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC has Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 and Dual-core ARM Cortex-R5. Software solutions such as [[OpenAMP]] are being used to help with inter processor communication.

==Benchmarks==
The research and development of multicore processors often compares many options, and benchmarks are developed to help such evaluations. Existing benchmarks include SPLASH-2, PARSEC, and COSMIC for heterogeneous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.ust.hk/~eexu/COSMIC.html|title=COSMIC Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Benchmark Suite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703123808/http://www.ece.ust.hk/~eexu/COSMIC.html|archive-date=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
# {{note|DSP}} [[Digital signal processor]]s (DSPs) have used multi-core architectures for much longer than high-end general-purpose processors. A typical example of a DSP-specific implementation would be a combination of a [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] CPU and a DSP [[Microprocessor|MPU]]. This allows for the design of products that require a general-purpose processor for user interfaces and a DSP for real-time data processing; this type of design is common in [[mobile phone]]s. In other applications, a growing number of companies have developed multi-core DSPs with very large numbers of processors.
# {{note|PMTandSMP}} Two types of [[operating system]]s are able to use a dual-CPU multiprocessor: partitioned multiprocessing and [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP). In a partitioned architecture, each CPU boots into separate segments of physical memory and operate independently; in an SMP OS, processors work in a shared space, executing threads within the OS independently.

If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, causing it to [[arc flash]] and destroy itself.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt; To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ''[[electrical ballast|ballast]]''.

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The [[electrical resistance|resistance]] between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (''I–V'') curve ([[current–voltage characteristic|characteristic curve]]), giving the current &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; through it for any given voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; across it.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

Negative resistance occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] (nonohmic) devices.&lt;ref name="Haisch"&gt;{{cite web

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_o = \frac{-r}{R-r}v_i = \frac{r}{r-R}v_i \,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so the [[voltage gain]] is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;G_v = \frac{r}{r-R} \,&lt;/math&gt;
In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_S - IR\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
**CCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].
The ''I–V'' curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;

===Q enhancement===
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so &lt;math&gt;|R_\text{if}|\;&lt;\;r_\text{loss}&lt;/math&gt;) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s toward the ''jω'' axis), increasing its [[Q factor]] so it has a narrower [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and more [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite conference

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complex impedance]] of the negative resistance part &lt;math&gt;Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on frequency ''ω'' but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current ''I''; while the resonator part &lt;math&gt;Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; is linear, depending only on frequency.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt; The circuit equation is &lt;math&gt;(Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; so it will only oscillate (have nonzero ''I'') at the frequency ''ω'' and amplitude ''I'' for which the total impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_N + Z_L \,&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

[[Image:Wwer-1000-scheme.png|thumb|Example of the core of a nuclear power plant, a [[VVER]] design.]]
A '''nuclear reactor core''' is the portion of a [[nuclear reactor]] containing the [[nuclear fuel]] components where the [[Nuclear fission|nuclear reactions]] take place and the heat is generated.  Typically, the fuel will be low-enriched [[uranium]] contained in thousands of individual fuel pins.  The core also contains structural components, the means to both moderate the [[neutron]]s and control the reaction, and the means to transfer the [[heat]] from the fuel to where it is required, outside the core.

== Water-moderated reactors == 
Inside the core of a typical [[pressurized water reactor]] or [[boiling water reactor]] are nuclear fuel rods equivalent to the diameter of a large gel type ink-pen, each about 4 m long, which are grouped by the hundreds in bundles called "fuel assemblies". Inside each fuel rod, pellets of uranium, or more commonly uranium oxide, are stacked end to end. Also inside the core are [[control rods]], filled with pellets of substances like [[boron]] or [[hafnium]] or [[cadmium]] that readily capture [[neutron]]s. When the control rods are lowered into the core, they absorb neutrons, which thus cannot take part in the [[chain reaction]]. Conversely, when the control rods are lifted out of the way, more neutrons strike the [[fissile]] [[uranium]]-235 (U-235) or [[plutonium]]-239 (Pu-239) nuclei in nearby fuel rods, and the [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] intensifies. The [[core shroud]], also located inside of the reactor, directs the water flow to cool the nuclear reactions inside of the core.

The heat of the fission reaction is removed by the water, which also acts to [[neutron moderators|moderate]] the neutron reactions.

An alternative form of nuclear fuel would be [[fissile]] [[uranium]]-233 (U-233) made by the neutron-bombardment of the common [[thorium]]-232.

== Graphite-moderated reactors ==
[[Image:MSRE Core.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Graphite [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] core]]
There are also [[Graphite moderated reactor]]s in use.

One type uses solid graphite for the [[neutron moderator]] and ordinary water for the coolant. See the Soviet-made [[RBMK]] nuclear-power reactor. This was the type of reactor involved in the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. 

In the [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]], a British design, the core is made of a graphite [[neutron moderator]] where the fuel assemblies are located. [[Carbon dioxide]] gas acts as a coolant and it circulates through the core, removing heat.

There have also been several experimental reactors that use graphite for moderation, such as the [[pebble bed reactor]] concepts and the [[molten-salt reactor experiment]].

'''RGX''' was a [[body spray]] owned by [[Dial Corporation]] and launched in January 2007. The product was an attempt by Dial to break into the body spray market, currently dominated by [[AXE Deodorant|AXE]] and [[TAG Body Spray|Tag]], through a marketing strategy directed at older men. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandweek.com/bw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003555840 Dial Hopes Right Guard Can Cut Into Axe's Business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=56665 MediaPost Publications - It Ads Up: Right Guard Takes Swing At Axe - 03/07/2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214023246/http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage |date=2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RGX employed the Internet to create buzz via a men's lifestyle website called RGX Life [http://www.rgxlife.com (www.rgxlife.com)], followed by television, print, and public relations activities. Television and online banners feature actress [[Rachel Specter]]. In 2009, the body spray line was discontinued.

'''Research Exchange Ltd''' is a [[FinTech]] company servicing the global asset management industry operating under the trading name RSRCHXchange. Its platform, RSRCHX, is an online marketplace for unbundled financial research.  RSRCHX provides asset management firms with a cloud-based repository of reports. Launched in September 2015, RSRCHX incorporates [[elasticsearch]], compliance checks and [[Commission Sharing Agreement]] (CSA) and credit card payment administration. RSRCHXchange is one of a number of [[FinTech]] start-ups offering products which relate to [[MiFID II]] ([[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]]), the European Union financial reforms intended as a response to the financial crisis to improve the functioning of financial markets and enhance investor protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/regulation/mifid-ii-and-investor-protection#title-paragrah-4 |title=Mifid (Ii) And Investor Protection |website=Esma.europa.eu |date=2014-04-05 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSRCHXchange's technology differs from other [[Financial data vendor|financial services vendors]] because its research catalogue is not dependent on [[XML|RIXML]], the industry-developed language for tagging documents. RSRCHXchange specialises in research unbundling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frostconsulting.co.uk/commission-unbundling-basics/ |title=Commission Unbundling - Basics |website=Frostconsulting.co.uk |date=2016-03-05 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most contentious topics of the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/452947/mifid-ii-payments-for-research-unbundling-the-confusion.pdf |format=PDF |title=MiFID II, PAYMENTS FOR RESEARCH: UNBUNDLING THE CONFUSION |website=Macfarlanes.com |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3502906/MiFID-II-transforms-market-for-research.html?p=2 |title=MiFID II transforms market for research /Euromoney magazine |website=Euromoney.com |date=2015-10-27 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research unbundling==
Globally $20bn a year is spent on research by asset managers and in the UK alone,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Edison Investment Research &amp; Frost Consulting, “The future of equity research”, January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the FCA estimates $4.5bn is spent on research.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;DP14/3 “Discussion on the use of dealing commission regime”, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Investment banks being the predominant supplier of external research to most investment managers. This effective oligopoly is the result of bundled commission rates where all services, including research, are paid for at the point of trading exclusively to the executing counterparty. Therefore, the investment banks who enjoy the largest trading volumes have also captured a dominant share of research payments.

The UK FCA ([[Financial Conduct Authority]]) and ESMA ([[European Securities and Markets Authority]]) have been debating reforms to the economic structure of investment research for a decade. The dot com boom of 2000 made it abundantly clear to regulators that equity research, investors, fund managers and public companies were too heavily interdependent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2736820|title=The Changing Market for Investment Research|date=2015-03-15|website=SSRN|accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US responded by imposing restrictions on sell side analyst activities, while the UK placed the responsibility on the buy side through the [[Myners Report]] (2001), which recommended changes in commission and investment research payments – effectively unbundling. The FCA has consistently argued that unbundling research from dealing commissions would drive both price efficiency and market transparency and at the same time enhance competition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 2006, the introduction of [[commission sharing agreement]]s (CSAs), which enabled fund managers for the first time to instruct their broker to pay away commissions to other research entities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinvestmentassociation.org/assets/files/research/2014/20140218-imadealingcommissionresearch.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Use of Dealing Commission for the Purchase of Investment Research |website=Theinvestmentassociation.org |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a further crucial step towards research unbundling. Given the UK market’s global significance, and the international nature of the brokerage market, this approach has gained traction internationally beyond the UK and represents a significant change in the market for investment research.

MiFID II has the potential to be the most significant catalyst for change in the market for investment research in decades. Crucially, the implementation of MiFID II, which is currently scheduled for January 2018, will require all sell side research to be individually priced and thus effect full price transparency.  Investment firms will be required to set and assess research budgets and MiFID II states that that payment must be direct, out of the firm’s own resources, without any undue delay. Full unbundling will finally be achieved as fund management firms will be required to create research payment accounts (RPAs) based on a pre-set budget independent of trading activity. This has met with heavy criticism and lobbying from a number of industry organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinvestmentassociation.org/media-centre/press-releases/2014/press-release-2014-05-22a.html |title=Press Release 2014-05-22a |publisher=Investment Association |date=2014-05-22 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MiFID II text also includes further demands of buy side firms which will require buyers and sellers to review and revise the research procurement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2015/11/2014-1570_cp_mifid_ii.pdf |format=PDF |title=Consultation Paper : MiFID II/MiFIR |website=Esma.europa.eu |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FCA has already issued a statement of “support” for ESMA’s new policies for investment research and advising asset management firms to start making changes now to prepare themselves for the inevitable regulatory change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/your-fca/documents/feedback-statements/fs15-01 |title=FS15/1: Feedback statement on DP14/3 – Discussion on the use of dealing commission regime - Financial Conduct Authority |website=Fca.org.uk |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While MiFID II’s scope is pan-European only, the regulator recognises that its proposed changes may resonate on a global scale as asset managers are likely to adopt a common system across their global businesses.

==Commission sharing agreement== 
[[Commission sharing agreement]]s (CSA) allow asset management firms to pay out a portion of commissions to research providers instead of the executing broker retaining the entire commission, Commission Sharing Agreements (CSAs) have expanded the content available to investment managers. CSAs have gained traction as a tool giving asset managers greater control over their research payments and enabling them to expand their range of research providers to include independent research providers (IRPs).

CSA penetration rates vary significantly across Europe but are highest in the UK, recently reaching 70%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the US, the use of Client Commission Arrangements (CSA equivalent) is well-entrenched and these two geographies have leading IRP presence. There are estimates of between 2,000 &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and 6,000 IRPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convergex.com/company/press-room/convergex-groups-westminster-research-associates-set-to-surpass-300-m-in-an |title=Convergex Group’s Westminster Research Associates Set to Surpass $300 M in Annual Payments &amp;#124; Press Room &amp;#124; Company |website=Convergex.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the introduction of CSAs has enabled fund managers to access a broader range of research, providing more valuable inputs to their investment process and thus benefiting the end investor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

[[File:Nozzle RSA-3-001.jpg|thumb|Nozzle on the first stage of an [[Shavit|RSA-3]] rocket]]
A '''rocket engine nozzle''' is a [[propelling nozzle]] (usually of the [[de Laval nozzle|de Laval]] type) used in a [[rocket engine]] to expand and accelerate the [[combustion]] gases produced by burning [[propellants]] so that the exhaust gases exit the nozzle at [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] velocities.

Simply: the rocket (pumps and a combustion chamber) generates high pressure, a few hundred [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s.  The nozzle turns the static high pressure high temperature gas into rapidly moving gas at near-ambient pressure.

==History==

The de Laval nozzle was originally developed in the 19th century by [[Gustaf de Laval]] for use in [[steam turbine]]s. It was first used in an early rocket engine developed by [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]], one of the fathers of modern rocketry. It has since been used in almost all rocket engines, including [[Walter Theill]]'s implementation, which made possible Germany's [[V-2]] rocket.

==Atmospheric use==

The optimal size of a rocket engine nozzle to be used within the atmosphere is achieved when the exit pressure equals ambient (atmospheric) pressure, which decreases with altitude. For rockets travelling from the Earth to orbit, a simple nozzle design is only optimal at one altitude, losing efficiency and wasting fuel at other altitudes.

Just past the throat, the pressure of the gas is higher than ambient pressure and needs to be lowered between the throat and the nozzle exit by expansion. If the pressure of the jet leaving the nozzle exit is still above ambient pressure, then a nozzle is said to be "underexpanded"; if the jet is below ambient pressure, then it is "overexpanded".

Slight overexpansion causes a slight reduction in efficiency, but otherwise does little harm. However, if the exit pressure is less than approximately 40% that of ambient, then "flow separation" occurs. This can cause jet instabilities that can cause damage to the nozzle or simply cause control difficulties of the vehicle or the engine.

In some cases it is desirable for reliability and safety reasons to ignite a rocket engine on the ground that will be used all the way to orbit. For optimal [[Takeoff|liftoff]] performance, the pressure of the gases exiting nozzle should be at sea-level pressure; however, if a rocket engine is primarily designed for use at high altitudes and is only providing additional thrust to another "first-stage" engine during liftoff in a [[multi-stage]] design, then designers will usually opt for an overexpanded nozzle (at sea-level) design, making it more efficient at higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower. This was the technique employed on the [[Space shuttle]]'s [[SSME|main engines]], which spent most of their powered trajectory in near-vacuum, while the shuttle's two [[solid rocket booster]]s provided the majority of the liftoff thrust.

==Vacuum use==

For nozzles that are used in vacuum or at very high altitude, it is impossible to match ambient pressure; rather, nozzles with larger area ratio are usually more efficient. However, a very long nozzle has significant mass, a drawback in and of itself. A length that optimises overall vehicle performance typically has to be found. Additionally, as the temperature of the gas in the nozzle decreases, some components of the exhaust gases (such as water vapour from the combustion process) may condense or even freeze. This is highly undesirable and needs to be avoided.

[[Magnetic nozzle]]s have been proposed for some types of propulsion (for example [[VASIMR]]), in which the flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or ions are directed by [[magnetic field]]s instead of walls made of solid materials. These can be advantageous, since a magnetic field itself cannot melt, and the plasma temperatures can reach millions of [[kelvin]]s. However, there are often thermal design challenges presented by the coils themselves, particularly if superconducting coils are used to form the throat and expansion fields.

==One-dimensional analysis of gas flow in rocket engine nozzles==
[[File:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of a de Laval nozzle, showing flow velocity (v) increasing in the direction of flow, with decreases in temperature (t) and pressure (p). The Mach number (M) increases from subsonic, to sonic at the throat, to supersonic.]]

{{main|De Laval nozzle}}

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and simplifying assumptions:

* The combustion gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].
* The gas flow is [[isentropic]] i.e., at constant [[entropy]], as the result of the assumption of non-viscous fluid, and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] process.
* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.
* The gas flow is non-turbulent and axisymmetric from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)
* The flow behavior is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the fluid is a gas.

As the combustion gas enters the rocket nozzle, it is traveling at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat constricts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the least, the linear velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the linear velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].

The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation &lt;ref name=Nakka&gt;[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Braeuning&gt;[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 2.22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutton, George P.|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=6th|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1992|isbn=0-471-52938-9|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some typical values of the exhaust gas velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' for rocket engines burning various propellants are:

* 1.7 to 2.9&amp;nbsp;km/s (3800 to 6500&amp;nbsp;mi/h) for liquid [[monopropellant]]s
* 2.9 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;km/s (6500 to 10100&amp;nbsp;mi/h) for liquid [[bipropellant]]s
* 2.1 to 3.2&amp;nbsp;km/s (4700 to 7200&amp;nbsp;mi/h) for [[solid rocket|solid propellant]]s

As a note of interest, '''''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is sometimes referred to as the ''ideal exhaust gas velocity'' because it based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.

As an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the  propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle of '''''p'''''&amp;nbsp;= 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure of '''''p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of '''''T''''' = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor of '''''γ''''' = 1.22 and a molar mass of '''''M'''''&amp;nbsp;= 22&amp;nbsp;kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity '''''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = 2802&amp;nbsp;m/s or 2.80&amp;nbsp;km/s which is consistent with above typical values.

The technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant '''''R''''' which applies to any [[ideal gas]] or whether they are using the gas law constant '''''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''''' which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is '''''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = '''''R/M''''', where R is the universal gas constant, and M is the molar mass of the gas.

==Specific impulse==

[[Thrust]] is the force that moves a rocket through the air or space. Thrust is generated by the [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system of the rocket through the application of Newton's third law of motion: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction".  A gas or working fluid is accelerated out the rear of the rocket engine nozzle, and the rocket is accelerated in the opposite direction. The thrust of a rocket engine nozzle can be defined as:&lt;ref name=Nakka/&gt;&lt;ref name=Braeuning/&gt;&lt;ref name=NASAThrust&gt;[http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rockth.html NASA: Rocket thrust]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASASummary&gt;[http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktthsum.html NASA: Rocket thrust summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F &amp;= \dot{m} v_\text{e} + \left(p_\text{e} - p_\text{o}\right) A_e \\[2pt]
    &amp;= \dot{m} \left[v_\text{e} + \left(\frac{p_\text{e} - p_\text{o}}{\dot{m}}\right) A_\text{e}\right],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and for perfectly expanded nozzles, this reduces to:
:&lt;math&gt;F = \dot{m} v_\text{eq}.&lt;/math&gt;

The specific impulse &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the thrust produced to the weight flow of the [[propellant]]s.  It is a measure of the fuel efficiency of a rocket engine. In [[Specific impulse#Units|English Engineering units]] it can be obtained as&lt;ref name=NASAIsp&gt;[http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/specimp.html NASA:Rocket specific impulse]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp} = \frac{F}{\dot{m} g_\text{o}} = \frac{\dot{m} v_\text{eq}}{\dot{m} g_\text{o}} = \frac{v_\text{eq}}{g_\text{o}},&lt;/math&gt;

|align=left|[[standard gravity|standard gravitational acceleration]] at sea level on Earth = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s²
|}

In certain cases, where &lt;math&gt;p_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;p_\text{o}&lt;/math&gt;, the formula becomes

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp} = \frac{F}{\dot{m}\,g_\text{o}} \,=\, \frac{\dot{m}\,v_\text{e}}{\dot{m}\,g_\text{o}} \,=\,\frac{v_\text{e}}{g_\text{o}}&lt;/math&gt;

In cases where this may not be so, since for a rocket nozzle &lt;math&gt;p_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to define a constant quantity that is the vacuum &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp,vac}&lt;/math&gt; for any given engine thus:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp,vac} = \frac{v_\text{e}}{g_\text{o}} + \frac{p_\text{e} A_\text{e}}{\dot{m} g_\text{o}},&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

:&lt;math&gt;F = I_\text{sp,vac}\, g_\text{o} \dot{m} - A_\text{e} p_\text{o},&lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the vacuum thrust minus the force of the ambient atmospheric pressure acting over the exit plane.

Essentially then, for rocket nozzles, the ambient pressure acting on the engine cancels except over the exit plane of the rocket engine in a rearward direction, while the exhaust jet generates forward thrust.

If a nozzle is under- or overexpanded, then loss of efficiency occurs relative to an ideal nozzle.

Grossly overexpanded nozzles have improved efficiency relative to an underexpanded nozzle (though are still less efficient than a nozzle with the ideal expansion ratio), however the exhaust jet is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Huzel, D. K.  |author2=Huang, D. H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=NASA SP-125, Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|edition=2nd|publisher=NASA|year=1971|id=}}[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=306030&amp;id=4&amp;qs=Ne%3D35%26Ns%3DHarvestDate%257C0%26N%3D280%2B4294967231 Technical report]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Aerostatic back-pressure and optimal expansion==

As the gas travels down the expansion part of the nozzle, the pressure and temperature decrease, while the speed of the gas increases.

The supersonic nature of the exhaust jet means that the pressure of the exhaust can be significantly different from ambient pressure – the outside air is unable to equalize the pressure upstream due to the very high jet velocity. Therefore, for supersonic nozzles, it is actually possible for the pressure of the gas exiting the nozzle to be significantly below or very greatly above ambient pressure.

If the exit pressure is too low, then the jet can separate from the nozzle. This is often unstable, and the jet will generally cause large off-axis thrusts and may mechanically damage the nozzle.

This separation generally occurs if the exit pressure drops below roughly 30–45% of ambient, but separation may be delayed to far lower pressures if the nozzle is designed to increase the pressure at the rim, as is achieved with the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSME]] (1–2 psi at 15 psi ambient).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k-makris.gr/RocketTechnology/Nozzle_Design/nozzle_design.htm|title=Nozzle Design|accessdate=November 23, 2011|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, as the rocket engine starts up or throttles, the chamber pressure varies, and this generates different levels of efficiency. At low chamber pressures the engine is almost inevitably going to be grossly over-expanded.

==Optimal shape==

The ratio of the area of the narrowest part of the nozzle to the exit plane area is mainly what determines how efficiently the expansion of the exhaust gases is converted into linear velocity, the exhaust velocity, and therefore the [[thrust]] of the rocket engine. The gas properties have an effect as well.

The shape of the nozzle also modestly affects how efficiently the expansion of the exhaust gases is converted into linear motion. The simplest nozzle shape has a ~15° cone half-angle, which is about 98% efficient. Smaller angles give very slightly higher efficiency, larger angles give lower efficiency.

More complex shapes of revolution are frequently used, such as [[Bell nozzle]]s or parabolic shapes. These give perhaps 1% higher efficiency than the cone nozzle and can be shorter and lighter. They are widely used on launch vehicles and other rockets where weight is at a premium. They are, of course, harder to fabricate, so are typically more costly.

There is also a theoretically optimal nozzle shape for maximal exhaust speed. However, a shorter bell shape is typically used, which gives better overall performance due to its much lower weight, shorter length, lower drag losses, and only very marginally lower exhaust speed.&lt;ref name="nozzledesign"&gt;[http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm PWR Engineering: Nozzle Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316084228/http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm |date=2008-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other design aspects affect the efficiency of a rocket nozzle. The nozzle's throat should have a smooth radius. The internal angle that narrows to the throat also has an effect on the overall efficiency, but this is small. The exit angle of the nozzle needs to be as small as possible (about 12°) in order to minimize the chances of separation problems at low exit pressures.

==Advanced designs==
A number of more sophisticated designs have been proposed for [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude compensation]] and other uses.

Nozzles with an atmospheric boundary include:
*[[Expansion deflection nozzle|expansion-deflection nozzle]],&lt;ref name="Sutton"/&gt;
*[[plug nozzle]],
*[[aerospike engine|aerospike]],&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutton, George P.|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2001|isbn=0-471-32642-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rocket+propulsion&amp;ei=wlEhScL4EYywkwSVv5SCDw#PPA84,M1-- p. 84]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JPP/1998/PVJAIMP5354.pdf Journal of Propulsion and Power Vol.14 No.5, "Advanced Rocket Nozzles", Hagemann et al.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Single Expansion Ramp Nozzle ([[SERN]]), a linear expansion nozzle, where the gas pressure transfers work only on one side and which could be described as a single-sided aerospike nozzle.
Each of these allows the supersonic flow to adapt to the ambient pressure by expanding or contracting, thereby changing the exit ratio so that it is at (or near) optimal exit pressure for the corresponding altitude. The plug and aerospike nozzles are very similar in that they are radial in-flow designs but plug nozzles feature a solid centerbody (sometimes truncated) and aerospike nozzles have a "base-bleed" of gases to simulate a solid center-body. ED nozzles are radial out-flow nozzles with the flow deflected by a center pintle.

Controlled flow-separation nozzles include:
*[[expanding nozzle]],
*bell nozzles with a removable insert,
*[[Stepped nozzles]], or dual-bell nozzles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=japaperimport&amp;gID=5905 Journal of Propulsion and Power Vol.18 No.1, "Experimental and Analytical Design Verification of the Dual-Bell Concept", Hagemann et al.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616192709/http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=japaperimport&amp;gID=5905 |date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These are generally very similar to bell nozzles but include an insert or mechanism by which the exit area ratio can be increased as ambient pressure is reduced.

Dual-mode nozzles include:
*dual-expander nozzle,
*dual-throat nozzle.
These have either two throats or two thrust chambers (with corresponding throats). The central throat is of a standard design and is surrounded by an annular throat, which exhausts gases from the same (dual-throat) or a separate (dual-expander) thrust chamber. Both throats would, in either case, discharge into a bell nozzle. At higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower, the central nozzle would be shut off, reducing the throat area and thereby increasing the nozzle area ratio. These designs require additional complexity, but an advantage of having two thrust chambers is that they can be configured to burn different propellants or different fuel mixture ratios. Similarly, Aerojet has also designed a nozzle called the "Thrust Augmented Nozzle",&lt;ref name="Thrust Augmented Nozzle"&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V1N-4K427MV-2&amp;_user=121739&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000010018&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=121739&amp;md5=dfdf8a69755f6b8d29a842f0447ce8b0 Thrust Augmented Nozzle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TAN"&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA454615 THRUST AUGMENTED NOZZLE (TAN) the New Paradigm for Booster Rockets]&lt;/ref&gt; which injects propellant and oxidiser directly into the nozzle section for combustion, allowing larger area ratio nozzles to be used deeper in an atmosphere than they would without augmentation due to effects of flow separation. They would again allow multiple propellants to be used (such as RP-1), further increasing thrust.

Liquid injection thrust vectoring nozzles are another advanced design that allow pitch and yaw control from un-gimbaled nozzles. India's [[PSLV]] calls its design "Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control System"; strontium perchlorate is injected through various fluid paths in the nozzle to achieve the desired control. Some ICBMs and boosters, such as the [[Titan IIIC]] and [[Minuteman II]], use similar designs.

harvnb|Curtis|Gerstoft|Sato|Snieder|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Seismic interferometry''' (SI) utilizes the [[cross-correlation|crosscorrelation]] of signal pairs to reconstruct the impulse response of a given media.

A signal at a location A can be crosscorrelated with a signal at a location B to reproduce a virtual source-receiver pair using seismic interferometry. [[cross-correlation|Crosscorrelation]] is often considered the key mathematical operation in this approach, but it is also possible to use [[convolution]] to come up with a similar result. The crosscorrelation of passive noise measured at a free surface reproduces the subsurface impulse response. As such, it is possible to obtain information about the subsurface with no need for an active [[seismic source]].&lt;ref name=drag06/&gt; This method, however, is not limited to passive sources, and can be extended for use with [[Seismic source|active sources]] and computer&amp;ndash;generated [[waveform]]s.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;

[[File:Seismic wave prop mine.gif|thumb|Image showing usefulness of seismic waves to investigate the subsurface]] 
As of 2006 the field of seismic interferometry was beginning to change the way [[geophysics|geophysicists]] view noise. Seismic interferometry uses this previously&amp;ndash;ignored noise in models of the shallow subsurface. Potential applications include both research and industry.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;

==History and Development==
[[Jon Claerbout|Claerbout]] (1968) developed a workflow to apply existing interferometry techniques to investigating the shallow subsurface, although it was not proven until later that seismic interferometry could be applied to real world media.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;&lt;ref name=wl01&gt;{{
harvnb|Weaver|Lobkis|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The long term average of [[random]] [[ultrasound]] waves can reconstruct the impulse response between two points on an [[aluminum]] block. However, they had assumed random diffuse noise, limiting interferometry in real world conditions. In a similar case, it was shown that the expressions for uncorrelated noise sources reduce to a single crosscorrelation of observations at two receivers. The interferometric impulse response of the subsurface can be reconstructed using only an extended record of background noise, initially only for the surface and direct wave arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Wapenaar|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Campillo|Paul|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosscorrelations of seismic signals from both active and passive sources at the surface or in the subsurface can be used to reconstruct a valid model of the subsurface.&lt;ref name=sysr04&gt;{{
harvnb|Schuster|Yu|Sheng|Rickett|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismic interferometry can produce a result similar to traditional methods without limitations on the diffusivity of the wavefield or ambient sources. In a drilling application, it is possible to utilize a virtual source to image the subsurface adjacent to a downhole location. This application is increasingly utilized particularly for exploration in subsalt settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Bakulin|Calvert|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical and Physical Explanation==
Seismic interferometry provides for the possibility of reconstructing the subsurface reflection response using the crosscorrelations of two seismic traces.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;&lt;ref name=drag06/&gt; Recent work&lt;ref name=wf06/&gt; has mathematically demonstrated applications of crosscorrelation for reconstructing [[Greens function|Green's function]] using wave field reciprocity theorem in a lossless, 3D heterogeneous medium. Traces are most often extended records of passive background noise, but it is also possible to utilize active sources depending on the objective. Seismic interferometry essentially exploits the [[phase difference]] between adjacent receiver locations to image the subsurface.

Seismic interferometry consists of simple crosscorrelation and stacking of actual receiver responses to approximate the impulse response as if a virtual source was placed at the location of the applicable receiver.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt; Crosscorrelation of continuous functions in the time domain is presented as Equation 1.

===Equation 1===
&lt;big&gt;(f 1∗f 2)(t)= ∫ f 1(λ)f 2(λ-t)dλ&lt;/big&gt;

Where the functions are integrated as a function of time at different lag values. In fact, crosscorrelation can be understood conceptually as the traveltime lag associated with waveforms in two discrete receiver locations. Crosscorrelation is similar to convolution where the second function is folded relative to the first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Convolution.html Animation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seismic interferometry is fundamentally similar to the [[Optical interferometry|optical interferogram]] produced by the interference of a direct and reflected wave passing through a glass lens where intensity is primarily dependent upon the phase component. 
[[File:Convolution of spiky function with box.gif|thumb|475px|Principle of convolution. Similar to cross-correlation]]

===Equation 2===
&lt;big&gt;I = 1+2R2 cos[ω(λAr+λrB)]+R^4&lt;/big&gt;

Where:
Intensity is related to the magnitude of the reflection coefficient (R) and the phase component ω(λAr+λrB).&lt;ref name=drag06&gt;{{
harvnb|Draganov|Wapenaar|Thorbecke|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wf06&gt;{{
harvnb|Wapenaar|Fokkema|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of the reflectivity distributions can be obtained through the crosscorrelation of the direct wave at a location A with the reflection recorded at a location B where A represents the reference trace.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt; The multiplication of the conjugate of the trace spectrum at A and the trace spectrum at B gives:

===Equation 3===
&lt;big&gt;ФAB =Re^iω(λAr+λrB) + o.t.&lt;/big&gt;

Where:
ФAB = product spectrum
o.t. = additional terms, e.g. correlations of direct-direct,{{huh|date=September 2018}} etc. As in the previous case, the product spectrum is a function of phase.

Key: Changes in reflector geometry lead to changes in the correlation result and the reflector geometry can be recovered through the application of a migration kernel.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt; Interpretation of raw interferograms is not normally attempted; crosscorrelated results are generally processed using some form of migration.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt;

In the simplest case, consider a rotating [[drill bit]] at depth radiating energy that is recorded by [[geophone]]s on the surface. It is possible to assume that the phase of the source wavelet at a given position is random and utilize the crosscorrelation of the direct wave at a location A with a ghost reflection at a location B to image a subsurface reflector without any knowledge regarding the source location.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt; The crosscorrelation of traces A and B in the frequency domain simplifies as:

===Equation 4===
&lt;big&gt;Ф(A, B) = −(Wiω)^2 Re^iω(λArλrB)+o.t.&lt;/big&gt;

Where:
Wi(ω) = frequency domain source wavelet (ith wavelet)

The crosscorrelation of the direct wave at a location A with a ghost reflection at a location B removes the unknown source term where:

===Equation 5===
&lt;big&gt;Ф(A,B)≈Re^iω(λArλrB)&lt;/big&gt;

This form is equivalent to a virtual source configuration at a location A imaging hypothetical reflections at a location B. Migration of these correlation positions removes the phase term and yields a final migration image at position x where:

m(x) = Σø(A,B,λAx+λxB)
Where:
ø(A,B,t) = temporal correlation between locations A and B with lag time t

This model has been applied to simulate subsurface  geometry in West Texas using simulated models including a traditional buried source and a synthetic (virtual) rotating drill bit source to produce similar results.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt;&lt;ref name=yfs03&gt;{{
harvnb|Yu|Followill|Schuster|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar model demonstrated the reconstruction of a simulated subsurface [[geometry]].&lt;ref name=drag06/&gt; In this case, the reconstructed subsurface response correctly modeled the relative positions of primaries and multiples. Additional equations can be derived to reconstruct signal geometries in a wide variety of cases.

==Applications==
Seismic interferometry is currently utilized primarily in research and academic settings. In one example, passive listening and the crosscorrelation of long noise traces was used to approximate the impulse response for shallow subsurface velocity analysis in Southern California. Seismic interferometry provided a result comparable to that indicated using elaborate inversion techniques. Seismic interferometry is most often used for the examination of the near surface and is
often utilized to reconstruct surface and direct waves only. As such, seismic interferometry is commonly used to estimate ground roll to aid in its removal.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt; Seismic interferometry simplifies estimates of shear wave velocity and attenuation in a standing building.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Snieder|Safak|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seismic interferometry has been applied to image the seismic scattering &lt;ref name=chaput12&gt;Chaput et al., 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and velocity structure &lt;ref name=brenguier07&gt;Brenguier et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; of volcanoes.

[[File:Seg-y picture.gif|thumb|Seismic display as recorded by geophones]]

===Exploration and production===
Increasingly, seismic interferometry is finding a place in [[Hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] and production.&lt;ref name=hy07&gt;{{
harvnb|Hornby|Yu|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; SI can image dipping sediments adjacent to [[salt dome]]s.&lt;ref name=lwcf06&gt;{{
harvnb|Lu|Willis|Campman|Franklin|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex salt geometries are poorly resolved using traditional [[seismic reflection]] techniques. An alternative method calls for the use of downhole sources and receivers adjacent to subsurface salt features. It is often difficult to generate an ideal seismic signal in a downhole location.&lt;ref name=hy07/&gt;&lt;ref name=lwcf06/&gt; Seismic interferometry can virtually move a source into a downhole location to better illuminate and capture steeply dipping
sediments on the flank of a salt dome. In this case, the SI result was very similar to that obtained using an actual downhole source. Seismic interferometry can locate the position of an unknown source and is often utilized in [[Hydro-fracing|hydrofrac]] applications to map the extent of induced fractures.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt; It is possible that interferometric techniques can be applied to timelapse seismic monitoring of subtle changes in reservoir properties in the subsurface.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;

==Limitations==
Seismic interferometry applications are currently limited by a number of factors. Real world media and noise represent limitations for current theoretical development. For example, for interferometry to work [[Passive seismic|noise sources]] must be uncorrelated and completely surround the region of interest. In addition, attenuation and geometrical spreading are largely neglected and need to be incorporated into more robust models.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt; Other challenges are inherent to seismic interferometry. For example, the source term only drops out in the case of the crosscorrelation of a direct wave at a location A with a ghost reflection at a location B. The correlation of other waveforms can introduce multiples to the resulting [[interferogram]]. Velocity analysis and filtering can reduce but not eliminate the occurrence of multiples in a given dataset.&lt;ref name=sysr04/&gt;

Although there have been many advancements in seismic interferometry challenges still remain. One of the biggest remaining challenges is extending the theory to account for real world media and noise distributions in the subsurface. Natural sources typically do not comply with mathematical generalizations and may in fact display some degree of correlation.&lt;ref name=curtis06/&gt;  Additional problems must be addressed before applications of seismic interferometry can become more widespread.

A '''sex toy''' is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual pleasure]], such as a [[dildo]] or [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]].  Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals and may be vibrating or non-vibrating.  The term ''sex toy'' can also include [[BDSM]] apparatus and [[sex furniture]] such as [[fisting sling|slings]]; however, it is not applied to items such as [[birth control]], [[pornography]], or [[condom]]s. Alternative expressions include '''adult toy''' and the dated euphemism '''marital aid''', although "marital aid" has a broader sense and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to supposedly enhance or prolong sex. Sex toys are most commonly sold at a [[sex shop]], but they may also be sold in a pharmacy/chemist store, a pornographic DVD store, or [[head shop]]. Today's sex toys are available in almost all countries for male and females.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Types==

=== Erotic electrostimulation ===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
Another form of sex toy for both men and women are those for [[erotic electrostimulation]].

Erotic electrostimulation refers to the act of using electricity for sexual stimulation. Electrostimulation dates back as early as the mid 1700s. By the mid 1970s, medical transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machines were widely available. The machines work by stimulating nerve endings with electricity, sending signals of stimulation to the brain. Electrostimulation works off this same principle, when the brain received a signal of stimulation from the genitals, pleasure hormones are released.

===Erotic furniture===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
[[Erotic furniture]] is furniture specially shaped for comfort, penetration levels, and stimulation.

===General penetrative toys===
[[Image:Ben Wa balls.jpg|thumb|upright|A type of Ben Wa balls]]
{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=

| footer = ''Top-'' A woman [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] a man [[doggy-style]] with a pink [[strap-on dildo]]. ''Bottom-'' Illustration of [[anal bead]] use
}}
* [[Ben Wa balls]] are hollow metal balls inserted vaginally which can be worn inside the vagina for extended periods of time. The internal rolling is claimed to enhance orgasms.
* Love Balls are solid metal balls inserted vaginally prior to sex. The weight and agitation by penis or dildo enhance sensation. They were popularised by the novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' and its film adaptation.
* A [[dildo]] is a non-vibrating device which is used for sexual stimulation of the vagina or anus. Dildos are generally made of silicone rubber, but can be made of other materials such as body safe metals such as titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, or glass. They are often made to resemble a penis, although some are C-shaped or S-shaped for G-spot or P-spot stimulation.
** A [[double penetration dildo]] is a long, usually flexible dildo with both ends designed for penetration. It allows for mutual penetration between two persons (or for double penetration of  a single female, both anally and vaginally).
** A [[strap-on dildo]] is a dildo worn in a harness, used to penetrate another person.
* A horseshoe is a non-vibrating sex toy which is shaped similar to a [[horseshoe]], which is put into the vagina and anus at the same time. It is made with softer plastics.
* [[Kegel exercise]]r, also known as vaginal barbells, eggs, or jugglers, are designed to improve muscle tone in the [[pelvic floor]], and can be used for sexual pleasure as well as enhancing vaginal response.
* A [[sex-machine]] is a motor-driven device that combines penetration with rotational or reciprocal movement, or both.&lt;ref name="leung"&gt;Leung, Isaac (2009). "The Cultural Production of Sex Machines and the Contemporary Technosexual Practices". In Grenzfurthner, J. et al., eds. ''Do androids sleep with electric sheep? Critical perspectives on sexuality and pornography in science and social fiction.''  [[RE/SEARCH]], {{ISBN|978-1-889307-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anal toys====
[[Image:Zwei unterschiedliche Butt-Plugs.jpg|upright|thumb|Two butt plugs]]
* [[Anal beads]]
* [[Butt plug]]s are often shorter dildos intended for anal insertion.  They tend to have a flared base to prevent the device from becoming sucked into the rectum.
* [[Prostate massage]]rs are devices designed to stimulate a man's [[prostate]] for health and pleasure.

====Glass sex toys====
[[File:Glass Dildo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Glass [[Dildo]]]]
Glass sex toys are commonly made from clear medical grade [[borosilicate glass]] ("hard glass"). This particular type of safety toughened glass is non-toxic and will withstand extreme temperatures, as well as physical shock without compromising its structural integrity.

The choice of this high-grade material provides safety in use and the option to heat or chill the toys. Borosilicate glass is also non-porous and can be sterilized to help prevent infection with reuse. The highest quality glass toys can even be put in the dishwasher making them easier to keep clean. As well as their practical qualities, a main selling point of glass sex toys is their visual appeal.

Some glass sex toys vibrate.  There are two main ways this can be achieved. Either the toy may have a hole into which a small bullet vibrator can be inserted, or the core of the glass design can be modified to form a standard vibrator. The latter option usually has a plastic cap covering the battery compartment, which will also house any control buttons or switches.

====Vibrators====
{{main|Vibrator (sex toy)}}
Vibrators are vibrating devices intended to stimulate the body. Vibrators come in a range of shapes and sizes, for internal or external use.  Some vibrators intended for internal use are [[Phallus|phallic]] in shape.  Small vibrators may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or [[cock ring]]. Penetrative vibrators usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average [[human penis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

* [[Anal vibrator]]s are designed to be inserted into the rectum, which may stimulate the [[prostate]] in men.  The safest ones have a flared base which remains outside the body, that prevents the toy from becoming irretrievable.
*  Bullet vibrators are small, bullet-shaped vibrators that can be used for direct stimulation or inserted into other sex toys to increase stimulation.  Some are sold with stretchy loops for attachment as a finger toy or [[cock ring]].
* Luxury vibrators have an increased focus on design and the use of expensive materials that appeal to a more upscale fashion market.
* [[G-spot vibrator]]s are curved at one end to facilitate stimulation of the female [[G-spot]].
* The [[rabbit vibrator]], of which there are several variations, is a popular female sex toy popularized by the television series ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name="Sex and The City Episode Guide"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Sex and The City Episode Guide| publisher = HBO.com| url = http://www.hbo.com/city/episode/season1/episode09.shtml| accessdate =2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises an insertable shaft which often has additional functionality, such as rotation and internal beads or a thrusting action. Attached to the shaft is a vibrating clitoral stimulator. For most rabbit vibrators this comes in the form of "bunny ears" which sit each side of the [[clitoris]].
* Vibrator wands, such as the [[Hitachi Magic Wand]], are large vibrators that generally plug into an electrical outlet (versus operating on battery power) and are often marketed as back massagers.&lt;ref name="christophertrout"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trout |first1=Christopher |title=The 46-year-old sex toy Hitachi won't talk about |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |accessdate=30 August 2014 |work=[[Engadget]] |date=28 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827183517/http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/history-of-the-hitachi-magic-wand/ |archivedate=27 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are able to produce far more powerful vibration than most battery-powered vibrators.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;  Various attachments made of silicone or a rubber material allow the toy to be used penetratively, or give the toy more interesting texture.&lt;ref name="christophertrout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand, with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle).

* [[Sybian]]s are dual-area vibrators in the form of a clitoral stimulator and vaginal stimulator, designed to stimulate the two erogenous zones simultaneously and independently.

===Nipple toys===
* A [[nipple clamp]] is a clamp used to stimulate the nipples by applying varying degrees of pressure.
* Suction devices are generally either rubber or glass.

===Penile toys===
[[Image:Sex Toy.png|thumb|100px|A penis sleeve]]
* [[Artificial vagina]]s, also known as "pocket pussies" or "male masturbators", are tubes made of soft material to simulate [[sexual intercourse]]. The material and often textured inner canal are designed to stimulate the [[Human penis|penis]] and induce [[orgasm]]. The male masturbators come in many shapes and styles; they can be shaped like [[vulva]]s, anuses, mouths, or as non-descriptive holes. Some male masturbators are [[disposable]] and some can be washed and used repeatedly. Some are equipped with [[sex-machine]] options that work similar to [[milking machines]].&lt;ref name="browne"&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray Broadus|year=1982|title=Objects of special devotion: fetishism in popular culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NO5DkzptBeoC|page=49|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-191-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A cock harness is a more elaborate harness designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with [[BDSM]] activities such as [[cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|cock and ball torture]]. An [[Arab strap (sexual device)|Arab strap]] is one such form of harness, purported to be a device used for maintaining an erection.
* [[Cock ring]]s prolong male erection by holding blood inside the penis. A man may wear a cock-ring to combat erectile difficulties, or for the sensation of tightness and engorgement that wearing one provides. Some models include a protruding [[Clitoris|clitoral]] stimulator, designed to stimulate the clitoris during sex. Others vibrate, either vibrating the ring itself, or in a popular 'Dolphin' variant by using two removable bullet vibrators to provide stimulation to both the testicles and clitoris. Some cock rings also have [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] attached which can be worn to stimulate a partner during [[sexual intercourse]], especially in the [[scrotum]] or [[perineum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremerestraints.com/nova-silicone-cock-ring-and-prostate-vibe.html|title="Nova Silicone Cock Ring and Prostate Vibe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other cock rings have arms that rub and apply pressure to the [[perineum]] of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Albert G|year=1994|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US5439007|title=United States Patent 5,439,007 "Suspensory"|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** A triple crown is a special cock ring that has additional rings for restraining the testicles. In orgasm, the testicles usually retract toward the body before [[ejaculation]]. A triple crown changes and intensifies the sensation of orgasm by forcing the testicles to stay away from the body.
* A docking sleeve is a cylindrical device similar to a penis sleeve, but is open at both ends, so that two men can [[List of sex positions#Genital-genital sex|dock]], a form of [[Mutual masturbation#Mutual masturbation as a form of non-penetrative sex|mutual masturbation]].
* A penis extension is a partially hollow device like a very short dildo, with the hollow end placed on the end of the penis, intended to increase the effective length of the penis, again for the benefit of the person being penetrated. These are generally worn with condoms to prevent them from falling off during use.
* A penis sleeve is a cylindrical device that is placed on the shaft of the penis, with the aim of increasing stimulation for the person being penetrated. They often have soft bumps intended to provide further stimulation.

==Health, safety, and privacy concerns==

No safety regulations exist in the sex toy industry. The sex toys are sold as novelty items so they do not need to adhere to certain regulations such as reporting the chemicals and materials used in a product. Due to this status, manufacturers are not responsible if their toys are used for any other purpose than being a novelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|publisher=www.kinseyconfidential.org|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations such as [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|title=REACH - ECHA|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160724051550/http://echa.europa.eu/regulations/reach|archivedate=24 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; do exist, and some sex toys may be compliant to this though, despite that there is no obligation for manufacturers on attaining compliance.  A 2006 study conducted by the [[Greenpeace]] Netherlands office found high level of [[phthalate]]s in seven out of eight plastic sex toys tested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal Bad vibrations? We expose an EU sex scandal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514001824/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/toxics/bad-vibrations-we-expose-an-eu-sex-scandal |date=2008-05-14 }} Posted by bex (8 September 2006)Greenpeace UK&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex toys are classified as novelties in the United States because the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has extensive testing and financial requirements in order for sex toys to be classified as medical devices. Therefore, sex toy manufacturers more often choose less complex production by labelling them a novelty, where their listed ingredients do not have to be accurate in chemical composition or percentage of ingredients.  Due to the novelty classification, sex toys may contain toxins such as phthalates, which have been banned in children's toys by the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]].&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinseyconfidential.org/safety-dance-sex-toy-safety-generation/|title=The Safety Dance: Sex Toy Safety for a New Generation - Kinsey Confidential|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phthalates|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Business-Guidance/Phthalates-Information/|publisher=www.cpsc.gov|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phthalates are chemical plasticizers that are added as softeners, to create the malleable and soft effect that many look for in sex toys.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;

Studies on rodents have revealed that when exposed to very large doses, phthalates can cause damage to the liver, lungs, kidneys, testes and can cause hormonal disruption. The latest research indicates that exposure to these substances can upset the body's ability to regulate hormone production, damage reproduction, can cause liver and kidney defects, and can cause cancer. The most common and external side-effects are rashes, itchiness and irritation to the locations of use.

Before using a sex toy, owners should take precautions.  One should check for tears, rough seams or cracks  that could harm the inside of the vagina or anus.  Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use appropriate lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.&lt;ref name=brownedu&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Toys|url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/sexual_health/sexuality/sex_toys.php/|publisher=[[Brown University]]|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleaning sex toys is also very important for sexual health and sex toy safety.  Cleaning them will avoid the potential of bacterial infection, transmission of STIs (if shared), or pregnancy (if sperm is present on the toy).  Porous sex toys (ridged, flexible, soft and squishy) are difficult to clean and can hide bacteria that multiply and harm the human body. Non-porous toys are easier to clean, being less harmful.&lt;ref name="kinseyconfidential.org"/&gt;  When cleaning sex toys, always use warm water and unscented anti-bacterial soap.&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;

Non-porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Glass toys: some can be put in the dishwasher, but it is recommended not to expose them to extreme temperatures and to wash them with soap and water.
* Stainless Steel toys: boil or soak stainless steel toys in 1-10 bleach-water solution for ten minutes, put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, or use soap and water (if there are electrical components to the toy).
* Hard plastic toys: do not boil the toy, and wash with soap and water.
* Silicone toys: put it on the top shelf of the dishwasher, boil for 5–10 minutes, or wash with water and soap.

Porous toys&lt;ref name=brownedu /&gt;
* Rubber toys: they cannot be properly cleaned because bacteria is absorbed into the material, so it is recommended to always use a condom.
* Cyberskin and Vinyl toys: clean with warm water, air dry, and sprinkle it with a small amount of cornstarch (to keep them dry and not sticky).
* Nylon toys: put it in the top rack of the dish-washer or wash with soap and water.

Anal toys ([[butt plug]]s, small dildos, etc.)
*When using sex toys in the anus, sex toys can easily get lost as rectal muscles contract and can suck an object up and up, potentially obstructing the colon; to prevent this serious problem, it is recommended that individuals use sex toys with a flared base or a string.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Vibrations: U.S. Consumer Web Site Aims to Enhance Sex Toy Safety|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/good-vibrations-us-consumer-web-site-aims-to-enhance-sex-toy-safety/|publisher=www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate=25 June 2015|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the security software company [[Trend Micro]] demonstrated that some sex toys are vulnerable to [[cyberattack]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Sex Toys Could Be Vulnerable To Cyberattack|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-toy-cyberattack_us_56e82b02e4b065e2e3d74bb5|work=Huffington Post|date=15 March 2016|author=Caroline Copley|agency=Reuters|location=Hanover, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating the field of [[Tor hidden services|onion dildonics]].&lt;ref name="Onion Dildonics"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sex-toy-bluetooth-hacks-security-fix |title=Smart dildos and vibrators keep getting hacked – but Tor could be the answer to safer connected sex|quote=Connected sex toys are gathering huge amounts of data about our most intimate moments.

==Legal issues==

===India===
Sex toys are illegal in India.&lt;ref name ="singh2007"&gt;Singh, Jyotsna (20 June 2007). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6221540.stm India rattled by vibrating condom.] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; Selling sex toys is a punishable offense under section 292 of Indian penal code, as sex toys are considered an "obscene" product. Besides sex toys, any book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or any other object, is by the way also considered obscene by section 292 if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Big-market-for-sex-toys-despite-ban/articleshow/2164155.cms|title=Big market for sex toys despite ban|author=Rati Chaudhary|date=1 July 2007|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for the offense is up to two years in prison.&lt;ref name ="timesindia"&gt;Staff report (February 2, 2011).

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], many [[dildo]]s are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as [[Hello Kitty]], rabbits or dolphins, so that they may be sold as toys, thus avoiding [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], the sale and importation of sex toys is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Christina|title=Shop online but don't break the law|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/07/28/Shop-online-but-dont-break-the-law/|accessdate=17 October 2014|work=The Star (Malaysia)|date=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 18A of the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], inserted by the [[Immorality Amendment Act, 1969]], prohibited the manufacture or sale of any item "intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act". The term "unnatural sexual act" referred to any sex other than vaginal heterosexual sex, and this prohibition was ostensibly aimed at preventing the use of [[dildo]]s by [[lesbian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kevan |last1=Botha |first2=Edwin |last2=Cameron |authorlink2=Edwin Cameron |editor1-first=Donald J. |editor1-last=West |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Green |title=Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison |chapter=South Africa |year=1997 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-45532-3 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer enforced, the section was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===United States===
{{see also|Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Texas obscenity statute}}
Sex toys and lubricants have become increasingly available in major commercial outlets in the United States. On-shelf displays tend to be more discreet than the offerings on web sites. These items tend to be displayed in the "sexual health" sections of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/110965|title=Sex Aids on Retail Shelves|date=13 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently, many [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] and some [[Great Plains|Great Plains states]] banned the sale of sex toys completely, either directly or through laws regulating "obscene devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lingere Store Accused of Violating State Obscenity Laws | publisher = KBCD.com | url = http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], an assistant attorney general in [[Alabama]] commenting on a case involving sex toys and discussing to what end the devices are used, was quoted as saying there is no "fundamental right for a person to buy a device to produce [[orgasm]]". A federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys on Valentine's Day, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, Phillip. [https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-01-2390404063_x.htm Court leaves Ala. sex toy ban intact], USA Today, Oct 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a [[Texas]] statute banning the sales of sex toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appeals court overturns Texas ban on sex toys | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23155562 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court cited ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', where the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at "enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct".  Similar statutes have been struck down in [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]].

[[Marty Klein]], author of ''America's War on Sex'' and an advocate for the moral value of sex toys, has described the sex toy bans as a form of [[erotophobia]] and [[genophobia]] claiming the "extraordinary erosion of personal liberty, coupled with the massive disrespect of and fear of sexuality is no joke" and that the "Supreme Court [of the United States] has declared our orgasms a battlefield, and sex toys another casualty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Holthouse|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005085548/http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|url=http://www.damemagazine.com/features/f261/AlabamavsDildos.php?Page=2|archive-date=5 October 2009|title=Alabama vs. Dildos: Attorney General Troy King stands hard against stimulators|magazine=Dame Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hair wash with shampoo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Shampoo lather in hair]]
[[Image:Shampoo.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Bottles of shampoo and [[lotion]]s manufactured in the early 20th century by the C.L. Hamilton Co. of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

'''Shampoo''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|æ|m|ˈ|p|uː}}) is a [[hair care]] product, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], typically in the form of a viscous liquid, that is used for cleaning [[hair]]. Less commonly, shampoo is available in bar form, like a bar of soap. Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product into the hair, and then rinsing it out. Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of [[hair conditioner]].

The typical reason of using shampoo is to remove the unwanted build-up of [[sebum]] in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable. Shampoo is generally made by combining a [[surfactant]], most often [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] or [[sodium laureth sulfate]], with a co-surfactant, most often [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] in water.

Specialty shampoos are available for people with [[dandruff]], color-treated hair, gluten or wheat allergies, an interest in using an [[organic farming|organic]] product, and infants and young children ("baby shampoo" is less irritating). There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain [[insecticide]]s or other medications to treat skin conditions or [[parasite]] infestations such as fleas.

==Etymology==

The word ''[[wikt:shampoo|shampoo]]'' entered the English language from the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Campion, [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18796493 Hobson-Jobson: The words English owes to India] BBC News, 11 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It dates to 1762, and is derived from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] ''chāmpo'' (चाँपो {{IPA-hns|tʃãːpoː|}}),&lt;ref&gt;''chāmpo'' (चाँपो {{IPA-hns|tʃãːpoː|}}) is the [[imperative mood|imperative]] of  ''chāmpnā'' (चाँपना {{IPA|[tʃãːpnaː]}}), "to smear, knead the muscles, massage the head and hair"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th Edition, See Shampoo; Also see [http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=hobson&amp;query=shampoo&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 Shampoo] Hobson-Jobson (1903), University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; itself derived from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''chapayati'' (चपयति, which means to press, knead, soothe).&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Lexicon, University of Koeln, Germany, see चपयति (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=shampoo&amp;searchmode=none Shampoo], Etymology Dictionary (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Indian subcontinent ===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], a variety of herbs and their extracts have been used as shampoos since ancient times. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling [[Sapindus]] with dried [[Indian gooseberry]] (amla) and a selection of other herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, a tropical tree widespread in India, is called ''ksuna'' (Sanskrit: क्षुण)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche kSuNa], Sanskrit Lexicon, Monier-Williams Dictionary (1872)&lt;/ref&gt; in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains [[saponin]]s which are a natural surfactant. The extract of soapberries creates a lather which Indian texts called ''phenaka'' (Sanskrit: फेनक).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=phenaka&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes phenaka], Spoken Sanskrit, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai ([[Acacia concinna]]), [[hibiscus]] flowers,&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;Rahman, {{Google books|4bnaAAAAMAAJ|History of Indian Science, Technology and Culture}}, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195646528}}, page 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnsmpb.tn.gov.in/images/HIBISCUS%20ROSA%20SINENSIS.pdf Tamil Nadu Medicinal plants board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161928/http://www.tnsmpb.tn.gov.in/images/HIBISCUS%20ROSA%20SINENSIS.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ritha ([[Sapindus mukorossi]]) and arappu (Albizzia amara).&lt;ref&gt;[http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/forestry/forestry_nursery_albizzia_amara.html Tamil Nadu Agricultural university – Albizzia amara]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak]], the founding prophet and the first [[Sikh Guru|Guru]] of [[Sikhism]], made references to soapberry tree and soap in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Khushwant Singh, Hymns of Guru Nanak, Orient Longman, {{ISBN|978-8125011613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleansing with hair and body massage (champu) during one's daily bath was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India. When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learned habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Smith (2007), Clean: A History of Personal Hygiene and Purity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199297795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
[[File:Katalog vintern 1905-1906. AB Nordiska Kompaniet. Hår-, Toalett- &amp; Tandvatten, Pomada &amp; Brilliantine - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0040796.jpg|thumb|Swedish advertisement for toiletries, 1905/1906]]
[[Sake Dean Mahomed]], a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] traveller, surgeon, and entrepreneur, is credited with introducing the practice of ''champooi'' or "shampooing" to Britain. In 1814, Mahomed, with his Irish wife Jane Daly, opened the first commercial "shampooing" vapour masseur bath in England, in [[Brighton]]. He described the treatment in a local paper as "The Indian Medicated Vapour Bath (type of Turkish bath), a cure to many diseases and giving full relief when everything fails; particularly Rheumatic and paralytic, gout, stiff joints, old sprains, lame legs, aches and pains in the joints".&lt;ref name=Teltscher&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13698010020019226|title=The Shampooing Surgeon and the Persian Prince: Two Indians in Early Nineteenth-century Britain|first=Kate|last=Teltscher|journal=Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies, 1469-929X|volume=2|issue=3|year=2000|pages=409–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early stages of shampoo in Europe, English [[hair stylist]]s boiled shaved [[soap]] in [[water]] and added [[herbs]] to give the hair shine and [[fragrance]]. Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century. A 1914 advertisement for Canthrox Shampoo in ''American Magazine'' showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine advertisements in 1914 by [[Rexall]] featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Sherrow, ''Encyclopedia of hair: a cultural history'', 2006 s.v.'' "Advertising" p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, liquid shampoo was invented by German inventor [[Henkel#Beauty Care|Hans Schwarzkopf]] in Berlin, whose name created a shampoo brand sold in Europe.

Originally, [[soap]] and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived [[surfactants]], a type of [[detergent]]. Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with ''Drene'', the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =From Pert: Do You Wash and Go? | work =Company Science Behind the Brands | publisher =[[Procter and Gamble]] | url =http://www.pg.com/science/pbi_pert.jhtml | accessdate =2007-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070216104007/http://www.pg.com/science/pbi_pert.jhtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the [[husk]] and [[straw]] (''merang'') of [[rice]]. The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have [[alkaline]] properties) are mixed with water to form [[foam|lather]]. The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry. Afterwards, [[coconut oil]] was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it.&lt;ref name="kompas"&gt;{{cite web | title =Agar RAMBUT Selalu Sehat | publisher =Kompas Cyber Media | date =2004-04-11 | url =http://www.kompas.com/kesehatan/news/0404/11/190759.htm | accessdate =2007-03-26 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070312145840/http://www.kompas.com/kesehatan/news/0404/11/190759.htm | archive-date =2007-03-12 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Columbian North America===
Certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the [[Ohlone people|Costanoan]]s of present-day coastal [[California]] used extracts from the [[coastal woodfern]], ''[[Dryopteris expansa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=88976 ''Coastal Woodfern (Dryopteris arguta)'', GlobalTwitcher, ed. N. Stromberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102430/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=88976 |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Columbian South America===
Before [[quinoa]] can be eaten the [[saponin]] must be washed out from the grain prior to cooking. Pre-Columbian [[Andean]] civilizations used this soapy by-product as a shampoo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholegrainscouncil.org/node/5889/print ''Quinoa – March Grain of the Month'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:Mild shampoo.jpg|thumb|Typical liquid shampoo]]

Shampoo is generally made by combining a [[surfactant]], most often [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] or [[sodium laureth sulfate]], with a co-surfactant, most often [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] in [[water]] to form a thick, viscous liquid. Other essential ingredients include salt ([[sodium chloride]]), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a [[preservative]] and [[fragrance]].&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Clarence R., ''Chemical and physical behavior of human hair'', 4th ed (Springer Verlag: New York) 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ChemViews Magazine, ''Shampoo Science'', [[ChemistryViews]] 2013 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chemv.201200149 "DOI: 10.1002/chemv.201200149"].&lt;/ref&gt; Other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities:
* pleasing foam
* ease of rinsing
* minimal [[Human skin|skin]] and [[Human eye|eye]] [[irritation]]
* thick or creamy feeling
* pleasant fragrance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Fresh Scent Technology|url=http://www.pg.com/en_US/downloads/innovation/factsheet_Head_and_Shoulders_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* low [[toxicity]]
* good [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]
* slight [[acid]]ity ([[pH]] less than 7)
* no damage to hair
* repair of damage already done to hair

Many shampoos are [[pearlescent]]. This effect is achieved by the addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. [[glycol distearate]], chemically derived from [[stearic acid]], which may have either animal or vegetable origins. Glycol distearate is a wax. Many shampoos also include [[silicone]] to provide conditioning benefits.

===Commonly used ingredients===
* [[Ammonium chloride]]
* [[Ammonium lauryl sulfate]]
* [[Glycol]]
* [[Sodium laureth sulfate]] is derived from coconut oils and is used to soften water and create a lather. There was some concern over this particular ingredient circa 1998 as evidence suggested it might be a carcinogen, and this has yet to be disproved, as many sources still describe it as irritating to the hair and scalp.&lt;ref&gt;http://sulfatefreeshampoos.org/why-are-sulfates-bad-for-hair/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sodium lauryl sulfate]]
* Sodium lauroamphoacetate is naturally derived from coconut oils and is used as a cleanser and counter-irritant. This is the ingredient that makes the product tear-free.
* [[Polysorbate]] 20 (abbreviated as [[Polysorbate 20|PEG(20)]]) is a mild glycol-based surfactant that is used to solubilize fragrance oils and essential oils, meaning it causes liquid to spread across and penetrate the surface of a solid (i.e. hair).
* [[Polysorbate]] 80 (abbreviated as [[Polysorbate 80|PEG(80)]]) is a glycol used to emulsify (or disperse) oils in water (so the oils do not float on top like Italian salad dressing).
* PEG-150 distearate is a simple thickener.
* [[Citric acid]] is produced biochemically and is used as an antioxidant to preserve the oils in the product. While it is a severe eye-irritant, the sodium lauroamphoacetate counteracts that property. Citric acid is used to adjust the pH down to approximately 5.5. It is a fairly weak acid which makes the adjustment easier. Shampoos usually are at pH 5.5 because at slightly acidic pH, the scales on a hair follicle lie flat, making the hair feel smooth and look shiny. It also has a small amount of preservative action. Citric acid, as opposed to any other acid, will prevent bacterial growth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* [[Quaternium-15]] is used as a bacterial and fungicidal preservative.
* [[Polyquaternium]]-10 has nothing to do with the chemical quaternium-15; it acts as the conditioning ingredient, providing moisture and fullness to the hair.
* Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate is a water-dispersible emollient that forms clear solutions with surfactant systems
* Methylisothiazolinone, or MIT, is a powerful biocide and preservative.

===Benefit claims regarding ingredients===
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container. The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit. Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations. While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward. For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to [[ultraviolet radiation]]. While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective. The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third-party testing.  Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as [[dandruff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Dandruff Issues|url=http://www.headandshoulders.co.in/hair-clinic/understanding-scalp-issues/dandruff}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[itchy scalp]] are regulated as [[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] drugs&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ucm209647.htm FDA OTC (Nonprescription) Drugs Approval Process] for information.&lt;/ref&gt; in the US marketplace.

In the European Union, there is a requirement for the anti-dandruff claim to be substantiated as with any other advertising claim, but it is not considered to be a medical problem.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Health risks==
A number of contact [[allergen]]s are used as ingredients in shampoos, and [[contact allergy]] caused by shampoos is well known.&lt;ref name="medscape.com"&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706406]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patch test]]ing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic, after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic.&lt;ref name="medscape.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dermnetnz.org/procedures/patch-tests.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The US bans 11 ingredients from shampoos, Canada bans 587, and the EU bans 1328.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schlanger|first1=Zoe|title=Will your shampoo make your hair fall out? The US government isn’t sure|url=https://qz.com/1015989/will-your-shampoo-make-your-hair-fall-out-the-us-fda-doesnt-know-either/|accessdate=27 June 2017|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized shampoos==

===Dandruff===
Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have [[dandruff]]. These contain [[fungicide]]s such as [[ketoconazole]], [[zinc pyrithione]] and [[selenium disulfide]], which reduce loose dander by killing [[fungi]] like ''[[Malassezia furfur]]''. [[Coal tar]] and [[salicylic acid|salicylate]] derivatives are often used as well.
Alternatives to medicated shampoos are available for people who wish to avoid synthetic fungicides. Such shampoos often use [[tea tree oil]], [[essential oil]]s or herbal extracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aburjai |first1=Talal |last2=Natsheh |first2=Feda M. |title=Plants used in cosmetics |journal=Phytotherapy Research |date=November 2003 |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=987–1000 |doi=10.1002/ptr.1363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colored hair===
Many companies have also developed color-protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; some of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers according to their manufacturers.

===Gluten-free or wheat-free===
Many people suffer from [[eczema]] on their palms and their head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/eczema-(atopic)/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Atopic eczema – NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some find that wheat or gluten &amp;mdash; the protein found in many grains including wheat &amp;mdash; is the cause, particularly if they are [[wheat allergy|sensitive to foods containing gluten]] (citation needed). Shampoo can inadvertently enter the mouth, particularly among children, so all individuals who are on [[gluten-free]] diets may prefer to use a gluten-free shampoo. Shampoo manufacturers are starting to recognize this and gluten-free and wheat-free products are now available.

Wheat derivatives and ingredients from other gluten grains are commonly used as binders to help shampoo stick together, and are also used as emollients in the form of oils. Following is a list of grain-derived shampoo ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenaturepure.com |title=A list of items with hidden gluten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these ingredients do not theoretically contain any intact wheat proteins, but trace amounts may be present due to incomplete processing or contamination. (citation needed)
* Triticum vulgare (wheat), hordeum vulgare (barley), secale cereale (rye), or avena sativa (oats), including any oil, protein, hydrosylate, or other extract from any part of the plant.
* Tocopherol/tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), which may be derived from wheat
* Hydrolyzed wheat protein or hydrolyzed wheat starch, also sometimes listed as hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearyldimoniumhydroxypropyl or hydroxypropyltrimonium
* Cyclodextrin, which may be produced from starch by means of enzymatic conversion
* Amino peptide complex
* Maltodextrin, dextrin, dextrin palmitate, or (hydrolyzed) malt extract
* Phytosphingosine extract
* Amino peptide complex
* Prolamine
* Beta glucan
* Disodium wheat germamido PEG-2-sulfosuccinate
* Fermented grain extract
* AMP-Isostearoyl
* PG-Propyl Silanetriol
* PVP crosspolymer
* Ethyldimonium ethosulfate
* Yeast extract
* Phytospingosine extract
* "Fragrance" is a broad category that may contain many chemicals that are otherwise unlisted on the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=222 |title=Campaign for Safe Cosmetics : Fragrance |publisher=Safecosmetics.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511130711/http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=222 |archive-date=2012-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baby===
Shampoo for [[infant]]s and young children is formulated so that it is less irritating and usually less prone to produce a stinging or burning sensation if it were to get into the eyes. For example, [[Johnson's baby|Johnson's Baby]] Shampoo advertises under the premise of "No More Tears". This is accomplished by one or more of the following formulation strategies.
# dilution, in case the product comes in contact with eyes after running off the top of the head with minimal further dilution
# adjusting pH to that of non-stress tears, approximately 7, which may be a higher pH than that of shampoos which are pH adjusted for skin or hair effects, and lower than that of shampoo made of soap
# use of surfactants which, alone or in combination, are less irritating than those used in other shampoos (e.g. [[Sodium lauroamphoacetate]])
# use of nonionic surfactants of the form of polyethoxylated synthetic glycolipids and polyethoxylated synthetic monoglycerides, which counteract the eye sting of other surfactants without producing the anesthetizing effect of alkyl polyethoxylates or alkylphenol polyethoxylates
The distinction in 4 above does not completely surmount the controversy over the use of shampoo ingredients to mitigate eye sting produced by other ingredients, or the use of the products so formulated.
The considerations in 3 and 4 frequently result in a much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos, and the detergency or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby. The monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosity-increasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other shampoos are much less common in the better baby shampoos.

===Animal===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
Shampoo intended for animals may contain [[insecticide]]s or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or [[parasite]] infestations such as [[flea]]s or [[mange]]. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special care must be taken not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.

Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on [[pet]]s, commonly [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, are normally intended to do more than just clean the pet's [[Coat (animal)|coat]] or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an [[allergy]] or to fight against [[flea]]s.

The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, [[emollients]], [[emulsifiers]] and [[humectants]]. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their [[veterinarian]]'s indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.
Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain [[pyrethrin]], [[pyrethroids]] (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and [[carbaryl]]. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.

Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or [[ringworm]] infections. These might contain ingredients such as [[miconazole]], [[chlorhexidine]], [[providone iodine]], [[ketoconazole]] or [[selenium sulfide]] (which cannot be used on cats).

Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain [[benzoyl peroxide]], [[chlorhexidine]], povidone iodine, [[triclosan]], [[ethyl lactate]], or sulfur.

[[Antipruritic]] shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2095&amp;aid=828| title=Dog Shampoos: The Function of Common Ingredients|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These usually contain colloidal [[oatmeal]], [[hydrocortisone]], [[Aloe vera]], pramoxine hydrochloride, [[menthol]], [[diphenhydramine]], sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.

Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, [[salicylic acid]], refined [[tar]] (which cannot be used on cats), [[selenium sulfide]] (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.

Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as [[almond]], [[Maize|corn]], [[cottonseed]], [[coconut]], [[olive]], [[peanut]], Persia, [[safflower]], [[sesame]], [[lanolin]], [[mineral]] or [[Higher alkanes|paraffin oil]]. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as [[cetyl alcohol]], [[laureth-5]], [[lecithin]], PEG-4 dilaurate, [[stearic acid]], [[stearyl alcohol]], [[carboxylic acid]], [[lactic acid]], [[urea]], [[sodium lactate]], [[propylene glycol]], [[glycerin]], or [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]].

Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause [[irritation]] to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include [[eucalyptus]], [[lemon]] or [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] extracts and [[tea tree oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vetinfo.com/dog-allergy-shampoo.html| title=Common Canine Skin Irritants|accessdate= 2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos. Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.

Pet shampoos which include [[fragrances]], [[deodorant]]s or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as [[hypoallergenic]] shampoos and are increasing in popularity.

===Solid===
Solid shampoos or shampoo bars use as their surfactants soaps or other surfactants formulated as solids. They have the advantage of being spill-proof. They are easy to apply; one may simply rub the bar over wet hair, and work the soaped hair into a low lather.

===Jelly and gel===
Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's [[viscosity]]. This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair.

===Paste and cream===
Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes. The contents were wet but not completely dissolved. They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly.

===Antibacterial===
{{visible anchor|Antibacterial shampoo}}s are often used in [[veterinary]] medicine for various conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3164.1996.tb00239.x | last1 = Guaguere | first1 = E. | title = Topical treatment of canine and feline pyoderma | journal = Veterinary Dermatology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–151 | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3164.2004.00344.x | last1 = Mueller | first1 = R.

== No Poo Movement ==
{{main|No poo}}
Closely associated with [[environmentalism]], the "[[no poo]]" movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use. Some adherents of the no poo movement use [[baking soda]] or [[vinegar]] to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey. Other people use nothing, rinsing their hair only with conditioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Wash-Your-Hair-Without-Shampoo |title=How to Wash Your Hair Without Shampoo: 11 steps |publisher=wikiHow |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tubular |url=http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Go-No-Poo/ |title=How to Go No Poo |publisher=Instructables.com |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory===
In the 1970s, ads featuring [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Christie Brinkley]] asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week. This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing. Using shampoo every day removes [[sebum]], the oil produced by the scalp. This causes the [[sebaceous glands]] to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing. According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969 |title=When It Comes To Shampoo, Less Is More |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid chemicals and ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehairpin.com/2011/04/how-to-quit-shampoo-without-becoming-disgusting&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social sorting''' is understood as the breakdown and categorization of group- or person-related raw data into various categories and segments by data manipulators and [[data broker]]s. Social sorting involves the key task of separating one group from the other. These groups can be based on [[income]], [[education]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], profiling, [[gender]], [[Job|occupation]], [[social status]], derived power (social and political) and geographic residence. Depending on the goals of the manipulator raw data is collected and then further evolves into meaningful data in order to be exploited for a specific purpose. For example, the formulation of [[profiling (information science)|profiling]] and [[predictive policing]] are all derivations of social sorting.

==History==

The concept is accredited to [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]], a sociologist who is best known for his work in surveillance studies. Contemporary times have allowed for the influx and constant growth of [[data collection]] especially in the countries of the global north. A prime example of social terming is [[surveillance]]. This practice was not always as sophisticated as today. Historically, simple tools such as labor-intensive watchers, [[book keeping]] and record keeping acted as the enablers of this form. Surveillance is now done by governments and various organizations. This technological tools that are equipped with surveillance are [[CCTV camera|cameras]], records of transactions done at [[automated teller machine|banking machines]] and [[point of sale]] terminals, [[machine readable passport]]s before boarding, [[cellular phone]] calls along with many other examples. This collection of raw data then enables trends to be found and the fostering of predictions.

In other contextual fashion, social sorting bears much of its resemblance to social stratification. In primitive societies there are evidence of the roots of social sorting where the sexual division of labour was concerned. Women would do most of the gathering where men would concentrate on hunting. It was argued that although this specific task of the woman may point to domestic oppression according to some observers, hunter-gatherer women would not understand this interpretation. The primitive society did show groupings and deployed categorization which perhaps without their own understanding of the understanding of the social construct was still insinuated.

Further confirmation of social sorting was evident through slavery. The [[racial divide]] between whites and blacks manifested for generations. Based on the visual appearance of their skin people of a darker complexion were grouped and made to endure hardships that included beatings, laborious field work, confinement and executions. A prime example of social sorting at work during the African slave era were [[mullato]]s were grouped together to perform household and other domestic work.

==Criticism==

Criticisms are often directed at the laws, implemented rules, educational system, job employment opportunities and at the government. Questions are asked of the integrity of many socially constructed programs led by private and government institutions. Fairness and equity are thought to be at the forefront of the list of frustrations for many people that are aware of social sorting.

There are [[paranoia]]s and indifferences in regards to social sorting. The [[September 11 attacks]] and the subsequent [[war on terror]] have fueled the desire for [[categorizing]] and profiling people. The beneficiaries that are associated with it are evident as it allows for a more transparent viewership. Some researchers such as David Lyon are concerned with the rise of [[big data]] as there are many implication on the daily lives of many.

According to David Lyon, Canadians are still unaware of the fact that surveillance which goes collaboratively with social sorting is now very much integrated into their daily lives. David Lyon discusses that the systematic routines and attention to personal detail which is encompassed into surveillance. The key criticism involves indifferent treatment to individuals based on their profile. Depending on the details of a person it can lead to the determination of whether the person may end up on a [[No Fly List]].

Employers have now begun to engage in these screening methods to determine a person’s suitability for a particular job. Law enforcement bodies and insurance companies have now all began to utilize social sorting to their use in order to determine whether their services should be offered or rescinded. The lives of many are directly affected as they are placed into [[socio-economic]] [[economic niche|niche]]s.

David Lyon insinuates that social sorting through surveillance is a modern [[threat to freedom]]. Byproducts of social sorting are isolation, [[Segregation (disambiguation)|segregation]] and [[marginalization]]. Social sorting has called into account issues that primarily involve equity and fairness. Different societies sort in different ways.

Other societies across the world engage in their own forms of social sorting. Some eastern countries such as China and India place much emphasis on an individual’s level of education. Blue collar jobs which at times may be dirty and laborious are often scorned and met with resentment. Low hourly wages, limited to zero prestige and little respect are directed at individuals who are involved in these occupational roles. Furthermore, the perception and low economic advantages hinder the progression of many people. At times, it acts as a domino effect where when one falls other problems come with it. For example, low education may not contribute to a good paying job; this may in turn lead to low income which may in turn lead to residing in a low class neighbourhood.

Wilson &amp; McBrier (2005) conducted a [[longitudinal study]] based on the theory of minority [[Social vulnerability|vulnerability]] of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sociological Forum|year=2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages= 301–321|title=Race and Loss of Privilege: African American/White Differences in the Determinants of Job Layoffs From Upper-Tier Occupations|author=George Wilson and Debra Branch McBrier|doi=10.1007/s11206-005-4102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constitute to a group of [[African American]]s who work for good financial income in the upper tier for relatively privileged jobs. "The minority vulnerability thesis, accordingly, maintains that African Americans are more likely to experience [[layoff]]s from upper-tier occupations than Whites even when the two groups have similar background socioeconomic statuses, have accumulated similar [[human capital|human-capital]] credentials, such as educational attainment and commitment to work, and have similar job/[[labor market]] characteristics, including union status as well as [[economic sector]] of employment. Findings indicate that, after controlling for seniority, African Americans are susceptible to layoffs on a relatively broad and generalized basis that is unstructured by traditional, stratification-based causal factors, namely, background socioeconomic status, human-capital credentials, and job/labor-market characteristics."

Schools are accredited differing levels of prestige in comparison to other institutions. Social sorting occurs amongst schools where claims are made about learning experiences and which institutions may be the best for learning all of which are left up to subjection. For example, Princeton, and Harvard are all highly rated prestigious universities for various reasons. These perceptions cause employers and students alike to question the credibility and graduate documentation based on the institution that one attends.

In 2015, The Data Broker Accountability and Transparency Act was resurrected by four U.S senators that would allow consumers to see and correct personal information held by data brokers and tell those businesses to stop sharing or selling it for marketing purposes.

'''Starseed''' is a proposed method of launching interstellar nanoprobes at one-third light speed.

The launcher uses a 1,000 kilometer long small diameter hollow wire, and uses electrodes lining the hollow wire as an electrostatic accelerator tube, similar to [[K. Eric Drexler]]'s ideas.  The launcher is designed to accelerate its probes to 1/3 the speed of light, about 100,000 kilometers per second, at something on the order of 100 million gravities of acceleration.

Keeping the launch tube straight enough to avoid the probe hitting the tube walls is a major challenge.  The launcher would have to be set up in deep space, well away from any planets, to avoid gravitational tidal effects bending the tube too much.

The ''Starseed Probes'' are proposed to be extremely small (roughly one microgram) [[Nanomachine|nanomachines and nanocomputers]].  The required launch energy per probe is low due to the low mass, and many nanoprobes would be launched in sequence and rendezvous in flight.

A '''Sussex trug''' is a wooden [[basket]]. It is made from a handle and rim of [[coppicing|coppiced]] [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]] wood which is hand-cleft then shaved using a [[drawknife]]. The body of the trug is made of five or seven thin boards of [[Salix alba#Cultivars and hybrids|cricket bat willow]], also hand-shaved with a drawknife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.countrylovers.co.uk/craf/susxtrug.htm |title=Images of trug making| publisher=countrylovers.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They may have originated in Sussex because of the abundance of chestnut coppice and willows found on the marshes. Nails or pins used are usually copper, to avoid rust.

Shapes and sizes became standardised, the most well-known shape being the "common or garden" trug ranging in volume from [[dry measure|one pint to a bushel]].  However, there is a diverse range of traditional trugs from garden and oval trugs to the more specialised "large log" and "walking stick" trugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetrugstore.co.uk/handmadesussextrugproducts.html#WalkingStickTrugAnchor Image of a "walking stick" trug] from thetrugstore.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

The website is also a supporter of Stanford's [[Folding@home]] and is currently ranked 26th in total production points as of March 22, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fah-web2.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&amp;teamnum=2630|title=Team 2630's contributions to Folding@home|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Tech Report was founded by Scott 'Damage' Wasson, a [[Harvard Divinity School]] graduate, and Andy 'Dr. Evil' Brown.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Both started by writing at [[Ars Technica]] in 1998. The two later decided to launch their own website.  The site eventually grew into a business enterprise with multiple full-time staff members, and continues in that form today.

Tech Report was originally located at tech-report.com in 1999. The site was moved to techreport.com in 2003.&lt;ref name="whois"&gt;[http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=tech-report&amp;tld=com], 'Whois.net data for tech-report.com'. September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 20, 2007 a beta for a new site design was posted in the forums for review by the user community. It has since been moved to live.

Launching on January 1, 2011, the new site design, TR 3.0 rolled out. Offering a completely new layout and two user switchable colors, blue and white.

On September 8, 2011 Scott posted an article titled "Inside the second: A new look at game benchmarking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/review/21516/inside-the-second-a-new-look-at-game-benchmarking|title=Inside the second: A new look at game benchmarking|work=techreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed GPU manufactures and gamers that frames per second(FPS) are not the only thing that matters in "smooth" gameplay, but frame latency has a big part. This encouraged the GPU manufactures to focus on keeping frame latency down across game play through heavy edits to their drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.beyond3d.com/threads/on-techreports-frame-latency-measurement-and-why-gamers-should-care.53455/#post-1678305|title=On TechReport's frame latency measurement and why gamers should care|work=beyond3d.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2015 Scott Wasson, the founder and Editor-In-Chief stepped down as he accepted a role in AMD's graphics division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/blog/29390/into-a-new-era|title=Into a new era|work=techreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ryan|title=Scott Wasson Announces His Retirement from The Tech Report|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/9832/scott-wasson-announces-his-retirement-from-the-tech-report|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=Anandtech|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wasson subsequently sold the company in March 2018 to Adam Eiberger, the Tech Report's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kampman|first1=Jeff|title=The Tech Report secures an independent future|url=https://techreport.com/blog/33308/the-tech-report-secures-an-independent-future|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=Tech Report|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site Structure ==
=== Main Page ===
A large portion of the main page is dedicated to "News" and "Featured Articles". Among the news entries are daily "Shortbread" posts which offer a summary breakdown of reviews and news offered by other sites.   Featured articles are often reviews of newly released PC hardware which has been tested by the site's editors and judged on a number of [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] including performance and value compared to other available hardware. Both the general news posts and the featured articles often feature off-beat humor in the form of wordplay and random pop-culture references, giving evidence to the founders' origins as technology humorists.

=== Podcast ===

Adapting to the general trend of more content for digest, The Tech Report launched their own podcast on February 9, 2008 hosted by Jordan Drake. While the schedule has varied it provides a casual but quite in-depth look back at the topics that made news from a panel of the site staff. Subsequent to 2015 episodes were released irregularly, frequently discussing the release of a new microarchitecture with David Kanter of Real World Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techreport.com/archive.x?tags=Podcast|title=Archive – The Tech Report|work=techreport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community and Forum ===
As with many technology websites, the Tech Report has developed a large user community, in part through a [[phpBB]]-styled forum that is unrestricted in read-only form and open to the public for contribution via simple registration.  The forum is primarily structured around computer technology and related topics, but debates also range from politics and religion in the "opt-in only" R&amp;P forum to general random chatter in the Back Porch.  Contributors to the website also have access to a restricted forum called the Smoky Back Room.    Registered users may respond to news topics and other entries posted on the front page in an isolated threaded comments section that automatically attaches to each new entry.  Although access to the main page comments is linked into the user database, the discussions are logged separately from the forum area of the site and are not counted toward the user forum statistics.

'''Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty''' (UKA) is a [[surgical procedure]] used to relieve [[arthritis]] in one of the [[knee]] compartments in which the damaged parts of the knee are replaced. UKA surgery may reduce post-operative pain and have a shorter recovery period than a [[total knee replacement]] procedure,&lt;ref name="wu"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5371236|year=2017|last1=Santoso|first1=M.

==Background==
In the early 1950s, Duncan C. McKeever theorized that osteoarthritis could be isolated to only one compartment of the knee joint,&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt; and that replacement of the entire knee might not be necessary if only one knee compartment were affected.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbon|first=Tony|title=Partial Knee Replacement|url=http://tony-gibbon.co.uk/treatment/knee-treatment/treatments/partial-knee-replacement|publisher=North Yorkshire Orthopaedic Specialists|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UKA concept was designed to cause less trauma or damage than traditional total knee replacement by removing less bone and trying to maintain most of the person’s bone and anatomy.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;  The concept was also designed to use smaller implants and thereby keep most of the person’s bone, helping them return to normal function faster.&lt;ref name=siman/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;

Initially, UKAs were not always successful, because the implants were poorly designed, people needing the surgery were not thoroughly screened for suitability, and optimal surgical techniques were not developed.&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Swienckowski JJ, Pennington DW |title=Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients sixty years of age or younger |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=86-A Suppl 1 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=131–42 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15466754 |doi= |url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15466754}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements have been made to improve the design of the implants.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fitzsimmons SE, Vazquez EA, [[Michael J. Bronson|Bronson MJ]] |title=How to Treat the Stiff Total Knee Arthroplasty?: A Systematic Review |journal=Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. |volume=468 |issue=4 |pages=1096–106 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20087698 |doi=10.1007/s11999-010-1230-y |url= |pmc=2835585}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, choosing the best-suited people was emphasized to ensure that surgeons followed the indications and contraindications for partial replacement.  Proper selection,&lt;ref name="pmid18300665"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geller JA, Yoon RS, Macaulay W |title=Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a controversial history and a rationale for contemporary resurgence |journal=J Knee Surg |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=7–14 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18300665 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the indications/contraindications, and performing the surgery well are key factors for the success of UKA.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;

==Indications and contraindications==
UKA may be suitable for people with moderate joint disease caused by painful [[osteoarthritis]] or traumatic injury, a history of unsuccessful surgical procedures or poor [[bone]] density that precludes other types of [[knee]] surgery.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; People who may not be eligible for a UKA include those with an active or suspected infection in or about the knee joint, may have a known sensitivity to device materials, have bone infections or disease that result in an inability to support or fixate the new implant to the bone, have inflammatory arthritis, have major deformities that can affect the knee mechanical axis, have neuromuscular disorders that may compromise motor control and/or stability, have any mental neuromuscular disorder, are obese,&lt;ref name="pmid16164956"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bert JM |title=Unicompartmental knee replacement |journal=Orthop. Clin. North Am. |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=513–22 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16164956 |doi=10.1016/j.ocl.2005.05.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have lost a severe amount of bone from the shin ([[tibia]]) or have severe tibial deformities, have recurring [[subluxation]] of the knee joint, have untreated damage to the knee cap and thigh bone joint (patellofemoral joint), have untreated damage to the opposite compartment or the same side of the knee not being replaced by a device, and/or have instability of the knee ligaments such that the postoperative stability the UKA would be compromised.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;

The [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) should be intact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partial Knee Replacement|url=http://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/ortho/partial_knee_replacement.html|date=2017|publisher=Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is debated by clinicians for people who need a medial compartment replacement.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;  For people needing a lateral compartment replacement, the ACL should be intact and is contraindicated for people with ACL-deficient knees because the lateral component has more motion than the medial compartment.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;

==History and physical examination==
A physical examination and getting the subject’s history is performed before getting surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt; A person with pain in one area of the knee may be a candidate for UKA.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;  However, a person with pain in multiple areas of the knee may not be a good candidate for UKA.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;  The doctor may take some radiographs (e.g., x-rays) to check for degeneration of the other knee compartments and evaluate the knee.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;  The physical exam may also include special tests designed to test the ligaments of the knee and other anatomical structures.&lt;ref name="pmid18300665"/&gt; Most likely, the surgeon will decide to do a UKA during surgery where he/she can directly see the status of the other compartments.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;

==Surgical information==
The surgeon may choose which type of incision and implant to use for the subject’s knee. During the surgery, the surgeon may align the instruments to determine the amount of bone to remove.&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"/&gt; The surgeon removes bone from the ([[tibia]]) and thigh bone ([[femur]]).&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"/&gt; The surgeon may decide to check if the appropriate amount of bone was removed during the surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"/&gt; In order to make sure that the proper size implant is used, a surgeon may choose to use a temporary trial.  After making sure the proper size implant is selected, the surgeon will put the implant on the ends of the bone and secure it with pegs. Finally, the surgeon will close the wound with sutures.&lt;ref name="pmid15466754"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partial Knee Replacement|url=http://tony-gibbon.co.uk/treatment/knee-treatment/treatments/partial-knee-replacement|publisher=North Yorkshire Orthopaedic Specialists|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unicompartmental replacement is a minimally invasive option for people whose arthritis is isolated to either the medial or the lateral compartment. The procedure offers several benefits for patients with a moderately active lifestyle, who have arthritis in just one knee compartment, and who are within normal weight ranges. The surgeon uses an incision of just 3-4 inches; a total knee replacement typically requires an incision of 8-12 inches. The partial replacement does not disrupt the knee cap, which makes for a shorter rehabilitation period. A partial replacement also causes minimal blood loss during the procedure, and results in considerably less post-operative pain. The hospitalization time compared with a total knee replacement is also greatly reduced.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref name=siman/&gt;&lt;ref name=han/&gt;

==Benefits==
The potential benefits of UKA include a smaller incision because the UKA implants are smaller than the total knee replacements, and the surgeon may make a smaller incision.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt; This may lead to a smaller scar.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt; Another potential benefit is less post-operative [[pain]] because less bone is removed.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt; Also, a quicker operation and shorter recovery period may be a result of less bone being removed during the operation and the soft tissue may sustain less trauma.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mullaji AB, Sharma A, Marawar S |title=Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: functional recovery and radiographic results with a minimally invasive technique |journal=J Arthroplasty |volume=22 |issue=4 Suppl 1 |pages=7–11 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17570269 |doi=10.1016/j.arth.2006.12.109 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the rehabilitation process may be more progressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newman JH |title=Unicompartmental knee replacement |journal=Knee |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=63–70 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10788767 |doi=10.1016/S0968-0160(99)00032-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specific benefits of UKA are that it may improve range of motion, reduce blood loss during surgery, reduce the person’s time spent in the hospital, and decrease costs.&lt;ref name=wu/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16164956"/&gt;

In 2018, two of the most significant benefits of UKA or partial knee replacements are:
1. Partial knee replacement subjects report that their replaced knee feels more like their original non-replaced knee as compared to a total knee replacement
2, Partial knee replacements leave other options open to further advances.  By not replacing the rest of the knee with metal and plastic, if other options exist in years to come for arthritis in these areas then a partial knee replacement does not burn that bridge.

==Risks==
[[Blood clots]] (also known as [[deep vein thrombosis]]) are a common complication after surgery.&lt;ref name="pmid17948162"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colwell CW |title=Rationale for thromboprophylaxis in lower joint arthroplasty |journal=Am J. Orthop. |volume=36 |issue=9 Suppl |pages=11–3 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17948162 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17613508"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warwick D |title=Insufficient duration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement when compared with the time course of thromboembolic events: findings from the Global Orthopaedic Registry |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=89 |issue=6 |pages=799–807 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17613508 |doi=10.1302/0301-620X.89B6.18844 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Friedman RJ |author3=Agnelli G |display-authors=3 |last4=Gil-Garay |first4=E. |last5=Johnson |first5=K. |last6=Fitzgerald |first6=G. |last7=Turibio |first7=F. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a doctor may prescribe certain medications to help prevent blood clots.&lt;ref name="pmid17948162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17613508"/&gt; Infection may occur after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ritter MA, Olberding EM, Malinzak RA |title=Ultraviolet lighting during orthopaedic surgery and the rate of infection |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=89 |issue=9 |pages=1935–40 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17768189 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.F.01037 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, antibiotics may be prescribed by a doctor to help prevent infections.&lt;ref name="pmid17613508"/&gt;  Individual factors (e.g., anatomy, weight, prior medical history, prior joint surgeries) should be addressed with the surgery subject. The causes of long-term failure of UKAs include [[polyethylene]] wear, loosening of the implant, and degeneration of the adjacent knee compartment.&lt;ref name="pmid18180388"/&gt;

==Long-term results==
Long term studies reported excellent outcomes for UKA, partly due to subject screening,&lt;ref name="pmid15866962"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger RA |title=Results of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty at a minimum of ten years of follow-up |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=999–1006 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15866962 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.C.00568 |url= |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Meneghini RM |author3=Jacobs JJ |display-authors=3 |last4=Sheinkop |first4=MB |last5=Della Valle |first5=CJ |last6=Rosenberg |first6=AG |last7=Galante |first7=JO}}&lt;/ref&gt; minimizing the amount of bone that is removed,&lt;ref name="pmid15930935"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Price AJ, Waite JC, Svard U |title=Long-term clinical results of the medial Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty |journal=Clin.

== Canadian parliamentary motion ==
{{main article|Canadian Parliamentary Motion on Alexander Graham Bell}}
On June 21, 2002, the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion declaring Alexander Graham Bell the inventor of the telephone, in response to the US House resolution.

== Critical views on the Motion, Resolution and the Patent Caveat ==
In 2003, the distinguished Italian telecommunications inventor and Meucci book author Professor Basilio Catania, interviewed on the parliamentary Bell motion and the congressional Meucci resolution, first commented on Bell's record as an inventor and scientist:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not the kind of man who can make statements without proofs. I did not do it with Meucci and I do not see why I should do it with Bell... ...I can, however, state that the theoretical description of the electrical transmission of speech in Bell's first patent is nearly perfect and appears to me as the first clear treatise ever written.&lt;ref name="Cusmano" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Catania later went on to note the straightforwardness of the follow-up parliamentary motion compared to the seaminess of the initial congressional resolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Canadian reaction to an unfortunate passage in Resolution No. 269 of the US House of Representatives is quite understandable. In my opinion the insinuation against the morality and scientific stature of Alexander Graham Bell, in the above resolution, was both unnecessary and unproven, though there had been suspicions that Bell might have fished something from Meucci's ideas. Personally, I would have refrained from stating anything that is not fully proven. I do, however, appreciate that, in the Canadian motion pro Bell, nothing [derogatory] is said against Antonio Meucci...&lt;ref name="Cusmano"&gt;Cusmano, Domenic. [http://www.accenti.ca/news_item.asp?news_id=03_3 "Interview with Basilio Catania."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164026/http://www.accenti.ca/news_item.asp?news_id=03_3 |date=2011-07-06 }} ''Accenti.ca'', July 16, 2003, Retrieved: April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, intellectual property law author R. B. Rockman was more critical in his view of HRes 269.&lt;ref name="Rockman"&gt;Rockman, Howard B.[https://books.google.com/books?id=jCEP2MUCIKAC "Intellectual Property Law for Engineers and Scientists."] ''IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society'', Wiley-IEEE, 2004, pp. 107–109. {{ISBN|978-0-471-44998-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After first reviewing the essential details of ''American Bell Telephone Company v. Globe Telephone Company, Antonio Meucci, et al.'' (31 Fed 728 (SDNY, 1887)), where he noted major inconsistencies in Meucci's various testimonies, the paucity of direct evidence that both the Globe and Meucci brought forward in support of their defenses and the court's definitive rejection of those defenses in favour of Bell, Rockman then compares the'' 'Bell v. Globe and Meucci' ''court decision (of July 19, 1887) with ''HRes 269'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I conclude that the comments of Mr. Grosvenor [who wrote a memo highly critical of HRes 269 by comparing it with ''Bell v. Globe''] are more likely correct in comparison to the statements [within the preamble of HRes 269]  by the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Rockman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rockman then proceeded to dissect and parse the U.S. Government's 1887 legal challenge to Bell's telephone patent, which had been brought by [[United States Attorney General]] [[Augustus H. Garland]], a major stock shareholder of the Pan-Electric Company which was the instigator of the suit. Pan-Electric sought to overturn Bell's patent in order to compete against the American Bell Telephone Co.&lt;ref name="Rockman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=106 "Augustus Hill Garland (1832–1899)".] ''Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture website''. Retrieved: May 1, 2009. Note: according to this article: "Garland soon found himself embroiled in scandal. While Garland was in the Senate, he had become a stockholder in, and attorney for, the ''Pan-Electric Telephone Company'', which was organized to form regional telephone companies using equipment developed by J. Harris Rogers. The equipment was similar to the Bell telephone, and that company soon brought suit for patent infringement. Soon after he became attorney general, Garland was asked to bring suit in the name of the United States to invalidate the Bell patent. He refused...." However, in ''Rockman (2004)'', there is no mention of Garland refusing to do so, and moreover Garland had been given his shares in Pan-Electric, by the company, for free.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSHM"&gt;[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/exhibits/virtual/governors/the_redeemers/garland.asp "Augustus Hill Garland (1874-1877)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618124303/http://www.oldstatehouse.com/exhibits/virtual/governors/the_redeemers/garland.asp |date=2004-06-18 }}, ''Old Statehouse Museum website''. Retrieved: May 1, 2009. Note: According to this biography: "He did, however, suffer scandal involving the patent for the telephone. The Attorney General's office was intervening in a lawsuit attempting to break Bell's monopoly of telephone technology, but it had come out that Garland owned stock in one of the companies that stood to benefit. This congressional investigation received public attention for nearly a year, and caused his work as attorney general to suffer."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this very court challenge that is referenced in ''HRes 269's'' preamble, in paragraph No. 9, which inferred an immoral and possibly criminal intent by Bell ("...the Government of the United States moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation"), to which Rockland wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The United States House of Representatives in its resolution of June 11, 2002 states merely that the government of the United States filed the lawsuit, and that the Supreme Court found the complaint viable and remanded the case for trial. The House of Representatives resolution, in my opinion, leaves out many of the salient details [of the Garland-initiated suit], and presents a disjointed and incorrect view of the invention of the telephone.&lt;ref name="Rockman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same paragraph No. 9 of the Meucci resolution also did not mention that the U.S. Attorney General, plus another cabinet member and two senators had been given or owned millions of dollars of stock in Pan-Electric, as revealed by [[Joseph Pulitzer]] in the ''[[New York World]]''', a fact which many viewed as a strong incentive for them to try to overturn Bell's patent.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor"&gt;Grosvenor, Edwin S. "Memo on Misstatements of Fact in House Resolution 269 and Facts Relating to Antonio Meucci and the Invention of the Telephone." ''alecbell.org'' website, June 30, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]] subsequently ordered the Attorney General not to 'pursue the matter' after the court case stalled out.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt; One of several biographies on the controversial Attorney General Augustus Garland's involvement in the 'Government case' noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He did, however, suffer scandal involving the patent for the telephone. The Attorney General's office was intervening in a lawsuit attempting to break Bell's monopoly of telephone technology, but it had come out that Garland owned stock in one of the companies that stood to benefit. This congressional investigation received public attention for nearly a year, and caused his work as attorney general to suffer.&lt;ref name="OSHM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 'Government case' became one of the greatest scandals in Grover Cleveland's presidency, and was ended when Cleveland ordered Garland to discontinue the trial.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt;

Other factual errors were also found within the preamble to the HRes 269 resolution; among them were:
* Paragraph No. 2 of the resolution referred to Meucci's invention involving "[[Telecommunication|electronic communications]]", however [[Antonio Meucci#Patent caveat|Meucci's patent caveat]] described a '[[Tin can telephone|lover's telegraph]]' which transmitted [[Sound#Sound wave properties and characteristics|sound vibrations]] mechanically across a taut wire, a conclusion that was also noted in Rockman's review ("The court further held that [[Antonio Meucci#Analysis of Meucci's caveat|the caveat of Meucci did not describe any elements of an electric speaking telephone]]...", and "The court held that Meucci's device consisted of a [[History of the telephone#Mechanical devices|mechanical telephone]] consisting of a mouthpiece and an earpiece connected by a wire, and that beyond this the invention of Meucci was only imagination.") &lt;ref name="Rockman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt;
* Paragraphs Nos. 7 &amp; 8 implied that Bell had access to Meucci's works prior to patenting the telephone ("....Meucci later learned that the Western Union affiliate laboratory reportedly lost his working models", followed by: "Alexander Graham Bell, who conducted experiments in the same laboratory where Meucci’s materials had been stored was granted a patent.... with inventing the telephone").&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt; The same inference in the resolution was also described by Rockman.&lt;ref name="Rockman" /&gt; Research by Professor Catania himself showed that Meucci's samples were reportedly lost at a laboratory of [[ADT Security Services|American District Telegraph]] (ADT) of New York, however ADT would not become a subsidiary of Western Union until 1901.&lt;ref name="Catania"&gt;Catania, Basilio [http://www.chezbasilio.org/meucci_faq.htm#25 Antonio Meucci -Questions and Answers: What did Meucci to bring his invention to the public?], Chezbasilio.org website. Retrieved July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADT"&gt;[http://www.adt.com/about_adt/company_history#1901 History of ADT], ADT.com website. Retrieved July 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and publisher (and Bell's great-great-grandson) [[Edwin S. Grosvenor]] also noted that with Bell living and working in the Boston and Brantford areas, and with Meucci living and working in the [[Staten Island]], New York area, there was no overlap where Bell would have had access to Meucci's works prior to Bell's patent application. Grosvenor further pointed out that in 1878, two years after Bell received his patent, the American Bell Telephone Comp., not Bell, was awarded a [[Western Electric]] laboratory as part of a patent infringement settlement with the Western Union Telegraph Company. Alexander Graham Bell never worked in that laboratory, and the timing of the transfer made it irrelevant in any event to Bell's patent application of February 1876.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt; Additionally, the American Bell Telephone Company and Western Union were both competitors to each other and did not share facilities both prior to, and subsequent to the patent lawsuit settlement.
* Paragraph No. 11 stated that "...if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain [his] caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell". However Grosvenor noted in a memo that Bell had succeeded in building a telephone based on a sound knowledge and understanding of its principles, whereas Meucci had been found by the court not to have understood the basics of the electric telephone's operation, with that court case having been conducted some time after Bell was awarded his patent. Since Meucci's caveat didn't describe any of the principles of electric telephony, it would therefore have been irrelevant to Bell's application even had the caveat been renewed.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt;

In total Grosvenor listed ten errors in detail found within the congressional Meucci resolution, and was highly critical of both its intent and accuracy.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt; He also asked two salient questions in Section "C" of the same report: "1) Should Congress overrule the US courts and its own committee, which looked at evidence extensively, and without reviewing any evidence in the matter?", and "2) Should [the U.S.] Congress pass resolutions on historical facts without checking with legitimate historians or their [[Library of Congress|own library]]?" The same document also noted that HRes 269 contradicted the findings of its own Congressional committee's investigation, which had, in 1886, produced a report of 1,278 printed pages.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt;

Grosvenor concluded that: "The historical facts stated in HR 269 were obtained from highly biased sources, and [were] based on shoddy, cursory research."&lt;ref name="Grosvenor" /&gt;
