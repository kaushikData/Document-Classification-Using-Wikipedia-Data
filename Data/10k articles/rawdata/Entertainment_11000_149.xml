'''''Adaptation.''''' is a 2002 American [[comedy-drama]] [[Metacinema|metafilm]] directed by [[Spike Jonze]] and written by [[Charlie Kaufman]]. It is based on [[Susan Orlean]]'s non-fiction book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'', with numerous [[self-reference|self-referential]] events added, and stars [[Nicolas Cage]] as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald, [[Meryl Streep]] as Orlean, and [[Chris Cooper]] as [[John Laroche]], with [[Cara Seymour]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Ron Livingston]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] in supporting roles.

''Adaptation'' had been in development as far back as 1994. [[Jonathan Demme]] brought the project to [[Columbia Pictures]] with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced [[writer's block]] and did not know what to think of ''The Orchid Thief''; he ultimately wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Although it is billed as an adaptation of ''The Orchid Thief'', its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt the book into a film, while dramatizing its events in parallel. ''Adaptation'' also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in ''The Orchid Thief''.

''Adaptation'' received awards at the [[75th Academy Awards]], [[60th Golden Globe Awards]], and [[56th British Academy Film Awards]], with Cooper winning the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and Kaufman winning the [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film was ranked in a [[British Film Institute]] poll as one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49593 |title=Sight &amp; Sound's films of the decade |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The self-loathing [[Charlie Kaufman]] is hired to write the screenplay adaptation for [[Susan Orlean]]'s ''[[The Orchid Thief]]''. Kaufman is going through depression and is not happy that his twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is taking advantage of him.  Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends one of [[Robert McKee]]'s famous seminars.

Charlie, who rejects formulaic script writing, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of ''The Orchid Thief''.  However, he comes to realize that the book does not have a usable narrative and that it is impossible to turn into a film, leaving him with a serious case of [[writer's block]]. Already well over his deadline with [[Columbia Pictures]], and despairing at writing his script with [[self-reference]], Charlie travels to [[New York City]] to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Unable to face her and with the surprising news that Donald's [[spec script]] for a clichéd psychological thriller, called ''The 3'', is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.

Donald pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean, but is suspicious of her account of the events of her book because she acts as though she is lying. He and Charlie follow Orlean to [[Florida]] where she meets [[John Laroche]], the orchid-stealing protagonist of Orlean's book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the [[Seminole]] wanted the [[Dendrophylax lindenii|ghost orchid]] in order to manufacture a drug that causes fascination – Laroche introduces this drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, she decides that Charlie must die.

Orlean forces Charlie at gunpoint to drive to the swamp, where she intends to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences and Charlie's problems with women. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Fleeing, Charlie and Donald drive off but crash into a ranger's truck – Donald dies in the accident. Charlie runs off into the swamp to hide but is spotted by Laroche. However, Laroche is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.

Orlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother before telling his former love interest, Amelia, that he is still in love with her. Charlie finishes the script which ends with Charlie in a voice-over announcing the script is finished and that he wants [[Gérard Depardieu]] to portray him in the film.

The idea to do a film adaptation of [[Susan Orlean]]'s ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' dates back to 1994.&lt;ref name="desowitz-variety"&gt;{{cite news|author =Bill Desowittz|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117871334|title=Development players make personal choices|work=Variety |date=August 18, 2002|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox 2000]] purchased the film rights in 1997,&lt;ref name="jones-variety"&gt;{{cite news|author =Oliver Jones|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117760122|title=Cruise in tune with ''Shaggs'' project|work=Variety |date=December 17, 1999|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually selling them to [[Jonathan Demme]], who set the project at [[Columbia Pictures]].

Kaufman explained, {{quotation|The idea of how to write the film didn't come to me until quite late. It was the only idea I had, I liked it, and I knew there was no way it would be approved if I pitched it. So I just wrote it and never told the people I was writing it for.

The makeup effects (the Nicolas Cage double, Chris Cooper's teeth, and the alligator attack) were the handiwork of Makeup Effects Designer [[Tony Gardner (designer)]], and his effects company [[Alterian, Inc.]]

The site's critical consensus reads: "Dizzyingly original, the loopy, multi-layered ''Adaptation'' is both funny and thought-provoking."&lt;ref&gt;Rotten Tomatoes. [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1118700/ Adaptation (2002)]. Retrieved on: 2012-11-12&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 83 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim."&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/adaptation?q=Adaptation| title=Adaptation. (2002): Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a perfect four star rating, believing that the film "leaves you breathless with curiosity, as it teases itself with the directions it might take. To watch the film is to be actively involved in the challenge of its creation."&lt;ref name="ebert-initialreview"&gt;{{cite news|author =[[Roger Ebert]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021220/REVIEWS/212200302/1023|title= Adaptation|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=December 20, 2002|accessdate=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later added the film to his "Great Movies" collection.&lt;ref name="ebert-greatmovies"&gt;Roger Ebert's "Great Movies" essay about [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080918/REVIEWS08/809180300/1004 Adaptation.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2009, Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also gave the film a four star rating and stated, "Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', in 1999."&lt;ref name="travers-rollingstone"&gt;{{cite news|author =[[Peter Travers]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/adaptation-20021206|title= Adaptation|work=Rolling Stone|date=December 6, 2002|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking.

In a 2005 survey, the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]] named Kaufman's screenplay for ''Adaptation'' the 77th best movie screenplay ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |title=101 Greatest Screenplays List |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |accessdate=August 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813151310/http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1807 |archivedate=August 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response from Susan Orlean ===
Having been submitted the screenplay for approval, Susan Orlean was strongly opposed to the making of the film; she ended up reluctantly approving its production, and was ultimately very impressed with the final result. In 2012, she stated "[reading the screenplay] was a complete shock. My first reaction was 'Absolutely not!' They had to get my permission and I just said: 'No! Are you kidding? This is going to ruin my career!' Very wisely, they didn't really pressure me. They told me that everybody else had agreed and I somehow got emboldened. It was certainly scary to see the movie for the first time. It took a while for me to get over the idea that I had been insane to agree to it, but I love the movie now."

She was very appreciative of Streep's portrayal, calling it "one of my favourite performances by her" and praising the fact that her version of the character was based not on the real Orlean, but on how Streep imagined Orlean based on ''The Orchid Thief''. Despite the fictional parts of the film, she praised it for being very faithful to the spirit of ''The Orchid Thief'': "What I admire the most [about the film] is that it's very true to the book's themes of life and obsession, and there are also insights into things which are much more subtle in the book about longing, and about disappointment."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Perry.

'''Albert E. Arkwright''', usually referred to simply as '''Arkwright''', is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the British sitcom, ''[[Open All Hours]]'', played by [[Ronnie Barker]]. Arkwright is the uncle of [[Granville (Open All Hours)|Granville]] and the proprietor of an old fashioned Yorkshire corner shop, which in the era of the programme (1970s and 1980s) was a product of a bygone age. Arkwright's signature characteristic is his stutter, which Granville never misses an opportunity to mock.

== Character ==
Arkwright is a pragmatic, miserly  man with old-fashioned values, whose world seems to stop at his shop door, except for his uncontrollable lust for Nurse Gladys Emmanuel ([[Lynda Baron]]), which may prompt him on occasion to wander across the road, usually with a ladder, to gain access to her bedroom window. Arkwright is a devious, and mildly dishonest character, who has many crafty tricks to try to persuade a customer to leave his store having bought at least one thing, and will avoid spending his own money at all cost. He is also very conservative about his savings, keeping some in his pocket wrapped in a fine gold chain, and some in an old, battered [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] tin that he hides under the kitchen sink. This includes, or so he claims, coins from before 1922, when they were "solid silver". He loves money so much that the last time he spent a whole night away from the shop was in 1957, when he went to have his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] [[Appendectomy|out]]. The till itself is old fashioned, and possesses a tight spring-clip that regularly puts Granville and his fingers in danger. Arkwright refuses to replace it because of the price of a replacement, and because it prevents people from taking his precious money. Although an avid political commentator, he has few political convictions and never sides with either the left  or  right wing, instead implying they are all useless. Arkwright does however seem fervently opposed to nationalisation, once commenting "My top lip went all stiff and dead, as if it had been nationalised." His political comments usually show no allegiances, instead making remarks like "When Wales get home rule, do you think they'll nationalise [[Clive Jenkins]]?"

Arkwright maintains an openly polite demeanour around customers, but will often insult those who offend him in a veiled or open manner.

Arkwright appears to believe in God, although he is certainly not portrayed as a religious man. Most episodes end with him on the pavement outside the shop during closing time, contemplating the day's events. His thoughts often start with an expression like "Soon they'll only be me and thee that aren't either nationalised or a limited company."

Arkwright, like most characters in the series, is a rational, practical man, who shows no signs of any sentimentality, unlike Granville, who seems to dream away most of his days, and longs for a life away from the shop.

Arkwright speaks with a stammer, which he acknowledges sometimes makes it difficult to express himself. He often makes his impediment into a joke, for example asking: "Granville, how do you spell P-p-p-pepper? Is it 6 Ps or 7?" Granville occasionally mocks his uncle's speech pattern (such as calling the "weather fore-fore-forecast" the "weather twelvecast", and referring to the "B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-BC" as morse code), although never in a malicious or hurtful manner. Arkwright was shocked on one occasion to find that he also appears to stutter even when thinking to himself.

By the time of the 2013 episode ''[[Still Open All Hours]]'' and the sequel series of the same name, Arkwright has long since died (Barker died in 2005), but almost all of his personality traits have passed onto Granville. Granville keeps a framed photograph of Arkwright in the shop's kitchen which he occasionally talks to. Several people in the town, including Granville, believe that Arkwright's ghost still haunts the shop, particularly the cash register, attributing events such as the lights switching on and off or the register randomly opening and closing to him.

==Relationships==
===Granville===
Arkwright's sister, whose name is never known, died shortly after giving birth to Granville. Less as an act of love and more as a source of free labour, Arkwright brought up the child. Arkwright paints a picture of his sister being a floozy and possibly a part-time [[prostitute]]. He sees no harm in this, seeing this as an enterprising choice of career. This is often implied by phrases such as "Just take the man's money and smile Granville, that's what your mother would have done", "You're j-just like your mother, happiness is h-horizontal", or, "Now, d-don't misunderstand me, s-some people loved dearly! Others used to get it on discount". Granville once takes a call from someone he addresses as "Auntie Lily"; seeing as his father is unknown, this would have to be another sister of Arkwright's. When Granville on occasion badgers his uncle about his own father's unknown identity, he retorts by calling him an "Hungarian P-p-p-p-p-prince".

Granville is often made to pay for anything he takes from the shop's shelves, even if Arkwright was the one who gave it to him. In later life, Granville demonstrates a great deal of affection and respect for his uncle after his death, taking comfort in his apparent poltergeist activities around the shop, saying: "I like having him still around, so long as he pays his own electric."

Its never made clear exactly how old Granville is during the original series run, but considering the age of David Jason, its easy to assume that Granville may actually be in his 30s-40s during the 1970s-1980s run.

===Nurse Gladys Emmanuel===
Gladys is a [[midwife]], to whom Arkwright is informally engaged. Their engagement doesn't seem to be serious, however they do seem to be fond of each other. (Their engagement is not mentioned until the end of series one, so for the first few episodes, Arkwright can appear to be a "sex pest" to Gladys, to some viewers). Most of the characters who use the shop are old-fashioned, domesticated characters, and while Gladys is very straight forward and Arkwright is somewhat eccentric, she does seem to find company in him, as he is probably more enlightened than most in the area. Gladys always says she won't marry Arkwright until her mother (who is in her eighties) dies, a day that Arkwright seems to look forward to. However, Gladys has also claimed on several occasions that she refrains from marrying him because of his excessively tight-fisted ways or his overworking of Granville. Emmanuel is Arkwright's sexual conquest; although he never manages it in the series, he does come close in the back of a mini van that proves to be too small for the act. Arkwright and Gladys apparently never got married before Arkwright's death; Gladys claims he died to save the cost of the church.

'''Astro Base''' was a [[toy]] made by the [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] company in the early 1960s. The toy ran on 4 [[D battery|D Cell batteries]]. Besides a power switch, it had several features that includes the following modes of operation:

==Modes of operation==
* ''Astro Scope'': Switch to Astro Scope and a scene of [[spaceships]], [[rockets]], and [[jet aircraft|jets]] rotates through a [[viewfinder]] just below a [[radar dome]] on the top of the toy. A button on the [[System console|console]] let the user "fire" at objects seen on the screen, which would pause the rotating images and emit a [[machine-gun]] style sound.
* ''Space Lock'': A [[crane (machine)|crane]] emerges from the [[Trapdoor|hatch]] on one side of the toy. This crane has a [[hoist (device)|hoist]] operation that can be used to raise or lower a plastic [[astronaut]] figure, or other objects that the user may have that can be connected to the hook at the end of a chain. The main purpose of this crane is to insert or remove the astronaut from a [[scout car]].
* ''Scout Car'': The scout car can be plugged into a [[port]] on the console and controlled by a two position [[switch]] marked "turn" and "drive" that can actually be used to steer the vehicle with a bit of practice. The scout car also has [[missiles]] that can be launched.

Ideal made two variations of the Astro Base. The original "all red" version featured a lighted Astro Scope that illuminated the pictures spinning around the Astro Scope. Ideal Toys discontinued this version and offered the common "red and white" version.

A '''bouchon''' is a type of restaurant found in [[Lyon]], [[France]], that serves traditional [[Lyonnaise cuisine]], such as sausages, [[Foie gras|duck pâté]] or roast pork.  Compared to other forms of French cooking such as ''[[nouvelle cuisine]]'', the dishes are quite fatty and heavily oriented around meat.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  There are approximately twenty officially certified traditional bouchons, but a larger number of establishments describe themselves using the term.

Typically, the emphasis in a bouchon is not on ''[[haute cuisine]]'' but, rather, a convivial atmosphere and a personal relationship with the owner.

==History==
[[Image:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|right|thumb|Another bouchon, ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon.]]

The tradition of bouchons came from small inns visited by [[History of silk#The silk industry in France|silk workers]] passing through Lyon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

According to the dictionary ''[[Petit Robert|Le petit Robert]]'', this name derives from the 16th century expression for a bunch of twisted straw.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Petit Robert'': Spécialt (1584) Vx Petit bouquet de paille, rameau de feuillage qui servait d'enseigne à un cabaret; ce cabaret. ➙ estaminet. « ''Le couple se donnait rendez-vous dans un bouchon de l'avenue'' »&lt;/ref&gt; A representation of such bundles began to appear on signs to designate the restaurants and, by [[metonymy]], the restaurants themselves became known as bouchons.  The more common use of "bouchons" as a stopper or cork at the mouth of a bottle, and its derivatives, have the same etymology.

===Today===
Since 1997, [[Pierre Grison]] and his organization, ''L'Association de défense des bouchons lyonnais'' (The Association for the Preservation of Lyonnais Bouchons), bestow annual certifications to restaurants as "authentic" bouchons.&lt;ref&gt;Birck, Danielle. ''[http://www.rfi.fr/francefr/articles/110/article_78705.asp Richesse des régions et gastronomie lyonnaise]''.  [[Radio France Internationale]] Published February 2, 2009 (French). Retrieved May 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These restaurants receive the title ''Les Authentiques Bouchons Lyonnais'' and are identified with a sticker showing the [[marionette]] [[Gnafron]], a Lyonnais symbol of the pleasures of dining, with a glass of wine in one hand and a napkin bearing the Lyon crest in the other.&lt;ref name=gones&gt;[http://www.cuisine-des-gones.com/bouchon1.html Cuisine des Gones] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504121706/http://www.cuisine-des-gones.com/bouchon1.html |date=May 4, 2010 }} (French) Retrieved May 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list, subject to some fluctuation as the certification is bestowed annually, contains most of the certified bouchons: ''Abel'', ''Brunet'', ''Café des deux places'', ''Café des fédérations'', ''Chabert et fils'', ''Daniel et Denise'', ''Chez Georges le petit bouchon'', ''Les gones'', ''Hugon'', ''Le Jura'', ''Chez Marcelle'', ''Le Mercière'', ''La mère Jean'', ''Le mitonné'', ''Le Morgon'', ''Le musée'', ''Chez Paul'', ''Les Trois Maries'', ''A ma vigne'', and ''Le Vivarais''.&lt;ref name=gones/&gt;

While many bouchons are now oriented strongly towards the tourist market, with increased prices and less traditional fare as a result, a typical meal in a real bouchon costs around €12-15 {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.

[[Rede Globo]] withdrew from the event in 1985 and 1986 and returned in 1987. Brazil withdrew again from 1988 to 1992. One year later, the Brazilian broadcaster made a brief return to the event till 1995. From 1996 on, Brazil retired definitively from the event.

== History ==
The brazilian OTI contestants were internally selected by Rede Globo. Brazil was one of the most successful participating countries in the festival with three victories: The first of those victories came in 1972 in the first edition of the festival with Cláudia Regina and Tobias. The second Brazilian victory came in 1978 in [[Santiago de Chile]] with the female singer Denise de Kalafe and her song "El amor... cosa tan rara" (Love... such a strange thing), which was performed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The third and last victory of Brazil in the OTI Festival took place in [[Washington D.C.|Washington DC]] 1983 with Jessé and his song "Estrela de papel" (Paper star). In total, the Brazilian broadcaster, Rede Globo managed to reach ten times to the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dicionariompb.com.br/festival-internacional-da-cancao-rj/dados-artisticos|title=OTI Festival.

Brazil hosted the OTI Festival in 1973, after winning the song contest the previous year, according to the original rules. The festival was held in the "Palacio das Artes" in [[Belo Horizonte]]. The stage of the festival had soft colors, a background zone for the orchestra and a central platform where the performers competed and the event was presented by Iris Lettieri and Walter Forster. This event wasn't organized by Rede Globo, but by [[Rede Tupi]], through its local TV station TV Itacolomi - Canal 4 of [[Belo Horizonte]].

== Contestants ==
Denisse de Kalafe, participated in the event for first time in 1976 getting the fourth place. Two years later, the singer returned to the event and got the second Brazilian victory in the OTI Festival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3943">"'''(The) Carioca'''" is a 1933 [[popular music|popular song]] with music by [[Vincent Youmans]] and lyrics by [[Edward Eliscu]] and [[Gus Kahn]], as well as the name of the dance choreographed to it for the 1933 film ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]''. It was sung in the film by [[Alice Gentle]], [[Movita Castaneda]] and [[Etta Moten]] and danced by [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] as part of an extended production dance number illustrating the [[ballroom dance]].&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book| last = Mueller| first = John| title = Astaire Dancing – The Musical Films| publisher = Hamish Hamilton| year = 1986| location = London| isbn = 0-241-11749-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46,47}} The dance, which was choreographed by the film's dance director, Dave Gould, assisted by [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]], was based on an earlier stage dance with the same name by [[Fanchon and Marco]].

The word "[[Carioca]]" refers to inhabitants of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. 

Astaire and Roger's short dance has historical significance, as it was their first screen dance together. Though billed fourth and fifth, many felt they stole the film, which became a big hit for [[RKO]]. The song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[7th Academy Awards]], but lost to an even bigger Astaire and Rogers production number, "[[The Continental (song)|The Continental]]" from ''The Gay Divorcee'' (1934), their next film together and their first starring vehicle. They were billed by RKO as "The King and Queen of 'The Carioca.'"

While the song has become a [[jazz standard]], the dance did not have longevity. Following the success of ''Flying Down to Rio'', an attempt was made to propagate it as a new ballroom dance, without much success. It was a mixture of [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|samba]], [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]], [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]] and [[rhumba]].{{cn|date=December 2015}} The distinctive feature of the dance &amp;ndash; at least as portrayed in the movie &amp;ndash; was that it was to be danced with the partners' foreheads touching.

==In popular culture==
*The credits of ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' feature a comic version of the song recorded by [[Jo Stafford]] and her husband, [[Paul Weston]], under the names [[Jonathan and Darlene Edwards]].
*A cover of this song was used in the French comedy film ''[[La Cité de la peur]]'', in which a French translation of the song was interpreted by actors [[Alain Chabat]] and [[Gérard Darmon]], along with a comic dance. In France, this version is widely known, while most people under age 50 are unaware of the original version.

The '''Chamberlain-Kahn Act''' of 1918 is a U.S. federal law passed on July 9, 1918 by the [[65th United States Congress]]. The law implemented a public health program that came to be known as the '''American Plan''', whose stated goal was to combat the spread of [[venereal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|editor=Anne Cipriano Venzon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|publisher=Routledge|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcYq72qYRTcC&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;pg=PA93|page=93|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work|volume=1|editor= Melissa Hope Ditmore|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chamberlain-Kahn Act gave the government the power to quarantine any woman suspected of having a [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD). A medical examination was required, and if it revealed an STD, this discovery could constitute proof of prostitution. The purpose of this law was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cather Studies|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZ0nDwAAQBAJ|editor1=Ann Moseley|editor2=John J. Murphy|editor3=Robert Thacker|volume=Volume 11: Willa Cather at the Modernist Crux|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2017|isbn=9780803296992|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, the American Plan authorized the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a "farm colony" until cured. By the end of the war 15,520 prostitutes had been imprisoned, most never having received medical hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Rosen|author-link=Ruth Rosen|title=The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America, 1900-1918|publisher=JHU Press|year=1983|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpTU7RwfaooC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is named for Senator [[George Earle Chamberlain]] of [[Oregon]] and Representative [[Julius Kahn (congressman)|Julius Kahn]] of [[California]].

== Historical context ==
America entered [[World War I]] with an undersized army, resulting in the first compulsory [[military draft]] since the [[American Civil War]]. The army grew from 128,000 members to four million by the end of the war. Large training camps were built throughout the US in order to train the vast amount of new recruits. These large, isolated camps populated by young men were often associated with excessive alcohol consumption and illicit sexual activities with local women. The culture of military camps coupled with rumors of widespread venereal disease among the militaries of Europe inspired the creation of the Commission on Training Camp Activities, which sought to investigate the sexual and moral cultures of these training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connelly|first1=Mark|title=The Response to Prostitution in the Progressive Era|publisher=Chapel Hill UNC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission report was written by Raymond Fosbick, the assistant to the Secretary of War [[Newton Baker]]. In the report, Fosbick urges preventative measures be taken against prostitution and the spread of venereal disease: 
"''take all steps necessary to suppress prostitution in the neighborhood of military training camps...We know something of the experience through which our allies have gone. In some cases as much as thirty three and a third percent of the men have been made ineffective through venereal disease. We cannot afford to have any condition of that kind in connection with American troops.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fosdick|first1=Raymond|title=The Commission on Training Camp Actitvities|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York|year=1918|volume=7|pages=163–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after the report was written, The Commission on Training Activities implemented the Chamberlain-Kahn Act.

== The law ==
The Chamberlain-Kahn Act of 1918 contains a series of measures intended to stop the spread of [[venereal disease]]. Firstly, it created the Interdepartmental Hygiene Board that controlled the allocation of funds for its stated purpose. Secondly, the act authorized the quarantine of citizens suspected of having venereal disease: 
"''That the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy are hereby authorized and directed to adopt measures for the purpose of assisting the various States in caring for civilian persons whose detention, isolation, [[quarantine]], or commitment to institutions may be found necessary for the protection of the military and naval forces of the United States against venereal diseases.''" 
The act allocates $1,000,000 to fund this quarantine effort. Thirdly, the act created Division of Venereal Disease in the Bureau of the Public Health Service. The stated goal of the Division of Venereal Disease was: "(1) to study and investigate the cause, treatment, and prevention of venereal diseases; (2) to cooperate with State boards or departments of health for the prevention and control of such diseases within the States; and (3) to control and prevent the spread of these diseases in interstate traffic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chamberlain-Kahn Act of 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=January 7, 2018 |url=https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/USA/Chamberlain_Kahn_1918.html |title=An Act Making appropriations for the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen: Chapter 15 (The Chamberlain-Kahn Act) |website=The Mead Project | publisher=Brock University, Toronto, Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repercussions ==
Under this law, women suspected to be prostitutes could be stopped, detained, inspected, and could sent to a rehabilitation center if they failed their examination. Any evidence of venereal disease found during one of these exams could constitute proof of prostitution. By 1919, thirty states had constructed facilities for the purpose of detaining and treating women with venereal disease; an estimated 30,000 women were detained and examined during the war. During the course of the war, 110 red light districts throughout America were shut down. Despite these efforts, the availability of prostitutes remained fairly constant around military camps, and rates of venereal disease remained quite high.

In his 2018 book ''The Trials of Nina McCall'', [[Scott W. Stern]] describes the American Plan as a decades-long government-sponsored campaign, under which public health officials were authorized to detain and examine women suspected of carrying a venereal disease and confine those who were positively diagnosed or otherwise judged to be a public health threat to a hospital or jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=The ‘Social Hygiene’ Campaign That Sent Thousands of American Women to Jail|author= Cynthia Gorney|date=July 31, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/books/review/scott-stern-trials-of-nina-mccall.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New Republic|title=A Forgotten War on Women|author=Kim Kelly|date=May 22, 2018|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/148493/forgotten-war-women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1330">The '''Children's Food Festival''' is a food festival held every two years in [[Oxfordshire]], organised by the [[Earth Trust]]. It is fronted by patrons [[Raymond Blanc]] and [[Sophie Grigson]], who give hands-on demos, inviting children to help them chop, stir, smell and taste. Other guests have included [[Annabel Karmel]], [[Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall]] (author of ''The Good Granny Cookbook''), [[Sam Stern]] (the Teenage Chef), Nora Sands (Jamie’s School Dinner Lady) and children’s cookery writer Amanda Grant.

The idea for a food festival for children came to Eka Morgan, the Festival's Director, in 2005. "Parents say that one of the best ways to encourage children to eat good food is to get them to cook it themselves. I thought that a festival which conveyed positive messages about food, with plenty of colour, humour and hands-on cooking, could go some way to transform young people’s approach to eating."

'''''Class Enemy''''' is a 1978 play by the British playwright [[Nigel Williams (author)|Nigel Williams]] which premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].

Class Enemy was written in 1978 as a social commentary on the apathy and anarchy in inner city British schools, is adapted to the new European reality at the beginning of the 21st century. The set is a bleak classroom with broken tables and chairs, dirty blackboard and lit with sterile fluorescent lamps. The play starts with six students waiting for a teacher and, like [[Samuel Beckett]]’s [[Vladimir and Estragon]], they seem to wait in vain. What the audience learns as the play unravels is that no one cares any more - at least not for these students. The female Deputy Headmistress delivers her scathing assessment, spitting the words with no compassion or understanding, and as soon as she leaves, into the break steps Iron - the school yard bully. He commandeers the situation, forcing each student to ‘teach’ a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theurbanwire.com/2008/06/25/class-enemy-an-enemy-of-the-people/ The UrbanWire: ''Class Enemy – An Enemy Of The People'' by Lucilla Teoh  &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine - 2 Jul 1979 - Page 16

The play was adapted (''Klasni Neprijatelj'' in local language) by the [[East West Theatre Company]] from [[Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  but East West Theatre Company's production was adapted by the show's director, [[Haris Pašović]]. The original play, set in the South London classroom in early 1980s, was in Pašović's production transported to Sarajevo of 2007. The original cast consisting of six high-school boys was replaced by seven characters – three girls and four boys. The free adaptation, while keeping the original spirit and main themes, was also inspired by the research conducted in Bosnian classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/class-enemy/ East West Theatre Company Official Website &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/theater/25frin.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=print/ New York Times: Antsy Adolescents Romp at Edinburgh Festivals by CHarles Isherwood &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic team of the ''Class Enemy'' has conducted a research in some of the secondary schools of Sarajevo and discovered alarming levels of violence among students and teachers. Findings, among other things included information that students often came to school carrying knives, that police was involved frequently, and that rude behavior during classes was a common occurrence. During just a few months, [[East West Theatre Company]]'s team has recorded a number of cases of brutal violence in [[Sarajevo]] and small Bosnian towns which further informed many themes covered by the show.

The show has won a number of awards including No. 1 Pick of The Year by The Flying Inkpot from Singapore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkpotreviews.com/2008reviews/picks.html/ The Flying Inkpot: ''Inkpot Picks 2008'' &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903075950/http://www.inkpotreviews.com/2008reviews/picks.html |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Best Play Award at Singapore Arts Festival 2008, and Best Contemporary Show Award at International Theatre Festival Kontakt 2009 in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/class-enemy/ East West Theatre Company Official Website &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been performed at festivals in Edinburgh ([[Edinburgh International Festival]]), Singapore, Shanghai and Sibiu Romania, as well as theatres in Ljubljana Slovenia, Novi Sad Serbia and various small towns across Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/10231-foe-play-class-enemy/ Edinburgh Festival Guide: ''Foe play - Class Enemy'' by Malcolm Jack &amp;#91;cited December 08, 2011&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigel Williams' shocking 1970s play about a London school has been relocated to modern-day Sarajevo, making the pupils children of the war. This updating, by director Haris Pasovic, is subtle but important. Most obvious change is the switch from a single-sex boys' school to a mixed class of pubescent teenagers, none of whom - either male or female - can go for long without referring to masturbation or making lewd, often violent, approaches to one another. Implicit in the production is also the memory of the collapse of Yugoslavia. One student talks about the poverty he has endured since his father's killing in the war, another about the social malaise that has attracted him to Islamic extremism, and a third about the racial abuse she has suffered as a result of being a Bosnian Serb living within Bosniak ethnic majority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/21/edinburghfestival.class.enemy/ The Guardian: ''Edinburgh festival: Class Enemy'' by Mark Fisher; 21 August 2008 (accessed January 17, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cast and crew are from across the national spectrum: Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, all full of disturbing stories of the war. The play's themes of confused social values, isolation, single-parent families, alcoholism, xenophobia and violence were a strong fit, although Pasovic tweaked cultural references somewhat and adjusted dialogue to make it more accessible to a Bosnian audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/07/edinburghfestival.theatre/ The Guardian: ''And the lesson today is how to shoot'' by Kate Connolly; 7 August 2008 (accessed January 17, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1411">A '''Danish pole''' is a [[circus]] prop, consisting of a [[wood]]en pole about 4 metres long and with a 5 cm diameter. It is fastened to a turnable base on the bottom and to a [[rope]] on top. The rope can be slackened, causing the pole to hang at an angle and permitting the [[artist]]s to swing the pole around the base and do [[acrobatic]]s on it while it turns. The rope can also be tightened, causing the pole to stand directly up in the air and allowing the artists to do more traditional pole acrobatics.

==History==
The Danish pole is a relatively new circus prop, invented by the Danish artist [[Anders Jensen Astrup]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirkus-dk.dk/htm/news2005.htm About the Roundabout show]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been used in at least two [[contemporary circus]] shows: ''[[99% Unknown]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirkor.se/99/eng/medverkande.html Cast of 99% Unknown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310224234/http://www.cirkor.se/99/eng/medverkande.html |date=2007-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Cirkus Cirkör]] and ''[[Roundabout (show)|Roundabout]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanonhallen.dk/english/roundabout.asp Roundabout at Kanonhallen's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220135207/http://www.kanonhallen.dk/english/roundabout.asp |date=2005-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Nova Exit]].

'''Double bugg''' ({{lang-sv|Dubbelbugg}}) is a Swedish [[Swing (dance)|swing]] dance.

==Dance detail==
Double bugg is more or less a [[competitive dance]] within the [[BRR dance]] family administered by the [[Swedish Dancesport Federation]]. The dance style has its background in another typical and invented Swedish dance style, namely [[Bugg]]. Bugg comes originally from [[Lindy Hop]] ([[Jitterbug]]).

Double bugg is danced by three persons, especially a gentleman and two women. Variations occur however. Double bugg is mostly performered on [[dance competition]]s, but sometimes also occurred among [[social dance]]rs. The dance arose during the 80s and was due to deficiency on gentlemen wanted to dance. One found out that a gentleman could dance the Swedish [[partner dance]] Bugg with two women concurrent. Suddenly a new dance style in [[Sweden]] was invented, double bugg.

Today double bugg is a small [[formation dance]], that is conducted of three persons. The formation of different patterns and formations, for example lines, circles, triangles are apart from changing place between the dancers, one of several main features in double bugg. The character is free and is retrieved from someone of the other Swedish BRR dances: [[Bugg]], [[Lindy Hop]], [[Boogie_woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]] and [[Rock and Roll (dance)]]. A various footwear is preferred in double bugg and is mainly danced to modern [[Pop music|pop]] or [[rock'n'roll]] music.

Today Lessing's successors — resident theatre critics throughout Germany and Austria — are called dramaturg(e)s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
One of the dramaturg(e)'s contributions is to categorise and discuss the various types of plays or operas, their interconnectedness and their styles.  The responsibilities of a dramaturg(e) vary from one theatre or opera company to the next.  They might include the hiring of actors, the development of a season of plays or operas with a sense of coherence among them, assistance with and editing of new plays or operas by resident or guest playwrights or composers/librettists, the creation of programmes or accompanying educational services, helping the director with rehearsals, and serving as elucidator of history or spokesperson for deceased or otherwise absent playwrights or composers. At larger theatres or opera houses, the dramaturg(e) works on the historical and cultural research into the play or opera and its setting.

In theatre companies, a dramaturg(e) will create a workbook for the director and actors (usually these are different) and work extensively with the director prior to the first rehearsal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Proehl|first=Geoffrey S|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8386-4112-5|publisher=Associated University Press|title=Toward a Dramaturgical Sensibility:landscape and journey|page=19|quote=dramaturgy is the name given to that set of elements necessary to the working of a play at any moment in its passage from imagination to embodiment...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was hired by the Hamburg National Theatre in 1767, to serve as the theaters critic of plays and acting, a position which would later be named dramaturge. This position grew over time to what it is today, encompassing the wide variety of tasks seen by modern dramaturgies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2018|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=Biographies&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=MultiTab&amp;searchType=PersonSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;docId=GALE%7CK1631003917&amp;docType=Biography&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=BIC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CK1631003917&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=colu91149&amp;inPS=true#|journal=Encyclopedia of World Biography.|volume=Online ed. 1998|pages=|via=GALE Biography in Context}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2018|editor-last=Dewald|editor-first=Jonathan|editor-link=|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/K3404900636/BIC?u=colu91149&amp;sid=BIC&amp;xid=65e42d3b|journal=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|volume=2004|pages=|via=GALE Biography in Context}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Discrepancies with Definition==
The modern definition of Dramaturge is often debated as to what specific tasks this job does, with some defining it as the bridge between the director and the actors, others defining it as one who determines the meaning of plays and shows for the actors, and others claiming that even they don’t quite have a complete definition for their job. Another view of the dramaturge is one who analyzes the texts of shows, and asks  This discrepancy between dramaturgies is likely due to the lack of an official historical definition, and the wide variety of tasks that Dramaturgies could be asked to work on, depending on the theater, director, the show being produced, and the actors. Since Gotthold Lessing didn’t create an official definition for his own position at the [[Hamburg National Theatre|Hamburg National Theater]], modern dramaturgies have to infer their tasks based on what Lessing did during his career, and adapt to the current needs of modern theater.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/12/theater/arts-in-america-dramaturges-take-a-while-to-define-themselves.html|title=ARTS IN AMERICA; Dramaturges Take a While to Define Themselves|last=Honan|first=William H.|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americantheatre.org/2015/09/29/the-dramaturg-is-in/|title=The Dramaturg Is In|date=2015-09-29|work=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Recent Growth of Dramaturgies==
Since the year 2000, the number of dramaturgies working around the world has increased, albeit it still remains a fairly rare job to have. In 2000, 400 dramaturgies were recorded to be active in the [[United States]], with that number growing. There are various possibilities for what is causing this growth, but some dramaturgies attribute the growth to the fact that dramaturgy combines two popular studies for young students, the [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]], and [[Theatre|Theater]]. Some dramaturgies are worried, however, that this growth may slow down, due to a decrease in the number of modern plays being written.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:HarryHoudini1899.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Houdini]] (1874–1926), a famous escapologist and [[magic (illusion)|magician]]]]
'''Escapology''' is the practice of escaping from [[physical restraint|restraint]]s or other traps. Escapologists (also classified as '''escape artists''') escape from [[handcuffs]], [[straitjackets]], [[Cage (enclosure)|cages]], [[coffins]], steel boxes, [[barrel]]s, bags, burning buildings, [[aquarium|fish-tanks]], and other perils, often in combination.

==History==
The art of escaping from restraints and confined spaces has been a skill employed by performers for a very long time. It was not originally displayed as an overt act in itself but was instead used secretly to create illusions such as a disappearance or transmutation.&lt;ref name="Dawes"&gt;{{citation
 |last = Dawes
 |first = Edwin A
 |title = The Great Illusionists
 |publisher = Chartwell Books (New Jersey)
 |year = 1979
 |page = 193
 |isbn = 0-89009-240-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s, the [[Davenport Brothers]], who were skilled at releasing themselves from rope ties, used the art to convey the impression they were restrained while they created spirit phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, 'The Great Illusionists', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other illusionists, including [[John Nevil Maskelyne]], worked out how the Davenports did their act and re-created the tricks to debunk the brothers' claims of psychic power. However, the re-creations did not involve overt escape, merely a replication of tricks with the statement that they were accomplished by secret magicians' skills rather than spirits. It took another thirty years before the pure skill of escape began to be displayed as an act in itself. The figure most responsible for making escapology a recognized entertainment was [[Harry Houdini]], who built his career on demonstrating the ability to escape from a huge variety of restraints and difficult situations.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, 'The Great Illusionists', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Houdini made no secret of the fact that he was an expert on restraints and the skills needed to overcome them but he often concealed the exact details of his escapes to maintain an air of mystery and suspense. Although many of his escapes relied on technical skills such as [[lock-picking]] and contortion, he also performed tricks such as [[Metamorphosis (illusion)|Metamorphosis]] and the [[Chinese Water Torture Cell]], which are essentially classic stage illusions reliant on cleverly designed props. Houdini's feats helped to define the basic repertoire of escapology, including escapes from [[handcuffs]], [[padlock]]s, [[straitjacket]]s, [[mail bag]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_-UQ8pUg_4C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Houdini+Mailbag+escape&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4R2ikHM-pZ&amp;sig=DS6KuQR4KzLIYu0qHe5gEBrDPgI&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kJQuUM2KCcf_ygH994DwDg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwDTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Houdini%20Mailbag%20escape&amp;f=false |first1=J.

The actual term 'escapology' is reputed to have been coined originally by Australian escapologist and illusionist Murray (Norman Murray Walters), a Houdini contemporary.

A succession of performers have added new ideas and created variations on old stunts, but it is common for even the best contemporary escapologists to be dubbed modern day "Houdinis".

Because St. [[Nicholas Owen (martyr)|Nicholas Owen]] successfully escaped the [[Tower of London]] and arranged the escape of two [[Jesuit]] inmates from the prison, the 16th-century Christian martyr is considered by [[Catholic]] escapologists as their patron saint. Along with St. John [[Don Bosco]], the two are considered the primary patrons of Catholic [[Gospel Magic]]ians.

==Societies==
The United Kingdom Escape Artists was formed in 2004 and is currently the only organisation in the United Kingdom devoted to the promotion of UK escape artists and the preservation of escapology within the UK. Its members are made up of professional escapologists, restraint collectors, master locksmiths, and historians. The UKEA meet once a year for their AGM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedkingdomescapeartists.co.uk ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411091854/http://www.unitedkingdomescapeartists.co.uk/ |date=2013-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Escapologists Society is an online society with its own monthly newsletter that is dedicated to the art of escape on an international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiesociety.webs.com/ |title=Home - T.I.E.S |website=Tiesociety.webs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Escape Masters (The International Association of Escape Artists) was formed in 1985 by renowned escape artist Norman Bigelow and has been run by Thomas Blacke as International President of the organization and Editor/Publisher of the magazine since 2001.

==Forms of escape performance==
*'''Hidden''' is a style of escape performance popularised by the late [[Harry Houdini]] that involved much of the performance taking place behind some form of screen or inside a cabinet in order to protect the secrets of the performer. This style of escape performance was popular with the majority of escape artists until the end of the 20th Century and is still preferred by many performers today. Its disadvantage is that audiences may wrongly believe a concealed assistant to have released the escapologist, whom they may not have seen struggle.
*'''Full View''' is a form of escape performance that was popularised by [[Norman Bigelow]] Sr. during the 1970s. He presented his escapes as pure tests of human skill and endurance and the audience could actually see everything from start to finish. His signature escape, "The Doors Of Death," inspired many escape artists to adopt this style of performance in their own shows.  One performer, Jonathon Bryce, took the full view approach to the Buried Alive escape and with the encouragement of Norman Bigelow Sr., made the world debut of Buried Alive in Full View at the Music is Art Festival in Buffalo, NY with the help of Goo Goo Dolls bassist, Robby Takac. Mark Nelson, "The Great Markini" also performed Full View with his Electrified Mummy Lid Torture Board Escape. 
*'''Escape Or Die,''' the form of escape performance originated by Houdini, is the standard for top-of-the-line escapologists. There are at least three possible ways for an escapologist's life to be at risk from the possible failure of this escape. These are '''death by drowning,''' as in the water escapes Houdini pioneered; '''death by suffocation,''' as in escapes from airtight enclosures containing no water, such as coffins; and '''death by falling,''' as also originated by Houdini, in a straitjacket escape hanging high above the earth as when Houdini hung from cranes and buildings upside down in a strait jacket where falling would mean certain death. UK escape artist [[Alan Alan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/burning-rope-escapologist |title=Burning Rope Escapologist - British Pathé |website=Britishpathe.com |date=2014-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; took this further by hanging from a burning rope hundreds of feet in the air. This type of escapology does fail, and its failures have resulted in escape artists getting hurt or losing their lives.  Others who have done this type of escape include [[Dorothy Dietrich]], [[Antony Britton]], Jonathon Bryce, and Mark Nelson "Markini The Worlds Youngest Professional Escape Artist" highlighted '''death by electrocution''' with his "Electrified Mummy Lid Torture Board". Escape was required in under 60 seconds or a fatal charge of electricity would be passed through the chains holding him to the board.
*'''Occult Escapology''' is a new style of escapology combining escapology with occult magick so that the escape is part of an occult ritual. This makes occult escapology a multidisciplinary subject needing skills in both areas. This style of escapology ranges on a continuum where at one extreme the occultism is the main focus (and consequently, simpler items may be utilized), whereas at the other end the element of escape predominates; however, aspects of both occultism and escapology are simultaneously present, not exclusively one or the other. This style was invented by occultist, author and occult escapologist [[S Rob]]. At the time of writing three of the books written by [[S Rob]] on occult escapology are at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.   
In 2012, Lucas Wilson, an illusionist from Canada managed the fastest ever recorded escape from a straitjacket while suspended; he escaped in 8.4 seconds while hanging upside down from his ankles at a height of 1m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|page=89|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
*''[[The Grim Game]],'' a [[1919 in film|1919 film]], stars [[Harry Houdini]] as a young man who is bound and imprisoned on numerous occasions by a gang who have kidnapped his fiancée. Considered by many as Houdini's best film. Lost for over 90 years and rediscovered in 2015 by escape artist and magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]].
*''Haldane of the Secret Service'' a 1924 film, Directed by and Starring [[Harry Houdini]], who is repeatedly restrained by villains who murdered his detective-father. Filmed at Beaver Kill Falls in [[Valatie]], NY.
*The novel ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay]],'' written by [[Michael Chabon]] and winner of the 2001 [[Pulitzer Prize]], features escapology as an important plot point.
*''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]],'' by [[E.L. Doctorow]], features [[Harry Houdini]] as a major character, and uses escapology as a metaphor for the struggles faced by the American immigrant.
*In American [[superhero]] [[comic book]]s, many superheroes like [[Batman]] are trained in escapology, which is invaluable when dealing with [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]]. However,  superheroes who are escapologists by profession include [[Mister Miracle]], [[Justice Machine|Ms. Liberty]] and [[The Escapist (character)|The Escapist]]. (Mister Miracle and The Escapist were both based on escapologist-turned-comic artist [[Jim Steranko]].) Houdini himself appeared as a time/space traveler in the comic book series ''Daring Escapes featuring Houdini.''
*The 1953 biographical film, ''[[Houdini (film)|Houdini]],'' starring [[Tony Curtis]] in the title role, depicted many of Houdini's escapology performances.  Curtis' performance artist character, The Great Leslie, also performs a suspended straight-jacket escape at the start of the film [[The Great Race]].
*In 1971, [[Christopher George]] played an escape artist named Cameron Steele in the TV movie/unsold series pilot, ''[[Escape (1971 film)|Escape]].'' Steele was a non-performing escapologist and night-club owner who, like [[Bill Bixby]]'s Anthony Blake (''[[The Magician (U.S. TV series)|The Magician]]''), habitually helped people in trouble.
*In 1982, [[Griffin O'Neal]] played a junior escapologist named Danny Masters in the film, ''The Escape Artist.''
*In 1983, real-life escape artist Bill Shirk played himself in a film called ''The Escapist.''
*Yorick, the main character of the comic book ''[[Y: The Last Man]],'' is an escape artist.
*In the 1991 film, ''[[The Linguini Incident]],'' [[Rosanna Arquette]] plays an aspiring escape artist.
*The novels ''[[Specific Gravity]]'' and ''[[Ontario Lacus]]'' by J. Matthew Neal (2007 and 2008) features a scientist who is also a master escape artist.
*[[Paul Adam (English novelist)|Paul Adam]]'s ''[[Escape from Shadow Island]],'' first published in 2009, features young escapologist [[Max Cassidy]]. Two further books in the series, ''[[Jaws of Death]]'' and ''[[Dead Man's Bay]],'' will be released in April 2011{{update after|2011|04|30}} and 2012 respectively.
*Adam Phillips's essay "[[Houdini's Box]]" uses Houdini himself, as well as a young victim of sexual abuse and other examples, to discuss escapology.
*The console video game [[EXIT (video game)|Exit]] focuses around the exploits of the self-proclaimed escapologist known as Mr. ESC.
*In the 2013 film, ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', [[Isla Fisher]] plays an escape artist named Henley Reeves. In an interview, she says, "I watched all of Houdini’s work and [[Dorothy Dietrich]], who is a female escapologist, who is amazing, you have to watch her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://collider.com/isla-fisher-now-you-see-me-interview/ |title=Isla Fisher Talks NOW YOU SEE ME, escapist tricks, the cast, and THE GREAT GATSBY |publisher=Collider |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I got to train with Dorothy Dietrich, the first lady magician to catch a bullet with her teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021005059_islafisherxml.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095646/http://seattletimes.com/html/movies/2021005059_islafisherxml.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher studied the life and work of Dietrich to prepare for the role. "Dorothy is a real female escapologist who is working today. She was the first woman to capture a bullet between her teeth, which is an amazing feat. She's not only good at misdirection, but she also connects emotionally with the audience, so she's better able to involve them in the stunts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coveringmedia.com/movie/2013/05/now-you-see-me.html |title=Now You See Me (2013) |publisher=Covering Media |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The definition of an extreme sport is not exact and the origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by [[marketing]] companies to promote the [[X Games]] and when the [[Extreme Sports Channel]] and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is  "a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/view/creators/Cohen=3ARhonda=3A=3A.html The relationship between personality, sensation seeking, reaction time and sport participation: evidence from drag racers, sport science students and archers].

While use of the term "extreme sport" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-athletes-told-me.html|title=What the Athletes Told Me|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are rarely sanctioned by schools.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than traditional sports&lt;ref name="americansportsdata.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |title='Generation Y' drives increasingly popular... |date=August 1, 2002 |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams). In addition, beginning extreme athletes tend to work on their craft without the guidance of a coach (though some may hire a coach later).

Activities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional [[sport]]s due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.

In a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for [[snowboard]]ers, rock and ice quality for [[climbing|climbers]], and wave height and shape for [[surfing|surfers]].

Whilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jungmin Lee (2004), [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ecm/nasm04/122.html Extreme Sports Evaluation: Evidence from Judging Figure Skating, Econometric Society]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2006/06/19/DI2006061900992.html|title='Adrenaline': Extreme Sports|accessdate=2008-07-11 | work=The Washington Post | first1=Jon | last1=Wile | first2=Sonny | last2=Amato | date=2006-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.

==Classification==
While the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tomlinson, Joe |title=Extreme Sports: In Search of the Ultimate Thrill |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=1-55297-992-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument is that to qualify as an "extreme sport" '''both''' expression terms need to be fulfilled;
* "'''sport'''": The participant has to dispose of considerable skill and/or physical ability to avoid ''poor execution of the activity'';
* "'''extreme'''": ''poor execution of the activity'' has to result in considerable risk of serious physical harm to the participant;

Along this definition, an activity such as [[bungee jumping]] may not qualify as no skill or physical ability is required to execute a good jump (i.e., avoid poor execution). A passenger in a canyon [[jet boat]] ride will not fulfill the requirements, as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. "[[Thrill seeking]]" might in these cases be a more suitable qualification than "extreme sport".{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Extreme sports may be subdivided into:

===Extreme vehicle sports===

These sports require the use of  snow, ice or water sports ("sports de glisse" in French) and '''rolling''' sports. Another subdivision can be made along '''motorized''' and '''non motorized''' vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;{{cn|date=July 2018}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Gliding !! Rolling
|-
| '''Motorized''' || [[Offshore powerboat racing]], [[Wakeboarding]], [[Water skiing]], [[Air racing]], [[Gliding]] || [[Motorcycle racing]], [[Rallying]], [[Motocross]]
|-
| '''Non-motorized''' || [[Surfing]], [[Windsurfing]], [[Kitesurfing|Kiteboarding]], [[Extreme skiing]], [[Snowboarding]], [[Parachuting]], [[Wingsuit]], [[Sailing]]&lt;br /&gt;
 || [[Skateboarding]], [[Mountain biking]], [[Mountain boarding]], [[BMX racing]], [[Freestyle scootering]], [[Freestyle BMX]], [[Aggressive inline skating]] &lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;

===Extreme non-vehicle sports===

No vehicle is required ([[rock climbing]], [[canyoning]], [[ice climbing]], [[parkour]], [[psicobloc]] etc.){{cn|date=August 2018}}

== History ==

[[File:ExtremeSports3.png|right|thumb|upright=2]]

The origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to [[Ernest Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq#threesports |title=Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203013838/http://www.timelesshemingway.com/content/quotationsfaq |archivedate=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed "games". The phrase may have been invented by either writer [[Barnaby Conrad]] or automotive author [[Ken Purdy]].&lt;ref name="Ernest Hemingway FAQ part 5"/&gt;

The [[Dangerous Sports Club]] of [[Oxford University]], [[England]] was founded by [[David Kirke (bungee jumper)|David Kirke]], Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and [[Alan Weston]]. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day [[bungee jumping]], by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol, England]]. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the [[Royal Gorge]] Suspension Bridge in [[Colorado]], sponsored by and televised on the popular [[United States|American]] television program ''[[That's Incredible!]]'' [[Bungee jumping]] was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.
The Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London [[double-decker bus]], wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.

Other Club activities included expedition [[hang gliding]] from active [[volcano]]es; the launching of giant (60&amp;nbsp;ft) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre ([[zorbing]]); [[microlight]] flying; and [[BASE jumping]] (in the early days of this sport).

In recent decades the term ''extreme sport'' was further promoted after the [[Extreme Sports Channel]], Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |title=extreme sports |year=2007 |publisher=[[Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023120444/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-364109.html |archivedate=2008-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15836448.html |title=Generation Ex – the Extreme Games, a competition for people with exceptional athletic talents |year=1994 |author=Josh Krulewitz |work=American Fitness |via=[[HighBeam]]|subscription=yes |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Mount Snow]], and [[Vermont]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia |title=Extreme Sports – Encarta |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwc2bMeg?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589555/Extreme_Sports.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutXGames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |title=About International X Games |year=2002 |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |accessdate=2008-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829202819/http://expn.go.com/intl/s/about.html |archivedate=2008-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, [[windsurfing]] was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a [[surfing|surfboard]] with a [[Sailing|sailing boat's]] propulsion system (mast and sail). [[Kitesurfing]] on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of [[kite buggying]] (a [[parafoil]]) with the bi-directional boards used for [[wakeboarding]]. [[Wakeboarding]] is in turn derived from [[snowboarding]] and [[waterskiing]].

== Marketing ==
[[File:Hanggliding03042006.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hang glider]] launching from [[Mount Tamalpais]]]]
Some contend&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DD133DF93BA35751C0A96E958260 "Extreme Sport, Extreme Chic, Extreme Hype"], ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform [[stunt]]s (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.

== Motivation ==
[[File:Snowboarder cornice at sugarbowl.jpg|right|thumb|Snowboarder drops off a cornice.]]
A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an [[adrenaline]] rush in participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |date=August 1, 2002 |title='Generation Y' Drives Increasingly Popular... |publisher=AmericanSportsData.com |accessdate=2008-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162957/http://www.americansportsdata.com/dev/pr-extremeactionsports.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[endorphin]]s and [[serotonin]] because of the high level of physical exertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konkel|first1=Lindsey|title=Extreme Psychology|url=http://scienceline.org/2009/07/health-konkel-extreme-sports-risk-psychology/|website=ScienceLine.org|publisher=New York University|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric and Gray, Tonia, ''Extreme Sports: A Challenge to Phenomenology''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.

Eric Brymer&lt;ref&gt;Brymer, Eric, ''Extreme Dude: A Phenomenological Perspective on the Extreme sports experience ''. University of Wollongong, Australia, 2005 {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721115425/http://www.library.uow.edu.au/adt-NWU/public/adt-NWU20060508.145406/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their [[comfort zone]] and are often done in conjunction with [[adventure travel]].

Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and [[ice climbing]] have spawned publicly recognizable names such as [[Edmund Hillary]], [[Chris Bonington]], [[Wolfgang Güllich]] and more recently [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]]. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Mortality==
[[File:Wingsuit-01.jpg|thumb|[[Wingsuit flying]] is a recent activity.]]
Extreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in these sports has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.philly.com/2013-02-03/sports/36723401_1_extreme-sports-snowmobile-backflip |title = In extreme sports, the X-factor is death |last = Smallwood |first = John |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://money.msn.com/now/post.aspx?post=1ef3fc34-dc7b-4421-974f-d3b7b37e8006 |title = Recent deaths draw attention to extreme sports |last = Kennedy |first = Bruce |accessdate= 11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disabled community==
Disabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.{{Advert inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Adaptive-Sports.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Adaptive Action Sports - Amy Purdy"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/x-games.html|title=''Ability Magazine: X Games - Adaptive Sports"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==
Extreme sports is a sub-category of sports than are described as any kind of sport "of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/14931/|title = A Phenomenological Investigation of the Experience of Taking Part in 'Extreme Sports'|last = Willig|first = Carla|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105307082459|pmid = |access-date =|volume=13|pages=690–702}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/55275/|title = Extreme sports are good for your health: A phenomenological understanding of fear and anxiety in extreme sport.|author1=Brymer, E. |author2= Schweitzer, R. |last-author-amp=yes |date = 2013 |origyear=2012|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|doi = 10.1177/1359105312446770|pmid = |access-date = |volume=18 |pages=477–487}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health.

Health is an individual's state of mental and physical well-being in which they are maximising their daily potential. It is divided into two main categories: mental and physical.

Mental health is a cognitive state of well-being, in this state the individual is aware of his or how own potential and is able to; cope with stresses of normal life and work productively, as well as willing to give their contribution to his or her community in a beneficial way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/mental_health/en/|title = Mental Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical health can be defined as a state of complete physical well-being in which an individual is mechanically fit to perform their daily activities and duties without any problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/social_care_and_health/health_advice/physical_health.aspx|title = Physical Health|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = X-games: Are you equipped for the extreme? (high-risk sports).|last = Globus|first = S|date = 1997|journal = Current Health 2|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a very powerful hormone as it can cause human beings to perform tremendous stunts of many sorts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Finding Serenity: Anti-heroes, Lost Shepherds and Space Hookers in Joss Whedon's Firefly''''' is a compilation of essays edited by [[Jane Espenson]] with Glenn Yeffeth. The book was released in late 2004 following the cancellation of the television show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''. Jane Espenson was a writer for the show and the book contains a series of essays that discuss the show from a variety of viewpoints, some scholarly, others with a comedic note.

As well as answering unresolved plotlines and character arcs, the compilation includes insight into the filming of each episode with actress [[Jewel Staite]] (who played the role of [[Kaylee Frye]] on the show) providing a commentary on each of the episodes produced. Due to ''Firefly'''s early demise it left viewers with unanswered questions and a certain sense of loss. The essays attempt to resolve the unanswered questions brought up in the show, ranging from the origin of the [[Reaver (Firefly)|Reavers]], the multi-racial casting, and the use of the Chinese language. Some essays are [[existentialist]], seeking to define what freedom meant for each member of the crew, a theme that [[Joss Whedon]] seemed to be exploring. Others focus on the changing nature of sexual relationships in Whedon's vision of the future.

It was followed by '''''Serenity Found: More Unauthorized Essays on Joss Whedon's Firefly Universe''''' in November 2007 by the same editor, including contributions by actor [[Nathan Fillion]] ([[Malcolm Reynolds]] in the series) and science-fiction author [[Orson Scott Card]].

The '''G7 Teams''' or '''G7 Federation''' is an association of professional [[esports]] teams.&lt;ref name="game boys"&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Boys: Triumph, Heartbreak, and the Quest for Cash in the Battleground of Competitive Videogaming|last=Kane|first=Michael|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=T.L.|author-link1=T.L. Taylor|title=Raising the Stakes|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally formed by seven teams: [[4Kings]], [[fnatic]], [[Made in Brazil (e-sports)|Made in Brazil]], [[mousesports]], [[Ninjas in Pyjamas]], [[SK Gaming]] and [[List of Championship Gaming Series teams#3D.NY|Team 3D]].&lt;ref&gt;Founding teams: [http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/story/32257/?spage=2 gotfrag.com: LAUNCH OF G7 FEDERATION]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the organization is made up of six members. The organization aims to promote the interest of the community and players to tournament organizers, sponsors, and other professional gaming institutions. The G7 teams have active presence in the advisory boards for both the [[World Series of Video Games]] and [[KODE5]], and has relations with other tournament organizations, including the [[Cyberathlete Professional League]], along with its players committee, and the [[Electronic Sports World Cup]]. The G7 teams also recognized in [[Zonerank]] as the official world e-Sports rankings. In 2010, after a contract dispute between [[fnatic]] and [[SK Gaming]], the organization dissolved.

In various [[jurisdiction]]s, the '''gambling age''' is the minimum age which one can [[gambling|gamble]]. In some countries, gambling is illegal for all people regardless of age, so a minimum age does not exist. In other countries, there are different age limits for different types of gambling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10590">The '''Golden Snowball Award''' is an annual award presented to the city in [[Upstate New York]] that receives the most snowfall in a season. The original award was the result of a friendly competition of [[National Weather Service]] offices in Upstate. It was originally conceived after the [[Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977]]. After the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] offices closed in the mid-1990s, the competition died out.

The award was revived during the 2002–2003 snowfall season, in which Syracuse won. It had won every year from then through the 2010–2011 season as well. In the 2011–2012 season, Rochester was the first city other than Syracuse to win since the award's revival. Binghamton won the award for the 2016-17 season. The prize is accompanied by a ceremonial [[US Dollar|$]]100 check to one of that city's school's hat and mitten drives. They also receive temporary possession of a trophy for the year. The original competition's trophy went missing, prompting its replacement with a new one donated by a trophy shop in Syracuse. The current Golden Snowball trophy resides in [[Syracuse City Hall]].

Compared to Syracuse's average snowfall of 123.8 inches, or over 10 feet per year, [[New York City]]'s annual snow average is a relatively small 2–3 feet per year in the city and about 3–4 feet per year in nearby suburbs. This is due to a number of factors, including lower latitude and oceanic influence keeping much of the precipitation as rain in the winter, combined with distance from the Great Lakes keeping the city well away from the influence of [[lake-effect snow]].  For the first time ever, during the 2005–2006 winter season New York City did have more snowfall than [[Albany, New York|Albany]], mainly due to the [[North_American_blizzard_of_2006|Blizzard of 2006]], which was the city's biggest snowfall to date, while Albany was on the extreme northern fringe.

The cities that compete for the award are:

* [[Albany, New York|Albany]]
* [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]
* [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]
* [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]
* [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]

Until the 2006–2007 season, several smaller cities also competed for a smaller award, that includes a $50 check. These are:

* [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton]]
* [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]]
* [[Utica, New York|Utica]]
* [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4827">'''Harry May Hemsley''' ([[Swindon]], 14 December 1877 - 5 April 1951) was an English music hall and radio comedian. He is best known as the host of the popular radio show ''[[Ovaltiney's Concert Party]]'' on [[Radio Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=wAEk9veAhpAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Elsie,+Winnie+and+Johnny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iSg0vT8yDV&amp;sig=bAMZVF7Z9c1JOI7RRGMQLvzomMw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEhJC42uTZAhWBKcAKHclzAbM4ChDoAQg1MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Elsie%2C%20Winnie%20and%20Johnny&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Harry Hemsley was born in 1877 in [[Swindon, Wiltshire|Swindon]], Wiltshire.&lt;ref&gt;http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827&lt;/ref&gt; He started acting at age eight, when his father, a scenic artist had him perform on stage. In the 1890s he was a cartoonist for the British comics magazine ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827&lt;/ref&gt; He performed as [[bass-baritone]] singer in the [[minstrel show]] ''White Coons''. In 1905 Hemsley started acting in the [[music hall]] stage show ''The Follies'' with his familiar act of impersonating children's voices.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/harry-hemsley-child-impersonator-british-radio&lt;/ref&gt; He did this by covering his mouth with a book, newspaper or just his hand to signal a transition. His imitations were so spot-on that later, when he went on radio, many listeners were fooled.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/harry-hemsley-child-impersonator-british-radio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827
&lt;/ref&gt; He also did celebrity voice impressions, among them of actor [[Wilson Barrett]].&lt;ref&gt;http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
In December 1934 Hemsley presented the weekly radio show ''[[Ovaltiney's Concert Party]]'' on [[Radio Luxembourg]], a show which ran until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/harry-hemsley-child-impersonator-british-radio&lt;/ref&gt;
The show featured Hemsley in a series of sketches where he impersonated "his" four children Johnny, Elsie, Winnie and baby Horace, in varying falsetto voices in comic dialogues with Hemsley as "daddy". The fourth child, the baby Horace, was perpetually unintelligible, and had to be interpreted by his elder sister Winnie. This led to Hemsley's familiar [[catchphrase]]:
"What did Horace say, ...?" &lt;ref&gt;Karl Williams  2015 [http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827 Vintage British Comedy - Harry Hemsley]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge '' A Dictionary of Catch Phrases'' 2003 - {{ISBN|1134929994}} Page 511 "What did Horace say, ... comes 'from Harry Hemsley's music-hall turn in the 1940s, in which he 'did' the voice of a whole family of children, the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Theatrephile'' Issues 5-8 -1984  p 60 "Hemsley's imaginary family began with two, grew to three, and trihumphed finally with four, with the birth of his crowning achievement, Baby Horace. ... hearts out, on would come Harry Hemsley with this week's adventure of Elsie, Winnie and Johnny (interrupted only by the Secret ... and translated into English by little Winnie, thus giving the listening world the famous catchphrase, 'What did Horace say?"&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional family featured on [[Ovaltiney's Concert Party]] on [[Radio Luxembourg]] from 1934 to 1939.

The show was so popular at the time that it spawned a [[comic magazine]], in which comics based on the radio characters were drawn by Harry Hemsley &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=wAEk9veAhpAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Elsie,+Winnie+and+Johnny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iSg0vT8yDV&amp;sig=bAMZVF7Z9c1JOI7RRGMQLvzomMw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEhJC42uTZAhWBKcAKHclzAbM4ChDoAQg1MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Harry%20Hemsley&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and S. K. Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/perkins_sk.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
After World War II Hemsley made other radio shows like ''[[Old Hearty]]'' (1947) and ''[[Hemsley's Hotel]]'' (1949).  He lived long enough to appear on early television too.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=wAEk9veAhpAC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Elsie,+Winnie+and+Johnny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iSg0vT8yDV&amp;sig=bAMZVF7Z9c1JOI7RRGMQLvzomMw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEhJC42uTZAhWBKcAKHclzAbM4ChDoAQg1MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Harry%20Hemsley&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
He died in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;http://stanbutler5.moonfruit.com/harry-hemsley/4587588827

'''Jerudong Park''' is an [[amusement park]] in [[Jerudong]], [[Brunei-Muara District]], [[Brunei]]. It is the largest and most expensive amusement park in [[Southeast Asia]], built and funded by the [[Politics of Brunei|Bruneian government]] for $1 billion.

During its first few years of operation, the park was completely free, with no admission fees and free rides. In 2009, it was reported that the number of visitors and tourists had dropped significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/international_business/2008/01/01/restore_jerudong_park_to_its_former_glory|title='Restore Jerudong Park to its former glory' |publisher=[[The Brunei Times]] |accessdate=2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owners introduced{{when|date=September 2018}} a one-time B$15 admission fee and a ride ticketing system.

Currently, the theme park has reduced its footprint to Phase 1 and 2, the original Playground.  It has revised its ride admission with a new ticket card system. The park is once again free entry to the general public with a fee to use a ride or other attraction. An $8 ticket card has 4 slots and 1 free slot (effectively allowing one guest to use 5 rides/attractions - or 2 guests to use two rides with one extra). The $10 ticket card has 5 slots plus 3 free slots (which means a guest can use 8 rides attractions and so on).

The concert, part of his [[HIStory World Tour]], was in celebration of the 50th birthday of [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], the Sultan of Brunei, and was attended by the Brunei royal family, though the Sultan himself did not attend. Jackson returned to perform another show on New Year's Eve 1996.

On August 24, 1996, singer [[Whitney Houston]] performed at the park for the wedding of [[Princess Rashidah]], the eldest daughter of the Sultan of Brunei. She was reportedly paid $7 million to perform for this event. Media stories on the Brunei royal family indicated that [[Prince Jefri]] gave Houston a [[blank check]] for the event and instructed her to fill it out for what she felt she was worth.

[[Janet Jackson]] performed a private concert during her [[Velvet Rope Tour]] to celebrate the twenty-first birthday of [[Princess Hamidah]] of the Brunei royal family. An exclusive audio recording of the show was issued to all those in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Janet-Jackson-With-Special-Guests-All-Saints-The-21st-Birthday-Celebration-For-Princess-Hamidah/release/4281943|title=Janet Jackson With Special Guests All Saints - The 21st Birthday Celebration For Princess Hamidah (CD) at Discogs|work=Discogs|accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, the company began to implement a revitalization program. It started with the re-launching of the GIGGLES, their in-house entertainment team. The team is composed of seven entertainers from the Philippines. In December, management began a special program on the weekends featuring local artists as the main performers. The program attracted more than 6,000 people on a single evening.

In 2007, the Park became the venue for a series of activities called Kids' Day. Although the main target was children, it drew families as well because of the "family" factor - the games involved adults such as moms and dads as well. The GIGGLES also began appearing regularly during activities at the Mall and around the country at shopping centers. By the end of 2007, the Giggles had made appearances in schools, public events, and party functions.

In late 2008, JPCC launched its Family Concert Nights (later renamed "Local is Best - Family Entertainment Night") featuring local talent. The program's goals are to entice local artists to perform and create an audience for their music. The shows are reviewed and approved by a Censorship Board.

On December 12, 2009, JPCC Management introduced a new ticket system. Entrance to the Playground was made free, and guests who wanted to use the attractions had the option to buy an $8 "4 plus 1 ride" ticket, and a $10 "5 plus 3 ride" ticket.

By the end of 2010, attendance to the park was up to 144,000 people annually. This figures are based on the actual park admittance and ticket sales.

The park underwent an extensive remodel in 2011. The park was reopened on March 19, 2011 with new attractions including bumper cars and boats, trains, and scooters. That month also saw a record high of over 70,000 visitors.

'''Joke chess problems''' are puzzles in [[chess]] that use [[humor]] as a primary or secondary element. Although most chess problems, like other creative forms, are appreciated for serious artistic themes ([[Grimshaw (chess)|Grimshaw]], [[Novotny (chess)|Novotny]], and [[Lacny]]), joke chess problems are enjoyed for some twist. In some cases the composer plays a trick to prevent a solver from succeeding with typical analysis. In other cases, the humor derives from an unusual final position. Unlike in ordinary [[chess puzzle]]s, joke problems can involve a solution which violates the inner logic or rules of the game.

| White to move, mate in 6. Can it be stopped?
}}
Some chess puzzles are not really puzzles at all. In the diagram, White is asked to [[checkmate]] Black in six moves. The joke in this case is that, by the rules of chess, White has no choice in the matter: the only legal moves available lead directly to the "solution":
:'''1. d4 b5 2. d5 b4 3. axb4 a3 4. b5 a2 5. b6 a1=any 6. b7{{chessAN|#}}'''

[[Tim Krabbé]] provides other examples on his chess website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_14.htm Examples] &amp;ndash; see items 276, 267, and 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess==

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|Mate in 1
}}
The [[rules of chess]] are fairly simple and clearly defined. Nevertheless, some composers have relied on ambiguities in the rules to create humorous puzzles. A typical example would be the position shown in the diagram on the right. According to chess legend, a composer stipulated "White mates in one move." It appears to be impossible, and now is, but formerly the color of the promoted piece was not specified, and the "solution" was for White to promote to a ''black'' knight on b8, thus depriving the black [[king (chess)|king]] of its only [[flight square|escape square]].

|Mate in 3
}}
A more sophisticated example was composed by [[Tim Krabbé]] and relied on a loophole that existed in the definition of [[castling]]. In the diagram, White must mate in three moves. The solution begins '''1. e7''', then the main variations are:

{{unordered list|style=list-style-position:inside
|'''1... Kd3 2. e8{{=}}Q gxf3''' (other moves allow Qe2#) '''3. 0-0-0#'''
|'''1... Kxf3 2. e8{{=}}R{{chesspunc|!}}''' (an [[underpromotion]]), and now: 
||'''2... d4 3. 0-0#'''
||'''2... Kg2 3. 0-0-0-0#!'''
}}

In the last variation, White castles with his newly promoted [[rook (chess)|rook]], moving his king to e3 and the rook to e2. Under the rules of chess at the time, this move was arguably legal because the rook had not moved yet. Afterward, FIDE amended the rules to require that the castling rook must occupy the same ''rank'' as the king.

==Unusual piece placement or movement==

Some problems are notable for extremely unusual patterns of piece placement. For example, direct mates and especially [[helpmate]]s have been composed with the pieces in the shape of a letter or number, or even a tree.

===The "back home task"===
{{Chess diagram

|  |  |  |ql|  |  |  |

|kd|rd|  |  |bl|kl|  |pl
|  |  |  |  |rl|  |  |  
| Selfmate in 8
}}
A more interesting example occurs in this 1st Prize winner by Kirtley, where the final position echoes a familiar pattern. Krabbé calls this problem the "back home task", as all eight white pieces retreat to their initial positions. He writes that "Strategy and deep themes are absent, Black only has forced moves, but it's one of the funniest chess problems I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_15.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 289&lt;/ref&gt; White must [[selfmate]] in eight moves; i.e., he must force Black to checkmate White against Black's will. The solution is:
:{{pad|1.5em}}'''1. Nb1+ Kb3 2. Qd1+ Rc2 3. Bc1 axb6 4. Ra1 b5 5. Rh1 bxc4 6. Ke1 c3 7. Ng1 f3 8. Bf1 f2#'''

===The "caterpillar theme"===
{{Chess diagram

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|rl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  
| Mate in 6
}}
Krabbé named the "caterpillar theme" for problems and studies where doubled or tripled pawns move one after the other. The diagram at the right shows a particularly silly example, with White forcing mate in six moves. The solution is:
:'''1. Bb1 b2 2. Ra2 b3 3. Ra3 b4 4. Ra4 b5 5. Ra5 b6 6. Be4#

Krabbé wrote a whole article on the caterpillar theme, citing about ten examples.&lt;ref&gt;The article is not available via direct link, but it can be downloaded on the archives at http://www.chesscafe.com/ (krabbe08.pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chess diagram

|rl|  |  |  |kl|  |  |  
| Mate in 8
}}
The American composer William A. Shinkman (1847–1933) is famous for composing the problem in the diagram, with sextupled pawns on the a-file.  As Krabbé writes on his website, "The solution, as it should be in a joke, is not difficult: '''1. 0-0-0 Kxa7 2. Rd8 Kxa6 3. Rd7 Kxa5 4. Rd6 Kxa4 5. Rd5 Kxa3 6. Rd4 Kxa2 7. Rd3 Ka1 8. Ra3#'''".&lt;ref name="kuwait-immortal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/kuwait.htm |title=The Kuwait Immortal |publisher=Xs4all.nl |accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem is "{{chessgloss|cook|cooked}}" (ruined, in the lingo of chess composition), however, because 1.Kd2 also forces mate in eight moves. But this problem was not intended to be a sound mate in eight, and was instead intended to be a [[proof game]] in 34 moves with seven consecutive captures by Black.&lt;ref name="kuwait-immortal"/&gt;
{{clear}}

==Humour in more traditional chess problems==
Humour is a component of some traditional themes, such as [[grotesque (chess)|grotesque]] and [[Excelsior (chess problem)|Excelsior]].

In 2004, Hans Böhm sponsored a chess composing tournament for humorous [[endgame study|endgame studies]]. The top two entries appear with solutions on Krabbé's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_15.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timkr.home.xs4all.nl/chess2/diary_14.htm Open chess diary] &amp;ndash; see item 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-chess chess problems==
{{Chess diagram

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
| White to play
}}
In this kind of problem, although the problem is posed as a standard chess problem, the solution has nothing to do with chess moves. An example is this problem composed by British composer [[Thomas Rayner Dawson]]. In the position in the diagram, Black had decided to resign (although it wasn't his turn). White advised his opponent not to give up so quickly. "But I am bound to lose, and there is nothing I—or you, for that matter—can do", said Black. But White insisted: "I'll bet you $100 that I can lose this game!" So the two made the bet and White actually lost. He did not resign, lose on time, or anything like that. How did he lose?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/chessbase-chrismas-puzzles-2014-solutions-2|title=ChessBase Chrismas Puzzles 2014 – solutions|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution is in the words: White did not lose the game (which is impossible in the diagram position, as the only legal moves are 1.g7+ Qxg7+ 2.hxg7#), but rather the bet.

[[Image:Thoranayudham- Madras1.jpg|Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] and his troupe performing ''Thoranayudham'' (part of [[Bhasa]]'s play ''Abhiṣeka Nataka'' based on the epic [[Ramayana]]) Koodiyattam (1962, Chennai). It was the first ever Koodiyattam performance outside Kerala.|thumb|right|300px]] 
'''Koodiyattam''' ({{lang-ml|കൂടിയാട്ടം}}), also transliterated as '''Kutiyattam''', is a traditional performing artform in the state of [[Kerala]], India. It is a combination of ancient [[Sanskrit theatre]] with elements of [[Koothu]], a Tamil/Malayalam performing art which is as old as [[Sangam era]]. It is officially recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].

==Origin==

Koothu (കൂത്തു് கூத்து) means dance or performance in [[Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. [[Image:Koodiyattam Framed 001.jpg|thumb|alt=Koodiyattam Performance.|''Koodiyattam'']]
Koodiyattam (kutiyattam), meaning "combined acting" as it combines dramas in Sanskrit theatre with elements of traditional Koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as ''Koothambalams'' of Kerala. It is the only surviving artform that uses dramas from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has an attested history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origin and evolution are shrouded in mystery. Koodiyattam and chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and chakyar koothu originates from ancient south Indian artform Koothu which is mentioned several times in ancient sangam literature of south and also in the epigraphs belonging to subsequent Pallava, Chera, Chola periods. Inscriptions related to the dramatized dance worship services known as  Koothu are available in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services alongside the singing of tevaram and prabandam hymns. There are mentions in epigraphs those forms of Koothu that are called ''aariyam'' when they use languages other than Tamil such as [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] or [[Prakrit]] for plays.

Several ancient kings and members of other professions are listed to have authored several works for these services. There is evidence of these services being done all over ancient subcontinent during time of cholas and pallavas. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring a play called ''kailasodharanam'' in Tamil that has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva's anger and being subdued mercilessly for the same. For examples a fragmented inscription at the door step of an ancient Shiva temple (now non-existent) in Pegan in Burma finds mention of these services.

It is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of Chera dynasty, who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern [[Kodungallur]]), reformed Koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring presentation of the play to well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, ''Subhadraharana'' and ''Tapatisamvarana'' and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a [[Brahmin]] friend called Tolan. These plays are still presented on stage. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include Ascaryacudamani of Saktibhadra, Kalyanasaugandhika of Nilakantha, Bhagavadajjuka of [[Bodhayana]], ''Nagananda of Harsa'', and many plays ascribed to [[Bhasa]] including  Abhiseka and Pratima. The Kutiyattam performance was performed in specially designed temples called koothambalams.

The use of Buddhist themes for plays is a very controversial and moot issue and seem to be a later interpolation not existing since ancient times for the latter not being a then-legal vedic system.

== Instruments used ==
[[Image:Mizhavu.jpg|Mizhavu kept in ''mizhavana'' (wooden box made especially to keep mizhavu).|thumb|left|200px]]
Traditionally,  the main musical instruments used in Koodiyattam are [[mizhavu]], [[kuzhitalam]], [[edakka]], [[kurumkuzhal]], and [[Conch (instrument)|sankhu]]. Mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi)|Nambiar caste]], accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).

== Performance style ==

[[Image:Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana.jpg|Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] as ''Ravana'' in Kutiyattam.|thumb|right|150px]]
[[File:Nangyar Koothu - Koodiyattam By Dr Indu G 2.JPG|thumb|Koodiyattam Character Subhadra in Subhadra Dhananjayam, Performed by Dr Indu G at Nepathya's Koothambalam, Moozhikkulam]]
Traditionally, Koodiyattam has been performed by [[Chakyar]]s (a [[Indian caste system|subcaste]] of Kerala [[Hindu]]s) and by [[Nangyaramma]] (women of the [[Ambalavasi]] [[Nambiar (Ambalavasi/Mizhavu)|Nambiar caste]]). The name Koodiyattam, meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence or more actors on stage who act in consonance with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shulman|first=David|title=Creating and Destroying the Universe in Twenty-Nine Nights|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/nov/24/creating-and-destroying-universe-twenty-nine-night/|accessdate=9 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic Koothu and Koodiyattam inside the temple or in the Koothambalam. Chakyar women, [[Illotammas]], are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are lengthy and elaborate affairs, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the ''purappadu'' where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the ''nirvahanam'' where the actor, using [[abhinaya]], brings to the audience the mood of the main character of the play. The ''nirvahanam'', a retrospective, takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is ''koodiyattam'' which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, Koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/theatre/article3631143.ece|title= All at home |publisher=''The Hindu'', 13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was that elders of the Chakyar community taught it to their youngsters and it was an art form performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955 Guru [[Mani Madhava Chakyar]] performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; For performing the art forms outside the temples he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words:

{{quote|My own people condemned my action (performing Koothu and Kutiyattam outside the precincts of the temples), Once, after I had given performances at Vaikkom, they even thought about excommunicating me.

I desired that this art should survive the test of time. That was precisely why I ventured outside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;''Mani Madhava Chakkyar: The Master at Work'', K.N. Panikar, Sangeet Natak Akademi New Delhi, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1962, under the leadership of Dr. V. Raghavan, noted art and Sanskrit scholar, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras, invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform Kutiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history Kutiyattam was performed outside Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;

In early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at [[Banaras Hindu University]] came to study Kootiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru's home at [[Killikkurussimangalam]] and studied the art form in traditional [[Gurukula]] way.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

*[[Ammannur Madhava Chakyar]]. In the 1980s, he became one of the first Koodiyattam performers to present this art to an international audience.
*Mani Madhava Chakkiar's disciple and nephew [[Mani Damodara Chakyar]] is also a Koodiyattam performer of traditional devotional Koodiyattams.

== A dying art form ==
Koodiyattam has traditionally been an exclusive art form performed in special venues called ''koothambalams'' in Hindu temples and access to these performances were highly restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances are lengthy taking up to forty 
days to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala led to a curtailment in the patronage extended to Koodiyattam artistes and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a severe crisis in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00010 |title= Kutiyattam, Sanskrit theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has called for the creation of a network of Koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to nurture the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. The Margi Theatre Group in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is a notable organisation dedicated to the revival of [[Kathakali]] and Koodiyattom in [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.margitheatre.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Nepathya(Koodiyattam)|Nepathya]] is an exclusive institution to promote Koodiyattam and related art forms working at Moozhikkulam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/koodiyattom-festival-begins-at-moozhikulam/article3702197.ece&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, awarded the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]], the highest award for performing artists, to Kutiyattam artists like, [[Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri]] (2007), [[Painkulam Raman Chakyar]] (2010) and  Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/awardeeslist.htm |title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees |publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331060603/http://www.sangeetnatak.gov.in/sna/awardeeslist.htm |archivedate=31 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2848">'''Lawrence Carra''' (1909&amp;mdash; March 30, 2006) was an [[Americans|American]] [[professor]] of [[drama]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], USA. He was a director of theater and television as well as a mentor to hundreds of actors and directors.

Carra (pronounced cuh-RAH) was born in Salina, [[Italy]]. His parents immigrated to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1912, where they started a grocery business. One of his high school teachers arranged for a full scholarship to [[Harvard University]], where he studied biology. He was active in the Harvard drama club and graduated in 1931.

He attended medical school in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] for one year, but his passion for theater caused him to return to the States and to enroll in [[Yale University]]'s drama school, from which he graduated in 1935. At Yale he was a research assistant for Professor Alexander Dean on the first edition of his classic textbook ''The Fundamentals of Play Directing''. Carra assumed the role of co-author after Dean's death in 1939. More than sixty years later, the book is in its fifth edition and still is widely used in colleges.

Carra taught directing at [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] before joining the drama school of Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon University, in 1947. He eventually became the department chairman.

His directing students at CMU included [[William Ball (stage director)|William Ball]], founder of [[American Conservatory Theatre]]; [[Steven Bochco]], creator of the hit TV series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''[[LA Law]]'', and ''[[NYPD Blue]]''; [[Mel Shapiro]], who co-wrote and directed the musical adaptation of ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' on Broadway; and [[John-Michael Tebelak]], creator of the popular musical ''[[Godspell]]''.

He died at age 97 on March 30, 2006 at his [[Squirrel Hill]] home in Pittsburgh and is buried at [[Homewood Cemetery]].

'''Improvisational theatre companies''', also known as '''improv troupes''' or '''improv groups''', are the primary practitioners of [[improvisational theater]]. Modern companies exist around the world and at a range of skill levels. Most groups make little or no money, while a few, well-established groups are profitable.

Although improvisational theater has existed in some form or another since the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gordon, ''Lazzi: The Comic Routines of the Commedia dell'Arte'' 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-933826-69-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern improv began with the teachings of [[Viola Spolin]] in Chicago, Illinois, USA and [[Keith Johnstone]] during the 1940-50s in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Improvisation for the Theater {{ISBN|0-8101-4008-X}} (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddick, Grant. "Keith Johnstone," Theatre 100. Calgary: [[Alberta Playwrights Network]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Spolin's teachings led to the creation of [[The Compass Players]], the first modern improvisational theater company, in 1955. The presence of [[The Compass Players]], [[The Second City]], and [[ImprovOlympic]] in Chicago created a strength in the form within the city that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David (September 3, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/03/arts/03impr.html "In Chicago, Honoring Athletes of Improv"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved January 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[Toronto]] are other major hubs of improvisational theater in the [[North America]].

Many companies host [[List of improvisational theater festivals|improvisational theatre festivals]] or give improvisational theatre classes. Professional groups often perform a regular stage show acted by the most senior members. Along with this, they host "house" improv teams made up of improv students or graduates from their classes. In the past decade, professional improvisational theater groups have gradually started working more with corporate clients, using improvisational games to improve productivity and communication in the workplace.

'''Major Professional''' companies have branches in more than one city, have touring groups, and/or host large-scale improvisational comedy schools. '''Professional''' troupes are those not affiliated with a [[university]] or [[secondary school]]. '''Collegiate''' groups are those associated with a post-secondary educational institution. If a company performs more than one type of improvisational comedy, they are defined as using '''Multiple''' improvisational comedy types. If it is unclear what particular kind of improvisational comedy a group performs, they are defined as '''Improvisational'''. Those marked '''Semi-improvisational''' generally perform shows that are partially improvised and partially scripted.

The following is a '''list of noteworthy improvisational theatre companies'''&lt;ref group="nb" name="noteworthy"/&gt; from around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12496">'''Minimates''' are a block-styled miniature [[action figure]] originally created by Art Asylum in 2002 and now released by [[Diamond Select Toys]]. The basic Minimate figure design has a 2" tall body that resembles an extremely simplified human form with 14 points of [[joint|articulation]], higher than average for block figures. Released in both specialty stores as well as mass-market retailers, Minimates are made for both kid-friendly and adult-oriented properties, giving them a diverse fan base. The best-known and longest-running series of Minimates is based on [[Marvel Comics]], with over 60 waves of figures in existence, but lines of Minimates have been released for numerous other comic books, TV series, movies and video games.

==History==
[[Image:Spider pack03.png|left|frame|200px|2" Spider-Man Minimate in early Marvel Minimate packaging]]

Designed and produced by New York City-based sculpting and design house [[Art Asylum]], the Minimates began in 2002 with multiple lines of 3" Minimates based on several different licenses. These included ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Kung Faux]]'', ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', and the films of ''[[Bruce Lee]]'', along with a [[Rock and roll|Rock]] line featuring [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Alice Cooper]]. The 3" Minimate Line also included several blank or promotional Minimates—these usually bore the logo of a specific company and were used as giveaways.

Minimates came of age in 2003 when, following a partnership with [[Diamond Select Toys]], a range of 2" Minimates based upon the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe was launched. The 2" Minimate body type began to be used for the promotional Minimates in place of the 3" body type, and it was announced that the 3" range would be discontinued. However, a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]] line produced by Art Asylum and [[Play Along Toys]] in 2004 added a third body type, which stood 2.5" tall, to further illustrate the size differences of the various races of Middle-Earth.

In 2004, Art Asylum and Play Along launched their Minimate-based C3 ("Create Construct Customize") construction sets, which could be used to build vehicles and playsets from the [[DC Comics]] universe. Focusing mainly on Batman and the Justice League, the [[Lego]]-esque line was moderately successful, but the license terms limited the selling of the 2" DC Minimates to the construction sets, and the line failed to gain a foothold in the market. C3 was discontinued, and in 2006 [[DC Direct]] announced that they had picked up the DC Minimates line and would put out their own figures (in 2" and 2.5" scales) in partnership with Art Asylum. That same year, non-construction-set vehicles were introduced to the brand, in lines based on the ''[[Speed Racer]]'' cartoon (from Art Asylum) as well as both the classic and modern ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV series (from Art Asylum and Diamond Select Toys).

In 2007, Art Asylum became a division of Diamond Select Toys,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/9319.shtml "Diamond Select Acquires Art Asylum"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minimates body type has since been applied to dozens of licenses from comic books ([[The Walking Dead (comic book)|''The Walking Dead'']]'', [[Invincible (comics)|Invincible]]''), TV (''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', [[Star Trek]] again), movies (''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]],'' [[Universal Monsters]], [[Marvel Studios]]), animation (''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'') and video games ([[Halo (series)|Halo]],'' [[Tomb Raider|&lt;nowiki/&gt;]][[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''). DST has also developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders, Minimates M.A.X., and [[Battle Beasts]], which they acquired the trademark for in 2009.

==Minimate product types==
Today, most Minimates lines are sold as two-packs, assortments of which are often shared between [[Toys "R" Us]] and the specialty comic market, which includes comic book shops and specialty toy stores serviced by [[Diamond Comic Distributors]]. Four-packs are also offered at Toys "R" Us and specialty, as well as through retailers like the [[Disney Store]] and Action Figure Xpress. Both two-packs and four-packs have been offered at major pop culture conventions, including San Diego's [[Comic-Con International]], [[New York Comic Con]] and [[C2E2]].

Due to license restrictions limiting all Marvel Minimates to the 2" scale, a range of four 8" unarticulated resin statues under the "Minimates Max" banner were announced for 2006, to represent larger-scale characters in the Minimate style. Unfortunately, because of the cost and unarticulated nature of the statues, the line was not well received and eventually cancelled, with only two of the four announced statues released, Galactus and the Sentinel. (Wolverine and Spider-Man were unproduced.)

The Minimates Vehicles line featured original ships and jets from DST's Pirate Raiders and M.A.X brands alongside licensed vehicles from ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', [[Back to the Future]] and ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', each in their own individually branded packaging. Each assortment featured color variations between Toys R Us and specialty, to differentiate between the two releases. While no longer offered in assortments, DST has continued to release vehicles individually, including [[Halo (series)|Halo]]'s Warthog vehicles, the [[Munsters]]' Koach, [[Captain Hook]]'s pirate ship from ''Peter Pan'', different versions of the Delorean from the Back to the Future trilogy, and several versions of the [[USS Enterprise (Star Trek)|U.S.S. ''Enterprise'']] from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]].''

Diamond Select Toys has also produced a carrying case that holds up to 36 Minimates, and comes with an exclusive figure. The first edition came with a Battle Beast, the second edition with a Pirate Raider, and the third, scheduled for 2013, will come with a silver 10th Anniversary Minimate.

==Media==
In 2005, animation students at the DAVE School produced ''[[Batman: New Times]]'', featuring computer-generated Minimate characters, as a class project. ''New Times'' features Batman, Catwoman and the Joker, and is notable for its all-star cast, including [[Adam West]] and [[Mark Hamill]] reprising their roles as the Batman and the Joker. Never intended for commercial release, ''New Times'' was released as a download on the DAVE School website and was available as a free DVD from DAVE School itself. As a promotional item, the Batman minimate from the Mini-Batmobile set was released separately in a ''Batman: New Time'' bag.

In 2006, an animated X-Men movie in the same style as ''Batman: New Times'' was produced under the name ''X-Men: Darktide''. Released on DVD as part of a box set containing Minimates of Magneto, New X-Men Cyclops, New X-Men Wolverine and Juggernaut, the movie features those characters, as well as the debuts of Minimate versions of ''[[New X-Men]]'' Storm, Beast and Archangel.

Currently, Diamond Select Toys is producing stop-motion animation for its in-house brands – Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders, Minimates M.A.X. and Battle Beasts – using actual Minimates, and posting it for free online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toplessrobot.com/2011/07/max-imum_overdrive.php "MAX-imum Overdrive"]&lt;/ref&gt; A minimally animated commercial using their line of Walking Dead Minimates has also been released online.

The '''Motion Picture Association of America''' ('''MPAA''') is an American [[trade association]] representing the [[Major film studio#Current|six major film studios]] of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Founded in 1922 as the '''Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America''' ('''MPPDA'''), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|film rating system]] in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).

More recently, the MPAA has advocated for the [[Film|motion picture]] and [[television]] industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb [[copyright infringement]], including recent attempts to limit the sharing of [[copyright]]ed works via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file-sharing]] networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France [[Charles Rivkin]] is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.

==History==

===Foundation and early history: 1922–29===

The MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a [[trade association]] of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYT22a&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultimatum by Hays to Purify Movies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/05/archives/ultimatum-by-hays-to-purify-movies-producers-and-distrihuters-join.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 June 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Will H. Hays]] was named the association's first president.&lt;ref name=Kimono&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dame in the Kimono: Hollywood, Censorship, and the Production Code |last1=Leff |first1=Leonard J. |last2=Simmons |first2=Jerold L. |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location= |isbn=0813190118 |page= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that [[Hollywood]] remained financially stable and able to attract investment from [[Wall Street]], while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a "clean moral tone".&lt;ref name=NYT22a /&gt;&lt;ref name=EvenNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Attacks Censors; Says Film Men O.K. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhdLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IiENAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2733%2C7216162 |work=The Evening News |date=26 May 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen.  Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spokesman24&gt;{{cite news |title=Czar of Movies Hits Censorship |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Np5XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t_MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=5826%2C734859 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=25 January 1924 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public [[Censorship in the United States#Film censorship|censorship]],&lt;ref name="Spokesman24"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT22b&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Says Public Censors Will Fail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/25/archives/hays-says-public-censors-will-fail-declares-american-principle-of.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship.&lt;ref name=ProvNews22&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays, Pledging Motion Picture Industry to Clean Pictures, Asks Public to Aid War on Evil Films |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFBbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QVANAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4100%2C1398046 |work=Providence News |date=6 July 1922 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

At the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt; Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

In 1924, Hays instituted "The Formula", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. "The Formula" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.&lt;ref name=Black96&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory D. Black |title=Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521565928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybKqnNNR7hwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hollywood+Censored:+Morality+Codes,+Catholics,+and+the+Movies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hIweUZuEJsHe0QG6zoHgBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" for the industry.&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls," and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production,&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===Production Code: 1930–34===

In 1930, the MPPDA introduced the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], sometimes called the "Hays Code". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films.&lt;ref name=TeleHerald30&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie Industry to Bar Obscenity and Crime Scenes, Plan |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-K9FAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pb0MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3907%2C1202519 |work=The Telegraph-Herald and Times-Journal |date=2 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the "Dont's and Be Carefuls", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; The Code incorporated many of the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of "scenes of passion" unless they were essential to a film's plot; "pointed profanity" in either word or action; "sex perversion"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with "indecent" moves; and white slavery.&lt;ref name=Calgary30&gt;{{cite news |title=Producers Adopt Code of Conduct For Screen Shows |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WyRkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3606%2C4315324 |work=The Calgary Daily Herald |date=1 April 1930 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the [[Great Depression]] of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

In 1933 and 1934 the [[National Legion of Decency|Catholic Legion of Decency]], along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral.&lt;ref name=Bernstein00&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew Bernstein |title=Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era |year=2000 |isbn=0813527074 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYoT857G8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Controlling+Hollywood:+Censorship+and+Regulation+in+the+Studio+Era&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eIseUamHDaa00AHX1oH4Bg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), with [[Joseph Breen]] as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA,&lt;ref name=Black96 /&gt; and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide "Production Code" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.&lt;ref name=Black96/&gt;

===War years: 1935–45===

In the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;&lt;ref name=LewistonTrib34&gt;{{cite news |title=Pictures Purged |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z5fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wzEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=3861%2C4395343 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=15 July 1934 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films&lt;ref name=SpokaneChron35&gt;{{cite news |title=Newest Pictures Based on Classics |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=atRXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_fQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=2505%2C6402892 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=26 March 1935 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued promoting American films abroad.&lt;ref name=MilJournal36&gt;{{cite news |title=Will Hays Gets Italy to Lift Film Blockage |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PHYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_yEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays&amp;pg=6885%2C5924504 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=25 November 1936 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands.&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt; That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=PittPress38&gt;{{cite news |title=Hays Scores Propaganda On Screens |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LE0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D0wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=motion%20picture%20producers%20and%20distributors%20of%20america&amp;pg=4508%2C6029095 |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=30 March 1938 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.&lt;ref name="SpokesReview45"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston to Rule Movies |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vipWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6105%2C4697631 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=20 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnston era: 1945–63===

In 1945 the MPPDA hired [[Eric Johnston]], four-time president of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], to replace Hays.&lt;ref name=SpokChron45&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnston Named Motion Picture Czar |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7NZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jvUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=will-hays%20and%20johnston&amp;pg=6668%2C3421898 |work=Spokane Daily Chronicle |date=19 September 1945 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).&lt;ref name=Kimono /&gt;

He also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries.&lt;ref name=Lewis02p37&gt;{{cite book |author=Jon Lewis |title=Hollywood V.

In 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were "within the limits of good taste". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.&lt;ref name=RG56&gt;{{cite news |title=Motion Picture Code Made 'More Flexible' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JRFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cOIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20johnston&amp;pg=6763%2C3434436 |work=Eugene Register Guard |date=17 December 1956 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington.&lt;ref name=Valenti07p271&gt;{{cite book |author=Jack Valenti |title=This Time, This Place |year=2007 |isbn=9780307346650 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |location=New York |page=271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke.&lt;ref name=Petersburg63&gt;{{cite news |title=Eric Johnston Dies at 66 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uJtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=eric-johnston&amp;pg=2746%2C970120 |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=23 August 1963 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.&lt;ref name=MPAAHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpaa.org/about/history |title=History of the MPAA |work=MPAA.org |publisher=Motion Picture Association of America |accessdate=23 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621235047/http://www.mpaa.org/about/history |archivedate=June 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the MPAA supported the launch of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), a coalition of entertainment companies, including the six major studios, [[Netflix]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], that will draw on the MPAA's resources in an effort to reduce online piracy through research and legal efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieberman|first1=David|title=Hollywood And Digital Companies Forge Global Anti-Piracy Alliance|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/hollywood-digital-companies-forge-global-antipiracy-alliance-1202112346/|work=Deadline|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film rating system==

{{Main|Motion Picture Association of America film rating system}}

In 1968, the MPAA established the Code and Rating Administration, or CARA (later renamed the Classification and Rating Administration), which began issuing ratings for films exhibited and distributed commercially in the United States to help parents determine what films are appropriate for their children.

Since the  [[motion picture rating system|rating system]] was first introduced in November 1968, it has gone through several changes, including the addition of a PG-13 rating.&lt;ref name=Coe68&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Classification Starts Nov. 1 |author=Richard L. Coe |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ujwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ogEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20film%20ratings%20system&amp;pg=7248%2C5548739 |work=Toledo Blade |date=14 October 1968 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Champlin70&gt;{{cite news |title=Film Ratings Plan Will Be Revised |author=Charles Champlin |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WAscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tloEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mpaa%20film%20ratings%20system&amp;pg=6981%2C4372645 |work=The Victoria Advocate |date=29 January 1970 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratings system is completely voluntary, and ratings have no legal standing.&lt;ref name=Lipper90&gt;{{cite news |title=At last, an adult decision |author=Hal Lipper |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=3SKP-CMT0-0060-215N&amp;csi=11063&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richman03&gt;{{cite news |title=Law limits some violent video games |author=Dan Richman |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Law-limits-some-violent-video-games-1115175.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=20 May 2003 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, theater owners enforce the MPAA film ratings after they have been assigned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CinemaCon: MPAA Tweaks Movie Ratings System in Wake of Newtown School Shooting |author=Pamela McClintock |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cinemacon-mpaa-tweaks-movie-ratings-440392 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=16 March 2013 |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many theaters refusing to exhibit non-rated films.&lt;ref name=McClintock12&gt;{{cite news |title=Weinstein Co. to Release Unrated 'Bully' in Protest of 'R' |author=Pamela McClintock |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weinstein-bully-unrated-rated-r-mpaa-304232 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unrated film is often denoted by "NR", such as in newspapers, although this is not a formal MPAA rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel P. |last=Franklin |title=Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States |year=2006 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=9781461641018 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQp4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 153]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' alleged that the MPAA gave preferential treatment to member studios during the process of assigning ratings,&lt;ref name=Travers06&gt;{{cite news |title=''This Film Is Not Yet Rated'' |author=Peter Travers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/this-film-is-not-yet-rated-20060803 |work=Rolling Stone |date=3 August 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency. In response, the MPAA posted its ratings rules, policies, and procedures, as well as its appeals process, online.&lt;ref name=McClintock07&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA, NATO reform ratings system |author=Pamela McClintock |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/mpaa-nato-reform-ratings-system-1117957535/ |work=Variety |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 study commissioned by CARA, ninety-three percent of parents in the U.S. find the rating system to be a helpful tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McClintock|first1=Pamela|title=Movie Ratings: Sex Remains Top Concern for American Parents, Not Violence|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/movie-ratings-sex-remains-top-845507|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings currently used by the MPAA's voluntary system are:&lt;ref name=MPAARatings&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mpaa.org/film-ratings/ |title=Film Ratings |work=MPAA.org |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] production and distribution of videos tapes and [[laserdisc]]s into the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Billboard91"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein94&gt;{{cite news |title=Picture This |author=Seth Goldstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA53&amp;dq=MPAA%20laserdiscs&amp;pg=RA1-PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |work=Billboard |date=21 May 1994 |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 took successful legal action against individuals posting [[DVD]] [[Digital rights management#DRM and film|decryption software]] on the Internet in [[Universal City Studios, Inc. v.

The MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online.&lt;ref name=Lieberman13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Cheers Prison Sentence For Leader Of Internet Piracy Ring |author=David Lieberman |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/mpaa-imagine-group-justice-department-conviction-sentencing/ |work=Deadline.com |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA and its British counterpart, the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT), also funded the training of [[Lucky and Flo]], a pair of [[Labrador Retrievers]], to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.&lt;ref name=Kirk06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125679/article.html |title=MPAA Trains Dogs to Sniff Out Pirate DVDs |author=Jeremy Kirk |date=11 May 2006 |work=PCWorld |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online file sharing===
In the early 2000s, the MPAA began focusing its efforts to curb copyright infringement specifically on [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]], initially using a combination of educational campaigns&lt;ref name=Atkinson03&gt;{{cite news |title=Music piracy persists at Boston U., nationwide despite lawsuits |author=Dan Atkinson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4B6F-HJW0-00K4-105J&amp;csi=172244&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=University Wire |date=10 December 2003 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cease and desist]] letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to [[internet service provider]]s to forward to users engaged in copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=Woolley02&gt;{{cite news |title=Shiver me timbers: Online bootlegs bane of entertainment industry |author=Simon Woolley |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4600-8XW0-015H-052Y&amp;csi=244819&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=Townsville Bulletin/Townsville Sun |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including [[BitTorrent]] and [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]].&lt;ref name=Locklear04&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2004/12/4467-2/ |title=MPAA lawsuits target BitTorrent, eDonkey and Direct Connect networks |author=Fred Locklear |date=14 December 2004 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.&lt;ref name=Johnson05&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Anti-Piracy Lawsuits Target Individuals |author=Bary Alyssa Johnson |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4H0K-M4X0-01KX-14V2&amp;csi=262320&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=PC Magazine |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPAA also played a role in encouraging the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] to conduct [[the Pirate Bay raid|a raid of the Pirate Bay]] file-sharing website in May 2006.&lt;ref name=Mennecke06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story1227.html |title=Sweden Pressured to take Pirate Bay Action |author=Thomas Mennecke |date=20 June 2006 |work=Slyck.com |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the [[World Trade Organization]], along with a letter from the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Ahrens06&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Joins Industry in Piracy War |author=Frank Ahrens |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061402071.html |work=The Washington Post |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewing06&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/4128/20060621/#.UTdo1nyY4RE |title=US threatened Sweden with sanctions over piracy |author=Adam Ewing |date=21 June 2006 |work=The Local |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Center for Copyright Information]] unveiled the [[Copyright Alert System]], a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], and five of the USA's largest [[internet service providers]].&lt;ref name=Miller13&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA-Backed Copyright Alert System Unveiled |author=Sean J. Miller |url=http://www.backstage.com/news/mpaa-backed-copyright-alert-system-unveiled/ |work=Back Stage |date=26 February 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system used a third-party service to identify content being distributed illegally. Users were then informed that their accounts were being used for possible copyright infringement and were provided with information about ways to get authorized content online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The new copyright alert system is running |author=Sarah Laskow |url=http://www.cjr.org/cloud_control/cas_system_already_in_action.php?page=all |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users who received multiple notices of infringement faced "mitigations measures," such as temporary slowing of their Internet service, but the system did not include termination of subscriber accounts. Subscribers facing such action had a right to appeal to the [[American Arbitration Association]].&lt;ref name=CASFAQs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copyrightinformation.org/resources-faq/copyright-alert-system-faqs/ |title=Copyright Alert System FAQs |work=copyrightinformation.org |publisher=Center for Copyright Information |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the Copyright Alert System was discontinued.  While no official reason was given, the MPAA's general counsel stated that the system had not been equipped to stop repeat infringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=Internet Service Providers, Studios and Record Labels Call It Quits on Copyright Alert System|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/copyright-alerts-piracy-mpaa-comcast-att-1201971756/|work=Variety|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 24, 2014, the [[Sony Pictures hack]] revealed that following a lawsuit in which the MPAA won a multimillion judgment against [[Hotfile]], a file hosting website, the MPAA colluded with Hotfile to misrepresent the settlement so that the case would serve as a deterrent. The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van der Sar|first1=Ernesto|title=MPAA Secretly Settled With Hotfile for $4 Million, Not $80 Million|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-secretly-settled-hotfile-4-million-80-million-141224/|work=Torrentfreak|date=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/sony-email-leak-has-uncovered-the-truth-behind-mpaa-and-hotfile-dispute|title=Sony email leak has uncovered the truth behind MPAA and Hotfile dispute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141224/06321429517/sony-hack-reveals-that-mpaas-big-80-million-settlement-with-hotfile-was-lie.shtml|title=Sony Hack Reveals That MPAA's Big '$80 Million' Settlement With Hotfile Was A Lie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the [[United States International Trade Commission]] (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as "articles" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Eriq|title=With the MPAA Watching, ITC Says Case About Teeth Won't Bring Down the Internet|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/mpaa-watching-itc-says-case-775397|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ted|title=MPAA Warns Appellate Ruling Could Limit Ability to Fight Digital Piracy|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/mpaa-digital-goods-piracy-google-1201637501/|work=Variety|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the MPAA reported [[Putlocker]] as one of the "top 5 rogue cyberlocker services" to the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandoval |first=Greg |date=31 March 2012 |title=MPAA wants more criminal cases brought against 'rogue' sites |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/mpaa-wants-more-criminal-cases-brought-against-rogue-sites/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Prabhu |first=Vijay |date=17 October 2016 |title=Yet Another Video Streaming Service Bites The Dust, Putlocker Shuts Down |url=http://www.techworm.net/2016/10/putlocker-video-streaming-service-shuts.html |publisher=TechWorm |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bolton |first=Doug |date=26 May 2016 |title=Putlocker blocked in the UK by internet service providers after High Court order |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/putlocker-blocked-down-virgin-media-sky-internet-streaming-watch-online-videos-a7050056.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
===Publicity campaigns===
The MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The ''[[Who Makes Movies?]]'' advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements.&lt;ref name=Boliek03&gt;{{cite news |title=H'wood steps up antipiracy fight |author=Brooks Boliek |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4BG8-SXP0-01V4-X35T&amp;csi=12015&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=23 July 2003 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan "[[You can click, but you can't hide]]". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action.&lt;ref name=BBC05&gt;{{cite news |title=Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4256449.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA.&lt;ref name=Hernandez04&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA Files Piracy Suits |author=Greg Hernandez |url=http://w3.nexis.com/new/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=4DTP-V1K0-TWDH-T3C9&amp;csi=157105&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true |work=The Daily News of Los Angeles |date=17 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the [[Intellectual Property Office of Singapore]] to release [[You Wouldn't Steal a Car|a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft]].&lt;ref name=IPOS04&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |title=Be HIP at the Movies |author= |date=27 July 2004 |work=Intellectual Property Office of Singapore |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924044120/http://www1.ipos.gov.sg/main/newsroom/media_rel/mediarelease1_270704.html |archivedate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.&lt;ref name=Rohrer09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8106805.stm |title=Getting inside a downloader's head |author=Finlo Rohrer |date=18 June 2009 |work=BBC |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.&lt;ref name=Pope08&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA admits mistake on downloading study |author=Justin Pope |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |work=Newsweek |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207045516/http://www.newsweek.com/id/98009/page/1 |archivedate=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's "I Make Movies" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=MPAA to Run 'I Make Movies' Ads at AMC Theaters, Local Cinema Chains|url=https://www.thewrap.com/mpaa-to-run-i-make-movies-ads-at-amc-theaters-local-cinema-chains/|work=The Wrap|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's "WhereToWatch" website (later dubbed "The Credits")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecredits.org/|website=mpaa.org|title=The Credits|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.

===Accusations of copyright infringement===
The MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a [[Blog software|blogging platform]] called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAA: We Were Only Testing Forest Blog|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-we-were-only-testing-forest-blog|work=Torrentfreak|date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |title=MPAA violates software license |author=Brett Thomas |date=19 February 2007 |work=bit-tech.net |accessdate=5 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110183631/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2007/02/19/MPAA_violates_software_license/ |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux]] distribution, released under the [[GNU General Public License|General Public License]], which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.&lt;ref name=Paul07&gt;{{cite news |title=MPAA's University Toolkit hit with DMCA takedown notice after GPL violation |author=Ryan Paul |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/12/mpaas-university-toolkit-hit-with-dmca-takedown-notice-after-gpl-violation/ |work=Ars Technica |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its [[MPAA film rating system|rating system]])&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060130093854/http://www.latimes.com/business/custom/cotown/cl-et-mpaa24jan24,0,2188275.story MPAA finds itself accused of piracy], by John Horn; at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (via [[archive.org]]); published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; — an act which ''[[Ars Technica]]'' explicitly described as [[hypocrisy]]&lt;ref name=ArsTech&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/01/6036-2/ MPAA admits to unauthorized movie copying], by Eric Bangeman, at ''[[Ars Technica]]''; published January 24, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and which [[Roger Ebert]] called "rich irony".&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/sundance-7-film-ratings-exposed Sundance #7: Film ratings exposed!], by [[Roger Ebert]]; at [[RogerEbert.com]]; published January 26, 2006; retrieved June 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

A '''movement director''' arranges actors' movements in a variety of production settings that include [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], [[opera]] and [[animation]]. Movement directors usually work closely with the [[theatre director|director]] and the [[performer]]s, collaborating with the creative team to realise the physical life of a work. They propose a physical language to performers and directors, and devise training methods or teach skills that will help facilitate a specific physical style. The movement director may create, or research and pass on, embodied information about [[etiquette]], [[ethnicities]] (including [[proxemics]], [[gestural]] language, social codes, etc.), a character’s condition (related to medical conditions within their  historical context, and factors such as inebriation, pregnancy, etc.) and personal journey (ageing, etc.), as well as specialist movement (e.g. period dances, dexterity in falling, lifts and [[acrobatics]], animal work, [[Cross-gender acting|cross-gendered performance]]) or chorus work.

Although [[choreography]] is part of a movement directors’ skill-set, this does not mean that every choreographer is also a movement director. There are also important differences between the movement director and the [[fight director]], where although the movement director will engage with the effect of the relevant weapons on posture, movement and emotional state, the [[stage combat|fight choreography]] itself is directed by the specifically qualified fight director. 
Specialist movement consultants may focus on other specific areas (e.g. as in the work on primate movement by the [[puppeteer]] Peter Elliot in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'').

==History==

===Movement directors in Britain===

The role described by the title of Movement director today has been in existence since at least the start of the 20th century, although rarely mentioned in programmes or credits. Movement directors often work at a crossover point, shifting between teaching and directing movement for actors, and have also been termed as Movement coach, Theatre choreographer, or Movement support. 
[[Royal National Theatre|The National Theatre]] created the role Head of Movement that was held by Jane Gibson for a period of ten years. [[Glynn MacDonald]] has been the long-standing Master of Movement at [[The Globe Theatre]], underpinning the work of each season and collaborating with visiting movement directors and choreographers. 
2009 saw an important development in the appointment of [[Struan Leslie]] as Head of Movement at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. This was  the only official Head of Movement position within a British theatre company at the time.
Many contemporary Movement directors have established long running relationships with certain companies, with whom they have created a shared body of work and working methodology. These are for example Jane Gibson with [[Cheek by Jowl]], [[Kate Flatt]] and [[Struan Leslie]] with [[Katie Mitchell]] at the National Theatre and [[English National Opera]], and [[Liz Ranken]] with [[Shared Experience]]. 
Other contemporary Movement directors include Michael Ashcroft, [[Peter Darling]], [[Lucy Cullingford]], [[Vanessa Ewan]], [[Lea Hausmann]], Steven Hogget and Scott Graham ([[Frantic Assembly]]), [[Georgina Lamb]], [[Sue Lefton]], [[Ita O'Brien]], [[Liz Ranken]], [[Dennis Sayers]], [[Toby Sedgwick]], [[Ayse Tashkiran]], Sian Williams, Anne Yee, Imogen Knight, Paul Harris, Diane Mitchell, Anna Morrissey, Paul Sadot.

Movement directors today emerge from a rich heritage of movement pedagogues and practitioners. French Director and practitioner [[Jacques Lecoq]], and movement theorist and pedagogue [[Rudolf Laban]] offer important influences. Many of their students and contemporaries became influential teachers of movement and Movement directors in British theatre, often influenced by and interweaving with the lineage of contemporary dance as influenced by Laban, and the heritage of social and cultural dances.
[[Claude Chagrin]], who trained with Jacques Lecoq, was the ‘movement person’ with the National Theatre Company before and while it became permanently resident in Denys Lasdun’s National Theatre Building in 1976.  She was also the first person to be credited for movement, on a production of ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun'' (Dir. Peter Shaffer, 1964).  
[[Michel Saint-Denis]] taught movement in London and was an influential associate director alongside [[Peter Brook]] at the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1962–1966, introducing influences from his work in Paris with his uncle Jacques Copeau.  
Other notable teachers who have shaped British movement work today through a heritage that is passed on from body to body, are [[Trish Arnold]], [[Geraldine Stephenson]], [[Jean Newlove]], [[Litz Pisk]], [[Yat Malmgren]] and [[Belinda Quirey]]. Their work underpins the practice and understanding of contemporary movement practitioners and gives physical life to actors’ performances at Drama Schools and in productions across Britain.

===Contemporary developments===
Movement Directors have sought to be named, in recognition of the existence of their profession, for many decades, and are increasingly gathering recognition. Relevant training for practitioners is now offered through recognized Higher Education degrees focusing on Movement in theatre, such as the MA in Movement studies at The Royal [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], founded by Vanessa Ewan and  Debbie Green in 2004, and now jointly led by Ayse Tashkiran and Vanessa Ewan re titled MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching and the MA in Training Actors Movement, led by [[Wendy Allnutt]] at [[The Guildhall School of Music and Drama]].  Manchester Metropolitan University also offers an MA in Movement Practice for Theatre.  
Movement director and MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching course leader at The Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), Ayse Tashkiran, is researching a comprehensive history of movement direction and creating a platform where movement practitioners are able to share their work and facilitate an understanding of their profession by a wider audience.
Industry initiatives to draw out the work of movement directors include the [[Young Vic]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] with a variety of workshops, apprenticeships and placements.

[[Image:Pleo robot.jpg|thumb|right|Pleo Robot]]'''PLEO''' is an [[animatronics|animatronic]] pet dinosaur toy manufactured by Innvo Labs, a company located in Hong Kong and Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLEOworld about|url=http://www.pleoworld.com/pleo_rb/eng/about.php|website=PLEOworld|publisher=Innvo Labs|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy has the appearance and (imagined) behavior of a week-old baby ''[[Camarasaurus]]'' dinosaur. It was designed by [[Caleb Chung]], the co-creator of the [[Furby]], Chung's company [[Ugobe]] first sold Pleo and was manufactured by Jetta Company Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jetta.com.hk/home.htm Jetta Company Limited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The species of dinosaur chosen allows for concealing the sensors and [[Electric motor|motors]] needed for the animation, since it has a big body shape and relatively large head. According to their website, each Pleo would "learn" from its experiences and environment through [[artificial intelligence]] and develop an individual personality.

PLEO was unveiled on February 7, 2006 at the [[DEMO Conference]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] and was expected to come on the [[India]]n and American markets around Fall 2007. PLEO shipments started on December 5, 2007.

In April 2009, Ugobe [[laid off]] all of its employees and filed for [[bankruptcy]].

On June 8, 2009 the original PLEO manufacturer Jetta announced it is re-launching Pleo and are continuing the line including accessories such as the vital [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[battery charger]] components. Since 14 July 2009, PLEO is owned by Innvo Labs Corporations (a division of Jetta).

In December 2011, the second generation, PLEO rb, was first launched in America, Europe and Hong Kong where Innvo Labs headquarter locates.

In July 10, 2017 the NPR "Hidden Brain" interviewer Shankar Vedantam used a pleo robot on the stage of the "Aspen Ideas Festival" to illustrate some issues of "robot ethics" while interviewing Kate Darling of MIT's Media Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/07/10/536424647/can-robots-teach-us-what-it-means-to-be-human|title=Can Robots Teach Us What It Means To Be Human?|last=Darling|first=Kate|last2=Lab|first2=MIT Media|website=NPR.org|access-date=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

* [[Machine vision|Camera-based vision system]] (for light detection and navigation)
* Two [[microphone]]s, [[Sound localization|binaural hearing]]
* [[Beat detection]] (allows pleo to dance and listen to music).
* [[Touch switch|touch sensors]] (head, chin, shoulders, back, feet) (12 in total)
* Four ground foot sensors (surface detection)
* Fourteen [[force-feedback]] sensors, one per [[joint]]
* Orientation [[tilt sensor]] for body position
* [[Infrared]] mouth sensor for object detection into mouth
* Two-way infrared communication with other Pleos
* Infrared detection for external objects
* [[32-bit]] [[Atmel]] [[ARM7]] microprocessor (main processor for Pleo)
** 32-bit [[NXP Semiconductors]] ARM7 sub-processor (camera system, dedicated [[Audio signal processing|audio input processor]])
** Four [[8-bit]] processors (low-level [[motor control]])

== Ugobe bankruptcy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}
Beginning in December 2008, Pleoworld.com began to experience technical problems. By the [[Christmas]] holidays, Pleoworld was offline, including the user forums. After the holidays, both Pleoworld and Ugobe's official websites displayed updating website messages. Both sites returned sometime at the beginning of 2009. Ugobe official website updated its board of directors listing. Ugobe stated that the problems were due to the company's relocation but had not explained why the [[Internet forum|user forums]] have not been restored.

[[Wired News]] reported the company's outlook was not good, and it was struggling to save itself from extinction as it tried to raise new funding and keep its pipeline of products alive.

From November 2008, the company saw a host of top management departures, including two [[CEO]]s, moved its office in [[California]], and pared down its marketing and [[Public Relations]] staff in an attempt to weather the current [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|economic storm]]. (This may be the reason for Pleoworld's demise.) Emails to the company's media contact on its website bounced back. Phone calls to its corporate office were not answered.

In July 2008, Ugobe CEO Bob Christopher stepped down and former [[CFO]] Liz Gasper retook control of the company. Christopher said he left the company to move on to other ventures. Gasper had focused on cutting down the company's [[burn rate]] and finding new funding.

With the collapse of the United States credit environment, though, fund raising came to a halt. Meanwhile, the company's entire [[board of directors]] [[Resignation|resigned]] before December, 2008, giving control of Ugobe back to the co-founders.

Ugobe also closed its [[Emeryville, California]] office and moved all operations to its new offices in [[Boise, Idaho]]. The company then had about twenty employees.

It had become extremely difficult for new PLEOs owners or existing members of the website to access the official forums and Plogs. In the wake of these problems, a loyal fan has set up a forum for members to join to talk Pleo, get the latest Pleo news, and download firmware updates for Pleo.

On April 17, 2009 Ugobe filed [[chapter 7 bankruptcy]], and halted the production of new PLEOs.

==Jetta acquired PLEO==

On June 8, 2009 Jetta acquired PLEO and later in July, Innvo Labs was founded for the development of PLEO business while Jetta continued to manufacture for the PLEO line. Innvo Labs is a division of Jetta and is a privately held company based in Hong Kong. Jetta and Innvo Labs is committed to re-launch the PLEO line and continue the line of products including accessories such as the recovery battery and charger components for Ugobe PLEO.
In order to strengthen its brand, Innvo Labs is decided to enhance their customer service, and so set up a customer service hotline and email to collect public opinions and reply to customer inquiries on PLEO and PLEO rb.

==PLEO rb==

In December 2011, the latest iteration, the PLEO rb (Standing for ReBorn), was invented and released.
PLEO rb is similar to the original PLEO. However, no two units are exactly alike: each PLEO rb comes with randomly selected eyeball, eyelid and eye-shadow colours. The skin is always a slightly different hue of green. A special line of pink or blue PLEO rb were released in late 2012.
PLEO rb has more senses than the original. The enhancements include:
#Eyes: It can now recognise colors and patterns; it can also detect drop-offs so it steps back from the risk of falling.
#Ears: It can hear, and will turn towards the source. Owners can name it and teach it verbal commands using "learning stones". 
#Nose and mouth: It can sense what kind of "food" or "medicine" owners are feeding and then it will choose to eat or not according to its simulated needs and wants. 
#Skin: It can sense the temperature of its surroundings and react accordingly; it can sense whether it is being petted or hit and react to touch. 
#Time: It can recognize the time to wake up, eat and sleep. ]*
There are altogether 9 new kinds of food and medicine items made for PLEO rb in different health and life situations and 7 new "learning stones": these can teach  PLEO rb how to bow, dance, sign, walk towards their owner, play games, etc.

PLEO rb is designed to behave like a life-form, with 4 distinct life stages. When unboxed, it behaves like a newborn and needs to be "hatched" and brought up. With proper care, it will "grow up" into a juvenile after about two days. It starts to stand and walk smoothly during its teenage stage, and can then be taught to recognize its name. As owners continue to teach verbal commands, it will get to the mature stage and all features will be fully enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLEOworld Lifeform|url=http://www.pleoworld.com/pleo_rb/eng/lifeform.php|website=PLEOworld|publisher=PLEOworld|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Harding''' (1858 – August 29, 1901) was an Irish-American singer, composer and music publisher active in the United States from 1890 to 1901.

==Biography==

Harding was born in Ireland in 1858, and emigrated to the United States as a boy. In June 1890, Harding performed in the musical play ''Billie Taylor'' in New York City as part of the Ideal Opera Company. In March 1893, he played Nixey Weld in ''A Night at the Circus'' at the Harrigan's Park Theatre in [[New York City|New York]]. Also in 1893 he joined the minstrel company of Sam Devere, author of "The Whistling Coon" made famous by [[George W. Johnson (singer)|George W. Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Martel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martel|first1=Joseph|title=Roger Harding: A Forgotten Recording Pioneer|journal=New Amberola Graphic|date=July 1988|issue=65|pages=3-8|url=https://archive.org/stream/NAG65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Harding began manufacturing phonograph records at 18 E. 22nd St., New York, and late in the year sold the operation to the Excelsior Phonograph Company (later Excelsior and Musical Phonograph Company). Harding continued managing recording for the Excelsior company until August of the following year, when he was replaced in that role by fellow recording artist [[William F. Hooley]]. He began recording around this time for the [[Columbia Phonograph Company]] (which had relocated from [[Washington, D.C.]] to [[New York City]]), [[Berliner Gramophone]] and [[National Phonograph Company|National Phonograph Company (Edison)]]. In addition to his own solo recordings of popular songs, Harding sang duets with [[Len Spencer]], [[Steve Porter (singer)|Steve Porter]], [[Minnie Emmett]] and Myra Price, and was a member of the Spencer Trio, Imperial Minstrels and Greater New York Quartette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenz|first1=Kenneth|title=Two-Minute Brown Wax and XP Cylinder Records of the Columbia Phonograph Company|date=1981|publisher=Kastlemusick|url=https://archive.org/details/KastlemusickColumbiaCylinders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deakins|first1=Duane|title=Edison Standard Index|date=1959|url=https://archive.org/details/EdisonStandardIndex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Harding (vocalist : tenor vocal)|url=http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/44150/Harding_Roger_vocalist_tenor_vocal|website=Discography of American Historical Recordings|publisher=UC Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1898, Harding had become associated with the Strakosch and Hess Grand English Opera Company and the Nellie McHenry Company, managing stage production and choirs as well as singing. In late 1898, Harding formed the Knickerbocker Music Publishing Company in New York with singer Steve Porter and pianist Fred Hylands, but the company was reformed as Hylands, Spencer and Yeager (with [[Len Spencer]] and Harry Yeager) in early 1899, apparently before any publishing commenced. In mid-1899, Harding began his own music publishing firm at 1180 Broadway, New York, then 53 W. 28th St., New York in [[Tin Pan Alley]]. In June 1901, Harding made his last recordings, for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. By August 1901 Harding had moved his publishing business to the Johnson Building in [[Brooklyn]], and died suddenly at this workplace on August 29, due to a viral infection. Harding is buried at the [[Maple Grove Cemetery (Queens)|Maple Grove Cemetery]] in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Queens]].&lt;ref name="Martel" /&gt;

'''Skill testing questions''' (or '''STQ''') are a legal requirement attached to many [[competition|contest]]s in [[Canada]].

==Origin==
The combined effect of Sections 197 to 206 of the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] bans for-profit gaming or betting, with exceptions made for provincial [[lottery|lotteries]], licensed [[casino]]s, and charity events. Many stores, radio stations, and other groups still wish to hold contests to encourage more purchases or increase consumer interest. These organizations take advantage of the fact that the law does allow prizes to be given for [[games of skill]], or mixed games of skill and chance. To make the chance-based contests legal, such games generally consist of a mathematical skill-testing question (STQ).&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; Penalties for violating the contest section of the Criminal Code, if it was enforced, include up to two years of imprisonment if charged as an indictable offence or a fine no more than $25,000 on a summary conviction charge. 

The Promotional Contest Provision of the [[Competition Act]] also states that "selection of participants or distribution of prizes is not made on the basis of skill or on a random basis."

Courts have accepted that estimating number of beans in a jar&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Dodds'' (Ontario High Court of Justice, 1884)&lt;/ref&gt; as a game with skill and number of votes will be cast in an upcoming election&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Johnston'' (Ontario High Court of Justice, 1904)&lt;/ref&gt; as a game with mixed skill and chance. Thus neither examples require additional STQ as the skill component has been met.

==Question format==
The most common form that these questions take is as an [[mathematical exercise|arithmetic exercise]]. A court decision ruled that a mathematical STQ must contain at least three operations to actually be a test of skill. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} For example, a sample question is "(2 × 4) + (10 × 3)" (Answer: 38). The winner should not receive any assistance (e.g. using a calculator, asking another individual to calculate the answer for the winner) in answering the STQ. Enforcement of these rules is not very stringent, especially for small prizes. Enforcement is often impossible if the winner chooses the time and location to answer the question (for example, the question is attached to the prize claim form). In most cases, there is no individual monitoring to ensure the integrity of answering STQ without assistance and the winner will submit the claim form having affirmed that they completed STQ without any assistance. In some cases, the player may not be required to answer the STQ to claim a prize. The questions are also becoming easier.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/01/dumb-math-tests-a-canadian-thing/ |title=Dumb Math Tests a Canadian Thing |publisher=Wired |date=2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For contests held in other countries but open to Canadians, a STQ must be asked of any potential Canadian winner.

==Consequences for not answering correctly==
Since those sections of the Criminal Code require elements of skill for the winners to be awarded of their prize, not answering the STQ correctly can result in the prize not being awarded. This has happened in at least one occasion for [[Tim Hortons]]' Roll Up the Rim contest winner in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Harold |last=Carmichael |url=http://www.saultstar.com/2008/06/21/refused-for-getting-skill-testing-question-wrong-sudbury-woman-finally-gets-her-prize |title=Refused for getting skill-testing question wrong, Sudbury woman finally gets her prize |publisher=Sault Star |date=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual failed to answer the same STQ correctly on the prize claim form twice due to a learning disability. Tim Hortons refused to release the prize until the intervention of a local newspaper. Anecdotally, getting the answer wrong is often not an obstacle to claiming a prize and the winner is given another chance to calculate again. 

==Free entry alternative==
The same section of law prohibits receiving consideration in exchange for playing the games, resulting in a related peculiarity of Canadian contests: the ''free entry alternative'', which is usually indicated by "No purchase necessary" in the [[fine print]]. Generally this means that it is possible to enter the contest for free by, for example, writing a letter to the entity sponsoring the contest and requesting a game piece or entry form.

'''Software visualization'''&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Bohnet, Jürgen Döllner: ''Analyzing Feature Implementation by Visual Exploration of Architecturally-Embedded Call-Graphs''. 4th International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis, ACM, ACM Press, pp. 41–48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, 2002; Diehl, 2007; Knight, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''software visualisation''' refers to the visualization of information of and related to software systems—either the [[software architecture|architecture]] of its [[source code]] or metrics of their [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime behavior]]- and their development process by means of static, interactive or animated 2-D or 3-D&lt;ref&gt;(Marcus et al., 2003; Wettel et al., 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; visual representations of their structure,&lt;ref&gt;(Staples &amp; Bieman, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; execution,&lt;ref&gt;J. Trümper et al.: ''Multiscale Visual Comparison of Execution Traces''. Proceedings of the International Conference on Program Comprehension, IEEE Computer Society, pp. 53-62, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; behavior,&lt;ref&gt;(Kuhn et al., 2006, Stasko et al., 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and evolution.

== Software system information ==
Software visualization uses a variety of information available about software systems. Key information categories include: 
* [[implementation]] artifacts such as [[source code]]s, 
* [[software metric]] data from measurements or from [[reverse engineering]], 
* [[tracing (software)|traces]] that record execution behavior, 
* [[software testing]] data (e.g., test coverage)
* [[software repository]] data that tracks changes.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of software visualization are to support the [[program comprehension|understanding of software systems]] (i.e., its structure) and algorithms (e.g., by animating the behavior of sorting algorithms) as well as the analysis and exploration of software systems and their anomalies (e.g., by showing classes with high [[coupling (computer science)|coupling]]) and their development and evolution. One of the strengths of software visualization is to combine and relate information of software systems that are not inherently linked, for example by projecting code changes onto software execution traces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet et al.: ''Projecting Code Changes onto Execution Traces to Support Localization of Recently Introduced Bugs''. 24th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, ACM, pp. 438–442, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software visualization can be used as tool and technique to explore and analyze software system information, e.g., to discover anomalies similar to the process of [[Data mining|visual data mining]].&lt;ref&gt;(Keim, 2002; Soukup, 2002; Burch, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, software visualization is used to monitoring activities such as for code quality or team activity.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet, J. Döllner: ''Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps''. Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Visualization is inherently not a method for [[software quality assurance]]{{fact|date=September 2017}}. Software visualization participates to [[Software intelligence|Software Intelligence]] in allowing to discover and take advantage of mastering inner components of software systems.

==Types==
Tools for software visualization might be used to visualize source code and [[software bug|quality defect]]s during software development and maintenance activities. There are different approaches to map source code to a visual representation such as by [[software map]]s&lt;ref&gt;D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objective includes, for example, the automatic discovery and visualization of quality defects in object-oriented software systems and services. Commonly, they visualize the direct relationship of a class and its methods with other classes in the software system and mark potential quality defects. A further benefit is the support for visual navigation through the software system.

More or less specialized [[graph drawing software]] is used for software visualization. A small-scale 2003 survey of researchers active in the [[reverse engineering]] and [[software maintenance]] fields found that a wide variety of visualization tools were used, including general purpose graph drawing packages like [[GraphViz]] and [[GraphEd]], UML tools like [[Rational Rose]] and [[Borland Together]], and more specialized tools like [[Visualization of Compiler Graphs]] (VCG) and [[Rigi (software)|Rigi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smr.270 | title=Software visualization in software maintenance, reverse engineering, and re-engineering: a research survey | journal=Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution: Research and Practice | date=2003 | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=87–109 | first=Rainer | last=Koschke}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–100}} The range of UML tools that can act as a visualizer by reverse engineering source is by no means short; a 2007 book noted that besides the two aforementioned tools, [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] also have this capability, and that Fujaba can also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=May 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6868">'''Sony HDVS''' is a range of [[high-definition video]] equipment  developed in the 1980s to support an early [[analog high-definition television system]] thought to be the [[broadcast television systems]] that would be in use today.  The line included [[professional video camera]]s, [[video monitors]] and [[linear video editing]] systems.

==History==

Sony first demonstrated a  wideband [[analog video]] [[HDTV]] capable video camera, monitor and [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in [[Algiers]]. The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-1000 video recorder, with its companion HDT-1000 processor/TBC, and HDS-1000 [[video switcher]] all working in the 1125-line [[component video]] format with [[interlaced video]] and a 5:3 aspect ratio.

The [[helical scan]] VTR (the HDV-100) used [[magnetic tape]] similar to 1" [[type C videotape]] for [[analog recording]].  Sony in 1988 unveiled a new HDVS digital line, including a reel-to-reel [[digital recording]] VTR (the HDD-1000) that used [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signal]]s between the machines for dubbing but the primary I/O remained [[analog signal]]s.  The large unit was housed in a 1-inch reel-to-reel transport, and because of the high tape speed needed, had a limit of 1-hour per reel.  Sony, owner of Columbia Pictures/Tri-Star, would start to archive feature films on this format, requiring an average of two reels per movie.  There was also a portable videocassette recorder (the HDV-10) for the HDVS system, using the "UniHi" format of [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] using 3/4" wide tape.  The transport housing similar in appearance to Sony's D1/D2 Standard Definition Digital VTRs, but recorded analog HD.  The small cassette size limited recording time.

==Uses==
The Sony HDVS system is used in the production of a 5-min feature film about [[Halley's Comet]] in 1986, titled "''Arrival''", and shown in US theatres later that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=debut%20set%20arrival%20halley|title=Debut Set for High-Definition System|last=Sutherland|first=Sam|date=5 October 1985|work=Billboard|access-date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; using 35mm film instead of tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=sony+hdvs|title=Fast Forward|last=Lovece|first=Frank|date=11 January 1986|work=Billboard|access-date=30 July 2017|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] shot using the HDVS professional video camera is [[RAI]]'s ''[[Julia and Julia]] (Italian: Giulia e Giulia'') in 1987, and the first HDTV television show was [[CBC Television|CBC]]'s ''[[Chasing Rainbows (TV series)|Chasing Rainbows]]'', shot using the HDVS system in 1988. For the [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] Invisible Touch Tour shows at [[Wembley Stadium]] in July 1987, the Sony HDVS system was used to film these shows and later released in VHS and LaserDisc in 1988 and DVD in 2003.

''[[World War II: When Lions Roared]]'' (also known as ''Then There Were Giants'') is a 1994 [[TV movie]], directed by [[Joseph Sargent]], that stars [[John Lithgow]], [[Michael Caine]] and [[Bob Hoskins]] as the three major Allied leaders.  It was the first [[video production]] to be produced in the 1125-line high-definition television (HDTV) format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World War II: When Lions Roared | date=18 July 2011 | publisher=imdb | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108956/trivia | accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was converted to [[NTSC]] for broadcast in the United States.

The HDVS brand and logo is still used by Sony nowadays (as "Digital HDVS", since the original HDVS line of equipment from 1984 used wideband analog video to achieve the 1125-lines of resolution) on their current digital high-definition [[HDCAM]]-format cameras such as the Sony HDW-750 and HDW-F900.

'''Techdombe''' is an electronic music subgenre that fuses the Afro-Uruguayan genre [[Candombe]] with [[Techno (music)|Techno]] music. The term is gestated by Uruguayan multidisciplinary-artist, music producer, and DJ Javier Zugarramurdi García. After many years of experimentation with the fusion of the genres, finally in 2015 Zugarramurdi releases a mini-album entitled ''Techdombe'' on his own independent label Repique, running under [[Bandcamp]]. The label is focused on release modern electronic music based on Candombe grooves. After giving birth to the subgenre Zugarramurdi is known as the originator of Techdombe.

'''''The Dick Van Dyke Show''''' is an American [[television sitcom]] that initially aired on [[CBS]] from October 3, 1961 to June 1, 1966, with a total of 158 half-hour episodes spanning five seasons. The show was created by [[Carl Reiner]] and starred [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Rose Marie]], [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[Larry Mathews]], and [[Mary Tyler Moore]]. It centered on the work and home life of television comedy writer Rob Petrie (Van Dyke). The show was produced by Reiner with [[Bill Persky]] and [[Sam Denoff]]. The music for the show's theme song was written by [[Earle Hagen]].&lt;ref name=song&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130739954 |title=Dick Van Dyke Plays Not My Job |work=[[NPR]] |date=October 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series won 15 [[Emmy Awards]]. In 1997, the episodes "Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth" and "It May Look Like a Walnut" were ranked at 8 and 15 respectively on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28-July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, it was ranked at 13 on [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml |title= TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows |date=April 26, 2002 |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013, it was ranked at 20 on their list of the 60 Best Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fretts |first=Bruce |last2=Roush |first2=Matt |date= |title=The Greatest Shows on Earth |url= |journal=TV Guide Magazine |publisher= |volume=61 |issue=3194-3195 |pages=16–19 |doi= &lt;!--|accessdate=22 December 2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
The two main settings show the work and home life of Rob Petrie ([[Dick Van Dyke]]), the head writer of a comedy/variety show produced in Manhattan. Viewers are given an "inside look" at how a [[Television program|television show]] (the fictitious ''The Alan Brady Show'') was written and produced. Many scenes deal with Rob and his co-writers, Buddy Sorrell ([[Morey Amsterdam]]) and Sally Rogers ([[Rose Marie]]). Mel Cooley ([[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]]), a balding [[straight man]] and recipient of numerous insulting one-liners from Buddy, was the show's producer and the brother-in-law of the show's star, Alan Brady ([[Carl Reiner]]). As Rob, Buddy, and Sally write for a comedy show, the premise provides a built-in forum for them to constantly make jokes. Other scenes focus on the home life of Rob, his wife Laura ([[Mary Tyler Moore]]), and son Ritchie ([[Larry Mathews]]), who live at 148 Bonnie Meadow Road in suburban [[New Rochelle, New York]]. Also often seen are their next-door neighbors and best friends, Jerry Helper ([[Jerry Paris]]), a dentist, and his wife Millie ([[Ann Morgan Guilbert]]).

==''Head of the Family'' pilot==
''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' was preceded by a 1960 pilot for a series to be called '''''Head of the Family''''' with a different cast, although the characters were essentially the same, except for the absence of Mel Cooley. In the pilot, [[Carl Reiner]], who created the show based on his own experiences as a TV writer, played Robbie Petrie, with a long first "e": PEE-tree. Laura Petrie was played by [[Barbara Britton]], Buddy Sorrell by [[Morty Gunty]], Sally Rogers by [[Sylvia Miles]], Ritchie by [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]], and Alan Sturdy, the Alan Brady character, was played by Jack Wakefield, although his face was never fully seen, which was also the case with Carl Reiner's Alan Brady for the first several seasons of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show''.

The pilot was unsuccessful, which led Reiner to rework the show with Dick Van Dyke playing the central character (who went by Rob, not "Robbie", and pronounced his last name PETT-ree.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/dickvandyke.htm |title=The Dick Van Dyke Show |work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |first=Paul |last=Cullum |accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot was subsequently the basis of the series episode "Father of the Week".

At least four episodes were filmed without a live studio audience: "The Bad Old Days," which featured an extended flashback sequence that relied on optical effects that would have been impractical to shoot with a live audience in the studio;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waldron |first=Vince |title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book |year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Episode Guide |isbn=1-56976-839-0 |pages=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Alan Brady Show Presents," which required elaborate set and costume changes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waldron |first=Vince |title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book |year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Episode Guide |isbn=1-56976-839-0 |pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Happy Birthday and Too Many More," which was filmed on November 26, 1963, only four days after [[Assassination of John F.

Reiner considered moving the production of the series to full color as early as season three, only to drop the idea when he was informed that it would add about $7,000 to the cost of each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waldron |first=Vince |title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book |year=2011 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Footnote |isbn=1-56976-839-0 |pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2016, two episodes from the series were presented on CBS-TV [[Film colorization|colorized]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20161209"&gt;{{cite news |last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |title=‘The Dick Van Dyke Show’ in Color?

* '''Robert Simpson "Rob" Petrie''' ([[Dick Van Dyke]]) — Rob is the head writer of the comedy writing team for the fictional TV variety show, ''The Alan Brady Show'', working with Sally Rogers and Buddy Sorrell. When not working, Rob enjoys life with his wife Laura Petrie, played by Mary Tyler Moore, and his son, Ritchie "Rosebud" Petrie, portrayed by Larry Mathews. Rob, Laura, and Ritchie live in [[New Rochelle, New York]]. Their neighbours are longtime friends, Millie Helper and her dentist husband Jerry Helper. Rob is a big fan of old-time radio, cowboy movies, and [[Laurel and Hardy]], as well as an excellent [[mime]] and fan of [[pantomime]]. He incorporates many favorite routines into his comedy writing. He has living parents, Sam and Clara Petrie. Rob was born, as was Dick Van Dyke, in [[Danville, Illinois]], along with younger brother Stacey Petrie, and served in the military at Camp Crowder, Missouri as a Special Services Sergeant. There he met his future wife, Laura Meehan, a USO dancer. After a number of jobs, he was hired by Allan Brady.
* '''Laura Petrie''' ([[Mary Tyler Moore]]) – Laura (née Meeker/Meehan) is Rob's wife.  As a 17-year-old dancer in the [[United Service Organizations]], she met and married Rob. Then, she became a [[Housewife|stay-at-home mom]]. In early Season One episodes, Rob calls her "Laurie" numerous times, as opposed to "Laura", which became his usual name for her. About 60 actresses auditioned for the part before Moore was signed.  Moore later wrote that she almost skipped the audition. 
* '''Maurice "Buddy" Sorrell''' ([[Morey Amsterdam]]) – Buddy is an energetic and at times sarcastic "human joke machine", and one of the comedy writers.  Amsterdam was recommended for the role by [[Rose Marie]] as soon as she had signed on to the series.  Buddy is constantly making fun of Mel Cooley, the show's producer, for being bald and dull.  His character is loosely based on [[Mel Brooks]] who also wrote for ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''.  He makes frequent jokes about his marriage to his wife, former showgirl Fiona "Pickles" Conway Sorrell, who is a terrible cook.  In several episodes, it is mentioned that Buddy is Jewish.  He was identified by his birth name, Moishe Selig, when he had his belated [[bar mitzvah]] in "Buddy Sorrell – Man and Boy."  Buddy plays the cello, which he sometimes incorporates into his comedy routines, and owns a large [[German Shepherd]] named Larry.  Buddy made a guest appearance on the ''[[Danny Thomas Show]]'' episode, "The Woman Behind the Jokes" that aired October 21, 1963.
* '''Sally Rogers''' ([[Rose Marie]]) – Sally is another of the comedy writers, and the designated typist, who is always on the lookout for a husband.  The character was loosely based on [[Selma Diamond]] and Lucille Kallen, both writers for ''Your Show of Shows.''  She never drinks and quotes frequently from her "Aunt Agnes in Cleveland".  She has an on-again/off-again relationship with her boyfriend Herman Glimscher, who seems to be too much of a mama's boy to get married.  She frequently scares men off with her sense of humor and strong personality.
* '''Richard Rosebud "Ritchie" Petrie''' ([[Larry Mathews]]) – Rob and Laura's son. His middle name is an acronym for "Robert Oscar Sam Edward Benjamin Ulysses David," all the names suggested by members of Rob and Laura's families in the episode "What's in a Middle Name?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Vince|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Episode Guide|isbn=978-1-56976-839-6|pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ann Morgan - Dick Van Dyke Show.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ann Morgan Guilbert]] alongside Mary Tyler Moore]]

'''Supporting''':
* '''Melvin "Mel" Cooley''' ([[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]]) – Mel is the balding producer of ''The Alan Brady Show'' and Alan Brady's brother-in-law.  Though Mel can often be an obsequiously sycophantic yes-man to the demanding Brady, he is also shown to be a dedicated, competent producer who takes his responsibilities very seriously.  Mel is constantly at odds with Buddy, who often makes insulting comments about Mel's baldness, to which Mel often responds with a simple "Yechh!"  
* '''Millie Helper''' ([[Ann Morgan Guilbert]]) – Millie the Petries' neighbor and Laura's best friend from their days in the USO.
* '''Jerry Helper''' ([[Jerry Paris]]) – Jerry the Petries' neighbor, Millie's husband, Rob's best friend and dentist.  He is an avid sailor, audiophile, and electronics and recording enthusiast.
* '''Alan Brady''' ([[Carl Reiner]]) – Alan the egocentric, demanding, high maintenance, toupee-wearing star of ''The Alan Brady Show''.  Originally an [[unseen character]], then shown only with his back to the camera or only in voice, Brady began to make full-face appearances in season four.  

'''Recurring''':
* '''Stacey Petrie''' ([[Jerry Van Dyke]]) – Rob's brother, played by Dick Van Dyke's real-life brother. Stacey – a quiet, shy, man – is prone to episodes of [[sleepwalking]], during which he becomes, literally, the [[banjo]]-playing life of the party, and calls his brother Rob "Burford".  He wrote love letters on behalf of his friend, a drummer named James Garner (not the famous actor) to a girl named Julie.  Once Garner lost interest, Stacey continued to write to Julie as Garner because he had fallen in love with her.  He confesses the truth, and eventually Julie becomes interested in getting to know him.
* '''Fiona "Pickles" Conway Sorrell''' (Barbara Perry/[[Joan Shawlee]]) – Buddy's slightly nutty wife and former [[showgirl]].  Pickle's first marriage was to a convicted con man who threatens to tell Buddy she was married to a jailbird unless she bribes him regularly.  She becomes an off-screen character after season two.
* '''Herman Glimscher''' ([[Bill Idelson]]) – Sally's occasional and nerdy boyfriend.  In the 2004 reunion special, Sally and Herman had been married for years (In an early episode, Sally mentioned having dated a Woodrow Glimscher, presumably a relative, until Woodrow's overbearing mother arranged for her to date Herman instead.)
* '''Sam (or Edward) Petrie''' – ([[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]]/[[J. Pat O'Malley]]/[[Tom Tully]]) – Rob and Stacey's father, Laura's father-in-law, and Clara's husband.
* '''Clara Petrie''' – (Carol Veazie/[[Isabel Randolph]]) – Rob's and Stacey's mother, Laura's mother-in-law, and Sam's wife.  Clara doesn't like Laura, partly because Laura and Rob married quickly without either set of parents attending the wedding.
* '''Mr. and Mrs. Alan Meehan''' – ([[Carl Benton Reid]] and Geraldine Wall) are Laura's parents.
* '''Freddie Helper'''  ([[Peter Oliphant]]) – Millie and Jerry Helper's son and Ritchie's best friend.
* '''Sol/Sam Pomeroy/Pomerantz''' – Rob's army buddy in flashback episodes, was originally played by [[Marty Ingels]].  The character's names changed over the course of the series.  Ingels left the role in 1962 to star in ''[[I'm Dickens, He's Fenster]]''.  In 1963, the character was played by two actors, [[Allan Melvin]] and [[Henry Calvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldron|first=Vince|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Episode Guide|isbn=978-1-56976-839-6|pages=291, 299, 303, 320, 334, 351, 361, 377, 379, 383, 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Delivery boy''' – originally a nameless character played by [[Jamie Farr]] in four season one episodes.  Subsequently, he was given the name Willie, and [[Herbie Faye]] played the role (Faye also played other characters in later episodes).
* '''Mrs. Billings''' ([[Eleanor Audley]]) – the head of the local [[Parent-Teacher Association]], who shoehorns Rob into writing and directing their annual fundraising shows.

A group of character actors played several different roles during the five seasons.  Actors who appeared more than once, sometimes in different roles, included Elvia Allman (as Herman Glimscher's mother), [[Tiny Brauer]], Bella Bruck, Jane Dulo, [[Herbie Faye]], [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]], [[Dabbs Greer]], Jerry Hausner, [[Peter Hobbs (actor)|Peter Hobbs]], [[Jackie Joseph]], [[Sandy Kenyon]] (who also appeared in the 2004 reunion special), [[Alvy Moore]], [[Isabel Randolph]], Burt Remsen, Johnny Silver, [[Doris Singleton]], [[Amzie Strickland]], George Tyne, [[Herb Vigran]] and [[Len Weinrib]]. Frank Adamo, who served as Van Dyke's personal assistant and stand-in, also played small roles throughout the show's five seasons.

==Production==
[[File:Dick Van Dyke 1965.JPG|thumb|Rob throws his hat into the ring in the election for city councilman, 1965]]

Many of the show's plots were inspired by Reiner's experiences as a writer for ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'' and ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'', both of  which starred [[Sid Caesar]]. Reiner based the character of Rob Petrie on himself, but Rob's [[egocentric]] boss Alan Brady is not based on Caesar, but is a combination of the abrasive [[Milton Berle]] and [[Jackie Gleason]], according to Reiner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/11/20/PK7E1AE3AI.DTL&amp;type=moviies John Clark, "'2,000 Year Old Man' still [[kicking]] on new DVD", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Nov. 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS had intended to cancel the show after its first season, but [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] threatened to pull its advertising from "the network's extremely lucrative daytime lineup" and the show was renewed, keeping its Wednesday night time slot.&lt;ref&gt;[P. 170 of The official Dick Van Dyke show book: the definitive history and ultimate... By Vince Waldron]&lt;/ref&gt; The show jumped into the top 10 by the third episode of its second season, helped by coming directly after ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', the number one show at the time.

===Crossovers===
*On October 21, 1963, Morey Amsterdam guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell during the final season of ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'' on the episode "The Woman Behind the Jokes".
*Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam reprised their roles on October 7, 1993 in the "When Hairy Met Hermy" episode of ''[[Herman's Head]]''.
*Carl Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady on the February 16, 1995 episode of ''[[Mad About You]]'', a guest appearance that won him the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series]].

==Theme==
The show's theme was by [[Earle Hagen]], who also wrote many other TV series themes, including those for ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, USMC]]'', ''[[I Spy (film)|I Spy]]'', and ''[[The Mod Squad]]''.

[[File:Dick van dyke show 1962.JPG|thumb|225px|While his wife is away, Buddy becomes the Petries' houseguest.]]

In a 2010 interview on [[National Public Radio]], Van Dyke revealed Morey Amsterdam's lyrics for the show's theme song:

:So you think that you've got troubles?
:Well, trouble's a bubble
:So tell old Mr. Trouble to get lost!

:Why not hold your head up high and
:Stop cryin', start tryin'
:And don't forget to keep your fingers crossed.

:When you find the joy of livin'
:Is lovin' and givin'
:You'll be there when the winning dice are tossed.

:A smile is just a frown that's turned upside down
:So smile, and that frown will defrost.

:And don't forget to keep your fingers crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Van Dyke Plays Not My Job (October 23, 2010) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130739954 NPR.org archive] Retrieved September 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast reunions==
* In a special that was first broadcast on April 13, 1969, Van Dyke and Moore reunited for a one-hour variety special called ''Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman.'' The program included a never-before-seen alternate take from one of the show's episodes in which Rob Petrie breaks down and cries after being dismissed from a film role.
* A 1979 episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Hour]]'' featured Van Dyke and Moore reprising their roles as the Petries in a short sketch presented as the brainstorming of Van Dyke (guest-starring as himself) and the writers of Mary McKinnon's (Moore) variety series, who noted McKinnon's resemblance to "the gal who played Laura Petrie".
* In a 1995 episode of the sitcom ''[[Mad About You]]'', Carl Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady, appearing in a documentary by Paul Buchmann ([[Paul Reiser]]) about the early days of television.  The episode included several other references to ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' including a scene in which Reiner and Reiser discuss whether it would be funnier to trip over an ottoman or to step over it at the last moment. 
* In 2003, TV Land produced ''The Alan Brady Show,'' an animated special presented as an episode of ''Dick Van Dyke''{{'}}s show-within-a-show.  Reiner, Van Dyke, and Rose Marie contributed voice performances to the show.  
* A 2004 reunion special, ''The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited,'' brought together the surviving members of the cast.  In this continuation, hosted by [[Ray Romano]], Rob and Laura have long since moved to Manhattan, where Laura runs a dance studio. (Ritchie has recently bought their old New Rochelle home.) Alan Brady re-enters their lives to ask Rob to write his eulogy, with the help of a happily-married Sally Rogers Glimscher.

==In popular culture==
*In 2003, [[TV Land]] produced a pilot for an animated TV series, ''The Alan Brady Show'', based on the fictional show-within-a-show on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show''. Written and executive-produced by Carl Reiner, it was scheduled to air on August 17, 2003, and featured the voices of Rose Marie as "The Secretary" and Dick Van Dyke as "Webb", with Reiner reprising his role as Alan Brady.&lt;ref&gt;Keneney, Bill. [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-06-25-toons_x.htm "Toons with a lot more 'tude"] ''[[USA Today]]'' (June 26, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0377346|The Alan Brady Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Holy Crap]]", the second episode of the second season of the animated TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', first broadcast on September 30, 1999,  features a parody of the opening of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' where Rob Petrie ([[Dick Van Dyke]]) falls over an ottoman.  In the parody, Petrie has a series of progressively more serious and dangerous accidents, until someone finally turns the TV off. In "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]", the 14th episode of season four, first broadcast on November 6, 2005, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] censors the opening credits of ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', blacking out both "Dick" and "Dyke", because of their alternate meanings of "penis" and "lesbian".

'''''The Final Cut''''' is a 2004 [[science fiction]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Omar Naim]]. It stars [[Robin Williams]], [[Jim Caviezel]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Mimi Kuzyk]], [[Stephanie Romanov]], [[Genevieve Buechner]] and [[Brendan Fletcher]]. The film takes place in a setting where memory implants make it possible to record entire lives. Williams plays a professional who specializes in editing the memories of unsavory people into uncritical memorials that are played at funerals.

The film won the award for best screenplay at the [[Deauville American Film Festival]] and was nominated for best film at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] and [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
A brief introduction describes "cutters", who edit the collected memories of the recently dead into [[feature length]] memorials that are viewed by loved ones at funerals. Their code forbids them to have the requisite implant or to sell memories.

The film opens with Alan Hakman as a child. While visiting a city with his parents, he meets another boy, Louis, and the two bond as they play together. Louis reluctantly joins Hakman in exploring an abandoned factory, and Hakman crosses a wooden plank suspended high above the ground. Goaded by Hakman, Louis also attempts to cross the plank, but he loses his confidence and falls. Hakman races to the ground and panics when he steps in what he thinks is Louis' blood. Hakman flees the scene and tells no one what happened.  Later that day, he leaves the city with his parents.

Years later, Hakman ([[Robin Williams]]) is a skilled cutter who specializes in editing the memories of controversial people into [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. When Fletcher ([[Jim Caviezel]]), a former cutter, confronts him at a [[funeral]], Hakman describes himself as a [[sin-eater]], who brings redemption to the immoral. Fletcher offers him $500,000 for the memories of his latest client, wealthy businessman Charles Bannister, but Hakman refuses. In a later meeting, Fletcher demands the memory recordings so that he can use Bannister, who he suspects was a [[pedophile]], as a [[scandal]] to shut down EYE Tech. Hakman again refuses, and, worried for his safety, uses his knowledge from memory tapes to shake down a shady criminal for a pistol.

As Hakman works through Bannister's memories, he encounters a scene that implies that Bannister was [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] his daughter, Isabel. Hakman wordlessly deletes it and presses on. He eventually comes upon a person that he is convinced must be his childhood friend Louis. Excited, he sets up a meeting with Bannister's family to find out more information. Bannister's wife is dismissive, but Isabel reveals that the man, recently dead of a car crash, was a teacher named Louis Hunt. Hoping that Hunt had an implant, Hakman organizes a break-in at EYE Tech, but they have no record of Hunt. Instead, Hakman finds a file on himself, which he is surprised to find documents his parents' purchase of an implant for him.

In his distress, Hakman turns to his lover, Delila. At his apartment, he shows her the equipment that he uses to view memories, and he demonstrates surreal footage from a defective implant. He leaves her alone as he seeks help from anti-implant protestors, who have discovered a way to block the implant through specialized [[body modification]]. When he returns to his apartment, he assumes that Fletcher has broken in; instead, Delila confronts him after having found memory tapes that document her prior relationship. She accuses him of [[voyeurism]] and angrily destroys his memory viewer, which results in Bannister's files also being damaged.

Fletcher and his associate finally break in, but they find nothing. Hakman tells Bannister's wife that the footage was lost in an accident, and she feigns disappointment, content to let dirty secrets stay hidden. Hakman asks his colleagues to recover live footage, a potentially deadly process. They agree, but admonish him that he can never cut memories again; a cutter with an implant is a violation of the "Cutter's code". The resulting memories show Hakman attempt to dissuade Louis from crossing the plank and stepping in red paint, not blood. Hakman, relieved, visits Hunt's grave but is confronted again by Fletcher, who has learned about Hakman's implant. After chasing Hakman through the graveyard, he hesitates and seems willing to let Hakman go; however, Fletcher's associate kills Hakman.

In the last scene, Fletcher loads Hakman's memories into a viewer and promises to use them for the greater good. As he pages through Hakman's memories, looking for evidence of Bannister's guilt, he sees Hakman watching himself in a mirror, and the memory implant lingers on the scene after Hakman has left.

[[File:Briny Beach.jpg|thumb|right|''The Walrus and the Carpenter speaking to the Oysters'', as portrayed by illustrator [[John Tenniel]]]]

"'''The Walrus and the Carpenter'''" is a [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Lewis Carroll]] that appeared in his book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', published in December 1871. The poem is recited in [[s:Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There/Chapter IV|chapter four]], by [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] to [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]. The poem is composed of 18 [[stanza]]s and contains 108 lines, in an alternation of [[iambic trimeter]]s and [[iambic tetrameter]]s. The [[rhyme scheme]] is ABCBDB, with [[masculine rhyme]]s throughout. The rhyming and rhythmical scheme used, as well as some archaisms and syntactical turns, are those of the traditional English [[ballad]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Summary==
[[File:Walrus and Carpenter.jpg|thumb|right|"If seven maids with seven mops{{br}}
&amp;nbsp; Swept it for half a year,{{br}}
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,{{br}}
&amp;nbsp; "That they could get it clear?"{{br}}
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,{{br}}
&amp;nbsp; And shed a bitter tear.]]

The [[Walrus]] and the [[Carpentry|Carpenter]] are the [[Wiktionary:eponymous#Etymology|eponymous]] characters in the poem, which is recited by Tweedledum and Tweedledee to Alice. Walking upon a beach one night when both sun and moon are visible, the Walrus and Carpenter come upon an offshore bed of [[oyster]]s. Groups of four are called up; the exact number is unknown. To the disapproval of the eldest oyster, many more follow them. After walking along the beach (a point is made of the fact that the oysters are all neatly shod despite having no feet), the two main characters are revealed to be predatory and eat all of the oysters. After hearing the poem, the good-natured Alice attempts to determine which of the two leading characters might be the more sympathetic, but is thwarted by the twins' further interpretation:

{{quotation|"I like the Walrus best," said Alice, "because you see he was a ''little'' sorry for the poor oysters."{{br}}{{br}}
"He ate more than the Carpenter, though," said Tweedledee. "You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how many he took: contrariwise."{{br}}{{br}}
"That was mean!" Alice said indignantly. "Then I like the Carpenter best—if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus."{{br}}{{br}}
"But he ate as many as he could get," said Tweedledum.{{br}}{{br}}
This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, "Well! They were ''both'' very unpleasant characters—"|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''}}

The characters of the Walrus and the Carpenter have been interpreted many ways both in literary criticism and popular culture. Some, including the character Loki in the film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', interpret the Walrus to be a [[caricature]] of the [[Buddha]] and the Carpenter to be a caricature of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name="SantanaErickson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard W. Santana|author2=Gregory Erickson|title=Religion and Popular Culture: Rescripting the Sacred|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZpYxZDsuHQC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3553-1|pages=89, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; British essayist [[J. B. Priestley]] argued that the figures were political,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Walter Russell Mead]], who utilises the Walrus and the Carpenter as an allegory for Britain and the United States respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God and Gold|last=Mead|first=Walter Russell|publisher=Atlantic Books|year=2007|isbn=978 1 84354 724 2|location=London|pages=43-45|quote=As the poem opens, the Walrus and the Carpenter—who, we can suppose, allegorically and respectively represent Britain and the United States—have worked themselves into a typically Protestant and Anglo-Saxon froth of transcendental idealism.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[The Annotated Alice]]'', [[Martin Gardner]] notes that, when Carroll gave the manuscript for ''Looking Glass'' to illustrator [[John Tenniel]], he gave him the choice of drawing a [[carpenter]], a [[butterfly]], or a [[baronet]], since each word would fit the poem's [[Meter (poetry)|metre]]. Because Tenniel rather than Carroll chose the carpenter, the character's significance in the poem is probably not in his profession, and interpretations of the poem as a commentary on religion are likely false. Gardner cautions the reader that there is not always intended symbolism in the ''Alice'' books, which were made for the imagination of children and not the analysis of "mad people".

[[File:The Walrus &amp; The Carpenter London 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Pub on Monument Street, London]]
* In the 1934 [[Betty Boop]] short film ''[[Betty in Blunderland]]'', the Carpenter is using a hammer on a saw with two [[lobster]]s and three [[clam]]s and the Walrus is on a board eating [[fish]]es out of a [[aquarium|fishbowl]].
* In the Doctor Who episode, "Rings of Akhaten", the Doctor mentions "Shoes and ships and sealing-wax and cabbages and kings", when talking about things made by the stars.
* In the XKCD comic entitled, "Click and Drag", a character recites a version combining the poem with the Lord of The Rings trilogy, saying, ""The time has come', the Walrus said, and put on Sauron's ring."
* "The Walrus and the Carpenter" song is sung by [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]] in the 1951 Disney film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' with the moon and the sun on each side and the oysters. The Walrus is portrayed as an intelligent, but lazy conman, with the Carpenter as a hardworking, but dimwitted sidekick who needs beating with a cane for acting before thinking. All characters in the story are voiced by [[J. Pat O'Malley]]. After the Carpenter discovers a family of oysters underwater, the Walrus tries to persuade them to come "walk" with them. The Mother Oyster, on the other hand, knows that the current month is March, one of the 8&amp;nbsp;months with the letter "R" in which oysters are eaten. She tries to convince her children to stay in the sea, but the Walrus (refusing to take no for an answer) shuts her up (literally) and leads the dozen curious, younger oysters in a [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]]-like dance and flute solo ashore, where the Carpenter builds a restaurant from a shipwreck on the beach in six seconds. Once everyone is inside, the Walrus (who somehow doesn't want to share) tricks the Carpenter into preparing some food so that he can eat all the oysters himself (off screen). When the Carpenter returns to find every last oyster devoured and that the Walrus has tricked him, his face turns red with anger and he chases the Walrus outside with his hammer. In the final parts of the film, the Walrus and the Carpenter are among those who join the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] into chasing after Alice.
* A line from the poem was used by [[O. Henry]] for the title of his 1904 book ''[[Cabbages and Kings (literature)|Cabbages and Kings]]''.
* Lines were used as clues in the [[Ellery Queen]] mystery story "The Adventure of the Mad Tea-Party".
* The surreal short story "The Sea was Wet as Wet Could Be" by [[Gahan Wilson]], first published in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1967, was inspired by the poem and includes large portions of it.
* In [[the Beatles]] song "[[I Am the Walrus]]", the walrus refers to the walrus in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties|last1=MacDonald|first1=Ian|date=2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press|year=|isbn=978-1-55652-733-3|location=Chicago, IL|page=268|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lennon]] later expressed dismay upon belatedly realising that the walrus was a villain in the poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheff|first1=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|date=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0-312-25464-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the play ''Journey's End'' by R. C. Sheriff, the character Osborne quotes the poem to Raleigh before going to the trenches.
* ''[[Harriet the Spy (film)|Harriet the Spy]]'', a 1996 adaptation of the [[Louise Fitzhugh]] novel, shows lead character Harriet and her nanny (played by [[Rosie O'Donnell]]) reciting alternating lines of the poem to each other on multiple occasions.
* A line from the poem was used as the title of the book ''Why The Sea Is Boiling Hot: A Symposium On The Church And The World'' (Ryerson Press, 1965). It was a collection of essays by a group of leading literary and political writers concerning the place of the church in 1960s Canadian society, commissioned by the then-Board of Evangelism and Social Service of the United Church of Canada.
* The [[Jack Warden]] character "Doc" in the [[John Wayne]] and [[Lee Marvin]] film ''[[Donovan's Reef]]'', quotes part of the poem to his visiting daughter from Boston, who looks down her society nose at the lifestyles of the people who live on the island.
* In "[[The Clocks]]" by [[Agatha Christie]], [[Hercule Poirot]] quotes part of the poem to his visiting mentee, Colin Lamb, who is trying to find the importance of clocks found at a murder scene.
* The Lucy Maud Montgomery character "Anne" quotes the part of this poem when talking about things she might learn in college in the book ''Anne of the Island''.
* In the ''[[Ultimate Muscle]]'' manga series the villainous wrestler and superman Neptuneman tells the tale to the good-natured Seiuchin (a walrus-themed hero and wrestler), driving him to embrace his own predatory nature and start displaying an egotistical streak.
* One of the stories in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' collection ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]]'', published in 1998, was named "Of Cabbages And Kings", a line taken from the poem.
* In the 1999 film ''[[Dogma]]'', the Matt Damon character Loki tells a nun this story as his reason for becoming atheist. 
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', the poem is playfully quoted as "'The time has come,' said Dr. Dimitri Moisevitch to his old friend Heywood Floyd, 'to talk of many things. Of shoes and spaceships and sealing wax, but mostly of monoliths and malfunctioning computers.'" in reference to the events from ''[[2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.
* In [[Sandra Cisneros]]'s novel ''[[The House on Mango Street]]'', Esperanza recites the poem to Ruthie in the vignette "Edna's Ruthie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The House on Mango Street|last1=Cisneros|first1=Sandra|date=1997|publisher=Jane Schaffer Publications|year=|isbn=9780679734772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' episode "The Night of the Underground Terror", James West briefly quotes from the poem when he first meets the episode's villain.
* The poem inspired the song "Just One Lifetime" by Sting and Shaggy off their album 44/876.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">'''''Torrent of Portyngale''''' is a [[Middle English]] [[chivalric romance|romance]], composed around 1400, probably in the north Midlands. It is written in 12-line tail-rhyme stanzas, with the [[rhyme scheme]] AABCCBDDBEEB, and is number 983 in the ''[[Index of Middle English Verse]]''. It is possible that it draws some inspiration from the Middle English ''[[Sir Eglamour of Artois]]''. The romance survives only in the fifteenth-century East-Midland manuscript Manchester, [[Chetham's Library]], MS 8009 (folios 76r-119v). The romance describes the tortuous efforts of the young earl's son Torrent to win the hand of Desonell, daughter of King Colomond of Portugal, against her father's wishes. Amongst other feats, Torrent fights five giants on different occasions and travels to Jerusalem. The romance ends with Torrent and Desonell's marriage and the uniting of their family.&lt;ref&gt;'Torrent of Portyngale', in ''The Database of Middle English Romance'' (University of York, 2012), http://www.middleenglishromance.org.uk/mer/63.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been characterised as 'perhaps the most critically neglected member of the Middle English verse romances'.&lt;ref&gt;Keith David Montgomery, 'Torrent of Portyngale: a critical edition' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Auckland, 2008), abstract, http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4542.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victoria Monks''' (1 November 1884 – 1927) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[music hall]] [[singer]] of the early 20th century.  During the [[Edwardian]] and [[World War I|First World War]] eras she performed and recorded popular songs such as "Take Me Back to London Town" and "Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey".

==Life and career==
Monks was born in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]] on 1 November 1884, the daughter of Charles Monks.&lt;ref name=WHO1916/&gt;&lt;ref name=CENSUS1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=BIRTHPLACE/&gt; She was educated in both [[England]] and [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=WHO1916/&gt; In 1899 she made her first stage appearance as "Little Victoria"; her first appearance in [[London]] was at the [[Oxford Music Hall]] on 9 March 1903.&lt;ref name=WHO1916/&gt;  She went on to appear in all the leading Music Halls, both in London and the provinces.  She married the American songwriter and Music Hall manager Karl F. Hooper and by 1911, they were living in [[Lambeth]], [[London]] with a daughter.&lt;ref name=WHO1916/&gt;&lt;ref name=CENSUS1911/&gt; In 1915 she was prevented from working following an accident which involved a stage door at one of the [[Moss Empires]] theatres; she became bankrupt shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=GHERALD/&gt;

She died in London in 1927 and is buried in [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery]] near [[Harlesden]], London.&lt;ref name=ALLOYD/&gt; Her great-granddaughter Chloe Hooper was born in Basingstoke and grew up in [[Silchester]] – she is both an international vocalist and Tribute Act today.

'''White power music''' is music that promotes [[white nationalism]]. It encompasses various music styles, including [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], experimental music and [[folk music|folk]].&lt;ref name=Messner&gt;Messner, Beth A., Art Jipson, Paul J. Becker and Bryan Byers. 2007.[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a782004590 "The Hardest Hate: A Sociological Analysis of Country Hate Music: From Rebel Records to Prussian Blue: A History of White Racialist Music in the United States"]. ''Popular Music and Society''. 30(4):513-531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Ethnomusicologist [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]] argues that white power music "can be defined by lyrics that demonize variously conceived non-whites and advocate racial pride and solidarity. Most often, however, insiders conceptualized white power music as the combination of those themes with pounding rhythms and a charging punk or metal-based accompaniment."&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin R. "Saga's Sorrow: Femininities of Despair in the Music of Radical White Nationalism. Ethnomusicology 58(3). {{jstor|10.5406/ethnomusicology.58.3.0405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genres include [[Nazi punk]], [[Rock Against Communism]], and [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Pulera, Dominic J.,''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pp. 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Perry writes that contemporary white supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Barbara, ''Hate Crimes'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009) {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the Internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'' ,Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, Anne, ''Race Hate''(Evans Brothers, 2006), {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in ''Popular Music and Society'' says "musicians believe not only that music could be a successful vehicle for their specific ideology but that it also could advance the movement by framing it in a positive manner."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;

Dominic J. Pulera writes that the music is more pervasive in some countries in Europe than it is in the United States, despite some European countries banning or curtailing its distribution.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; European governments regularly deport "extremist aliens", ban white power bands and raid ''organizations'' that produce and distribute the music.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; In the United States, racist music is protected [[freedom of speech in the United States]] by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=eatwell&gt;Eatwell, Roger and Cas Mudde, ''Western democracies and the new extreme right challenge'' (Psychology Press, 2004) {{ISBN|0-415-36971-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-36971-8}}, pp. 54-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White power country music==
Country music has spawned several subgenres, including white racist country music — also referred to as ''segregationist music'' — which came about in response to the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|American civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, 2000a, 2002b.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs expressed resistance to the federal government and civil rights advocates who were challenging well-established white supremacist practices endemic in the  [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; There were also changes in the music recording industry in the 1940s and 1950s that allowed regional recording companies to form across the United States, addressing small specialized markets.&lt;ref name="Tucker, 1985"&gt;Tucker, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; B.C. Malone writes: "the struggles waged by black Americans to attain economic dignity and racial justice provided one of the ugliest chapters in country music history, an outpouring of racist records on small labels, mostly from [[Crowley, Louisiana]], which lauded the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and attacked [[African American]]s in the most vicious of stereotypical terms."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone (2002a), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists often adopted [[pseudonym]]s, and some of their music was "highly confrontational, making explicit use of [[List of ethnic slurs|racial epithets]], [[stereotype]]s and threats of [[violence]] against civil rights activists.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Much of the music "featured blatantly racist [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes that dehumanized African Americans]]", equating them with [[animal]]s or "using cartoonish imagery associated with "[[List of ethnic slurs|Jigaboos]]"".&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Becker, Jipson, and Byers (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics warned of "white violence" on African Americans if they insisted on being treated as equals.&lt;ref name="Messner, et al., 2007"&gt;Messner, et al., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs were [[dog-whistle politics|more subtle]], couching racist messages behind social critiques and political action calls.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; The lyrics, in the tradition of [[right-wing populism]], questioned the legitimacy of the federal government and rallied whites to protect "Southern rights" and traditions.&lt;ref name="Messner, et al., 2007"/&gt;  The song "[[Black Power]]" includes the lyrics:
{{quote|The ones who shout "Black Power" / Would bury you and me. / Yeah, the ones who shout "Black Power" / Should let our country be... / White men stand together and register to vote. / Don’t let them take way our land. / We’ve still got lots of hope.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;}}

===Reb Rebel Records===
In 1966, businessman Jay "J.D." Miller created a niche record label for his company, the defiantly [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] Reb Rebel Records. It was arguably the most notable of the racist country music record labels.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker, 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman, 2006"&gt;Herman, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Reb Rebel released 21 singles and ''For Segregationists Only'', an album of its ten  bestselling songs, four of which were Johnny Rebel's.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broven"&gt;Broven, John, ''South to Louisiana: The Music of the Cajun Bayous'' (Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican, 1983) p. 252, {{ISBN|0-88289-608-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label's first single, "Dear Mr. President" (referring to then-president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]), by Happy Fats (Leroy Leblanc), sold more than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Herman, 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The song parodied Johnson's [[Great Society]] programs, which aimed to eliminate [[poverty]] and racial injustice.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; Other songs were primarily about [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] or the [[Vietnam War]], "but they never really attacked [[black people]]."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The studio's second release, "Flight NAACP 105" by "the Son of Mississippi" (Joe Norris), was the label's bestseller; the track was a "spontaneous skit in the vein of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; It was the first in a series of "highly racist take-offs" of ''Amos n’ Andy''.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Few of Miller's racist records were played on the radio in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone (2002b) and Pittman (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Rebel===
[[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]], the pseudonym that Cajun country musician Clifford Joseph Trahane used on racist recordings issued in the 1960s, became the "forefather of white power music."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cajuns"&gt;Bernard, Shane K.,''The Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' (Jackson, Miss: University Press of Mississippi, 2003) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Rebel's six [[Single (music)|singles]] (12 songs altogether), frequently use the racial epithet ''[[nigger (word)|nigger]]'', and often voiced sympathy for [[racial segregation]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), such as his first B-side "Kajun Ku Klux Klan", which was a "cautionary tale centered on the story of 'Levi Coon' who dared to demand that he be served in a café."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, 2003; Johnny Rebel – Klassic Klan Kompositions.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were "vehemently anti-black, its pro-segregationist lyrics set to the twangs of the era's swampbilly craze."&lt;ref name="Pittman"&gt;Pittman, Nick, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071112091023/geocities.com/pittman1978/rebeltimes.html Johnny Rebel Speaks: The true-to-life story of how a South Louisiana man with a guitar and a belief became a forefather of white power music.]", in: ''Times of Acadiana'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], ca. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of bootlegged records and Internet interest, Johnny Rebel's career never ended; in the late 1990s he was rediscovered, and he re-released his music on CD and promoted it with his own website.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The site, however, did not spark new interest outside his fanbase until [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; Johnny Rebel recorded and released "Infidel Anthem", about "the whipping America should lay on Osama bin Laden," leading to an appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', where his new compilation CD and the new song were promoted.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; At the time, Stern's show had a peak audience of around 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Condran | first = Ed | title = Stern Producer Flourishes By The Skin Of His Teeth | publisher = ''[[The Morning Call]]'' |date= July 31, 1998 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/32538396.html?dids=32538396:32538396&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+31%2C+1998&amp;author=ED+CONDRAN+%28A+free-lance+story+for+The+Morning+Call%29&amp;pub=Morning+Call&amp;desc=STERN+PRODUCER+FLOURISHES+BY+THE+SKIN+OF+HIS+TEETH&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = James | first = Renee A. | title = Hmmm?

Michael Wade argues that Johnny Rebel "influenced British racist musicians, notably the band [[Skrewdriver]], which inspired other right-wing musicians."&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Michael, "Johnny Rebel and the Cajun Roots of Right-Wing Rock". ''Popular Music and Society''(2007) 30(4), 493-512. {{doi|10.1080/03007760701546364}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White power rock==
[[Nazi punk]] music is stylistically similar to most forms of [[punk rock]], although it differs by having lyrics that express hatred of [[Jew]]s, [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[communism|communists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[anti-racism|anti-racists]] and people who are not considered [[white people|white]], as opposed to the often left-wing lyrics of punk rock. In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] (NF) had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it included a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon.''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' Routledge, 1999. pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nazi punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s during the rise of the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock Against Communism]] movement originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 1978 with  activists associated with the NF. The most notable RAC band was [[Skrewdriver]], which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a [[white power skinhead]] band after the original lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/skrewdriverinterview.htm |title=Skrewdriver- A Fan's View |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |date=|accessdate=31 August 2010}}.&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/skrewdrivecuttings.htm |title=Skrewdriver- Press Cuttings |publisher= Punk77.co.uk |date= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.skrewdriver.net/diamond.html Diamond in the Dust - The Ian Stuart Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were the "most dominant white racial extremist band" and were idealized in the "emerging movement that arose in response to perceptions of political liberalism, diversity, and the loss of a power in the white community."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Skrewdriver advocated on behalf of [[Far-right politics|extreme right-wing]] and racist politics, and its frontman [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] identified himself as a [[History of British fascism since 1945|British neo-Nazi]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; The group performed mainly for other white power skinheads and "asserted the need for extremist political violence."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Bands that followed their lead also "fused racist ideology, heavy metal and hard rock styles", embracing "aggressive [[racism]] and [[ethnic nationalism]]".&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;

[[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM) is [[black metal]] that promotes [[Nazism|National Socialist (Nazi)]] beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. These beliefs often include: [[white supremacy]], [[racial segregation|racial separatism]], [[antisemitism]], [[heterosexism]], and Nazi interpretations of [[Germanic neopaganism|paganism]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism]] ([[Nazism and occultism|Nazi mysticism]]). According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see "national socialism as a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal.&lt;ref name="Gardell"&gt;Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307&lt;/ref&gt; Bands whose members hold Nazi beliefs but do not express these through their lyrics are generally not considered NSBM by black metal musicians, but are labelled as such in media reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html ''Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im "SO 36"'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some black metal bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, [[Neo-völkisch movements|völkisch]] [[pagan metal]] and neo-Nazism are the current trends in the black metal scene, and are affecting the broader metal scene.&lt;ref&gt;Unheilige Allianzen, page 290&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattias Gardell]], however, sees NSBM artists as a minority within black metal.&lt;ref name="Gardell"/&gt;
