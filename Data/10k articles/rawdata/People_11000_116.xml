The '''Aberdeen doctors''' or '''Doctors of Aberdeen''' were six [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divine]]s working at [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland in the seventeenth century. Until 1635, they enjoyed the leadership of [[Patrick Forbes]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]]. They are distinguished not only for their positions at Aberdeen, but also by their [[irenicism|irenicist]] opposition to the [[National Covenant of 1638]]. Their adherence to [[Episcopacy in the Church of Scotland|Episcopacy]] and their support for the [[Articles of the Assembly at Perth]] (1618), which prescribed several English forms of worship, form the backdrop of their opposition to the [[Presbyterian Covenanters]].

When Patrick Forbes was consecrated Bishop of Aberdeen in 1618, he [[Financial endowment|endowed]] a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] of divinity in each Aberdeen college. He revived the awarding of degrees in divinity which earlier Protestants had suppressed as [[prideful]] or as redolent of the Roman Catholic title [[Doctor of the Church]]. The early recipients of the [[Doctor of Divinity]] who stayed on to teach at the colleges became known as the "Aberdeen doctors".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dury]] wrote to the doctors seeking their opinion on the points of dispute between the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Their reply of 20 February 1637 was supported by [[Robert Baillie]] but opposed by [[Samuel Rutherford]]. On 20 July 1638, a deputation seeking Aberdeen's adhesion to February's National Covenant arrived, comprising the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]], [[Lord Cupar]], the [[Alexander Forbes, 10th Lord Forbes|Master of Forbes]], and Sir Thomas Burnett, Laird of Leyes representing the nobility; and [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], [[David Dickson (minister)|David Dickson]], and [[Andrew Cant (minister)|Andrew Cant]], the ministry. The doctors were prepared to adhere provided satisfactory answers were given to 14 written questions, termed "demands". The Covenanter ministers' "answers" were submitted the following day, prompting "replies" from the doctors and "second answers" from the Covenanters, who then left the town. The doctors issued further replies which they called "duplies", which went unanswered. All the texts were quickly printed and widely circulated and debated.

The doctors' obduracy contributed to the [[First Bishops' War]] of 1639 in which the Covenanters sought the submission of Aberdeen.

==List==
The six doctors who participated in the 1638 disputation were:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.45–48&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Leslie (theologian)|William Leslie]], Principal of King's College, leader after death of Bishop Forbes in 1635
* [[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes of Corse]], theologian at King's College and son of Bishop Forbes
* [[Alexander Scroggie]], scholar of King's College, Minister in [[Old Aberdeen]]
* [[Alexander Ross (Aberdeen doctor)|Alexander Ross]], Scholar of King's College, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[Robert Baron (theologian)|Robert Baron]], Professor of Divinity at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[James Sibbald]],  Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen

As well as Bishop Patrick Forbes, two other notable Aberdeen divines were associated with the six doctors:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.48–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Guild]], who subscribed to the six doctors' initial demands but then switched to the side of the Covenanters
* [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]], principal of Marischal until made [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] in 1634, months before his death

The '''Armand Preud'homme Museum''' was a museum  in [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]], [[Belgium]], that was dedicated to the Belgian composer [[Armand Preud'homme]] (1904-1986). From 1990 to 2018 the museum formed a combination with the Heemkundig Museum ([[local museum]]) upstairs, called the Dulle Griet Museum.&lt;ref name="GVB"&gt;Geert Van Baelen, [http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20180406_03450908 ‘Ooit kwamen hier achthonderd groepen per jaar, nu nog twee’], 7 April 2018, De Standaard {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preud'homme was born in this house, when his father was a teacher and head of the municipal boys school. The land of the house and the school was acquired by the municipality on 3 April 1859. It was developed by the provincial underarchitect {{ill|Herman Jaminé|nl}} and built from 1860 to 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Agentschap Onroerend Erfgoed, [https://id.erfgoed.net/erfgoedobjecten/80670 Onderwijzerswoning en geboortehuis van toondichter A. Preud'homme], 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Preud'homme was an organist and composed hundreds of songs and [[operetta]]s on themes like connectivity of people and the nostalgia for his birth region. His most popular operetta was ''Op de purp'ren hei'' and his most popular song ''Kempenland''; the latter one was popular during the occupation of the [[Second World War]] as march music for paramilitary groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dewilde" /&gt;Jan Dewilde, [http://www.svm.be/content/preud-homme-armand Preud' homme, Armand], Studiecentrum voor Vlaamse Muziek {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded by Jaak Geuns and was largely run by volunteers.&lt;ref name="GVB" /&gt; It showed belongings of the musician, like his [[grand piano]], news paper articles, photographs, and [[sheet music]] of his most famous songs and operettas.&lt;ref&gt;Openbaar Vlaams Kunstbezit, [http://museumprijs.be/musea/armand-preud%E2%80%99homme-museum Armand Preud’homme museum] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of groups visiting the museum went down from eight hundred per year at the beginning to just a couple in 2018. In this year the municipality of Peer decided to close both museums.&lt;ref name="GVB" /&gt; On this site it planned appartments and a service center.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Gazet, [https://www.internetgazet.be/peer/openbaar-park-op-oude-schoolsite.aspx Openbaar park op oude schoolsite], 6 november 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[literary technique]], an '''author surrogate''' is a [[fictional character]] based on the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pandey | first = Ashish | year = 2005 | title = Academic Dictionary Of Fiction | publisher = Isha Books | page = 18 | isbn = 8182052629}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, authors insert themselves under their own name into their works, typically for humorous or surrealistic effect.

==Usage==
===Fiction===
Frequently, the author surrogate is the same as the [[main character]] and/or the [[protagonist]], and is also often the [[narrator]]. As an example, the author surrogate may be the one who delivers political diatribe, expressing the author's beliefs at an appropriate time, or expound on the strengths and weaknesses of other characters, thereby communicating directly the author's opinion on the characters in question. Philosophers may use author-surrogates to express their personal positions, especially if these are unpopular or run counter to established views. British writer [[David Hume]] used the author-surrogate 'Philo' in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''. Philonous was the author-surrogate of the Irish philosopher George Berkeley in his work ''Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous''. [[Michael Crichton]] used his character Ian Malcolm to express views on catastrophic system failure in his novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''. Perhaps the best-known philosophical author-surrogate is [[Socrates]] in the writings of [[Plato]]. 

A surrogate's life may be very similar to that of the author. Like his creator, Peter Marlowe—a character in [[James Clavell]]'s novels—wrote about his experience as a prisoner of war with the Japanese during World War II, became a Hollywood writer, and visited Hong Kong to research a book on its [[trading company|trading companies]].&lt;ref name="bernstein19810913"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/13/magazine/making-of-a-literary-shogun.html |title=Making of a Literary Shogun |last=Bernstein |first=Paul |date=1981-09-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-03-15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most stories have an author surrogate, insofar as the author is usually capable of pointing to one character (major or minor) whom he or she identifies with to a much greater degree than any other character. This can take the form of a realistic depiction of the author (Benjamin in ''[[Animal Farm]]''), or a negative ([[Woody Allen]] in many of his films) or positive depiction of the author.  [[Steve Gerber]] depicted himself saving the universe in his final issue of ''[[Man-Thing]]'' for [[Marvel Comics]], and [[Chris Claremont]] did the same, while Gerber's act was passive and Claremont's had him merge briefly with the title character.&lt;ref&gt;Man-Thing #22; Man-Thing (vol. 2) #11&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, the authors had other characters that were more traditional author surrogates, [[Richard Rory]] and Jonh Daltry.  In ''[[Animal Man]]'', [[Grant Morrison]] appears as the author who controls the title characters actions. For example, he tells Buddy Baker that the next writer could have him eating meat (which in fact did happen, in a bizarre set of circumstances), and Buddy says, "But I don't eat meat," to which Morrison retorts, "No, '''I''' don't eat meat."&lt;ref&gt;Grant Morrison. ''Animal Man:  Deus Ex Machina'' DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombian author and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Gabriel García Márquez]] appears near the end of his own book, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''. He is just a minor character in the novel.

===Fan fiction===
{{main|Mary Sue}}
Author surrogacy is a frequently observed phenomenon in hobbyist and amateur writing, so much so that [[fan fiction]] critics have evolved the term [[Mary Sue]] to refer to an idealized author surrogate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Mary Sue' is thought to evoke the cliché of the adolescent author who uses writing as a vehicle for the indulgence of self-idealization rather than entertaining others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Chander, A., &amp; Sunder, M. (2007). Everyone's a Superhero: A Cultural Theory of "Mary Sue" Fan Fiction as Fair Use. California Law Review, 95(2), 597-626. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/20439103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For male author surrogates, similar names such as 'Marty Stu' or 'Gary Stu' are occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luc Reid|title=Talk the Talk: The Slang of 65 American Subcultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0hRbvV2yEC&amp;pg=PA300|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=4 September 2006|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-59963-375-6|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Harper|title=Writing the Paranormal Novel: Techniques and Exercises for Weaving Supernatural Elements Into Your Story.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y80Cr__mKlkC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=18 February 2011|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=978-1-59963-301-5|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The expression has also been used in a different sense, meaning the ''principal author'' of a multi-author document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/8290.html | title=9/11 Report As An Award-Winning Historical Narrative | work=The New York Times | date=October 24, 2004 | accessdate=September 16, 2016 | author=Thomas Crampton |via=History News Network | quote=''Call me an author surrogate, not an author,'' Mr. Zelikow said moments before speaking about the book before the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles.

'''''Baixing''''' ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:百|百]][[Wikt:姓|姓]]|p=bǎixìng|l=hundred surnames}} or '''''lao baixing''''' ({{zh|c=老百姓|l=old hundred surnames}}) is a term in Chinese meaning "the people", or "commoners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lee|first= Philip |title=250 Essential Chinese Characters for Everyday Use|publisher=# Publisher: Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd. |date= June 2003 |pages=Page 25|isbn= 978-0-8048-3359-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XclXGDyToqoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22laobaixing%22&amp;lr=&amp;hl=zh-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''lao'' ({{zh|c=老|l=old}}) is often added before "baixing" to give the term a more affectionate tone.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Chinese family names are [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], passed from father to children. Chinese women, after marriage, typically retain their birth surname. Historically, however, only Chinese men possessed ''xìng'' ({{zh|c=姓|l=family name}}), in addition to ''shì'' ({{zh|c=氏|l=clan}}); the women had only the latter, and took on their husband's ''xìng'' after marriage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Legendary origin==
{{tone|section|date=January 2015}}
{{See also|Yellow Emperor|Shennong|Chi You}}
{{clarify span|Thousands of years ago,|date=January 2015}} along the plain of the [[Yellow River]], there lived several large tribes, including the [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi tribes]] ({{zh|c=黄帝族}}), [[Shennong|Yandi tribes]] ({{zh|c=炎帝族}}), [[Yi people|Yi tribes]] ({{zh|c=夷族}}), and the [[Jiuli tribe]]s ({{zh|c=九黎族}}). After {{clarify span|many years of tribal wars|date=January 2015}}, the [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi tribes]], [[Shennong|Yandi tribes]] and the [[Yi people|Yi tribes]] formed an alliance which consisted of roughly 100 tribes, hence the origin of the Baixing {{zh|c=百姓}}, or the "hundred surnames". The three-tribe-alliance won the war over the Jiuli tribe, and the war captives became slaves of the alliance, hence the origin of the term Limin ({{zh|c=黎民}}), who were formerly of the Jiuli tribe.

==History==
During the [[Western Zhou]], Baixing came to mean "slaveowners" and Limin their slaves. {{clarify span|Over thousands of years|date=January 2015}}, the terms Baixing and Limin came to refer to the same thing, the common people.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

'''Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury''' ({{lang-ar|بطرس الخوري}}, 1907 – 18 November 1984) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[businessman]], [[banker]] and [[industrialist]]. A successful [[self-made man]], Khoury managed to build a large commercial and industrial empire, and was one of Lebanon's most well-established [[businessperson|businessmen]] from the 1950s to the 1970s. Khoury was an important figure of the Lebanese ruling elite in the second half of the 20th century. He played a decisive role in the development of economic legislation, and used his expertise in the resolution of several major national crises.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

[[File:Boutros Khoury - Avec sa mere dans son enfance.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury as a child, with his mother.]]
[[File:Boutors Khoury - Avec sa femme et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury with his spouse and children.]]
Khoury was born in 1907 in the village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]], in the [[Zgharta District|Zghorta District]] ([[North Governorate|North Lebanon]]), the son of Salim and Myriam el-Khoury. His family hailed from the [[Lebanese diaspora]] in the [[French West Africa|French colonies]] of [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arsan |first1=Andrew |title=Interlopers of empire: the Lebanese diaspora in colonial French West Africa |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199333387 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some members, including his father, residing in Senegal . Khoury lost his parents at an early age: his father died abroad on the day he was born, while his mother passed away when he was three years old. Khoury was subsequently raised first by his grandparents and then by his paternal aunt, Sayde Khoury, while his father's uncle, Abbas Abboud, who resided in Senegal, supported him financially. It was Abboud who initiated Khoury to the world of [[business]] and [[commerce]] early on in his life.

===Education===
Khoury studied at the Mar Yaacoub school in his home village and graduated from the al-Alam school in the village of [[Daraya, Zgharta|Daraya, Zghorta]].

==Business career==

Khoury pursued a career in business, and by the 1960s had become one of the wealthiest men in Lebanon thanks to his investments in various sectors of the economy.

Khoury's career began at the age of 20. He started out in the [[oil]] business, dividing his time between his home village and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] until, the beginnings of the 1930s, he moved permanently to [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]]’s capital, where it was easier for him to run his business and broaden his contacts. He then shifted easily from [[trade]] to [[industry]] and conducted many successful partnerships with well-established businessmen in various fields, founding companies such as the Stephan and Khoury company (created with Joseph and Sayed Stephan of [[Kfarsghab]]), the Kfoury–Khoury company (founded with Al Kfoury from [[Khenchara]], [[Metn District]]), the “Al Ghazzal Transports” with Ghattas el-Murr, and Fadel Al-Ghandour from [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], among others.

===La Kadisha===
[[File:Boutros Khoury - Devant Al-Kadisha.jpg|left|thumb|In front of "La Kadisha" with various political figures.]]
Over the course of the 1920s, Khoury gained a thorough understanding of financial [[investment]]. In accordance with the traditional role played at that time by the [[Lebanese diaspora]] in the country's economy, the young sheikh reinvested the money he received from his family abroad, including his great-uncle Abboud from [[Senegal]], in various local businesses.

In this respect, his experience in the [[hydroelectric]] company "La Kadisha" highlighted early on his innate talents as a businessman. The company had been founded in 1924 by prominent figures in [[Bsharri]], such as the Keirouz and Geagea families, with the [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli|Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli]], [[Anthony Peter Arida]], also playing an important role. Under the [[Greater Lebanon|French Mandate]], the company had obtained the concession to provide electricity in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]], from the [[Kadisha Valley]] to the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Gazette of the Lebanese Government |date=7 August 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; First introduced into the company through his uncle Abbas, Khoury quickly rose through its ranks, and in 1929, at the age of 22, was elected to the administrative council. In 1929, La Kadisha merged with the Abu Ali hydroelectric plant, the power concession for which had been granted to the Stephan brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Gazette of the Lebanese Government |date=4 April 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1930, Khoury was re-elected to the new council. He gradually acquired a majority stake in the company, until on May 14, 1953, he bought the majority of shares owned by the French shareholders of the companies La Pyrénéenne and La Toulousaine. He then became president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[Le Commerce du Levant]] |date=20 May 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khoury's years working in the administration of La Kadisha had a significant impact on his economic and political outlook. The economic thought of Albert Naccache, author of La Kadisha [[hydroelectric]] project, was especially influential. Naccache advocated greater industrial development in Lebanon, contrary to the widespread ideology at the time that was influenced by the ideas of [[Michel Chiha]], according to which Lebanon was a “merchant republic” devoid of any raw materials. Naccache called for the establishment of a large network of hydroelectric power plants across the country that would be financed and managed entirely by Lebanese capital and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Albert Naccache |publisher=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=30 March 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience gave Khoury a taste for industrial adventure and contributed to his grander vision for the national economy.

===Agriculture===

[[File:Boutros Khoury work desk.jpg|thumb|right|The young Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury.]]
Khoury's interest in [[agriculture]] also began at an early age, due to his rural upbringing. He started trading in agricultural products, beginning with [[olive oil]], which he sold through [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] before committing to the purchase and resale of [[flour]] and [[wheat]] to the whole of [[Lebanon]]. From the late 1940s onward, he negotiated the cost price per kilogram of both flour and wheat with the Ministry of National Economy. His concern for the agricultural industry and the rural world was evident from the start of his parliamentary career: He was elected as head of the Commission of Agriculture and Food Supply for two consecutive terms in 1946 and 1947, as well as head of the Commission of Public Works in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=20 March 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=19 March 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Khoury became involved in the fight against the monopolization of [[staple foods]] and rising prices and became one of the leading figures in the world of trade. He was often consulted by authorities in times of national emergency. During the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]], he belonged to the group of traders that sounded the alarm about the paralysis of commercial activity in the country, and publicly encouraged the unloading of boats in the Port of Beirut to avoid food shortages.
 
In addition to his involvement in the wheat trade, Khoury also revolutionized [[sugar]] production in Lebanon. In 1963, in his capacity as representative of [[sugar refiner]]s, he advised [[Prime Minister of Lebanon]] [[Rashid Karami]] on the measures to be taken to meet the country's sugar requirements for the following year. His suggestion was to encourage the production of [[sugar beet]], almost nonexistent in Lebanon at the time, in order to boost domestic output and allow the country to move towards self-sufficiency in sugar production. He was also one of the largest shareholders in the [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] sugar factory, playing a key role in the resolution of the sugar beet crisis that lasted from December 1964 to June 1965 and which saw the [[Bekaa]] peasants clashing with the management of the factory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=30 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khoury's stature and position as a prominent industrialist made him inclined to a traditional and benevolent social paternalism towards the peasants. To help Lebanese farmers and combat rural exodus, he was actively involved with the Banque de Crédit Agricole, Industriel et Foncier (BCAIF), founded in 1954, becoming chairman in 1958. During the banana crisis caused by the violent storm of November 20, 1964, which destroyed production for an entire season, Khoury offered long-term loans to banana growers in order to alleviate their difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=24 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry and commerce===

[[File:Boutros Khoury - Camille Chamoun - Antoine Abed Tripoli.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury with [[Lebanese President]] [[Camille Chamoun]], [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli|Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli]] [[Antoine Abed]] and [[Mufti]] of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Kazem Mikati.]]
Khoury was one of the pillars of Lebanese industry during the second half of the 20th century, and he was a keen supporter of investment of Lebanese capital in the industrial sector, which he advocated as a means of increasing the national income and curbing unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=17 October 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also president of the Association of Industrialists from 1965 to 1975, and called for the establishment of a Ministry of Industry.

Khoury's first industrial ventures were in the [[electricity]] sector. He invested at an early stage in the La Kadisha company, and in 1948 founded another [[hydroelectric]] company, Al-Bared, with two other partners . Through these two companies, Khoury helped to solve the electricity crisis that plagued Lebanon between 1952 and 1954. He proposed linking Beirut to the networks of Qadisha, Nahr el-Bared and Nahr el-Joz to overcome the power cuts in the capital, with Al-Bared handling the operation. In an effort to strengthen the energy sector, he demanded in 1956 a government loan of 5 million [[Lebanese pound|LBP]] to La Kadisha in order to avoid an increase in electricity tariffs.

Khoury was also involved in the [[cement]] industry. In 1963, he became a shareholder in the Lebanese Cement Company, founded in 1929 by the [[Maronite Church|Maronite Patriarchate]] in [[Chekka]], having supplied its factories with electricity through the Al-Bared company since 1956.

[[File:Boutros Khoury - Dans l'une de ses usines.jpg|left|thumb|Boutros el-Khoury at one of his factories.]]
In 1952, through several companies founded in conjunction with various business partners from [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Khoury helped establish a [[Free-trade zone|free zone]] in the [[Port of Tripoli (Lebanon)|Port of Tripoli]], building port facilities and warehouses and supplying the necessary machinery for the transfer of goods. This expanded the port significantly, as well as strengthening [[North Governorate|North Lebanese]] industry in general. He then founded several import–export companies with his partners to encourage trade and transit operations, which inevitably led him to become more closely involved in the [[maritime transport]] sector. He became a ship owner and founded the Maritime Boutros S. El-Khoury Agency in the 1960s.

Khoury also invested in numerous other areas, founding or co-founding over 50 companies both in [[Lebanon]] and abroad. Sectors to which he contributed included [[aluminum]] and [[pressed wood]] production, the [[petroleum industry]], the drinks industry (notably [[juices]] and [[sparkling water]]), the [[hospitality industry]] (hotels), the [[insurance]] sector, and the land and [[real estate]] industry.

===Banking===

[[File:L'Association des Industriels avec le President Suleiman Franjieh.jpg|thumb|right|The Association of Lebanese Industrialists with [[Lebanese President]] [[Suleiman Frangieh]].]]
Khoury's involvement in the Lebanese [[banking]] sector contributed to the emergence of the “Golden Age” in the domestic banking industry in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saffiedine |first1=Hicham |title=Economic Sovereignty and the Fetters of Finance: The Making of Lebanon’s Central Bank |date=June 2015 |publisher=University of Toronto |location=Toronto |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/77732}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main figures of the Lebanese banking sector, alongside people like Pierre Edde, [[Hussein Al Oweini]] and Philippe Takla. In addition to his role in the BCAIF, which played a leading role in the economic affairs of the country, he also participated in the establishment of many banking institutions, including the project "Bank Al-Ahli Al-Mahjar", which never took shape but whose purpose was to link the capitals of the diaspora to those of the motherland. Following the same principle, the [[BLOM Bank]] (Banque du Liban et d’Outre-Mer) was created a year later in 1951. The Sheikh was one of its founders, also serving as its vice-president. BLOM Bank remains one of the leading banks in [[Lebanon]]. He was also one of the founders of Al-Madina Bank, established in 1982. He was a shareholder in the Bank of Industry and Labor and invested momentarily funds in Al-Mahjar Bank and Bank of the Mediterranean (Banque de la Méditerranée) in the 1980s.

The success of BLOM attracted Arab and foreign capital to the institution. In May 1960, Khoury secured a 5 million [[USD]] loan for the BCAIF, largely through his personal negotiations with Hart Perry, director of the American Bank Institution known as the Credit Fund. Also through the BCAIF, he led similar negotiations on behalf of the Lebanese government to obtain a US wheat loan in 1964, efforts which resulted in the agreement of a $17 million deal in July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=19 July 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh also maintained relations with leading personalities in the international banking community, including [[David Rockefeller]], adviser to the [[World Bank]].

In his capacity as chairman of the BCAIF's board of directors, Khoury also worked closely with the Lebanese government in efforts to alleviate problems in the banking sector. In 1964, he chaired the banking consortium that regulated the resolution of the “Land Bank” crisis. He was also involved in the 1966 project to establish a Development Bank, for the financing of industrial and tourism projects. Additionally, he was a key figure in the resolution of the “Intra-banking crisis” of 1968, during which Lebanon's [[central bank]], the [[Banque du Liban]] (BDL), asked the BCAIF to handle the management and liquidation of 10 banks in distress.

===Contribution to social dialogue===

[[File:Boutros Khoury Conferance de presse de l'Association des Industriels.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury at the press conference of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists.]]
Khoury's role in the Lebanese business world gave him a decisive voice in the dialogue that emerged between [[trade union]]ists and managers in the second half of the 1960s. As a representative of the [[industrialists]], he was commonly invited by the ruling class to participate in the settlement of social crises. While usually chosen to represent the employers in these discussions, Khoury often adopted a conciliatory position, reflecting his role as a mediator in both politics and business.

On the question of wage increases in the private sector, demanded by unions as early as November 1964, Khoury welcomed the adoption in January 1965 of the wage increase law, which in his opinion guaranteed continued cooperation between employers and workers, as well as increasing living standards.

Khoury was also committed to improving worker productivity, providing funds for [[vocational training]] and collaborating with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on the modernization of the [[Dekwaneh]] accelerated vocational training center.

Khoury's conciliatory tendencies did not outweigh his [[economic liberalism]], however, and while he was sensitive to worker well-being, he believed that the state should also work in the interests of employers in order to improve the whole economic sector. He remained a proponent of [[free trade]], which also led him to defend the interests of [[industrialists]] and [[capitalists]]. During the fruit crisis of June 1966, he condemned the measures of the Union of Farmers—defended by [[Kamal Jumblatt]] and the leftist parties—as an attempt to [[nationalization|nationalize]] the fruit industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=12 June 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==

[[File:Camille Chamoun Boutros Khoury.jpg|gauche|thumb|left|El-Khoury with [[Lebanese President]] [[Camille Chamoun]].]]

Khoury's social skills and talents as a mediator also served him well in his political career. He established himself at an early age as an influential figure in his home village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]], and received as a consequence the honorary title of "[[Sheikh]]". He was therefore elected mayor of the village at a very young age.

Khoury's reputation, in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] and across the country, grew as a result of his business successes and growing leadership skills, along with his participation in the [[Independence of Lebanon|Lebanese independence]] movement led by [[Bechara El Khoury]] against the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French Mandate]]. He rapidly became established as an important political leader in [[Zgharta District|Zghorta]], and was elected [[Member of Parliament|member]] of the [[Lebanese Parliament]] from 1943 to 1947. He showed little interest in a purely political career, however, retiring from parliament and instead adopting a role as an advisor and mediator in political circles.

[[File:Boutros el-Khoury public photo.jpg|left|thumb|Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury was known as "the man and friend of all regimes.".]]
Khoury built strong ties with Lebanon's most prominent post-independence political figures, including [[Camille Chamoun]], [[Fouad Chehab]], [[Rashid Karami]], [[Charles Helou]], [[Suleiman Frangieh]] and [[Elias Sarkis]]. He often acted as an intermediary and conciliator between different factions, holding frequent social events to this end at either his residence or [[St. Georges Hotel, Beirut|St. George's Hotel]] in [[Beirut]]. His prominence and influence in political circles earned him the title of “the man and friend of all regimes.”

Khoury's political connections also afforded him various business advantages, thanks in large part to the government contracts he was able to obtain. In 1964, in close cooperation with [[Lebanese President]] [[Fouad Chehab]], he negotiated with the [[United States]] a 25 million [[USD]] wheat loan. Contracts such as this gave Khoury the opportunity to play a decisive role in the country's political economy.

===The 1974 crisis and civil war===

[[File:Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury - Front Libanais.jpg|right|thumb|Boutros el-Khoury attends a [[Lebanese Front]] meeting.]]
Khoury's authority and influence within both the economic and the political establishment was particularly evident during the social crisis of 1974 and the subsequent [[Lebanese civil war]].

The social unrest that shook the country in the early 1970s was driven in part by the activities of the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers (Confédération Générale des Travailleurs Libanais, CGTL). The CGTL protested against the deterioration of living conditions, and in June 1974 presented the government with a list of demands, which included the amendment of Article 50 of the Labor Code, authorizing [[Unfair dismissal|arbitrary dismissal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liban: géographie, économie, histoire et politique |date=October 2015 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the president of the Association of Industrialists resigned on July 11, 1974 to signify his total rejection of trade union demands, and refused any negotiation, a move that prolonged the crisis considerably.

Khoury's position during this conflict was in line with that of the rest of the Lebanese business world, traditionally committed to private initiative and individual and contractual freedom, which were endorsed by the constitution. His commitment to the [[Lebanese Front]] during the civil war was thus consistent with his pre-1975 stance: he financed the purchase of weapons used by the [[Al-Tanzim]] militia and Camille Chamoun's [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]], which were fighting the Islamist-progressive militas calling for reforms in the economic and political spheres.

Khoury was also renowned for his [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] activities and generous donations to [[charity (practice)|charity]]. He was always committed to help in times of [[humanitarian crisis]] or [[natural hazards]] and used his influence for fundraising purposes: during the [[flood]]s of [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] on December 22, 1955, he participated in the committee of dignitaries organizing the relief efforts in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. Similarly, he was one of the first to donate money during the [[earthquake]] of March 16, 1956, which affected the [[Chouf]] and [[South Lebanon]] regions, and formed a committee to organize fundraising among industrialists. In March 1960, he donated to the Red Cross for the benefit of the victims of the [[1960 Agadir earthquake|Agadir earthquake]]. In 1974, he became a member of the National Committee for Victims of [[Cyprus]].

==Personal life==
Khoury married Najibe Abboud, a relative of his mentor Abbas, on September 19, 1926. The couple had seven children.

[[File:Caricature Boutros Khoury.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature by Pierre Sadek published in [[An-Nahar]].]]
Khoury died in 1984 in [[Beirut]] at the age of 77.

Khoury has since become established in Lebanese collective memory as the quintessential [[self-made man]], due to his rural origins and his impressive social ascent during his work in [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and [[Beirut]]. His legacy has been examined in various books, both fiction and non-fiction. Similarly, a commemorative statue was erected in his home village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]] to honor him.

Khoury was also known for wearing the [[Fez|tarboush]], which became his trademark, both in the newspapers and in the political cartoons made of him by the famous Lebanese cartoonist Pierre Sadek. He was also known for his great sense of humor.

'''Carl Onora Ikeme''' (born 8 June 1986) is a former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

He spent his entire career at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], making 207 appearances across all competitions. He was part of their teams that won the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in 2009 and [[EFL League One|League One]] in 2014, and he made one [[Premier League]] appearance in 2012. Throughout his time at Wolves, he was loaned to eight other clubs. Born and raised in England, Ikeme chose to represent Nigeria at international level, earning ten [[Cap (sport)|caps]] between 2015 and 2016.

In July 2017, Ikeme was diagnosed with [[acute leukaemia]]. A year later, after being in complete [[Cure#Remission|remission]], he retired.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Ikeme progressed through [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]' academy and made the first team squad in their [[2003–04 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2003–04 Premier League season]]. Due to [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]]'s long term injury, he was promoted to the substitutes' bench for a string of games but never played.

He moved on a month-long [[loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Conference Premier]] side [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]] on 14 October 2004, to fill the gap in their team caused by [[Jon Kennedy (footballer)|Jon Kennedy's]] broken leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Accrington snap up keeper Ikeme|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/accrington_stanley/3741910.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his senior debut on 16 October when he played the first of four games for them, keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw at [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]]. 

He finally made his Wolves debut the following season, in a 5–1 win over [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] second round on 23 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves 5–1 Chester|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/4168884.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a further loan move to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in late 2005 which was cut short due to a hand injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeper Howarth loaned to Hatters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/4607306.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August 2006 he made his league debut for Wolves when he appeared as a late substitute in a 1–0 home win over [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], replacing Murray for the final three minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves 1–0 Luton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/5266224.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ikeme suffered a knee injury during the 2006–07 season and had to undergo surgery, which kept him out of contention until late 2007. After recovering, he was an unused substitute or only employed in reserve team fixtures. It was not until September 2008 that he got his chance to return to Wolves' first team after regular keeper [[Wayne Hennessey]] was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=McCarthy tipping Ikeme to shine|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7638098.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed his longest run of games in a Wolves shirt until injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season, during which the club went on to claim the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] title and reach the [[Premier League]].

===Championship loan spells===
After regaining fitness, he joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on a month's loan in October 2009 to cover for injured [[Robert Elliot (footballer)|Robert Elliot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charlton sign Wolves keeper Ikeme|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/8330799.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; making five appearances. Upon the end of this loan he immediately went out on loan again, this time to Championship side [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a month&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheff Utd sign Ikeme and Kallio|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/8351124.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a hamstring injury halted his stay. He recovered from this setback and was again sent out on loan to a Championship club, this time [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] during January 2010, where he made 17 appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queens Park Rangers sign Wolves keeper Carl Ikeme|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/qpr/8444227.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, he again went out on loan when he joined [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on a one-month emergency deal as cover for injured keeper [[Chris Weale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wolves loan keeper Carl Ikeme to Leicester City|date=26 August 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/8946885.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spell was later extended but ended when the Foxes recruited [[Chris Kirkland]] at the end of November, after four appearances by Ikeme. He spent the remainder of the 2010–11 season back at Wolves.

Ikeme completed a one-month loan move to [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in August 2011, after impressing in a pre-season trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keeper completes Boro loan |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2408266,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=2 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808010252/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~2408266%2C00.html |archivedate=8 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This loan deal was extended for a further month in August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ikeme Loan Extended |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~2432922,00.html |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913080511/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0%2C%2C10307~2432922%2C00.html |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then for a third and final month until 1 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolves keeper Carl Ikeme extends Middlesbrough loan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/15082125.stm|publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 September 2011 |accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept six clean sheets in ten games before a hand injury saw him return to [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]].

Once recovered, he had a loan spell at another Championship side when he joined [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in November 2011. He made five appearances for the club as they struggled at the foot of the table before the deal expired in January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15678263.stm |title=Doncaster Rovers sign Carl Ikeme on loan from Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to them once again in March 2012, joining on an initial one-month loan deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17221788 |title=Doncaster Rovers re-sign Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; later extended to run until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/22032012/63/duo-depart-rovers-loan.html |title=Duo depart Rovers on loan |publisher=Yahoo |date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was recalled by Wolves following an injury to first choice goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey; by this point, Doncaster had been confirmed as relegated to League One under his future Wolves manager [[Dean Saunders]].

===Return to Wolves===
[[File:Carl Ikeme 1.png|thumb|200|Ikeme playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2012]]
Ikeme made his first appearance for Wolves since January 2009 on the final day of 2011–12, coming on as a substitute for [[Dorus de Vries]] in the 51st minute of a 3–2 loss to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the [[DW Stadium]] on 13 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wigan 3–2 Wolves|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17973127|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ikeme started the [[2012–13 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2012–13 season]] as Wolves' first choice goalkeeper in the Championship following injuries to Hennessey and De Vries; he maintained his place in the first team when the latter returned in September 2012. In March 2013 he conceded a bizarre [[own goal]] during a league game against [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], when he allowed a [[David Davis (footballer)|David Davis]] backpass to go between his legs and roll over the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Own-goal calamity at Wolves as keeper nutmegged by his defender| url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2294708/Video-Own-goal-calamity-Wolves-keeper-nutmegged-defender.html | work=Daily Mail| date=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ikeme was substituted at half time, and it was later confirmed that he had broken his hand during the interval by punching a tactics board in the dressing room in frustration at the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Angry-keeper-breaks-own-hand-punching-board-after-Wolves-comedy-own-goal/tabid/415/articleID/291065/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title=Angry keeper breaks own hand| date=20 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injury kept him out for the remainder of the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Boss confirms Ikeme break| url =http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/boss-confirms-ikeme-break-190313-724169.aspx?pageView=full#anchored| publisher =Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C| date =19 March 2013| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140101114918/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/boss-confirms-ikeme-break-190313-724169.aspx?pageView=full#anchored| archivedate =1 January 2014| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended in relegation to League One.

Ikeme retained the goalkeeping position at Wolves for the [[2013–14 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2013–14 season]], excelling in a 3–0 win over [[Colchester United]] at the [[Colchester Community Stadium]] on 5 October 2013 when he saved a late [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] from [[Freddie Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colchester 0–3 Wolves|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24349480|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again suffered a broken hand when he was injured in a collision against [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere]] on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Carl Ikeme: Wolves keeper out for six weeks with broken hand|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25575906|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Wolves' goal now as the established first choice, following the sale of Hennessey, and was a part of the team that won the League One title with a record points tally. After keeping 22 clean sheets across the season Ikeme was named in the [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)#League One 5|PFA League One Team of the Year]] alongside four other teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Bet League 1 Team of the Season 2013/14|url=http://www.efl.com/news/article/2014/sky-bet-league-1-team-of-the-season-201314-1964429.aspx|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once back in the Championship, Ikeme impressed at the start of [[2014-15 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2014–15]], keeping five clean sheets in the first eight games, during which he saved an [[Owen Garvan]] penalty in a 1–0 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 20 September 2014 at Molineux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolves 1–0 Bolton|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29186884|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ikeme was born in [[Sutton Coldfield]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]],&lt;ref name="Hugman2010-11 212" /&gt; and was eligible to represent England or [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] at international level, choosing the latter.

With emphasis on the need for open content and open knowledge, Cobo has promoted the ideas that education should be a continuous process and flexible to changing needs.&lt;ref name=desperto/&gt;&lt;ref name=encuentro&gt;{{cite web |title= Cristóbal Cobo Fundación Telefonica |publisher=Telefonica Foundation |url= http://encuentro.educared.org/group/educacion-para-el-futuro/page/cristobal-cobo |accessdate=August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes there should be a balance between [[face-to-face interaction|F2F]] and virtual learning environments and to mix them to complement each other,&lt;ref name=fabricas&gt;{{cite web |author=Lucía Dorronsoro |title= Cristóbal Cobo: Las escuelas no pueden ser fábricas de licenciados |publisher= ABC |date=March 25, 2014 |url= http://www.abc.es/economia/20140325/abci-cristobal-cobo-educacion-oxford-201403232025.html |accessdate=August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has criticized the use of technology in education currently as contradictory and confusing, with too much promotion of products by companies not necessarily focused in improving education.&lt;ref name=alt1040&gt;{{cite web |title= Entrevista con Cristóbal Cobo sobre el Aprendizaje Invisible  |work=ALT1040 |publisher=Sony  |url= http://alt1040.com/2011/04/entrevista-con-cristobal-cobo-sobre-el-aprendizaje-invisible |accessdate=August 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobo, argues the challenges of a more open science: "we exclude a lot of communities, which might be equally interested in producing science or consuming science, but they may not have the English or the access to journals data bases to do those things. So we have here this kind of tradeoff between this approach of we need to publish [[open access]] for everybody but we have this restriction where if people don’t have the English or the access they cannot be a part of this game."&lt;ref name=LSE&gt;{{cite web |title= Five Minutes with Cristóbal Cobo: Redefining Knowledge in the Digital Age.

His main contribution to educational theory is the concept of “invisible learning,” the idea that most of what people learn comes from doing new things, rather than through explicit instruction. He promotes “invisible learning” not as a theory but as a [[meta-theory]] with the aim of incorporating different ideas and perspectives and as a “work in progress.” It is highly influenced by the notion and values of open source in the sense that it should be developed collaboratively.&lt;ref name=alt1040/&gt; The idea is convert the classroom into a laboratory, incubatory or taller instead of a place for monologues.&lt;ref name=sintetica/&gt;

[[File:20070816 116 Melingo Central-2.jpg|thumb|Daniel Melingo]]
'''Daniel Melingo''' (born October 22, 1957) is an Argentine musician, with a background in [[rock and roll|rock]] (he played [[guitar]] for [[Los Twist]] and [[saxophone]] for [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]]). He is now a [[tango music|tango]] artist and tours with his band [[Los Ramones del tango]].

==Biography==

Melingo was exposed to music since his childhood days, as his stepfather was [[Edmundo Rivero]]'s manager. After playing for some time with [[Brazil]]ian singer [[Milton Nascimento]], Melingo was active in the [[Buenos Aires]] independent theater scene in the early 1980s, under the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]]. When the restrictions on cultural activities eased after the [[Falklands war]], Melingo became a notable participant in projects such as a rock opera version of "Dr. Moreau's Trials", masterminded by Victor Kesselman, and Los Twist, a fun band with echoes of [[The B-52's]]. He was called by [[Cachorro López]] to play the sax in the Abuelos de la Nada reunion, where he was, according to colleague [[Andrés Calamaro]], the person who established the band's musical direction.

After the Abuelos and Twist, Melingo spent time in [[Spain]], where he formed a band named Lions in Love. Back in Argentina, he issued a disc based on the mythical Argentine graphic novel [[El Eternauta]], and later on turned to [[tango singer]]. He has issued several recordings to critical acclaim, toured the world, and was hailed by the British press as "the man who's making tango seriously cool" [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/daniel-melingo--the-man-whos-making-tango-seriously-cool-804385.html].

'''Josiah Gordon "Doc" Scurlock''' (January 11, 1849 &amp;ndash; July 25, 1929) was an [[United States|American]] [[American Old West|Old West]] figure, [[cowboy]], and [[gunslinger|gunfighter]]. A founding member of the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] during the [[Lincoln County War]] in [[New Mexico]], Scurlock rode alongside such men as [[Billy the Kid]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa County]], [[Alabama]], the sixth of 11 children born to Priestly Norman Scurlock (July 3, 1806 &amp;ndash; June 22, 1876) and Esther Ann Brown (May 19, 1819 &amp;ndash; June 1, 1903). Josiah was said to have studied medicine in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], thus receiving his [[nickname]] "Doc".

Described as {{convert|5|ft|8|in|m}} tall, weighing {{convert|150|lb|kg}}, with brown eyes and dark blond hair, Doc went to [[Mexico]] in about 1870. While there, he and another man had an argument over a card game and drew their pistols. The other man shot first and the bullet went through Doc's mouth, knocking out his front teeth and coming out the back of his neck without any more serious damage. He quickly returned fire and killed the man who shot him.

==Cowboy==
Scurlock returned to the [[United States]] in 1871 and went to work as a line rider for [[John Chisum]]. He and other riders were also used to defend Chisum and his cattle holdings in the event [[cattle rustling|cattle rustlers]] attempted to prey on them. Sometime during 1873, he and Jack Holt were surprised by a group of Native Americans and Holt was killed. Scurlock found refuge among some rocks and, after a protracted fight, he killed the Native American leader. During the night he slipped away and walked {{convert|20|mi|km}} for help. At some time after the fight, Holt's body was presumably partially dismembered, as his right arm was removed at the elbow.

In September 1875, Scurlock's riding partner, Newt Higgins, was killed by Native Americans. Scurlock was so upset over this incident he told Chisum he wanted to quit. Chisum, however, would not hear of it and refused to pay him. Scurlock then made the newspapers when he stole three horses, two saddles, and a rifle and left for [[Arizona]]. Chisum sent some of his men after Scurlock and they caught up with him, but when he explained that he took the things because Chisum would not pay him, they agreed with him and let him go.

In Arizona, he met [[Charlie Bowdre]] and the two men opened a cheese factory on the [[Gila River]]. Some of Scurlock and Bowdre's descendants have said that one of their first employees was [[Billy the Kid]]. After they closed the cheese factory in the spring of 1876, Scurlock and his best friend, Bowdre, returned to [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]], where they bought a ranch on public domain land on the [[Rio Ruidoso]] from [[Lawrence Murphy|L. G. Murphy]] on credit, which made them victims of the L. G. Murphy &amp; Co. [[monopoly]].

Scurlock, Bowdre, [[Frank Coe (Lincoln County War)|Frank Coe]], [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]], and [[Ab Saunders]] stormed the very weak Lincoln jail on July 18, 1876, freeing cattle rustler Jesus Largo from the custody of Sheriff Saturnino Baca. They took Largo outside of town and hanged him. Scurlock accidentally shot and killed his friend, Mike G. Harkins, manager of John H. Riley's store at Blazer's Mill, while he was examining a pistol on September 2, 1876.

On October 19, 1876, Scurlock and María Antonia Miguela Herrera (June 13, 1860 – November 27, 1912) were married in [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]. (Around the same time, Antonia's sister, Manuela Herrera, married Charlie Bowdre, which made Bowdre a brother-in-law of Scurlock.) Ten children were eventually born of Scurlock and Antonia's union.

==Lincoln County War==
For over a year, Scurlock was in several [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posses]] to pursue and arrest horse thieves. He, Bowdre, and others [[Lynching|lynched]] some of the thieves they caught. In January 1877, Scurlock and a neighbor, [[George Coe (Lincoln County War)|George Coe]], were arrested by [[Sheriff]] [[William J. Brady]] for suspicion of harboring a murdering fugitive and member of the [[Jesse Evans Gang]] named Frank Freeman. For the next few days, Scurlock and Coe received very harsh treatment from Brady. They were allegedly tortured, but were eventually released. In October 1877, the Evans Gang stole horses belonging to [[John Tunstall]], [[Alexander McSween]], and [[Richard M. Brewer|Richard "Dick" Brewer]] from Brewer's Rio Ruidoso ranch. Scurlock and Bowdre, as well as Brewer, went off in pursuit of the Evans Gang and located them, but were unable to regain possession of the stolen horses.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Jacobsen, ''Such Men as Billy the Kid: The Lincoln County War Reconsidered'', University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, 1994, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tunstall was murdered in February 1878, Scurlock became a founding member of the [[Lincoln County Regulators|Regulators]] and was involved in most of the battles of the [[Lincoln County War]]. In the [[Gunfight of Blazer's Mills]] on April 4, Scurlock was shot in the leg by Buckshot Roberts. Scurlock later became the third and final leader of the Regulators, after prior leaders Dick Brewer and [[Frank McNab]] had been killed.&lt;ref name = "bill"/&gt;

Scurlock served as a deputy sheriff under Sheriff John Copeland, who was a McSween partisan and replaced Sheriff Brady. On May 14, 1878, he led a posse of 18 to 20 men, which included [[Billy the Kid]], Bowdre, George Coe, Brown, and Scroggins, to the Dolan-Riley cattle ranch, ostensibly in search of those implicated in the killing of MacNab and the wounding of Saunders. According to Riley, they drove off 26 horses and two mules, killed a herder named Wair; a Navajo Indian employed at the ranch as a cook; and a 15-year-old boy called Johnny. However, W.T. Thornton, Thomas B. Catron's law partner, reported that the latter two were only wounded. Writer Robert M. Utley says that they captured a man named "Indian" Manuel Segovia, the likely shooter of McNab, but he was shot while allegedly trying to escape.&lt;ref name = "bill"&gt;Robert M. Utley, ''Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life'', University of Nebraska Press, 1989, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Catron had foreclosed on the property of J. J. Dolan &amp; Co., the horses appear to have been his property. As a result of his strong protest to the governor, Copeland was removed as sheriff due to his refusing to side with the Murphy-Dolan faction. The raid by the Regulators resulted in the removal of one of their partisans from a position of authority and his replacement with [[George Peppin]], who was just as strongly attached to the other side.

When Billy attempted to make a deal with Governor [[Lew Wallace]], Scurlock was captured and held in custody with him. He was held on suspicion of the murder of "Buckshot" Roberts. When Wallace's deal fell through, Billy and Scurlock were told they were going to be charged. Faced with extradition for a murder, on June 17, 1879, Billy and Scurlock rode out of Lincoln. Sheriff Kimball did nothing to stop them.&lt;ref name = "bill2"&gt;Robert M. Utley, ''Billy the Kid: A Short and Violent Life'', University of Nebraska Press, 1989, p.119-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In August Billy and associates stole a large number of cattle from Chisum. After Chisum sent a posse after them, Scurlock decided to leave the gang.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Tuska, ''Billy the Kid: His Life and Legend'', Greenwood Press, Westport, 1994, p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In about October or November 1879, Scurlock moved to Texas, where he settled down and became a highly respected citizen. On the [[1880 United States Census|1880 census]] in [[Potter County, Texas]], he was keeping the mail station.

Doc Scurlock died at age 80 from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Eastland, Texas]]. He is interred in Eastland City Cemetery, along with his wife and other family members.

==Movie portrayals==
In the [[western (genre)|western film]], ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]'', Scurlock was portrayed by actor [[Kiefer Sutherland]], as a polite, moral, poetry writing cowboy. At the end of the film, Scurlock left [[Billy the Kid]]'s posse, fleeing from New Mexico with an Asian woman he fell for earlier in the movie in the hopes of starting a new life in the East.

In the [[sequel]], ''[[Young Guns II]]'', Scurlock (again played by Sutherland) is serving as a school teacher in New York City when he is arrested and taken back to New Mexico, where he is saved from hanging by The Kid. He rejoins Billy's posse and is mortally wounded in an ambush led by John W. Poe, played by [[Viggo Mortensen]], when he steps out of their hideout. Back inside, he staggers out again to be killed in a hail of bullets. This is based on the death of [[Charlie Bowdre]] in an ambush organized by [[Pat Garrett]]. In fact Scurlock was married to a Spanish woman in 1876 and died peacefully in Texas many years after the period of time covered by the movie. The original "Young Guns II" screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading off to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that Kiefer Sutherland, faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's "Stinking Springs Shoot Out". Writer John Fusco fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule.

For his linguistic and literary works he is regarded as one of the cultural founders of the [[Hungarian Reform Era]] along with Dávid Baróti Szabó, Ferenc Verseghy, [[György Bessenyei]], Mátyás Rát and János Kis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/MagyarIrodalom-magyar-irodalomtortenet-1/magyar-irodalomtortenet-pinter-jeno-5116/5-a-magyar-irodalom-a-xix-szazad-elso-harmadaban-15FC/a-kozerdeku-irodalom-16AB/az-irodalomtortenet-es-kritika-1714/|title=AZ IRODALOMTÖRTÉNET ÉS KRITIKA. - Magyar irodalomtörténet - Kézikönyvtár|website=www.arcanum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Early years===
Ferenc Kazinczy was born in [[Érsemjén]], [[Bihar County|Bihar]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (today [[Șimian, Bihor|Șimian]], [[Romania]]). His father, József Kazinczy de Kazincz (1732-1784) came from an old noble family and worked as a magistrate at [[Abaúj County]]. His mother was Zsuzsanna Bossányi de Nagybossány (1740-1812). Ferenc had four brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macse.org/gudenus/mcsat/fam.aspx?id=9144|title=MAGYAR CSALÁDTÖRTÉNETI ADATTÁR|website=www.macse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the age of eight he was brought up by his maternal grandfather, Ferenc Bossányi, the notary of [[Bihar County]] and parliamentary ambassador, where he did not hear any foreign word during his first seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kislexikon.hu/kazinczy.html|title=Kazinczy - Lexikon ::|first=BioDigit|last=Kft.|website=www.kislexikon.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote his first letters in December 1764 to his parents who lived in [[Alsóregmec]] at that time. In 1766 his aunt got sick, therefore they moved to [[Debrecen]] for three months for the healing treatment. Kazinczy studied during that time at the College of Debrecen.&lt;ref&gt;[* István Nagy : Kazinczy és Debrecen. Karcagi ref. gimnázium értesítője. 1888. ]&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his aunt he returned to his parents where he learnt [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[German language|German]] from a student of the College of [[Késmárk]] (today [[Kežmarok]], [[Slovakia]]). His well educated and enlightened father, experiencing rare susceptibility, was delighted with his son, so he also taught him and communicated with him in Latin and German. Kazinczy continued his language studies in Késmárk in 1768 in a preparatory class.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02228/html/03/153.html|title=Tanulóévek és pályakezdés (1759–1789)|website=mek.oszk.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Zsuzsanna Bossányi 18th c..jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of Zsuzsanna Bossányi de Nagybossány (1740-1812), the mother of Ferenc Kazinczy]]

His father, József Kazinczy, initially wanted Ferenc to become a soldier, but Ferenc's resistance and the development of his other especially literary talents diverged him from his intent, and then he wanted to see his son as a writer. However the father, as a pietistic educator, understood under the profession of a writer a religious one, and therefore ordered his fourteen-year-old son to translate [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]'s dissertations on religion from [[Latin language|Latin]] to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Otherwise, the father provided his son advanced education: Ferenc was educated in foreign languages, could practice fine art and music, and for seeing the world, he brought him to county assemblies and for the lunch of the emperor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] when the ruler visited [[Sárospatak]]. In 1774 the father urged his son to continue his translations, but Ferenc preferred to spend time reading [[György Bessenyei]]'s [[Ágis tragédiája]] (1772), Ignác Mészáros's Kártigám (1772) and other [[belles-lettres]] works. He broadened his knowledge with the idylls of [[Salomon Gessner]] and the poems of [[Vergilius]], [[Horace]], [[Anacreon]].&lt;ref name="unideb.hu"&gt;[http://irodalom.arts.unideb.hu/kutatas/textologia/docs/PE.pdf Kazinczy Ferenc - Pályám Emlékezete published by Debreceni Egyetemi Kiadió 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not neglect his theological studies, and even at home they frequently debated over theological topics during lunch and dinner. After his father's death in 1774, he continued to pursue the translation of [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]'s ''De religione'' until his teacher of theology dismissed him to do it because he found Gellert's works too difficult to interpret. Ferenc turned slowly from theological to more secular and national topics and prepared a short geographical description of the country. István Losonczi Hányoki's ''Three Small Mirrors'' served as an example for his work. It was a childish compilation with the title ''Geography of Hungary...'' , which he later described as "suddenly scribbled" and was published in [[Košice|Kassa]], [[Hungary]] (today [[Košice]], [[Slovakia]]) at his mother's expense in 1775.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

===Sárospatak (1769-1779)===
[[File:Református Kollégium, könyvtár, Sárospatak - 2014.04.09 (25).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The library of the College of Sárospatak where Kazinczy spent his time reading and learning]]

On September 11, 1769, he became a student at the College of [[Sárospatak]] where he taught himself [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]. He studied philosophy and law during his first years. In 1773 he started to learn rhetoric. Even in the same year December he greeted General Count [[Miklós Beleznay]] as a member of the thanksgiving delegation of the college in [[Bugyi]] on a special reception for donating money toward the construction of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muemlekem.hu/muemlek?id=11717|title=műemlékem.hu - Beleznay-kastély, Bugyi|website=www.muemlekem.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Kazinczy saw [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] for the first time. Until 1775 he attended the theology courses at the college and from a [[French people|French]] soldier who came to [[Sárospatak]] learnt [[French language|French]].

He translated [[György Bessenyei]]'s short story written in [[German language|German]], ''Die Amerikaner'', to [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and published it in 1776 in [[Košice|Kassa]] with the title ''Az amerikai Podoc és Kazimir keresztyén vallásra való megtérése'' (''{{lang-en|The conversion of American Podoc and Kazimir to the Christian religion}}''). He recommended his translation to his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adtplus.arcanum.hu/en/view/MTA_Konyvek_164976/?pg=0&amp;layout=s|title=Az amerikai Podocz és Kazimir keresztyén vallásra való megtérése - Régi magyar könyvtár 34. (Budapest, 1914) - Arcanum Digitheca|website=adtplus.arcanum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work informed him about [[Deism]] and the principle of religious tolerance. In his translation Kazinczy used the word ''világosság'' (meaning ''clarity'', ''lucidity'') the first time in the history of the [[Hungarian language]]. Bessenyei welcomed it and his response was inspirational for Kazinczy. Kazinczy understood Bessenyei's response as a liberating letter for the profession of an author.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt; He was happy finding the contact with one of the most prominent authors in [[Hungarian literature]] of that time. But Kazinczy did not become a follower of Bessenyei, because Bessenyei as a culture politician and philosopher did not mature his works so much so that he could create a literary school.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

Ferenc's uncle was a member of the delegation of [[Zemplén County]] in [[Vienna]] at the royal court and he took the young Kazinczy along. This travel made a huge impact on him. It was the first time that Kazinczy saw the emperor's city, whose magnificent collections, especially his pictures, completely enthralled him.&lt;ref name="unideb.hu1"&gt;[http://irodalom.arts.unideb.hu/kutatas/textologia/docs/PE.pdf Kazinczy Ferenc - Pályám emlékezete published by Debreceni Egyetemi Kiadó, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time Kazinczy followed the thoughts of [[Salomon Gessner]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] and Dávid Baróti Szabó. Later he got Sándor Báróczi's translation of [[Jean-François Marmontel]]'s ''Contes Moraux'' (''{{lang-en|Moral tales}}'') from the librarian of [[Sárospatak]], which became his favourite book and he later took it along also in the prison. So he decided to seek after how can he lay a wreath on Báróczi's works. What fascinated him was this beautiful new style, the rhythmically arranged packing of sentences, the rigidity and purity of the language with a dramatic compactness, and the French strangeness which made the translation truly incomprehensible for simple litterateurs. It showed Kazinczy a sample for the cultivation of Hungarian [[belles-lettres]]. Thus after being primarily inspired by Bessenyi he found himself a life goal as a translator and cultivator of the Hungarian language.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

===Kassa (1779-1780)===
[[File:TUTKÓ(1861) p213 Košice - 1850.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ferenc Kazinczy lived in [[Košice|Kassa]] during his practice of law (1779-1780) and then later as an inspector of education (1785-1790)]]

After finishing his studies he travelled to [[Košice|Kassa]] on September 9, 1779, to meet Sámuel Milecz, the prosecutor of [[Tolna County]], where he did his practice of law and first met his young love, Erzsébet Rozgonyi and one of his role models, Dávid Baróti Szabó. He stayed there until October 18.&lt;ref name="unideb.hu"/&gt;

His world-view crises occurred during his stay in [[Košice|Kassa]]. He turned away from the religious thesis and "useless" theological studies. Between 1779 and 1781 Kazinczy joined the laic, deist perception of religion which was completely cleaned from dogmas. The artistic cult of beauty replaced the lost religious experience. His enthusiasm for beauty became his passion, filling his whole individuality and worldview. In about 1780 he started his first major literary work, the translation of [[Salomon Gessner]]'s writings among others. Soon after that he published the Hungarian version of ''Siegwart'' in 1783. Because of his translations he came in contact with several foreign authors and corresponded with Gessner, [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]] and [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. His connection with renowned European scholars awoke in him the feeling of being chosen. So after Rousseau he stated his own conscious separation from ordinary people.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1779, he met Miklós Révai in [[Nagyvárad]], [[Hungary]] (today [[Oradea]], [[Romania]]). Révai was a grammarian who acclimatized the analysing of words according to the rules of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] in the [[Hungarian language]]. They became friends and often shared their own ideas about literature and grammar with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revai.hu/?q=node/135|title=Révai Miklós - A Révai Miklós Gimnázium honlapja|website=www.revai.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eperjes (1781-1782)===
[[File:Kazinczy Ferenc portré.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of Ferencz Kazinczy from 1780]]
Between January 11, 1781 and June 2, 1782, he continued his practice of law in [[Eperjes]], [[Hungary]] (today [[Prešov]], [[Slovakia]]). Besides his job he spent a lot of time with arts, too: dancing, playing the flute, drawing, painting and reading. His favourites were especially the German writers. During this time in Eperjes he fell in love with an "educated girl", the daughter of [[Ninos Steinmetz]], who had a great influence on him.&lt;ref name="unideb.hu1"/&gt;

===Pest (1782-1783)===
He continued his practice of law in August 1782 in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] where he was sworn in as a hired clerk of [[József Bernáth]]. During his time in Pest he came in contact with two older, prominent authors, [[Lőrinc Orczy]] and {{ill|Gedeon Ráday (writer)|lt=Gedeon Ráday|hu|Ráday Gedeon (író)}}. Ráday introduced him even more to knowledge of Western literature, but also to an appreciation of the old Hungarian writers, especially [[Miklós Zrínyi]]. This friendship greatly developed Kazinczy's aesthetic sense and broadened his horizons. Kazinczy was still working on the translations of [[Salomon Gessner]]'s idylls and showed them to Ráday and Báróczi. Their enthusiastic acknowledgement greatly enhanced his writer ambition. The fact that Kazinczy was working a lot on the translations of Gessner's maudlin, sentimental idylls, was partly brought by the sentimental trend at the time, but on the other hand, Kazinczy intended to practice the Hungarian prose in the depiction of emotions and expression of fond moods.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

He found himself soon in a more lively intellectual and political life in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and became interested in the church policies of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] which were born in the spirit of [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]].

Miklós Beleznay, József Teleki, Gedeon Ráday and László Prónay were working on the preparation of the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781 just when Kazinczy became their trustworthy man. As a [[Protestant]] Kazinczy was glad to be so close to the "champions of Protestant freedom". The policies of the emperor on religious tolerance, on the press, and on the permission for Protestants to hold office strengthened his beliefs in his [[Freemasonry]] convictions of believing in the illusion of the "brightness" coming from above. Already in [[Miskolc]], he became a member of the secret society in early 1784 which generally supported the civilization process. It had a major role in the refinement of morals and tastes, unlike the former religiosity, it captured rather the recently alienated members of the biblical religions with a mystical, mostly naturalistic mysticism. Kazinczy later, in the beginning of the 1890s, started to sympathize with the ideas of the [[Illuminati]] order, and wrote about them enthusiastically to [[György Aranka]]: "their goals are... evertere superstitionem, opprimere Tyrannismum, benefacere ({{lang-la|liquidation of superstitions, collapse of the tyranny, benefaction}})... is it not the sweetest happiness of life?".&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

===Legal career (1783-1785)===
[[File:Portrait Ferenc Kazinczy von Kasincz und Alsóregmecz.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The young Kazinczy]]

In 1783 he returned to his mother in [[Alsóregmec]], who encouraged him to travel to [[Tarnaörs]] to Baron Lőrinc Orczy to accept a job as honorary clerk. On October 13, 1784, he was appointed to this job and then in the same month to [[magistrate]] in [[Abaúj County]]. On November 29, he also gained a post of vice-notary in [[Zemplén County]], but he had a disagreement with the chief notary and therefore almost immediately lost his position.

Count Lajos Török, the father of Ferenc's prospective wife, was Director-General of the Kassa School District and the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Masonic lodge]] of [[Miskolc]] and a friend of Kazinczy. On January 16, 1784, Lajos took Kazinczy among the members of the lodge. As a freemason, Kazinczy got to know several intellectuals like [[Angelo Soliman]] and [[Ignaz Born]].

===Inspector of education (1785-1790)===
[[File:P bibDEK00927248.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The cover of ''Bácsmegyeynek öszve-szedett levelei'' first edition (1789)]]
In August 1785, he traveled to Vienna to introduce himself to the Minister of Public Education, [[Gottfried van Swieten]], and to request the inspectorate of the county schools of the following Counties: [[Szepes County|Szepes]], [[Sáros County|Sáros]], [[Zemplén County|Zemplén]], [[Ung County|Ung]], [[Bereg County|Bereg]], [[Gömör és Kishont County|Gömör]], [[Torna County|Torna]], [[Abaúj County|Abaúj]], [[Borsod County|Borsod]], [[Heves County|Heves]] and the autonomies of [[Jászság]] és [[Kiskunság]]. On November 11 he was nominated for this position, which he held for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biolex.ios-regensburg.de/BioLexViewview.php?ID=1118|title=Kazinczy, Ferenc|website=www.biolex.ios-regensburg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1785 to 1790 Kazinczy was known as the "apostle of renewing Hungarian education". As a supervisor he had a well paid job and a wide range of power. But even his school-organizing practice turned him against the churches and his brothers of faith whom he had been friends with during the early eighties. He lived in Kassa, travelled a lot in Upper and Eastern Hungary, established and controlled schools. His superiors were satisfied with him and his results. He took over 79 functioning schools as he started working in his position. This number rose rapidly to 124 of which 19 were common schools where pupils belonging to different denominations received state-funded joint education.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

Finally he finished the translations of [[Salomon Gessner]]'s idylls and published them in one book with the title ''Gessner Idylliumi'' in 1788 in Kassa. Its preface dates back to summer 1785 and was written to Gedeon Ráday. During his demanding works on the book, which he did with great care, he could count on the help of the author, Salomon Gessner and, after his death, on the help of his widow. It was Kazinczy's first world-famous translation and brought him recognition and appreciation abroad. He paid particular attention to the content and stylistic fidelity, accuracy, and musical rhythm of the language.

Gessner's classical idyllic world expresses [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]'s sentimentality in a pseudo environment. His middle-class optimism keeps all disturbances away from its reader. Its [[Roccoco]] emotions are remotely related to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s world of thoughts, but it is rather a sweeter and simpler happiness offering version of that. By turning away from civilization and retreating into the ''ancient beautiful'' times, Gessner criticizes society, but at the same time brings us into a middle-class ideal world. As an enlightened, emotionally educated young man, this feeling of life was no stranger to him, but he was particularly delighted with the sophisticated style of the work.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

His emotional world was refined by the saloon life of [[Košice|Kassa]], whose social pleasures he felt as delightful as the Freemasonry ceremonies which he often attended. His desires were tense between Teréz Radvánszky and Zsuzsanna Kácsándy. For the "nice companies" gathered in the saloons of the Török, Kácsándy and Bárcsay families and for female members of the [[Freemasonry]] he addressed his ''Bácsmegyeynek öszve-szedett levelei'' ({{lang-en|Collected letters of Bácsmegyey}}) in 1789. It was a translation of Albrecht Christoph Kayser's ''Adolfs gesammelte Briefe'' which was a pastiche of [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werther]].&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt; This form of translation, which differs from the principle of faithful translation followed during his works on the ''Gessner Idylliumi'', was common in [[Hungarian literature]] at that time, but not in such a way as Kazinczy did in his ''Bácsmegyeynek öszve-szedett levelei''. He moved the figure and scene of Kayser's original novel into the role of his friends and into the scenes of their frequent gatherings which showed a rare example of personal self-expression in translation. In some cases his protagonist openly attacks the [[estates of the realm]] as a limitation of freedom for humans and emotions. The first edition was indeed a great success in Hungarian public life. Ádám Pálóczi Horváth, János Földi, [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]], [[Sándor Kisfaludy]], [[Mihailo Vitković]] and Benedek Virág enthusiastically welcomed it.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt; However Kazinczy also received criticism from conservative writers and from his teachers in [[Sárospatak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irodalmiszemle.sk/2007/09/laszlo-erika-a-bacsmegyey-sikere-a-korabeli-magyarorszagon/|title=László Erika - A Bácsmegyey sikere a korabeli Magyarországon - Irodalmi Szemle|date=7 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magyar Museum-1788-1789.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The cover of the first volume of ''Magyar Museum'' literary journal, printed by Mátyás Trattner in 1788/1789 in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], [[Hungary]]]]

On November 13, 1787 Kazinczy together with Dávid Szabó Baróti and [[János Batsányi]] in order to organize the literary movements of the Hungarian literature of that era established the ''Magyar Museum'' periodical. This was the first literary magazine in [[Hungarian language]]. But already after the first edition Kazinczy got into a debate on what kind of direction do they want to give to their periodical. Kazinczy recommended the title ''Magyar Parnassus'' instead of ''Magyar Museum'' and thought of a [[belles-lettres]]-like magazine with translations and critics. Batsányi wanted to create a more general and practical journal. Their political disagreement was deepend by the debate. Kazinczy was a [[Josephinism|Josephinist]], a follower of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Unlike Batsányi who was known as a member of the reform movement. Kazinczy soon left the editorial of the periodical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/SajtoTortenet-a-magyar-sajto-tortenete-1/a-magyar-sajto-tortenete-i-17051848-2D87/hirlap-es-folyoirat-irodalmunk-a-18-szazadban-91/az-elso-magyar-nyelvu-folyoiratok-3D3/a-kassai-magyar-museum-az-elso-onallo-magyar-nyelvu-folyoirat-17881793-3E3/|title=A KASSAI MAGYAR MUSEUM, AZ ELSŐ ÖNÁLLÓ MAGYAR NYELVŰ FOLYÓIRAT (1788–1793) - A magyar sajtó története - Kézikönyvtár|website=www.arcanum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most difficult time of his life came as Kazinczy became so seriously ill that on May 31, 1789 he had abandoned his life. In Kassa people already talked about his death. But he suddenly got better and quickly recovered.&lt;ref name="unideb.hu"/&gt;

In November 1789 Kazinczy established his own periodical and titled it ''Orpheus'' after his own [[Freemason]] name.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02200/02228/html/03/154.html|title=A felvilágosodás propagandistája (1786–1795)|website=mek.oszk.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its operation between 1789 and 1792 only 8 numbers were published in 2 volumes. He wrote his essays under the name ''Vince Széphalmy''. Kazinczy faced two problems that threatened the existence of his journal and led to its closure. Firstly beside his aim to improve the Hungarian language on a perfect level he also popularised the ideas of [[Voltaire]] and other [[List of Freemasons|Freemason]] philosophers. Secondly, his ''Orpheus'' was not so popular as the ''Magyar Museum'' and was financially unsustainable in the long run. Two years after the ''Orpheus'', the ''Magyar Museum'' also ceased in 1794 because of its editors were accused being members of the [[Jacobin]] movement of [[Ignác Martinovics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/SajtoTortenet-a-magyar-sajto-tortenete-1/a-magyar-sajto-tortenete-i-17051848-2D87/hirlap-es-folyoirat-irodalmunk-a-18-szazadban-91/az-elso-magyar-nyelvu-folyoiratok-3D3/az-orpheus-kazinczy-folyoirata-17891790-40F/|title=AZ ORPHEUS, KAZINCZY FOLYÓIRATA (1789–1790) - A magyar sajtó története - Kézikönyvtár|website=www.arcanum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy Crown of Hungary|Holy Crown]] was brought to Hungary in 1790. Kazinczy was a member of the Crown Guard. In the crown's room, as a member of the Honor Guard of [[Abaúj County]], he translated [[Friedrich Ludwig Schröder]]'s ''Hamlet'' and wrote his letter to László Prónay, [[Ispán]] of Csanád, in which he spoke in favor of Hungarian acting. He went to Kassa, and later to Buda when the efforts of Hungarian acting intensified there. Between September and October in 1790 he started to organize with the help of Pál Ráday the acting in Buda in Hungarian language. However, he had to travel home due to his official affairs.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[Jenő Andrássy : Kazinczy Ferenc életrajza. Pozsony, 1883.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Hadi és Más Nevezetes Történetek'' (''{{lang-en|Military and Other Remarkable Stories}}'') he took side against the ''student language'' (Latin language) and later published an impulsive article in favour of the introduction of the Hungarian language in schools and public life.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu1"/&gt;

After the death of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] the earlier system collapsed. The next emperor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] abolished the ''common schools'' in 1791 and Kazinczy's office was cancelled. He lost his job for the reason that "''I am not a Roman Catholic''", he wrote later in a letter.&lt;ref&gt;[Kazinczy Ferenc utazásai (Válogatta, szerkesztette, jegyzetelte: dr. Busa Margit.)

He did not want to apply for a job as an officer again. But on request of his mother and his uncle, András Kazinczy, he travelled to [[Vienna]] on May 7 to meet the emperor who was then unfortunately in [[Pisa]]. Kazinczy returned to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] on a ship, and after ten days he went to [[Székesfehérvár]] to meet Benedek Virág and Ádám Pálóczi Horváth. From there he came back to Vienna, where he was welcomed by the Crown Prince [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis]] on August 15, but his request was not heard. In Vienna Kazinczy made a friendship with József Hajnóczy. Kazinczy arrived home on September 10 and spent the winter in [[Alsóregmec]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Alsóregmec (1791-1794)===
[[File:Kazinczy2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of Ferenc Kazinczy by Friedrich John and Vincenz Georg Kininger from 1804]]

After the death of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] his successor, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], came to the throne. He convoked the National Assembly in [[Buda]]. In May 1792 Kazinczy sat in the Lower Chamber as an envoy of Baron Ferenc Vécsey. On June 17 he went to the emperor to apply for the secretary position of the chamber of the royal court. But this office was already reserved by József Hajnóczy.

After the end of the National Assembly Kazinczy returned home and worked in [[Alsóregmec]] for a year and a half until 1794. This time of his life was especially productive. He published one after another his translated and original pieces: ''Helikoni virágok 1791. esztendőre'' ({{lang-en|Flowers of Helicon for the year 1791}}, Pozsony 1791), ''Lanassza'' (tragedy in 4 acts, after Lemierre, Pozsony 1793), ''Sztella'' (drama 5 acts, after [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s work, Pozsony 1794.) ''A vak lantos'' (after [[Leonhard Wächter]]'s work). In addition, he published the tales of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in the translation of his friend János Aszalai with his own adaptation at his own expense. He translated also: ''Helikoni virágok'' volume 2, first 10 songs of [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]]'s ''[[Der Messias (Klopstock)|Der Messias]]'' in prose, one part of [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s ''Die Gratien'', [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''Brüder'', ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'' and ''[[Clavigo (play)|Clavigo]]'', two plays from [[Molière]]: ''Le Mariage forcé'' and ''Le Médecin malgré lui'', [[Pietro Metastasio]]'s ''Temistocle''; idylls from [[Salomon Gessner]]'s 15 times revised and a philosophical play from Samuel Christian Hollmann ''Die Oekonomie der Natur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcanum.hu/hu/online-kiadvanyok/MagyarIrodalom-magyar-irodalomtortenet-1/magyar-irodalomtortenet-pinter-jeno-5116/5-a-magyar-irodalom-a-xix-szazad-elso-harmadaban-15FC/kazinczy-ferenc-1771/kazinczy-ferenc-forditasai-17C2/|title=KAZINCZY FERENC FORDÍTÁSAI. - Magyar irodalomtörténet - Kézikönyvtár|website=www.arcanum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time he experienced that several enlightened policies of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] which were born in the spirit of [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] had been repealed and he thought that the system shifted in the wrong direction. He made an intense attack on the existing order in his translation of [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s ''Sokrates mainomenos oder die Dialoge des Diogenes von Sinope'' which was published in 1793. His dominant worldview reflects in the book with the arrogance of the clerics, the abandonment of the existing society, and the escape from this world. It was quickly banned.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

Menyhért Szulyovszky, a member of [[Ignác Martinovics]]'s [[Jacobin]] movement, handed over to him the ''Forradalmi Káté'' ({{lang-en|Revolutionary Doctrines}}) during the county assembly. On the inauguration of the chief-[[ispán]] of [[Nagykároly]] (today [[Carei]], [[Romania]]), Ferenc Kazinczy and his brother Dienes Kazinczy disputed, together with Ferenc Szentmarjay and György Szlávy, joining [[Ignác Martinovics]]'s [[Jacobin]] movement. In the beginning Kazinczy felt insecure to copy the ''Forradalmi Káté'', but Szentmarjay dispelled his concerns. Kazinczy liked the idea of the "bloodless revolution" which the movement propagated.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu"/&gt;

===In captivity (1794-1801)===
[[File:Louis Wallée Festung Kufstein 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Kufstein Fortress|Fortress of Kufstein]] in [[Tyrol]], [[Austria]] where Kazinczy was held in captivity]]

He was arrested on December 14, 1794, at his mother's house in [[Alsóregmec]]. He was brought to [[Buda]] and had to wait for the judgement in the Franciscan monastery of Buda. On May 8, 1795, the blood court sentenced him to death and his cattle had to be taken away. The decision was confirmed by the seven-person board. For three weeks he lived in the shadow of a sure death. Then partly by the intervention of his relatives, the emperor changed his sentence to imprisonment for an uncertain time.&lt;ref name="oszk.hu1"/&gt;

He stayed in Buda until September 27. Then he was taken to [[Brünn]] (today [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic]]), in the prison of the [[Špilberk Castle]] where he arrived on October 7. He lived in a damp, underground jail and got so sick that he could not get up from his bed. Sometimes his stationery were taken away from him; then he wrote with rust paint and rarely with his own blood. He used as pen a kneaded tin piece from the window. When he was allowed to use pen and ink he sat at his table and corrected his earlier translations or was working on new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/00000/00060/html/056/pc005624.html|title=A Pallas nagy lexikona|website=mek.oszk.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later his life conditions became better. On the order of [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Joseph]] he was placed on an upper floor on December 21 where he could live at his own expense and could use his books.

On January 6, 1796, he was brought to the Prison of Obrowitz (today Zábrdovice, Czech Republic) near Brno, and on June 22, 1799, he was transferred further to [[Kufstein Fortress]].

On June 30, 1800, his captors fearing the approaching French armies, he was taken first to Bratislava and then to Pest and finally to [[Munkács]] (today [[Mukachevo]], [[Ukraine]]).

On June 28, 1801, Kazinczy received amnesty from the king, who set him free and allowed him to return home. He spent a total of 2387 days (roughly 6½ years) in prison. He eternalized this part of his life in his book ''Fogságom naplója'' (''{{lang-en|Diary of my captivity}}'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://mek.oszk.hu/07000/07016/html/#85 Ferenc Kazinczy - Fogságom naplója published by Genius-Lantos Kiadó (1931) (2000)],{{ISBN|963-379-807-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

[[File:Jakobey kazinczy house.jpg|thumb|left|200px|His country house in Széphalom]]Following his release from captivity his fellow writers welcomed him gladly. But Kazinczy withdrew from the public.

When he was imprisoned, the value of his property was about twenty thousand [[forints]],  of which a significant part was spent on the cost of his captivity. He had nothing more than his grapefield and his hill in Kisbányácska near [[Sátoraljaújhely]] which he called ''Széphalom'' (''{{lang-en|Nice Hill}}''). In the winter of 1804 he again became seriously ill, but was luckily cured by József Szentgyörgyi, the chief doctor of [[Debrecen]], in the same year. Szentgyörgyi became his friend and so they corresponded a lot in later years.

In 1806 he settled in Széphalom, where only three rooms were ready from the new mansion. The love of his mother and her joy in the growing family somewhat compensated for the sufferings that had not come to an end with his release. He was constantly struggling with financial difficulties, since after his imprisonment, he had to clear the accounts he was charged with, and later he had to raise his children.

[[File:Kazinczy emléképület, Széphalom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mausoleum of Ferenc Kazinczy in Széphalom, Sátoraljaújhely was built by [[Miklós Ybl]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.hu/muzeum/271/Kazinczy_Ferenc_Emlekcsarnok|title=Múzeum - Kazinczy Ferenc Emlékcsarnok - Museum.hu|website=www.museum.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Shortly afterwards he married {{Interlanguage link multi|Sophie Török|hu|3=Kazinczyné Török Sophie}}, daughter of his former patron, and retired to his small estate at [[Széphalom (Sátoraljaújhely)|Széphalom]] or "Fairhill", near [[Sátoraljaújhely]] (Széphalom is already a part of Sátoraljaújhely), in the county of [[Zemplén (county)|Zemplén]]. In 1828 he took an active part in the conferences held for the establishment of the Hungarian academy, in the historical section of which he became the first corresponding member. He died of [[cholera]] at Széphalom.

==Legacy==

Kazinczy, known for possessing great beauty of style, was inspired greatly by the masterpieces of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]], [[Ossian]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]], [[Molière]], [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], [[Cicero]], [[Sallust]], [[Anacreon]], and many others. He also edited the works of {{Interlanguage link multi|Sándor Báróczi|hu|3=Báróczi Sándor}} (Pest, 1812, 8 vols.) and of the poet [[Nikola Zrinski|Zrinyi]] (1817, 2 vols.), and the poems of [[Gábor Dayka|Dayka]] (1813, 3 vols.) and of [[John Kis]] (1815, 3 vols.).

A collected edition of his works, consisting for the most part of translations, was published at Pest, 1814-1816, in nine volumes. original productions (''Eredeti Munkái''), largely made up of letters, were edited by [[József Bajza|Joseph Bajza]] and [[Ferenc Toldy|Francis Toldy]] at Pest, 1836-1845, in five volumes. Editions of his poems appeared in 1858 and 1863.

In 1873, a [[Neoclassicism|neo-classicistic]] memorial hall ([[mausoleum]]) and graveyard was built in [[Széphalom (Budapest)|Széphalom]] in his memory, based on the plans of the architect [[Miklós Ybl]]. Today it belongs to the [[Ottó Herman Museum]]. The Museum of the Hungarian Language is intended to be built here, whose [[cornerstone]] has been laid in the park.

==Personal life==
[[File:Portrait of Sophie Török Mrs. Kazinczy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sophie Török was Kazinczy's love and later his wife]]

On November 11, 1804, he married the daughter of his former principal, Count Lajos Török in Nagykázmér (today [[Kazimír]], [[Slovakia]]). His wife, Sophie Török, was 21 years younger than Kazinczy and came from a rich and prominent family. Kazinczy regarded himself for years not appropriate to her. He writes in his diary why he chose Sophie:

{{quote|"It is decided that I marry (...) But who? where? how? I could not rest my mind. Later a thought flew through my head if only I could find me somebody in whom at least half so much culture, mature soul and kindness are as in ''Sophie''. I did not dare dream about ''Sophie''. (...) However, as I was wanting to chase my memories about ''Sophie'' out of my mind, the more stubbornly the thought stuck in. "|author=Ferenc Kazinczy}}&lt;ref name="anyanyelvapolo.hu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anyanyelvapolo.hu/a-vilagnak-sok-jo-lelke-van-de-bizony-keves-sophie-ja-kazinczyne-torok-zsofia-portreja/|title="A világnak sok jó lelke van, (…) de bizony kevés Sophie-ja" – Kazinczyné Török Zsófia portréja|date=8 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sophie married Kazinczy because of love, and her father regarded his daughter's husband as a friend of his.

[[File:Kazinczy Lajos.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lajos Kazinczy, Ferenc's youngest son, is a national hero of Hungary]]

They lived together for almost 27 years, often struggling with serious financial problems, but according to their diaries and letters their life together was happy. They had four sons and four daughters. Unfortunately the firstborn daughter died in infancy in 1806.&lt;ref name="macse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macse.org/gudenus/mcsat/fam.aspx?id=9146|title=MAGYAR CSALÁDTÖRTÉNETI ADATTÁR|website=www.macse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kazinczy organized the Hungarian literary life, Sophie was most concerned with housekeeping and child rearing. She also taught other children of friends beside her own. According to Kazinczy's writings she knew well the herbs and the preparation of home-made medicine and therefore she could help many infected people during the [[1829–51 cholera pandemic|cholera epidemic of 1831]].&lt;ref name="anyanyelvapolo.hu"/&gt;

The youngest son of Kazinczy became a soldier and later an army colonel. He fought in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian War of Independence of 1848-1849]] and after the defeat of the uprising he was executed. He was afterwards named the [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|Fifteenth Martyr of Arad]].

'''Georges Valois''' (real name ''Alfred-Georges Gressent''; 7 October 1878 &amp;ndash; February 1945) was a [[France|French]] journalist and politician, born in [[Paris]]. He was a member of the French resistance and died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].

==Life and career==
Born in a working-class and peasant family, Georges Valois went to [[Singapore]] at the age of 17, returning to [[Paris]] in 1898.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://centre-histoire.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/georges_valois.html Biographical notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116034518/http://centre-histoire.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/georges_valois.html |date=2006-11-16 }} on the [[Sciences-Po]] website (''Centre d'histoire de Sciences Po - Georges Valois (Alfred-Georges Gressent) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early years he was an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalist]]. He found work as a secretary at ''L'Humanité Nouvelle'' where he met [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Later, after a stay in [[Imperial Russia]] (1903), Gressent worked as a secretary at [[Armand Colin]] publishing house.

After having written his first book, ''L'Homme qui vient'', he met the [[nationalist]] and monarchist writer [[Charles Maurras]] and became a member of his ''[[Action Française]]'' (AF) league, where he continued to follow the workers' movement. As his employment would have been compromised by an involvement in the [[French far-right|far-right monarchist league]], he took the [[pseudonym]] of Georges Valois.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1911, he created the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', a [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] group, and took direction of the AF's publishing house, the ''Nouvelle librairie nationale'', in 1912.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; The ''Cercle'' mixed Sorel's influence with the ''[[Integralism]]'' favored by [[Charles Maurras]], and was overtly [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. According to historian [[Zeev Sternhell]], this [[ideology]] was the prefiguration of [[Italian fascism]].

In 1925 Valois founded the weekly ''Le Nouveau Siècle'' (The New Century), seen by Maurras as a potential rival.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; As a result, he lost his job at the AF's publishing house, ''La Nouvelle librairie nationale''. The rupture with Maurras became even more serious after his creation, the same year, of the ''[[Faisceau]]'' league.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; 
His long-term collaborator [[Jacques Arthuys]] was one of the leaders of the new league.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Plaque en hommage à Jacques Arthuys, fondateur de l'OCM|language=fr
 |last=Bourrée |first=Fabrice|publisher= Fondation de la Résistance (Département AERI)
 |url=http://museedelaresistanceenligne.org/media5091-Plaque-en-hommage-A|accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was the first overtly [[Fascism|Fascist]] party outside [[Italy]], assisted by major entrepreneurs in their fight against the agitation of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). After some initial success (it was joined by such extremist figures as [[Hubert Lagardelle]] and [[Marcel Bucard]]), it disappeared in 1928, by which time Valois himself had already been excluded from the party. The middle-class may have withdrawn its support due to its lack of confidence in Fascism as a plausible solution for France, or because it considered, following a trend established by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] (which, in 1926, [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] the AF), that the best solution was to infiltrate the [[French Third Republic|republican institutions]].

Valois lost financial support, and after the dissolving of the ''Faisceau'' league in 1928, he founded the [[Republican Syndicalist Party]] (PRS). Jacques Arthuys was also a leader of this party.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=99 |last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|title=Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccgIu6oYkREC&amp;pg=PA99
 |accessdate=2017-06-30|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Second [[Cartel des gauches]] (Left-wing Coalition), this party published the ''Cahiers bleus'' (1928–1932), which hosted essays by widely different personalities, including [[Marcel Déat]] (a future [[neo-socialist]] excluded from the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and then [[Collaborationist]]), [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]] (co-founder of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], a [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal]] organisation that exists to this day), [[Pierre Mendès France]] (one of the young guards or ''jeunes loups'' of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]], he was to become [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]), and [[Edouard Berth]].

After the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], Valois founded ''Le Nouvel Age'' (The New Era), which he presented as a [[left-wing]] review - along with the ''Cahiers bleus'', however, ''Le Nouvel Age'', which claimed to promote a post-[[capitalism|Capitalist]] economy, was nonetheless advertising itself as [[Corporatism|corporatist]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1935, he attempted to join the SFIO, but was turned down, although being backed by [[Marceau Pivert]].

He took part in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] during [[Vichy France|Vichy]]. During [[World War II]], he moved near [[Lyon]] where he launched a cultural [[cooperative]] project.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Georges Valois was finally arrested by the [[Nazis]] on 18 May 1944, and died in February 1945 of [[typhus]] at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

'''Hans Moeser''' (April 7, 1906 – November 26, 1948) was a German [[SS]] functionary during the [[Nazi era]] who served at the [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camps. He was captured at the end of the war and tried by the United States Military Government Court. The only one among 19 defendants at the [[Dora Trial]] sentenced to death, Möser was executed at [[Landsberg Prison]] in 1948.

== SS career ==
Möser was born in Darmstadt, [[German Empire|Germany]]. A merchant by trade, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] in October 1929 (Member No. 155301) and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in July 1931 (Member No. 9555). In July 1940 Möser joined the staff at the newly opened [[SS]]-[[Hinzert concentration camp]], infamous for its brutality, and later he transferred to [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]]. From May 1943 until October 1943 he was posted to the [[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III Monowitz]] concentration camp as [[Kompanieführer]] of the Wachbatallion (Guard Battalion) in [[IG Farben]]'s "Buna" plant. By the end of April 1944 he was also Kompanieführer of the Men on Watch at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I main camp]] ({{lang-de|Stammlager}}).&lt;ref name="Lasik"&gt;Aleksander Lasik: "Die Organisationsstruktur des KL Auschwitz", in: Aleksander Lasik, Franciszek Piper, Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka: ''Auschwitz 1940-1945'', Volume I (Oświęcim: State Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau, 1999) p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

He transferred to the Dora central camp on May 1, 1944, initially serving as Deputy Protective Custody Camp Leader ({{lang-de|Schutzhaftlagerführer}}) and then in July promoted to First Protective Custody Camp Leader. Here he was to commit the atrocities that would lead to his later trial and execution. During hangings of prisoners, for instance, he sometimes had the ropes cut while the victims were still alive so as to prolong their suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Michel and [[Louis Nucéra]], ''Dora'' (Holt Rinehart and Winston, 1980) p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 1945, as the [[Red Army]] overran German positions on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the SS headquarters personnel at Auschwitz evacuated to Mittelbau-Dora. Auschwitz commander [[Richard Baer (Nazi)|Richard Baer]] and his staff took over the Dora complex and Möser was again made Deputy Leader, this time under [[Franz Hößler]].&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;Jens-Christian Wagner, ''Produktion des Todes: Das KZ Mittelbau-Dora'' (Göttingen, 2001) p. 670&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1945, as American [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] closed in on Mittelbau-Dora, Möser led a forced evacuation of over 3,000 prisoners to the railhead for transfer to Neuengamme. Due to the wartime situation the train was diverted to [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] instead. The prisoners were then led on a [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] for the last stage of their journey.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/microfilm/m1079.pdf |format=pdf |title=United States of America v.

==Trial, conviction and execution==
[[File:Dora-defendants.jpeg|thumb|The Dora defendants, Hans Möser 3rd from the right]]
Möser was arrested at the end of the war. Following the June 1945 [[Mittelwerk|Fedden Mission]] investigation of the Dora conditions, Möser was among 19 defendants tried by the American General Military Government Court in the [[Dora Trial]] (''The United States of America versus Arthur Kurt Andrae et al.'', Case Number 000-50-37), part of the [[Dachau Trials]]. Proceedings began on July 7, 1947 and lasted until December 30. Möser was found to have been present at hangings and personally shooting prisoners execution-style during escape attempts. The responsibility for the death marches during the final evacuation of Dora were also attributed to Möser. In his trial statement he said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The same way, with the same pleasure, as you shoot deer, I shot a human being. When I came to the SS and had to shoot the first three persons, my food didn't taste good for three days, but today it is a pleasure. It is a joy for me."&lt;ref&gt;Israel Gutman, ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'' (New York: Macmillan Library Reference, 1995) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Found guilty, he was the only defendant in the Dora Trial sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt; Following appeals, Möser was executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison on November 26, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.'' (Frankfurt am Main, 2007) p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irma Avegno''' (20 December 1881 – June 1913) was a [[Uruguay]]an woman of [[Montevideo|Montevidean]] high society who devoted herself to financial affairs.&lt;ref name=Tercera&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.diariolatercera.com.ar/0/vnc/nota.vnc?id=793 |title=Irma Avegno: Una historia enmarcada en la leyenda |trans-title=Irma Avegno: A History Framed in the Legend |last=Guerra |first=Federico Gastón |work=Diario La Tercera |location=Argentina |language=Spanish |date=25 February 2013 |access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Irma Avegno was the daughter of Emilio Avegno and María de Ávila, according to her birth certificate. She belonged to a wealthy family linked to the land and, politically, to the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]]. Her father was deputy of that party for [[Artigas Department]], and her uncle, Dr. José Romeu, was Secretary of State, both during the second government of [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]].

She was considered in her own time as a liberal and transgressive person,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mec.gub.uy/innovaportal/file/12030/1/folleto_programa.pdf |title=Folleto programa |publisher=[[Ministry of Education and Culture (Uruguay)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] |language=Spanish |access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; since she dedicated herself to financial business (she was a [[moneylender]]) and to activities traditionally reserved for men, such as betting on horse races. Her openly stated [[Lesbian|homosexual orientation]], which could only be recognized implicitly at the time, also contributed to that perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.raicesuruguay.com/raices/brevehistoria_piedrasblancas.html |title=Breve historia de Piedras Blancas. Parte 5 |trans-title=Brief History of Piedras Blancas. Part 5 |last=Brazeiro |first=Héctor |work=Revista Raíces |language=Spanish |access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avegno died in strange circumstances in [[Lomas de Zamora Partido|Lomas de Zamora]], [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] Province, [[Argentina]], as a [[fugitive]] from Uruguayan justice. The scandal unleashed by the debts that she left after escaping from the country sent a shockwave through the government of Batlle y Ordóñez. The official cause of death was [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=Tercera/&gt;

Her body was buried in the [[Central Cemetery of Montevideo]], after having arrived on the steamer ''Roma'', which was awaited by a crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004448307&amp;search=&amp;lang=es |title=Irma Avegno |work=Caras y Caretas |location=Buenos Aires |pages=98-100 |volume=16 |number=768 |language=Spanish |date=21 June 1913 |access-date=10 December 2017 |via=Biblioteca Nacional de España}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ishinagenjo''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 石投げんじょ, "stone throwing ''genjo''") is a folkloric phenomenon which is documented to occur in the [[Nishisonogi District, Nagasaki|Nishisonogi district]] of the [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], the waters of [[Enoshima]], and the city of [[Tosu, Saga|Tosu]] in the [[Saga Prefecture]].{{sfn|Yanagita|1955|p=79}}{{sfn|Sakurada|1933|p=6}}

"In the month of May, the rainy season, a group of fishermen are working at night in the midst of a thick fog. Suddenly comes the sound of a huge rock crashing into the ocean, a tremendous splash and crack that sends the boat rocking and the sailors panicking. However, there is no rock to be seen, even by the break of day."{{sfn|Yanagita|1955|p=79}}

In the Japanese Folklore Institute's book ''Comprehensive Lexicon of Japanese Folklore'', the phenomenon is explained as being the doing of a sea monster - or ''[[Yōkai]]'' (Japanese: 妖怪, variously translated as "spectre", "monster", "goblin") - known as the Iso Woman, or some other related sea witch. This explanation is echoed in [[Kunio Yanagita|Kunio Yanagita's]] book ''Yōkai Lectures'', in which Yanagita concurs that the phenomenon is best explained by some oceanic ''Yōkai''.{{sfn|Yanagita|1977|p=201}} Because of this association, many experts have hypothesised that the "jo" - written in [[Hiragana]] as "じょ" - actually means woman - represented by the [[Kanji]] "女"{{sfn|Mizuki|1994|p=58}}{{sfn|Muramaki|2000|p=34}} - which is the rendering used by folklorist Sakurada Katsunori in her paper ''Ghost Ships and Drowning People''.{{sfn|Sakurada|1933|p=6}} Written thus, Ishinagenjo (石投女) translates literally to "stone-throwing woman". The [[Kojien]], on the other hand, renders "じょ" as "尉", meaning "captain" or "old man". The "stone-throwing old man" (石投尉) is likened in the text of the Kojien to an old man idly throwing stones into the sea.{{sfn|Shinmura|2008|p=147}} However, Yōkai expert Murakami Kenji has expressed doubts regarding the existence of any documentary evidence to visually identify the creature responsible for the phenomenon described.{{sfn|Muramaki|2000|p=34}} Indeed, the Kojien notes that it is assumed that fishermen only imagine seeing a monster, but that ultimately the experience as a whole is merely an illusion.{{sfn|Shinmura|2008|p=147}}

'''James Alexander Gordon''' (10 February 1936 – 18 August 2014) was a Scottish radio broadcaster, best known for reading the classified check of the [[association football|football]] results every Saturday at 17:00 on [[BBC Radio Five Live]]'s ''[[Sports Report]]''.

Born in [[Edinburgh]] in 1936,&lt;ref name="NS1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/139119 |title=JAG, the man who has read the results for nearly 30 years |author=Hunter Davies|authorlink= |coauthors= |date=27 November 2000 |format= |work= |publisher=New Statesman|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his youth he was paralysed with [[polio]] and he spent a large part of his childhood in hospital.&lt;ref name="urlBBC NEWS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2299769.stm |title=Football scores 5 Polio 0|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2002-12-28|format= |work= |publisher=BBC News|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-05-22 |first=Jane |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in music publishing before joining the [[British Broadcasting Corportation|BBC]] in 1972, becoming an announcer and newsreader (mostly on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]]) until the early 1990s. In 1974 he followed in the footsteps of John Webster, reading the classified football results, first on Radio 2 and later on Five Live. 

Popularly known as "Jag",&lt;ref name="NS1"/&gt; he used his intonation, when pronouncing the names of the clubs, to indicate whether a match had ended in a home win, away win or draw.&lt;ref name="NS1" /&gt;

Gordon also worked as a freelance voice artist, recording voice-overs and commenting on company videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/393728.0/ |title=From Arsenal to Liverpool to Wolves – James has the results (From Times Series) |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced his retirement from radio in July 2013 following surgery to remove his larynx after being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23434089 |title=James Alexander Gordon to retire as football results reader|work=BBC NewsOnline|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as the reader of the classified football results by former [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] newsreader [[Charlotte Green]] from late September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23592586 |title=Charlotte Green replaces James Alexander Gordon on BBC Radio|work=BBC News Online|date=6 August 2013|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon reprised his role as announcer of the football results to read fictional results for the play ''Jumpers for Goalposts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23795394 | work=BBC News | title=Playwright Tom Wells on Jumpers For Goalposts | date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Roberto Camisasca''' (born 9 August 1951), best known as '''Juri Camisasca''', is an Italian singer-songwriter and composer.

==Life and career ==
Born in [[Melegnano]], a self-taught musician, Camisasca debuted in 1974 with the [[progressive rock]] album ''La finestra dentro'', produced by  [[Pino Massara]] and [[Franco Battiato]], which received large critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="Deregibus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Enrico Deregibus|title=Dizionario completo della Canzone Italiana|publisher=Giunti Editore, 2010|pages=83–4|isbn=8809756258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he collaborated as a vocalist and as a songwriter with Battiato and with other singers, and he took part to the musical project Telaio Magnetico.&lt;ref name="Deregibus"/&gt;  

In 1979 Camisasca decided to enter a [[Benedictine monastery]], still keeping to be active as a songwriter for artists such as [[Milva]], [[Alice (singer)|Alice]] and [[Giuni Russo]].&lt;ref name="Deregibus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite book|last=Eddy Anselmi|title=Festival di Sanremo: almanacco illustrato della canzone italiana|publisher=Panini Comics, 2009|isbn=8863462291|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987 he left the monastic life to embrace an [[Hermit|eremitical life]] at the slopes of [[Mount Etna]].&lt;ref name="Deregibus"/&gt;  After participating to the Battiato's [[opera]] ''Genesi'' as a singer and as the narrating voice, he reprised his record activity in 1988 with the album ''Te Deum''.&lt;ref name="Deregibus"/&gt;  

Camisasca is also active as an [[icon]] painter, an activity he gradually focused in later years.&lt;ref name="Deregibus"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3817">'''József Dudás''' (22 September 1912 - 19 January 1957), an [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician and [[Resistance movement|resistance fighter]], was born in Marosvásárhely (in Romanian: [[Târgu Mureş]]) in [[Austria-Hungary]] (today in [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]]).

As a very young man, he joined the illegal Communist Party in Transylvania.  In 1933 he was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison. When Northern Transylvania was transferred to Hungary as part of the [[Second Vienna Award]] in 1940, he was released and he moved to Budapest. During World War II, he worked within the anti-fascist movement acting as a liaison between groups. When the war ended, Dudás was a member of an unofficial ceasefire delegation that visited Moscow, and he was a founding member of the [[Liberation Committee of the Hungarian National Uprising]].

In late 1945 he joined the [[Independent Smallholders' Party]] and was elected to the Budapest government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rev.hu/history_of_56/szerviz/kislex/biograf/dudas_uk.htm|title=József Dudás|website=www.rev.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communists mounted their campaign to take over Hungary, Dudás was arrested and detained until he was handed over to Romanian state security in 1951. Released in 1954, he returned to Hungary.

Working as an engineer when the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] broke out, he took to addressing crowds and on 29 October, established the Second District National Committee, with a 25-point program demanding, a coalition government, a multi-party system and neutrality. He also started a newspaper (Magyar Függetlenség—Hungarian Independence)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ancAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=J%C3%B3zsef+Dud%C3%A1s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkJaHtQvO6&amp;sig=mxZZbLDcSufpJ-oWh2ypcmHBUO8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCvImMx4bXAhXQaFAKHaIBDWQ4ChDoAQg4MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=J%C3%B3zsef+Dud%C3%A1s&amp;f=false|title=Imre Nagy: A Biography|first=Janos|last=Rainer|date=30 August 2009|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which headlined, ‘We do not recognize the present government!’ At this same time the so-called "Dudás Group" consisting of about 400 armed men was formed. Dudás soon acquired a bad reputation among the revolutionary forces, as he started  negotiations with Colonel Malashenko, acting chief of staff of the Soviet Special Forces, with the aim of being recognized by the Soviets as the main seat of political and military power in Hungary, instead of [[Imre Nagy]]. The Dudás group also became known for the campaign of terror it unleashed against members of Hungary's [[State Protection Authority|AVH]] [[Secret Police]], lynching or otherwise executing offenders on sight.  The activities of the group went to such an extreme that other revolutionaries began arresting AVH officers for their own protection.

He continued publishing his newspaper criticizing the Nagy government until his own armed men dismissed him on 3 November, and he was arrested by government forces for acts attributed to him, or rumors of such acts (an attack on the Foreign Ministry; looting of the National Bank). On 4 November he was wounded and taken to a hospital.

On 21 November he was tricked into entering the Parliament building and was arrested by the Soviets. He was charged with leadership of a conspiracy and on 14 January 1957 he was sentenced to death. He was executed on 19 January 1957.

==Early life==
Riordan was born in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] and graduated from the [[University of Bradford]].&lt;ref name=ww&gt;‘RIORDAN, Linda’, Who's Who 2013, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2013; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2012; online edn, November 2012 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U45754 Profile], ukwhoswho.com; accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ukpolitics.telegraph.co.uk/Halifax/Linda+Riordan Linda Riordan - Parliamentary candidates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306092741/http://ukpolitics.telegraph.co.uk/Halifax/Linda+Riordan |date=6 March 2012 }}, ukpolitics.telegraph.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She served as a [[Calderdale]] councillor for eleven years,&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; representing the [[Ovenden]] ward from 1995 to 2006, when she stood down to devote herself full-time to her role as an MP. She worked as private secretary for her predecessor as Halifax's Labour MP [[Alice Mahon]] between 2001 and 2005,&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; and was active in the local Co-operative Party as secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She was chosen as the Labour candidate from an [[all-women shortlist]] but her candidature was at first opposed by the Party's ruling [[National Executive Committee]] owing to concerns about selection process. She was later allowed to stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/localnews/Victory-for-councillor-in-Labour.814432.jp Victory for councillor in Labour candidate battle],  YorkshirePost.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Riordan was elected in 2005 and returned to Parliament with a reduced majority in 2010&lt;ref name="beeb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Halifax MP Linda Riordan to stand down at general election|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-31434198|accessdate=8 April 2015|publisher=BBC|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served on various select committees including the Justice Committee, the Procedure Committee, the Environmental Audit Select Committee, the European Scrutiny Committee and the all-Party Crossrail Committee. She was one of 16 signatories of an open letter to [[Ed Miliband]] in January 2015 calling on the party to commit to oppose further austerity, take rail franchises back into public ownership and strengthen collective bargaining arrangements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=George|title=The Labour left demand a change of direction - why their intervention matters|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/labour-left-demand-change-direction-why-their-intervention-matters|accessdate=5 April 2015|publisher=New Statesman|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 she announced that she would be standing down at general election in May, citing ill health.&lt;ref name="beeb"/&gt;

==Expenses==
In December 2010 it was revealed that Riordan had secretly repaid £105.86 in wrongly claimed expenses. The repayment came about after Riordan had used [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] stationery for [[party political]] purposes. Riordan apologised, blaming volunteers for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/documents/pcfs/written-evidence/2008-09/rectified/riordan-baines-290708.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/8192581/MPs-expenses-the-secret-deals-revealed.html MPs' expenses: the secret deals revealed], telegraph.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the Commons Speaker [[John Bercow]] blocked the release of data showing which MPs were letting their homes to other MPs for financial gain. However, a study of parliamentary records was published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraph19oct12&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9619333/Labour-MP-made-thousands-letting-flat-to-fellow-member.html Expenses scandal: Labour MP made thousands letting flat to fellow member], ''Daily Telegraph'', 2012-10-19. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; This article listed problematic expense claims of Riordan and 26 other MPs,&lt;ref name=gran19oct12 /&gt; and said that she received rental income from a flat she owned in London which was rented out through an agency&lt;ref name=gran19oct12&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/mps-expenses-row-defend-arrangements?INTCMP=SRCH MPs in expenses row defend renting arrangements], ''The Guardian'', 2012-10-19. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; to fellow Labour MP [[Iain McKenzie]] and was, at the same time, able to claim expenses on another flat she rented in the city under an arrangement allowed by [[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority|IPSA]] rules.&lt;ref name=telegraph22oct12&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9626170/Linda-Riordan-promises-to-pay-back-profit-on-flat-sale-after-renting-to-fellow-Labour-MP.html Linda Riordan promises to pay back profit on flat sale after renting to fellow Labour MP], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 2012-10-22. Retrieved 2013-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Riordan, along with other MPs, said that under new rules she was banned from receiving mortgage interest expenses by IPSA and, as a result, had been forced to let the property.&lt;ref name=gran19oct12/&gt;

Days after the report, Riordan put the flat on the market, having previously tried to sell the flat in 2010. She pledged to ensure that any profit she gained from the sale would be paid back to the taxpayer.&lt;ref name=telegraph22oct12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hc23oct12&gt;[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/local/update-on-halifax-mp-linda-riordan-revelations-she-says-flat-will-be-put-up-for-sale-1-5051502 Update on Halifax MP Linda Riordan revelations – she says flat will be put up for sale], ''Halifax Courier'', 23 October 2012; retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was married to Alan Riordan from 1979 until his death in April 2007, of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/MP39s-tribute-to-husband-Alan.2714699.jp MP's tribute to husband, Alan, 65], HalifaxCourier.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine Morès-A 03.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant de Morès]]
'''Antoine-Amédée-Marie-Vincent Manca Amat de Vallombrosa, Marquis de Morès et de Montemaggiore''' (June 14, 1858 – June 9, 1896), commonly known as the '''Marquis de Morès''', was a famous [[duelist (occupation)|duelist]], [[frontier]] ranchman in the [[Badlands]] of [[Dakota Territory]] during the final years of the [[American Old West]] era, a railroad pioneer in [[Vietnam]], and an anti-Semitic politician in his native [[France]].

==Early life==
Born Antoine-Amédée-Marie-Vincent Manca Amat de Vallombrosa, he inherited the title Marquis de Morès et de Montemaggiore,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'', 1882, ''s.v.'' "Vallombrosa (Manca Amat de)".&lt;/ref&gt; but he was usually called Marquis de Morès.

De Morès began life as a soldier, graduating in 1879 from [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|St. Cyr]], the leading [[military academy]] of France. Among his classmates was [[Philippe Pétain]], famous [[French Army|French]] general of [[World War I]] and the ill-fated future leader of the [[Vichy France]] government in [[World War II]].

After St. Cyr, he entered [[Saumur]], France's premier [[cavalry]] school, where he trained to be an officer. He was later sent to [[Algiers]], helping to put down an uprising. It was while in Algiers that he had his first [[duel]], starting his career as the most celebrated duelist of his day.

[[File:Chateau de mores in medora.jpg|thumb|The "[[Chateau de Mores]]" in [[Medora, North Dakota]]]]

==The Badlands==
He resigned from the cavalry in 1882 and married [[Medora von Hoffman]], sometimes called the Marquise. Soon thereafter, he would move to the North Dakota badlands to begin ranching, purchasing {{convert|44500|acre|km2}} for that purpose.  He also opened a [[stagecoach]] business. He named his simple vernacular house in [[Medora, North Dakota]],  the "[[Chateau de Mores]]"; it is preserved as a historic house there.

He tried to revolutionize the ranching industry by shipping refrigerated meat to [[Chicago]] by railroad, thus bypassing the Chicago stockyards. He built a meat-packing plant for this purpose in Medora, the town he founded in 1883 and named for his wife.

{{quote|text=The railroads, undoubtedly working hand in glove with the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago beef trust]], refused to grant him the same rebates on freight rates they gave his competitors, adding to his costs. And range-fed—on grass—beef turned out to be less popular with consumers than beef that had been fattened—on corn—in the stockyards of Chicago. The marquis's father-in-law withdrew his financial backing and soon the packing plant closed. Not long after, just as winter was settling in on the Bad Lands in 1886, de Mores and his wife left Medora for good. The short-lived reign of the Emperor of the Bad Lands was over.
Footnote:
Back in France, the Marquis claimed the Chicago beef trust was dominated by Jews and announced himself the victim of  "A Jewish Plot." Turning to politics, he organized a movement that mixed socialism with rabid [[anti-semitism]] that fed the French collective mania which led to the [[Dreyfus affair]]. On 23 June 1892, he killed a Jewish captain, Armand Mayer, during a duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 June 1892 |title=The de Mores-Mayer Duel |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/06/25/104137251.pdf |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]  |access-date=16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 (after ten years), he was killed by North African tribesmen while carrying out a wild scheme to unite the Muslims in a Holy War against the British and the Jews.|sign=Nathan Miller|source=''Theodore Roosevelt: A Life''&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Roosevelt: "A Life" by Nathan Miller, page 172, 1992. William Morrow and Company, Inc. New York&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He became famous in the West as a rancher and gunslinger, getting [[arrested]] for [[murder]] a few times. He was always [[acquitted]]. Known as an [[adventurer]], he was quick to anger and was engaged in numerous duels throughout his life; he notoriously sent [[Theodore Roosevelt]] what the latter interpreted as a challenge to a duel, though nothing came of it.

[[Outlaw]]s were very numerous in the Badlands, and cattle and horse rustling had become unbearably common. Frontiersman [[Granville Stuart]] organized a vigilance committee to fight the [[Cattle rustling|rustlers]]. De Morès told Roosevelt of the plan, and the two offered their services to be [[vigilantes]]. Stuart declined, stating that de Morès and Roosevelt were both well known and their presence could ruin the element of surprise. [[Stuart's Stranglers|Stuart's vigilantes, called The Stranglers]], struck viciously against the rustlers, greatly weakening their power in the Badlands.

By 1885 it became obvious that de Morès' business was failing. He was losing a business war against the beef trust, and the enterprise collapsed. He would later sell the ranch and other assets in the Badlands.

==Gulf of Tonkin==
Subsequently, he left Dakota Territory and returned to France. He was commissioned by the French army to build a proposed [[railroad]] in [[Vietnam]], from the [[China|Chinese]] frontier to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], and arrived in [[Asia]] to lead railroad construction in the fall of 1888. He observed the [[Vietnamese people]], and cautioned the French to be kind to them. He wrote, "The colonization of Tonkin will not be accomplished with rifles, but with public works."

He believed a railroad was needed there, and hoped to have one extending all the way to [[Yunnan Province]] in China. This was partly a reaction to a [[United Kingdom|British]] railroad being built from [[Burma]] to China.

Political intrigue, being notorious in France in that day, impeded construction of the railroad. A [[prime minister]] was deposed, which led to a new undersecretary of the navy, [[Jean Constans]], who opposed de Morès' plan from the start. The Marquis was recalled to France in 1889, and the railroad project was ruined.

==France, Algeria, assassination==
Upon his return, he would be embroiled in political controversies for the remainder of his life.

He started by attacking Constans, enlisting the aid of [[Georges Clemenceau]], but failed to unseat him in the next election. His politics became overtly [[anti-Semitic]], and he challenged [[Ferdinand-Camille Dreyfus]], a [[Jewish]] member of the [[Chamber of Deputies]], to a duel after Dreyfus wrote an article attacking him. De Morès said he wanted [[Gaul]] for the Gauls, and Dreyfus replied by writing that de Morès had a [[Spain|Spanish]] title, a father with an [[Italy|Italian]] title, and an [[United States|American]] wife who was neither [[Christian]] nor French. At the duel Dreyfus fired first and missed, and the Marquis wounded his opponent in the arm.

In 1889 de Morès joined ''La Ligue antisémitique de France'' ([[Antisemitic League of France]]) founded by [[Edouard Drumont]]. After more verbal attacks on [[Jews]], he went to [[Algeria]] to strengthen the French hold there and stop British advances into the interior of Africa. He used anti-Semitic rhetoric to his advantage in Algeria, giving speeches claiming that French and African Jews and the British were conspiring to conquer the entire [[Sahara Desert]]. With the British in a difficult position in the [[Sudan]] after the death of General [[Charles George Gordon]] in the siege of [[Khartoum]], de Morès planned a trip there to meet with the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]], a powerful [[Muslim]] leader who was intent on undermining British hegemony in the region. He traveled to North Africa, selected Arabic men in [[Tunis]] to escort him, and set out his caravan towards [[Kebili]].

The French officer in charge of the post at Kebili, Lieutenant Leboeuf, received a telegram from the French Intelligence Officer and [[Military attaché]] in Tunis, advising him not to give de Morès' expedition any assistance. Furthermore, Leboeuf was told to ensure de Morès traveled by the way of the Berresof oasis. A [[marabout]] from [[Guemar]] dispatched a messenger to dissident tribesmen in Messine, southeast of [[Ghadames]], telling them to come to Berresof at once to kill a Frenchman. The recipients of the message were told the man they were to kill would be carrying a great deal of money, would not have an official escort, and that whoever killed him would not be prosecuted.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=170–171}} While he was in Kebili, de Morès received a telegram from General de la Roque, commander of the division at [[Constantine, Algeria]], telling him that [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] guides would be waiting for him at Berresof. de Morès expressed surprise at this, as he had not asked de la Roque to find him any guides.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=175}}  de Morès departed Kebili on May 20, and the Tuareg "guides" joined his caravan on June 3. On the morning of June 9 the Tuareg sprung their attack. de Morès was able to kill several of his attackers before he was gunned down.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=186}}

On 28 July 1902, after a trial in Sousse (Tunisia) two of the murderers were sentenced: El-Kheir ben Abd-el-Kader to the death penalty and Hamma Ben Cheikh to 20 years of forced labor. During the trial his widow, the Marquise, sought to expose the French government as responsible for the murder but the tribunal did not agree.&lt;ref&gt;Liberation, 2 August 1902&lt;/ref&gt; She then even paid [[Isabelle Eberhardt]] to return to Africa to investigate his death, though Eberhardt made no real attempts to investigate the matter,{{sfn|Bodley|1968|page=149}} and no government official was ever convicted.{{sfn|Bodley|1968|pp=186–187}}

'''James Herbert Keenan''' (born April 17, 1964),&lt;ref name=McAlley-86/&gt; known professionally as '''Maynard James Keenan''' or '''MJK''', is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944475028|title=A perfect union of contrary things|last=Sarah,|first=Jensen,|others=Keenan, Maynard James,|isbn=9781495024429|location=Milwaukee, WI|oclc=944475028}}&lt;/ref&gt; author, and winemaker. He is best known as the vocalist for the [[rock music|rock]] bands [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[A Perfect Circle]], and [[Puscifer]].

In addition to his music career, Keenan has ventured into fields such as acting, improvisational sketch comedy, and winemaking. He currently owns Merkin Vineyards and the associated winery [[Caduceus Cellars]]. Since rising to fame, he has been noted as being reclusive; however, he does emerge for the occasional interview and to support charitable causes.

==Early life==
James Herbert Keenan was born into a [[Southern Baptist]] family in [[Ravenna, Ohio]], on April 17, 1964, the only child of Judith Marie (née Dougherty; November 22, 1943{{spaced ndash}}June 18, 2003) and Michael Loren Keenan (March 4, 1946).&lt;ref&gt;Ohio Birth Index, 1908-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ohio, Death Index, 1908-1932, 1938-1944, and 1958-2007&lt;/ref&gt; When his parents divorced in 1968, his father moved to [[Scottville, Michigan]] and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an "intolerant and unworldly household" where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.&lt;ref name=McAlley-86&gt;{{harvnb|McAlley|2007|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keenan's mother suffered a paralyzing [[cerebral aneurysm]] in 1976, when Maynard was 11 (the inspiration for creative works such as Tool's songs "jimmy" and "Wings for Marie" as well as A Perfect Circle's "Judith").&lt;ref name=McAlley-88&gt;{{harvnb|McAlley|2007|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Scottville. Keenan considers this "the best move [he] ever made".&lt;ref name=McAlley-86/&gt; In 1982, he graduated from Mason County Central High School in Scottville, where he was a member of the wrestling team. His father was one of the coaches for the team and left coaching at the same time Keenan graduated in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/tool-maynard-james-keenan-helps-high-school-wrestling-team/|title=Tool's Maynard James Keenan Helps Train High School Wrestling Team |work=Loudwire |date=2013-12-09 |accessdate=2017-10-23|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tool===

After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]] who had in college heard him singing on a demo. Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones suggested that they form a band. Reluctant,&lt;ref name="AV"/&gt; Keenan eventually agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed.

Tool signed to [[Zoo Entertainment (record label)|Zoo Entertainment]] in November 1991 and released the ''[[Opiate (EP)|Opiate]]'' EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with [[Fishbone]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]].

Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.&lt;ref name=GPC&gt;{{cite web

The band members were outspokenly critical of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with ''[[NY Rock]]'' in 2000, Keenan stated, "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed.

On December 12, 2012, Tool's webmaster posted on the band website:

{{quote|Something that might be encouraging to some Tool enthusiasts is that while riding with Danny to Chili John's yesterday, I heard a lot of new Tool music (sans Maynard). This was the most new material that I've heard so far, although a few of the riffs and arrangements were familiar. So, what did I think? Dare I say that it sounded like... Tool (some of it reminiscent to earlier Tool stuff, with other parts pushing the envelope), and I assume that it will sound even more like Tool once the vocal melodies, etc. have been added. To answer your next question, I cannot say how far along in the writing process the band is. If I had to GUESS, I would say more than half way (and keep in mind that in the past, at least, the writing went faster once the first few [more complex] songs were finished).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During Tool's post-''Ænima'' hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with [[Billy Howerdel]], Tool's [[Guitar technician|guitar tech]] through the ''Ænima'' tour, on a different project. The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album ''[[Mer de Noms]]'' in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled ''[[Thirteenth Step]]'', a reference to [[twelve-step program]]s (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, ''[[Emotive (album)|eMOTIVe]]'', was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles "[[Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums]]"—a song inspired by "Pet" that was originally released on ''Thirteenth Step''—and "Passive". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he "tested the waters" and was subsequently "crucified" for it because of the content.&lt;ref name=AV/&gt; It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled ''[[aMotion|aMOTION]]'', which was certified platinum within a month of its release.

Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When asked, in an interview for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' that same month, about the possibility of another A Perfect Circle album, Keenan stated, "Maybe, someday, a song on a soundtrack. But an album? No."&lt;ref name="McAlley-88"/&gt; A year later, on December 9, 2008, [[blabbermouth.net]] reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel have been writing new music for A Perfect Circle.

Instead, they will focus on "one or two songs at a time", which will most likely be released via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Puscifer contributed the song "The Undertaker (Renholder Mix)" to the [[Underworld: Evolution: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] of ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'', where "Renholder", a moniker for Danny Lohner created by the members of A Perfect Circle, is the reversal of "Re: D Lohner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band "[[Puscifer]]". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he ''knows'' it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" He also appears in episode 2.6, "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", as one of the viewers of ''Coupon: The Movie'', saying "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater.

With Satan there's so much gray area."&lt;ref name=Blender/&gt;

In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created "Free [[Frances Bean]]" tee-shirts to represent his own platform.

==Etymology==
{{Wikispecies|Naja naja}}
In Sanskrit, a {{IAST|nāgá}} ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:नाग#Sanskrit|नाग]]}}) is a [[cobra]], the [[Indian cobra]] (''Naja naja''). A synonym for ''{{IAST|nāgá}}'' is ''{{IAST|phaṇin}}'' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:फणिन्#Sanskrit|फणिन्]]}}). There are several words for "snake" in general, and one of the very commonly used ones is ''{{IAST|sarpá}}'' ({{lang|sa|[[:wikt:सर्प#Sanskrit|सर्प]]}}). Sometimes the word ''{{IAST|nāgá}}'' is also used generically to mean "snake".&lt;ref name=Apte&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apte|first1=Vaman Shivram|title=The student's English-Sanskrit dictionary|date=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=81-208-0299-3|edition=3rd rev. &amp; enl.}}, p. 423.

The mythological serpent race that took form as cobras often can be found in Hindu iconography. The nāgas are described as the powerful, splendid, wonderful and proud semidivine race that can assume their physical form either as human, partial human-serpent or the whole serpent. Their domain is in the enchanted underworld, the underground realm filled with gems, gold and other earthly treasures called Naga-loka or Patala-loka. They are also often associated with bodies of waters — including rivers, lakes, seas, and wells — and are guardians of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/naga-Hindu-mythology|title=Naga {{!}} Hindu mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their power and venom made them potentially dangerous to humans. However, they often took beneficial protagonist role in Hindu mythology, such as in [[Samudra manthan]] mythology, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], a [[Nagaraja|nāgarāja]] who abides on Shiva's neck, became the churning rope for churning of the Ocean of Milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/15105/why-was-vasuki-used-in-samudra-manthan-great-ocean-churning|title=Why was vasuki used in Samudra Manthan great ocean Churning|website=Hinduism Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eternal mortal enemies are the [[Garuda]]s, the legendary semidivine birdlike-deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Garuda|title=Garuda {{!}} Hindu mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Vishnu]] is originally portrayed in the form sheltered by [[Shesha|Śeṣanāga]] or reclining on Śeṣa, but the iconography has been extended to other deities as well. The serpent is a common feature in [[Ganesha]] iconography and appears in many forms: around the neck,&lt;ref&gt;For the story of wrapping {{IAST|Vāsuki}} around the neck and {{IAST|Śeṣa}} around the belly and for the name in his sahasranama as {{IAST|Sarpagraiveyakāṅgādaḥ}} ("Who has a serpent around his neck"), which refers to this standard iconographic element, see: Krishan, Yuvraj (1999), Gaņeśa: Unravelling An Enigma, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|81-208-1413-4}}, pp=51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; use as a [[Upanayana|sacred thread]] (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|yajñyopavīta}}'')&lt;ref&gt;For text of a stone inscription dated 1470 identifying Ganesha's sacred thread as the serpent {{IAST|Śeṣa}}, see: Martin-Dubost, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; wrapped around the stomach as a belt, held in a hand, coiled at the ankles, or as a throne.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of snake images in Ganesha iconography, see: Martin-Dubost, Paul (1997).

==Buddhism==
[[File:2006 0922 wat phrathat doi suthep buddha mucalinda.JPG|thumb|[[Mucalinda]] sheltering [[Gautama Buddha]] at [[Wat Phra That Doi Suthep]] in [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand]]
As in Hinduism, the Buddhist nāga generally has the form of a great cobra, usually with a single head but sometimes with many. At least some of the nāgas are capable of using magic powers to transform themselves into a human semblance. The nāga is sometimes portrayed as a human being with a snake or dragon extending over his head.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Nagas and Draconic Prototypes" in: Ingersoll, Ernest, et al., (2013). ''The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0&lt;/ref&gt; One nāga, in human form, attempted to become a monk; and when telling it that such ordination was impossible, the Buddha told it how to ensure that it would be reborn a human, and so able to become a monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brahmavamso|first=Ajahn|title=VINAYA The Ordination Ceremony of a Monk|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut020.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Devadatta" chapter of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', the daughter of the dragon king, an eight year old [[longnü]] ({{IAST|nāga}}), after listening to [[Manjusri|Mañjuśrī]] preach the Lotus Sutra, transforms into a male Bodhisattva and immediately reaches full enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Nancy (1981).

[[File:Wat Phra Kaew Naga.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Naga at the steps of a building in the [[Wat Phra Kaew]] in [[Bangkok]]]]

Nagas are believed to both live on [[Mount Meru]], among the other minor deities, and in various parts of the human-inhabited earth. Some of them are water-dwellers, living in streams or the ocean; others are earth-dwellers, living in underground caverns.

The nāgas are the followers of {{IAST|[[Virūpākṣa]]}} (Pāli: Virūpakkha), one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] who guards the western direction. They act as a guard upon Mount Sumeru, protecting the [[deva (Buddhism)|dēvas]] of [[Trāyastriṃśa]] from attack by the [[Asura (Buddhism)|asūras]].

Among the notable nāgas of Buddhist tradition is [[Mucalinda]], [[Nagaraja|Nāgarāja]] and protector of the Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra (I, 3), shortly after his enlightenment, the Buddha is meditating in a forest when a great storm arises, but graciously, King Mucalinda gives shelter to the Buddha from the storm by covering the Buddha's head with his seven snake heads.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;P. 72 ''How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings'' By Richard Francis Gombrich&lt;/ref&gt; Then the king takes the form of a young [[Brahmin]] and renders the Buddha homage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It is noteworthy that the two chief disciples of the Buddha, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Moggallāna]] are both referred to as ''Mahānāga'' or "Great Nāga".&lt;ref&gt;P. 74 ''How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings'' By Richard Francis Gombrich&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most important figures in Buddhist history symbolize nagas in their names such as [[Dignāga]], [[Nagasena|Nāgāsēna]], and, although other etymons are assigned to his name, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].

In the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] and [[Mahasiddha|Mahāsiddha]] traditions,{{sfn|Béer|1999|p=71}} nagas in their half-human form are depicted holding a naga-jewel, [[kumbha]]s of [[amrita]], or a [[terma (religion)|terma]] that had been elementally encoded by adepts.

According to tradition, Prajñapāramita sutras had been given by the Buddha to a great Naga who guarded them in the sea, and were conferred upon Nāgārjuna later.&lt;ref name="Donaldson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas E.

==Other traditions==
{{see also|Phaya Naga}}
In [[Thailand]] and [[Java (island)|Java]], the nāga is a wealthy [[underworld]] deity. For [[Malaysia|Malay]] sailors, nāgas are a type of dragon with many heads. In [[Laos]] they are beaked water serpents.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Cambodia===
[[File:NagaPhnomPenh.jpg|thumb|upright|Cambodian seven-headed naga at the Royal Palace in [[Phnom Penh]]]]
The seven-headed nagas often depicted as guardian statues, carved as balustrades on causeways leading to main Cambodian temples, such as those found in [[Angkor Wat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=mI0vKhZXJqwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=naga+in+angkor+wat+cambodia&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit8Yf56vraAhVL6Y8KHc7qCRwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naga%20in%20angkor%20wat%20cambodia&amp;f=false|title=The Mythical Creatures Bible: The Definitive Guide to Legendary Beings|last=Rosen|first=Brenda|date=2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=9781402765360|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently they represent the seven races within naga society, which has a mythological, or symbolic, association with "the seven colors of the rainbow". Furthermore, Cambodian naga possess numerological symbolism in the number of their heads. Odd-headed naga symbolise the Male Energy, Infinity, Timelessness, and Immortality. This is because, numerologically, all odd numbers come from One (1). Even-headed naga are said to be "Female, representing Physicality, Mortality, Temporality, and the Earth."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Indonesia===
[[File:Yogyakarta Indonesia Kraton-the-Sultans-Palace-03.jpg|thumb|left|Crowned golden Naga woodcarving at [[Keraton]] [[Yogyakarta]], [[Java]]]]
In [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Bali#Culture|Balinese culture]], [[Indonesia]], a naga is depicted as a crowned, giant, magical serpent, sometimes winged. It is similarly derived from the [[Shiva]]-Hinduism tradition, merged with Javanese [[animism]]. Naga in Indonesia mainly derived and influenced by Indic tradition, combined with the native animism tradition of sacred serpents. In Sanskrit the term ''naga'' literally means snake, but in Java it normally refer to serpent deity, associated with water and fertility. In [[Borobudur]], the nagas are depicted in their human form, but elsewhere they are depicted in animal shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=naga+java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn16O16fraAhVJpo8KHajpCBQ4ChDoAQgqMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naga%20java&amp;f=false|title=Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas|last=Miksic|first=John|date=2012-11-13|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462909100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early depictions of circa-9th-century Central Java closely resembled Indic Naga which was based on [[cobra]] imagery. During this period, naga serpents were depicted as giant cobras supporting the waterspout of [[yoni]]-[[lingam]]. The examples of naga sculpture can be found in several Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candis]], including [[Prambanan]], [[Sambisari]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], and [[Jawi temple|Jawi]]. In East Java, the [[Penataran]] temple complex contain a ''Candi Naga'', an unusual naga temple with its Hindu-Javanese [[caryatids]] holding corpulent nagas aloft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=candi+naga+panataran&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjum27PraAhVLqo8KHY-7CVUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=candi%20naga%20panataran&amp;f=false|title=Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java|last=Kinney|first=Ann R.|last2=Klokke|first2=Marijke J.|last3=Kieven|first3=Lydia|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824827793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Crowned Naga flanked the stairs entrance of [[Pura Parahyangan Agung Jagatkarta|Pura Jagatkarta]]]]
The later depiction since the 15th century, however, was slightly influenced by Chinese dragon imagery—although unlike its Chinese counterparts, Javanese and Balinese nagas do not have legs. Naga as the lesser deity of earth and water is prevalent in the [[Majapahit|Hindu period]] of Indonesia, before the introduction of Islam.

In [[Bali]]nese tradition, nagas are often depicted battling [[Garuda]]. Intricately carved naga are found as stairs railings in bridges or stairs, such as those found in [[Balinese temple]]s, [[Ubud]] monkey forest, and [[Taman Sari (Yogyakarta)|Taman Sari]] in Yogyakarta.

In a [[wayang]] theater story, a snake (naga) god named Sanghyang Anantaboga or [[Antaboga]] is a guardian deity in the bowels of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Rodemeier: ''Lego-lego Platz und naga-Darstellung.

Diederichs, Düsseldorf 1981, {{ISBN|3-424-00693-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naga symbolize the nether realm of earth or underworld.

=== Laos ===
Naga are believed to live in the [[Laos|Laotian]] stretch of the [[Mekong]] or its estuaries. Lao mythology maintains that the naga are the protectors of [[Vientiane]], and by extension, the Lao state. The naga association was most clearly articulated during and immediately after the reign of [[Anouvong]]. An important poem from this period ''San Leupphasun'' ({{lang-lo|ສານລຶພສູນ}}) discusses relations between Laos and Thailand in a veiled manner, using the naga and the [[garuda]] to represent the Lao and the Thai, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ngaosīvat |first= Mayurī |author2=Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn |title= Paths to conflagration : fifty years of diplomacy and warfare in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, 1778-1828 |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100616420 |series= Studies on Southeast Asia |volume=24 |year= 1998 |publisher= Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University | location= Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn= 0-87727-723-0 |oclc= 38909607 |page= 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naga is incorporated extensively into Lao iconography, and features prominently in Lao culture throughout the length of the country, not only in Vientiane.

=== Malaysia ===
{{see|Lake Chini}}
In Malay and Orang Asli traditions, the lake Chini, located in [[Pahang]] is home to a naga called Sri Gumum. Depending on legend versions, her predecessor Sri Pahang or her son left the lake and later fought a naga called Sri Kemboja. Kemboja is the Malay name for Cambodia. Like the naga legends there, there are stories about an ancient empire in lake Chini, although the stories are not linked to the naga legends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nici.ru.nl/~peterh/srigumum/doc/stories.html Legends] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202720/http://www.nici.ru.nl/~peterh/srigumum/doc/stories.html |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeymalaysia.com/ML_chini.htm|title=Journey Malaysia » Tasik Chini|work=journeymalaysia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
A '''papal legate''' or '''Apostolic legate''' (from the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] title ''[[legatus]]'') is a personal representative of the [[pope]] to foreign nations, or to some part of the Catholic Church. He is empowered on matters of [[Catholicism|Catholic Faith]] and for the settlement of [[ecclesiastical]] matters.

The legate is appointed directly by the pope (the bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church and (historically) head of state of the papal states). Hence a legate is usually sent to a government, a sovereign or to a large body of believers (such as a national church) or to take charge of a major religious effort, such as an (ecumenical) council, a [[crusade]] to the Holy Land, or even against a heresy such as the [[Cathars]].

The term ''legation'' is applied both to a legate's mandate and to the territory concerned (such as a state, or an ecclesiastical province). The relevant adjective is ''legatine''.

== History ==
{{expand section|history in early Church to 1300, and material other than English and Wolsey|date=April 2016}}
[[image:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]], papal legate to England during the reign of [[Henry VIII]]]]
In the [[High Middle Ages]], papal legates were often used to strengthen the links between Rome and the many parts of [[Christendom]]. More often than not, legates were learned men and skilled diplomats who were not from the country they were accredited to. The Italian-born [[Guala Bicchieri]] served as papal legate to England in the early 13th century and played a major role in both the English government and church at the time. By the [[Late Middle Ages]] it had become more common to appoint native clerics to the position of legate within their own country, such as [[Cardinal Wolsey]] acting as legate to the court of [[Henry VIII of England]]. The reason for this switch in policy could be attributed to a change in attitude on the eve of [[The Reformation]]; by this point, foreign men representing the papacy would be more likely to reinforce dissent than bring [[Christendom]] closer together.&lt;ref name="Pagden"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Idea of Europe: From Antiquity to the European Union|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|origyear=2002|volume=13|isbn=9780521795524}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non sequitur|date=April 2016}}

Papal legates often summoned [[legatine council]]s, which dealt with church government and other ecclesiastical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, I. S. |title=The Papacy 1073–1198: Continuity and Innovation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-31922-6 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pope [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], writing in the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'', a papal legate "presides over all bishops in a council, even if he is inferior in rank, and he can pronounce sentence of deposition against them".&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], a legatine council was the usual means that a papal legate imposed his directives.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, I. S. |title=The Papacy 1073–1198: Continuity and Innovation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1990 |page=150|isbn=0521319226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diplomatic Ranks ==
There are several ranks of papal legates in diplomacy, some of which are no longer used.

===Apostolic nuncio===
[[image:Giovanni Francesco Commendone.PNG|thumb|right|Cardinal [[Giovanni Francesco Commendone]], sometime papal nuncio to [[Urbino]], [[Ferrara]], [[Venice]], [[Parma]], and [[England]].]]
{{main article|Nuncio}}
The most common form of papal legate today is the [[Nuncio|apostolic nuncio]], whose task it is to strengthen relations between the [[Holy See]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in a particular country and at the same time to act as the diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the government of that country.&lt;ref name="Collinge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collinge|first=William|title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|pages=251|edition=2|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|location=Maryland, USA|year=2012|isbn=9780810857551}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of [[ambassador]] extraordinary and [[plenipotentiary]], although in [[Catholic countries]] the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the [[Dean of the Diplomatic Corps|deanship of that country's diplomatic corps]] to the nuncio regardless of seniority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=United Nations Conference on Diplomatic Intercourse and Immunities | title=[[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], Article 16 |publisher=United Nations |year=1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pro-nuncio====
Pro-nuncio was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and ''[[ex officio]]'' deanship of the diplomatic corps. In those countries, the papal representative's precedence within the corps is exactly on a par with that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps.&lt;ref name="Beal"&gt;{{cite book|pages=462|title=New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law|editor-last=Beal|editor-first=John P.|editor2-last=Coriden|editor2-first=James A.|editor3-last=Green|editor3-first=Thomas J.|edition=Study|publisher=Paulist Press|location=NJ, USA|year=2000|isbn=9780809140664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostolic delegate====
For countries with which the Holy See has no diplomatic relations, an apostolic delegate is sent to serve as a liaison with the Catholic Church in that country, though not accredited to its government.&lt;ref name="Collinge"/&gt;

===''Legati''===

{{anchor|Legatus a latere|Legatus a Latere}}&lt;!--linked--&gt;
====''Legatus a latere''====
This highest rank (literally "from the (Pope's) side", i.e. "intimately" trusted) is normally awarded to a priest of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal rank]]. It is an exceptional investiture and can either be focused or broad in scope. The legate ''a latere'' is the alter ego of the Pope, and as such, possesses full plenipotentiary powers.&lt;ref name=Princes2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingstone"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church|pages=331|last=Livingstone|first=E. A.|location=Oxford, UK|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780199659623|edition=3rd|year=2013|origyear=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Legatus natus''====
Literally "born legate", i.e. not nominated individually but ''ex officio'', namely a bishop holding this rank as a privilege of his see, e.g. [[archbishop]]s of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]]), [[Archbishop of Prague|Prague]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom|Esztergom]], [[Archbishop of Udine|Udine]], [[Archbishop of Salzburg|Salzburg]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Gniezno]] and [[Archbishop of Cologne|Cologne]].&lt;ref name=Princes2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingstone"/&gt; The ''legatus natus'' would act as the pope's representative in his province, with a ''legatus a latere'' only being sent in extraordinary circumstances. Although limited in their jurisdiction compared to ''legati a latere'', a ''legatus natus'' were not subordinate to them.&lt;ref name="Tayler"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law Glossary|last=Tayler|first=Thomas|pages=300|publisher=Baker, Voorhis &amp; Co.|location=NY, USA|year=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Legatus missus''====
Literally "sent legate", possessing limited powers for the purpose of completing a specific mission. This commission is normally focused in scope and of short duration.&lt;ref name=Princes2&gt;{{cite book |author=Bellenger, Dominic Aidan |author2=Fletcher, Stella |title=Princes of the Church: A History of the English Cardinals |publisher=Sutton |location=Stroud, UK |year=2001 |isbn=0-7509-2630-9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingstone"/&gt;

== Gubernatorial legates ==
Some administrative (temporal) provinces of the [[Papal states]] in (mostly central) Italy were governed by a Papal Legate. This has been the case in [[Benevento]], in [[Pontecorvo]] (of Campagna e Marittima/ of Frosinone) and in [[Viterbo]].
In four cases, including [[Bologna]], this post was awarded exclusively to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s; the [[Velletri]] post was created for [[Bartolommeo Pacca]].

The title could be changed to [[Apostolic Delegate]], as happened in Frosinone (for Pontecorvo) in 1827.

'''Paul Harvey Aurandt''' (September 4, 1918 – February 28, 2009), better known as '''Paul Harvey''', was an American radio broadcaster for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Radio Networks.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;Michael Carlson, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/03/paul-harvey "Paul Harvey: Influential conservative American radio host"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He broadcast ''News and Comment'' on weekday mornings and mid-days and at noon on Saturdays, as well as his famous ''[[The Rest of the Story]]'' segments. From 1952 through 2008, his programs reached as many as 24 million people a week. ''Paul Harvey News'' was carried on 1,200 radio stations, 400 [[American Forces Network]] stations, and 300 newspapers.

==Career==

===Early years===
Harvey was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma,&lt;ref name="hoover2010"/&gt; the son of a policeman who was killed by robbers in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/1347-officer-harry-h-aurandt|title=Officer Harry H. Aurandt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made radio receivers as a young boy, and he attended [[Central High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Central High School]] where teacher Isabelle Ronan was "impressed by his voice".  On her recommendation, he started working at [[KFAQ|KVOO]] in Tulsa in 1933 helping to clean up when he was 14. He eventually was allowed to fill in on the air, reading commercials and the news.&lt;ref name="kogan"&gt;{{cite web | author=Rick Kogan | url=http://www.cltv.com/entertainment/chi-paul-harvey-good-days-rick-kogan,0,6824290.story?page=3 | title=Good days for Paul Harvey | publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=August 4, 2002 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radioink"&gt;{{cite web | author=Joe Howard | url=http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=1036324&amp;spid=24698 | title=Paul Harvey: A Legend Looks Back | publisher=[[Radio Ink]] | date=November 2, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082728/http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=1036324&amp;spid=24698 | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Marc Fisher | url= http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=325 | title=A Lifetime on the Radio | publisher=[[American Journalism Review]] | date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued working at KVOO while attending the [[University of Tulsa]], first as an announcer and later as a program director. He spent three years as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pittenger|first=Todd|title=Paul Harvey's employment at 19/KFBI|url=http://www.ksallink.com/?cmd=displaystory&amp;story_id=7859&amp;format=html|publisher=Metro Source News|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a station manager for KFBI AM, now known as KFDI, a radio station that once had studios in [[Salina, Kansas]]. From there, he moved to a newscasting job at [[KOKC (AM)|KOMA]] in [[Oklahoma City]], and then to [[KXOK (AM)|KXOK]] in St. Louis in 1938&lt;ref&gt;"KXOK in St. Louis to Debut September 19," Broadcasting, September 15, 1938, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was Director of Special Events and a roving reporter.

Harvey then moved to Hawaii to cover the United States Navy as it concentrated its fleet in the Pacific. He was returning to the mainland from assignment when the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. He eventually enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces but served only from December 1943 to March 1944. His critics{{specify|date=October 2010}} claimed that he was given a psychiatric discharge for deliberately injuring himself in the heel.  Harvey angrily denied the accusation, but was vague about details: "I cannot tell you the exact wording on my discharge."&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite web| author=Linda Witt | date=January 22, 1979 | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20072778,00.html | title=Forget Cronkite: Paul Harvey Is the Biggest Newscaster in America, and Getting Bigger | publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]] | work=Vol. 11 No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Move to Chicago===
Harvey then moved to Chicago, where in June 1944, he began broadcasting from the ABC affiliate [[WLS (AM)#WENR|WENR]]. In 1945, he began hosting the postwar employment program ''Jobs for G.I. Joe'' on WENR. Harvey added ''The Rest of the Story'' as a tagline to in-depth feature stories in 1946.

One of Harvey's regular topics was lax security, in particular at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], a nuclear research facility located {{convert|20|mi}} west of Chicago.&lt;ref name="hoover2010"&gt;{{cite news| title=New documents show longtime friendship between J.

Harvey['s plan was] to scratch his signature on 'objects that could not possibly have been brought to the site by someone else,' according to a statement later given by an off-duty guard who accompanied him.... But seconds after Harvey hit the ground, security officers spotted him.... Harvey ran until, caught in a Jeep's headlights, he tripped and fell. As guards approached, Harvey sprang to his feet and waved. Guards asked whether Harvey realized he was in a restricted area. Harvey replied no, that he thought he might be at the airport because of the red lights.... Harvey told the authorities he had been headed to a neighboring town to give a speech when his car died.... Under questioning, Harvey eventually dropped his cover story but refused to elaborate, saying he wanted to tell his tale before a congressional committee. Guards searched his Cadillac and found ... a four-page, typewritten script for an upcoming broadcast. Harvey, it turned out, had planned from the outset to feed the nation a bogus account of his escapade: "I hereby affirm the following is a true and accurate account," the script began. "My friend and I were driving a once-familiar road, when the car stalled.... We started to walk.... We made no effort to conceal our presence.... Suddenly I realized where I was. That I had entered, unchallenged, one of the United States' vital atomic research installations.... Quite by accident, understand, I had found myself inside the 'hot' area.... We could have carried a bomb in, or classified documents out.&lt;ref name="hoover2010"/&gt;}}

Harvey's "escapade" prompted the [[U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois|U.S. attorney for Illinois]] to empanel a [[grand jury]] to consider an [[espionage]] indictment; Harvey "went on the air to suggest he was being set up"; the grand jury subsequently declined to indict Harvey.&lt;ref name="hoover2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/media_criticism/paul-harveys-attempted-hoax-was-beginning-of-beautiful-friendship/|title=Paul Harvey's Attempted Hoax Was Beginning of Beautiful Friendship|date=January 23, 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 1951, before the grand jury's decision,&lt;ref name="hoover2010"/&gt; the ABC Radio Network debuted ''Paul Harvey News and Comment'' "Commentary and analysis of Paul Harvey each weekday at 12 Noon". Harvey was also heard originally on Sundays; the first Sunday program was Harvey's introduction. Later, the Sunday program would move to Saturdays. The program continued until his death.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Harvey recorded five-minute video editorials that local television stations could insert into their local news programs or show separately. Some of those editorials were recorded, such as his "Warning To The Nation," broadcast on ABC Radio on April 3, 1965&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Az0okaHig "If I Were the Devil"], Paul Harvey, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and "Freedom to Chains," from the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0FF13u13WE|title=PAUL HARVEY FREEDOM TO CHAINS 1965 (BEST VERSION)|first=|last=Bill J.

In the latter half of his career, Harvey was also known for the radio series ''The Rest of the Story'', described as a blend of mystery and history, which premiered on May 10, 1976. The series quickly grew to six broadcasts a week, and continued until Harvey's death in 2009. ''The Rest of the Story'' series was written and produced by the broadcaster's son, Paul Harvey, Jr., from its outset and for its thirty-three year duration. Harvey and his radio network stated that the stories in that series, although entertaining, were completely true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/30/lkl.00.html Interview with Paul Harvey], [[CNN]] ''[[Larry King Live]]'', January 30, 2003 (accessed May 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This was contested by some critics, including [[urban legend]] expert [[Jan Harold Brunvand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/extra/the-right-of-the-story/|title=The Right of the Story|publisher = [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|date=September–October 1997|author=Dan Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/take-action/action-alerts/paul-harveys-tribute-to-slavery-nukes-genocide/|title=Paul Harvey's Tribute to Slavery, Nukes, Genocide|date=July 1, 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/uncategorized/the-rest-of-paul-harveys-story/|title=The Rest of Paul Harvey's Story|date=March 1, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Harvey signed a 10-year, $100 million contract with ABC Radio Networks. A few months later, after damaging his [[vocal cords]], he went off the air, but returned in August 2001.

His success with sponsors stemmed from the seamlessness with which he segued from his monologue into reading commercial messages. He explained his relationship with them, saying "I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is."&lt;ref name="Obituary: Paul Harvey"&gt;Michael Carlson, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/03/paul-harvey "Obituary: Paul Harvey"], ''The Guardian'', March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

July 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mort Crim]], [[Art Van Horn]], [[Scott Shannon]], and [[Tony Snow]]. Three weeks after Harvey's death, the entire ''News and Comment'' franchise was canceled.

Harvey did not host the show full-time after April 2008, when he came down with pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, his wife died on May 3, causing him to prolong his time away from broadcasting. He voiced commercials, new episodes of ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''News &amp; Comment'' during middays a few times a week, with his son handling mornings.

===On-air persona===
Harvey's on-air persona was influenced by that of sportscaster [[Bill Stern]]. During the 1940s, Stern's ''[[The Colgate Sports Newsreel|The Colgate Sports Reel]]'' and newsreel programs used many of the techniques later used by Harvey, including his emphatic style of delivery, and the use of phrases such as ''Reel Two'' and ''Reel Three'' to denote segments of the broadcast—much like Harvey's ''Page Two'' and ''Page Three''.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Dunning, ''The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'' ([[Oxford University Press]] US, 1998), {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}, p. 163. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=%22bill+stern%22+%22paul+harvey%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H4zG6NB3sr&amp;sig=E21cN97CUvRMygLz-CH42nxzcSk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gIjjS9ziBIawsgP4pJW6DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bill%20stern%22%20%22paul%20harvey%22&amp;f=false Excerpt available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey was also known for catch phrases he used at the beginning of his programs, such as "Hello Americans, this is Paul Harvey. Stand by for NEWS!" He always ended, "Paul Harvey&amp;nbsp;... Good ''day''." or "Paul Harvey&amp;nbsp;... Good ''night''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNPoui2RYEk&amp;t=2378s|title=KODA 99 FM Radio Houston (1964)|first=|last=Houston Radio REWIND|date=December 16, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story might be "This day's news of most lasting significance." At the end of a report about someone who had done something ridiculous or offensive, Harvey would say, "He would want us to mention his name," followed by silence, then would start the next item. The last item of a broadcast, which was often a funny story, would usually be preceded by "And now from the 'what-it's-worth' department . . ."

Other phrases made famous by Harvey included "Here's a strange..." (a story with an unusual twist) and "Self-government won't work without self-discipline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k-state.edu/media/newsreleases/landonlect/harveytext903.html|title=Paul Harvey Landon Lecture|website=www.k-state.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the inquiry into whether Harvey's ''Rest of the Story'' tales are true, Harvey's trademark ability to seamlessly migrate from content to commercial brought scrutiny. In that context, ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' magazine called him the "finest huckster ever to roam the airwaves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/people/bc/2001/09/25/harvey/print.html Salon.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201073241/http://dir.salon.com/story/people/bc/2001/09/25/harvey/print.html |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that Harvey's fawning and lavish product endorsements may be misleading or confusing to his audience. Harvey's endorsed products included EdenPure heaters, [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] radios, [[Select Comfort]] mattresses, and [[Hi-Health]] dietary supplements, including a supplement that was claimed to improve vision but was later the subject of a [[Federal Trade Commission]] enforcement action against the manufacturer (but not Harvey himself) for misleading claims made on Harvey's show.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Harris, [http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/0824hihealth24.html "FTC fines Hi-Health $450,000 over Paul Harvey ads"], ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', August 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the tribute broadcasts, Gil Gross said Harvey considered advertising just another type of news, and he only endorsed products he believed in, often interviewing someone from the company.

===Aviation===
Harvey was an avid pilot. He served in the [[US Army Air Corps]] from 1943-1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/477/000022411/|title=NNDB Paul Harvey|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey had been an [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] (AOPA) member for more than 50 years, and would occasionally talk about flying to his radio audience. He was a member of the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] (EAA), and was frequently seen at [[EAA AirVenture]] in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He was responsible for funding the Paul Harvey Audio-Video Center at EAA headquarters in Oshkosh. Harvey was also an early investor in the Duluth, Minnesota-based aircraft manufacturing company, [[Cirrus Aircraft]]. According to ''AOPA Pilot'' contributing editor Barry Schiff, Harvey coined the term ''[[Aircraft hijacking|skyjack]]'', and is credited with popularizing the terms ''[[Reaganomics]]'' and ''[[guesstimate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/paul-harvey-radio-broadcaster-who-became-the-voice-of-middle-america-1637578.html|title=Paul Harvey: Radio Broadcaster Who Became the Voice of America (obituary)|publisher = [[The Independent]]|date=March 5, 2009|author=Rupert Cornwell | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avweb.com/news/osh2002/183929-1.html|title=Oshkosh 1999 Newswire: Day Six - Cirrus Gets Stockholders To Show Them The Money|publisher = ''AVweb''|date=August 2, 1999|author=The Editors of ''AVweb'' | location = Oshkosh, Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal tastes===

Beginning in 1952, Harvey was a friend of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]].  Harvey would often submit "advance copies of his radio script for comment and approval."&lt;ref name="hoover2010"/&gt; It is believed that Harvey's friendship with Hoover helped Harvey escape criminal charges relating to his trespassing at [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. Nevertheless, Paul Harvey was happy to defend his friend, and spoke of him on his show of April 25, 1963, saying: "God help the United States without John Edgar Hoover. ... (FBI) Director Hoover is not retiring. If you have heard otherwise, somebody's sinister wish was the father of that thought. It is not so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/JFK-Assassination-Chronology-David-Wood-ebook/dp/B005QOUV36/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493234583&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr1&amp;keywords=ira+david+wood+3rd|title=JFK Assassination Chronology|first=Ira David Wood|last=III|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Wilds|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey was also a close friend of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and supporter of his search for Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1883362,00.html | work=Time | title=Paul Harvey | date=March 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | first=Richard | last=Corliss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey was also a close friend of [[George Vandeman]] and the Reverend [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; From the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s, Harvey attended [[Calvary Memorial Church]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  When the church moved from its original location on Madison Street to the former Presbyterian Church on Lake Street, Harvey asked his friend Graham to preach at the dedication service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Harvey associated with various congregations of different denominations.&lt;ref name="Batura"&gt;{{cite book | last = Batura | first = Paul | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Good Day!

White]] in his broadcasts and received the "Golden Microphone" Award for his professionalism and graciousness in dealing with the church.&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/people/ph/Paul_Harvey.html The Religious Affiliation of Radio Broadcaster Paul Harvey] at [[Adherents.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.biggytv.com/media/265/Paul_Harvey_Tribute/ SDALink Paul Harvey Tribute] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721145254/http://link.biggytv.com/media/265/Paul_Harvey_Tribute/ |date=July 21, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also active with a small [[Plymouth Brethren]] meeting in [[Maywood, Illinois|Maywood]], Illinois called Woodside Bible Chapel.

==Rhetorical style==
[[Robert D. McFadden]], writing Harvey's obituary for the ''New York Times,'' examined his unique radio style and how it interacted with his political views:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] personalized the radio news with his right-wing opinions, but laced them with his own trademarks: a hypnotic timbre, extended pauses for effect, heart-warming tales of average Americans and folksy observations that evoked the heartland, family values and the old-fashioned plain talk one heard around the dinner table on Sunday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Hello, Americans,' he barked. 'This is Paul Harvey! Stand byyy for Newwws!'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He railed against welfare cheats and defended the death penalty. He worried about the national debt, big government, bureaucrats who lacked common sense, permissive parents, leftist radicals and America succumbing to moral decay. He championed rugged individualism, love of God and country, and the fundamental decency of ordinary people.&lt;ref name="New York Times March 2, 2009"&gt;Robert D. Mcfadden, "Paul Harvey, Homespun Radio Voice of Middle America, Is Dead at 90,"  [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/business/media/02harvey.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ''New York Times'' March 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;Also Cited in  Garance Franke-Ruta, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/paul-harveys-1978-so-god-made-a-farmer-speech/272816/ "Paul Harvey's 1978 'So God Made a Farmer' Speech," ''The Atlantic'' Feb 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Awards==
Harvey was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] and [[Oklahoma Hall of Fame]], and appeared on the [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|Gallup poll list of America's most admired men]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In addition he received 11 Freedom Foundation Awards as well as the [[Horatio Alger Award]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Harvey was named to the [[DeMolay International|DeMolay Hall of Fame]], a [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] youth organization, on June 25, 1993.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2005, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' most prestigious civilian award, by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|title=Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's  remarks summarized Harvey's career: "He first went on the air in 1933, and he's been heard nationwide for 54 years. Americans like the sound of his voice...over the decades we have come to recognize in that voice some of the finest qualities of our country: patriotism, the good humor, the kindness, and common sense of Americans."&lt;ref name="Batura" /&gt;{{rp|201}}

On May 18, 2007, he received an honorary degree from [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1992 he received the [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]] Award of the [[Radio Television Digital News Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/paul_white_award#.U4FBHS8-Ngc |title=Paul White Award |publisher=Radio Television Digital News Association |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Harvey was inducted as a Laureate of [[The Lincoln Academy of Illinois]] and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1987 in the area of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/4632-2/#toggle-id-29|title=Laureate Convocations by Year - The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Harvey was born and raised in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Harry Harrison Aurandt (1873–1921) and Anna Dagmar (née Christensen) Aurandt (1883–1960). His father was born in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania; his mother was a native of Denmark.  He had one sibling, an older sister Frances Harrietta (née Aurandt) Price (1908–1988).

In 1921, when Harvey was three years old, his father was murdered. His father and a friend (a Tulsa police detective) were rabbit hunting while off-duty around 9pm when approached by four armed men who attempted to rob them. Mr. Aurandt was shot and died two days later of his wounds. The four robbers were identified by the surviving detective, and arrested the day after Aurandt died. A lynch mob of 1,500 people formed at the jail, but all four were smuggled out, tried, convicted, and received life terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFr5QBK4rEcC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=aurandt+tulsa+police |title=Oklahoma Heroes: The Oklahoma Peace Officers Memorial |first=Ron |last=Owens |pages=41–42 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company |year=2000 |isbn=1-56311-571-9 |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Harvey married [[Lynne Cooper Harvey|Lynne Cooper]] of St. Louis. She was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]] at Washington University in St. Louis&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=4780941&amp;page=1|title=Paul Harvey's Wife Dies at Age 92|date=May 3, 2008|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a former schoolteacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/14/books-good-day-paul-harvey-story/|title=Good Day!

Harvey invited her to dinner, proposed to her after a few minutes of conversation and from then on called her "Angel," even on his radio show. A year later she said yes. The couple moved to Chicago in 1944.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

On May 17, 2007, Harvey told his radio audience that Angel had developed [[leukemia]]. Her death, at the age of 92, was announced by [[Citadel Media|ABC radio]] on May 3, 2008.&lt;ref name="Ink"/&gt;  When she died at their [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]] home, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' described her as, "More than his astute business partner and producer, she also was a pioneer for women in radio and an influential figure in her own right for decades."  According to the founder of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]], Bruce DuMont, "She was to Paul Harvey what [[Colonel Parker]] was to [[Elvis Presley]]. She really put him on track to have the phenomenal career that his career has been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=184996&amp;src=109|title=Wife of broadcaster Paul Harvey dies|date=May 4, 2008|publisher=Daily Herald|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynne Harvey was the first producer ever inducted into the [[Radio Hall of Fame]], and had developed some of her husband's best-known features, such as "The Rest of the Story."&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;  While working on her husband's radio show, she established 10 p.m. as the hour in which news is broadcast.

While working at [[CBS]], she was among the first women to produce an entire newscast.

Harvey's full-length biography, ''Good Day! The Paul Harvey Story,'' was published in May 2009 by Regnery Publishing.&lt;ref name="Batura" /&gt;

On February 3, 2013, a recording of Harvey's "[[So God Made a Farmer]]" commentary was used by [[Dodge Ram|Ram Trucks]] in a [[Super Bowl advertising|commercial]] titled "Farmer," which aired during [[Super Bowl XLVII]].

==Reports about Prisoner X2==

First details about a "second Prisoner X" being secretly held in [[Ayalon Prison]] emerged in 2013, following the exposure of the [[death of Ben Zygier]]. Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]], who chaired the [[Knesset]] Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs, told Knesset members the case was "extremely serious" but that the prisoner's rights were being upheld.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23187419|title=Israel 'secretly holds second Prisoner X' in jail|date=12 July 2013 |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Israeli [[lawyer]] [[Avigdor Feldman]] described this case as "a terrible security breach", and "much more grave, sensational, amazing and riveting from Zygier's case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Rodrigo Sutiq Callapiña''' was a native Inca who successfully claimed his [[nobility]] in colonial [[Spanish America]] in 1569.

== Overview ==

In the late 16th century, the Spanish developed a [[political system]] that depended heavily on the [[social status]] and [[Reputation|prestige]] of the individual. Natives who were not nobility were expected to pay [[tax]]es, perform public labor, and personal service for the Spanish. Because of this pressure [[Inca]]n natives began to manipulate both the legal system and their traditional [[mythology]] to prove their noble lineage. In 1569, Rodrigo Sutiq Callapiña successfully claimed his nobility by linking his bloodline to [[Manco Cápac|Manqo Qhapaq]] and Qoya Qori Kuka. Manqo Qhapaq was the mythic ancient Inka ancestor, known as the first Inka, and Qoya Qori Kuka was a great female warrior who defended [[Cuzco]] and was later imbued into a stone as a spiritual protector.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 47.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Callapiña Document ==

The main document used to assess Rodrigo Sutiq Callapiña is called the Callapiña Document, which he gave to the Spanish to prove his noble lineage. The document mostly details [[testimony]] that was given in Cuzco in 1569. The original Callapiña document was later used by Rodrigo’s two grandsons, who also [[petition]]ed for noble status and had a copy of their grandfather's investigation as the main evidence for their petition. Callapiña had a total of eight [[witness]]es testify to affirm his lineage. The witnesses ranged from 85 to 132 years old, and were already recognized as descendants of the Inka nobility in Cuzco.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Callapiña Document is a document that reveals the connections between elite families in Cuzco and the sixteenth-century “reconstructions” of the mytho-historical tradition of the origin of Manqo Qhapaq. Rodrigo combined, in his ancestral claim (from his paternal ancestors), descent from both Tampu T’oqo and Sutiq T’oqo. Tampu T’oqo connected him to the Inka nobility in Cuzco, and Sutiq T’oqo linked him with an [[ayllu]] of the [[Maska people|Maska]]s, a division of the [[Tambos (thnic group)|Tambos]] ethnic group from the Pacarigtambo area.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;   When trying to deconstruct the methodology used to claim nobility, it seems that the Inka [[origin myth]] was being manipulated among high-class individuals in Cuzco wishing to exploit the benefits that came with being represented by the Spanish colonial administrative system.

== Andean Peoples and the Spanish Administration ==
Rodrigo is an example of the way [[Andes|Andean]] people tactfully manipulated their traditional histories to take action through colonial procedures. By doing this, they were able to slightly shape the administrative system that was being forced upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Urton, The History of a Myth: Pacariqtambo and the Origin of the Inkas. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;   This example runs counter to the myth that Andean natives being colonized were simply overtaken by the system. Rodrigo Callapiña instead demonstrates that Andean natives sought to weave themselves into the fabric of the newly imposed administration by finding and exploiting [[loophole]]s, and also creatively manipulating their own histories to better their own social standing.

'''Steven Jay Russell''' (born September 14, 1957) is an [[Americans|American]] [[con artist]] known for [[List of people who escaped multiple times from prison|escaping from prison multiple times]]. ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', a film about his life and crimes, was produced in 2009. In 2011, his crimes were featured on the TV show ''I Almost Got Away with It'' in the episode "Got a Boyfriend to Support". He was also the subject of the 2005 ''On The Run'' episode "King of Cons" on [[The Discovery Channel]].

==Biography==
On March 20, 1998, Russell posed as a millionaire from [[Virginia]] in an attempt to legitimize a $75,000 loan from [[NationsBank]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]; when bank officials became suspicious and alerted the police, Russell feigned a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and was transported to a hospital.  Russell was placed on security watch but he impersonated an FBI agent and called the hospital on his cell phone to tell them he could be released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=rwEhk56xNqMC&amp;dat=19980410&amp;printsec=frontpage The Lakekand Ledger], April 10, 1998, via google news, with a photo of S. Russell, page B5 (10 in the google reader).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Marshals]] later tracked down Russell in Florida, where they arrested him on April 5, 1998, when he went to retrieve a [[fax]]. Russell was sentenced to a total of 144 years in prison (99 years for the escapes and 45 years for subsequent scams).

As of 2010, Russell is in the [[Allan B.

{{Shia Islam|Beliefs and practices}}
'''The Four Companions''', also called '''the Four Pillars of the Sahaba''' is a [[Shi'a|Shiʿah]] term for the four [[Sahaba]] who stayed most loyal to [[Imam Ali]] after the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]:
* [[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari|Abū Dharr al-Ghifāri]]
* [[Ammar ibn Yasir|Ammār ibn Yāsir]]
* [[Miqdad ibn Aswad|al-Miqdad ibn Aswād al-Kindi]]
* [[Salman the Persian|Salman al-Fārsī]]

Those among [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] who were closest to both [[Muhammad]] and [[Imam Ali]] were called [[Shia etymology|Shiʿah of Ali]] "partisans of Ali" during Muhammad's lifetime, and it was for these primarily that the following hadith was said:{{quote|Glad tidings, [[Ali]]! Verily you and your Shiʿah will be in Paradise.}} These companions are later referred to as "The Real Shiʿah". [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Abdullah ibn Abbas]], [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]] were other such partisans. However, it is only The Four Companions that are believed to have attained the rank of "The Real Shiʿah" and remained so.

'''Theo de Raadt''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|oʊ|_|d|ɛ|ˈ|r|ɔː|t}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈteː.joː dəˈraːt|lang}}; born May 19, 1968) is a [[software engineer]] who lives in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada. He is the founder and leader of the [[OpenBSD]] and [[OpenSSH]] projects, and was also a founding member of [[NetBSD]]. In 2004, De Raadt won the [[FSF Free Software Awards|Free Software Award]] for his work on OpenBSD and OpenSSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theo de Raadt presented with the 2004 Free Software Award|url=https://www.fsf.org/news/fsaward2004.html|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Theo de Raadt is the eldest of four children to a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father and a [[South Africa]]n mother, with two sisters and a brother. Concern over the mandatory two-year armed forces [[conscription]] in South Africa led the family to emigrate to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in November 1977. In 1983, the [[Early 1980s recession#Canada|largest recession in Canada]] since the [[Great Depression]] sent the family to the [[Yukon]]. Prior to the move, De Raadt got his first computer, a [[Commodore VIC-20]], which was soon followed by an [[Amiga]]. It is with these computers that he first began to develop software.&lt;ref&gt;The Age article:  [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089476287.html "Staying on the cutting edge"]. October 8, 2004.  Accessed April 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he obtained a [[BSc]] in [[Computer Science]] from the [[University of Calgary]].

== NetBSD ==
{{Main|NetBSD}}

In 1993, Theo de Raadt founded NetBSD with Chris Demetriou, Adam Glass, and Charles Hannum, who felt frustrated at the poor quality of [[386BSD]] and believed an open development model would be better.   386BSD was derived from the original University of California Berkeley's 4.3BSD release, while the new NetBSD project would merge relevant code from the Networking/2 and 386BSD releases.

The new project focused on clean, portable, correct code, with the goal of producing a unified, multi-platform, production-quality BSD operating system. Because of the importance of networks such as the Internet in the distributed, collaborative nature of its development, De Raadt suggested the name "NetBSD", which the three other founders agreed upon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The first NetBSD source code repository was established on March 21, 1993 and the initial release, NetBSD 0.8, was made in April 1993.  This was derived from 386BSD 0.1 plus the version 0.2.2 unofficial patchkit, with several programs from the Net/2 release missing from 386BSD re-integrated, and various other improvements.  In August 1993, NetBSD 0.9 was released, which contained many enhancements and bug fixes. This was still a [[PC compatible|PC]]-platform-only release, although by this time work was underway to add support for other architectures.

NetBSD 1.0 was released in October, 1994.  This was the first multi-platform release, supporting the [[IBM PC compatible]], [[HP 9000]] Series 300, [[Amiga]], [[68k]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], [[Sun-4]]c series and [[PC532]].  Also in this release, the legally encumbered Net/2-derived source code was replaced with equivalent code from 4.4BSD-lite, in accordance with the  [[USL v BSDi]] lawsuit settlement.  De Raadt played a vital role in the creation of the [[SPARC]] port, implementing much of the initial code together with  Chuck Cranor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chuck.cranor.org/|title=Chuck Cranor's Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1994, De Raadt was asked to resign from the NetBSD core team and his access to the source code repository was revoked. The reason for this is not entirely clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its [[Electronic mailing list|mailing lists]].&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;Glass, Adam.

In his book ''Free for All'', Peter Wayner claims that De Raadt "began to rub some people the wrong way" before the split from NetBSD,&lt;ref&gt;Wayner, Peter.

In October 1995, De Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project [[fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD 1.0.

== Outspokenness ==

[[Image:Jon "maddog" Hall gives Theo de Raadt a set of red plastic horns.jpg|thumb|[[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon "maddog" Hall]] presents De Raadt with [[BSD Daemon|daemon]] horns at [[Fórum Internacional Software Livre|FISL8]]]]
De Raadt has been a vocal advocate of free software since the inception of OpenBSD, but he is also a strong proponent of free speech, having on occasion had rather public disputes with various groups, from Linux advocates to governments.  This outspoken attitude, while sometimes the cause of conflict, has also led him to acclaim; De Raadt has given presentations at open source, free software and security conferences around the world—including [[FOSDEM]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], [[Usenix]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[AUUG]] Conference in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] and [[FISL]] in [[Porto Alegre]], RS, [[Brazil]].

=== DARPA funding cancellation ===

After De Raadt stated his disapproval of the U.S.-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in an April, 2003 [[interview]]&lt;ref&gt;Globe and Mail article: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article996772.ece "U.S. military helps fund Calgary hacker"].  April 6, 2003.  Accessed October 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Toronto]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', a multi-million-dollar [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] grant to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[POSSE project]] was cancelled, effectively ending the project.  Funding from the grant had been used in the development of OpenSSH and OpenBSD, as well as many other projects and was to be used to pay for the ''[[hackathon]]'' planned for May 8, 2003.  Despite money from the grant already having been used to secure accommodations for sixty developers for a week, the money was reclaimed by the government at a loss and the hotel was told not to allow the developers to pay the reclaimed money to resecure the rooms.&lt;ref&gt;LWN.net article:  [https://lwn.net/Articles/29186/ "DARPA Cancels OpenBSD Funding"].  April 24, 2003.  Accessed April 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in criticism among some that the US military held an anti-[[free speech]] attitude. The grant termination was, however, not as bad a blow as some portrayed it.  The project's supporters rallied to help and the hackathon went on almost as planned.  The funding was cut mere months before the end of the grant, further fueling the speculations regarding the situation surrounding the grant's termination.

=== Free driver advocacy ===

De Raadt is also well known for his advocacy of [[free software]] [[device driver|drivers]].  He has long been critical of developers of [[Linux]] and other free platforms for their tolerance of non-free drivers and acceptance of [[non-disclosure agreement]]s.

In particular, De Raadt has worked to convince [[IEEE 802.11|wireless]] hardware vendors to allow the [[firmware]] images of their products to be freely redistributed. These efforts have been largely successful, particularly in negotiations with [[Taiwan]]ese companies, leading to many new wireless drivers. De Raadt has commented that "most Taiwanese vendors give us documentation almost immediately," allowing open source drivers to reliably support devices, as opposed to the lack of willingness from US companies like [[Intel]] and [[Broadcom]] to release firmware images free from [[software license|licensing]] restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/6550 |date=May 2, 2006 |first=Jeremy |last=Andrews |title=Interview: Theo de Raadt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424125958/http://kerneltrap.org/node/6550 |archivedate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clash with Linux developers ===

In April 2007, De Raadt was involved in a controversy involving the use of [[GPL]] code from the Linux ''bcm43xx'' driver in the BSD ''bcw'' driver.&lt;ref&gt;LXer article: [http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/85224/ Broadcom Driver Dispute Uglier Than Necessary].  April 7, 2007.  Accessed April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thread on gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.wireless.general/1558/focus=1558 OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues] Various dates beginning April 4, 2007.  Accessed April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Linux developers accused the BSD community of infringing GPL code, but De Raadt denied infringement, arguing that the BSD driver was not "released."  He also maintained that the conflict was not about GPL, but the way Linux developer [[Michael Buesch]] handled the situation.  To Buesch's email, he responded:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-wireless&amp;m=117572345902445&amp;w=2|via=[[MARC (archive)|marc.info]]|title=OpenBSD bcw: Possible GPL license violation issues|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=28 May 2017|author=Theo de Raadt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be resolved in our tree, but it is up to him which way he does
it.  But when you approach issues like this with comments like "We'd
like you to start contacting us to resolve the issue now" and your
first mail is cc'd to a couple hundred people.... in the future,
please think more carefully, ok?

Because right now, in that mail, you've pretty much done Broadcom's
job for them.  You've told the entire BSD community who may want to
use a driver for this chip later, that because of a few GPL issues you
are willing to use very strong words—published very widely—to
disrupt the efforts of one guy who is trying to do things for them.
And, you are going to do this using the GPL, even.  You did not
privately mail that developer.  No, you basically went public with it.

That is how about half the user and developer community will see it.
They will see your widely posted mail as an overly strong position.}}

Another clash occurred in August 2007, when a group of Linux developers attempted to modify the license of dual-licensed ath5k driver.  De Raadt summarized the issue as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/1/102 |first=Theo |last=de Raadt |date=August 31, 2007 |title=That whole "Linux stealing our code" thing |publisher=LKML.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code, modify it, and not give back.
Nope—the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code, and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out.
Just like the Linux community, we have many companies giving us code back, all the time.
But once the code is GPL'd, we cannot get it back.}}

[[Image:Thomas William Robertson.jpg|right|frame|Engraving of Tom Robertson]]
'''Thomas William Robertson''' (9 January 1829 – 3 February 1871), usually known professionally as T. W. Robertson, was an English [[dramatist]] and innovative stage director best known for a series of [[realism (arts)|realistic]] or [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] plays produced in London in the 1860s that broke new ground and inspired playwrights such as [[W.S. Gilbert]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark-upon-Trent]], [[Nottinghamshire]], England, Robertson was the oldest son of William Robertson, a provincial actor and manager.  His family was famous for producing actors.  The actress [[Madge Kendal|Margaret (Madge) Robertson]] was his youngest sister.  As a child, Robertson acted in juvenile parts in ''Rob Roy'', ''Pizarro'', ''The Stranger'', "French" parts and eccentric comedy on the Lincoln Circuit and at the Marylebone in London.  He also visited Paris as the stage manager and interpreter for an English company.&lt;ref name=Utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289-301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Never a successful actor himself, he wrote numerous plays, mostly comedies, many of which achieved popularity.  Robertson died at the age of 42 and is buried, as is his wife Elizabeth, at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in [[Stoke Newington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savin|first=Maynard|title=Thomas William Robertson: his plays and stagecraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=jwFeTPO2N5SQOKLjtL0J&amp;ct=result&amp;id=XU0GAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=buried|year=1950|publisher=Brown University|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
As a dramatist, Robertson began with adaptations of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] novels and wrote [[music hall]] songs for comedians.&lt;ref name=Utility/&gt;  He produced a farcical comedy, ''A Night's Adventure'' at London's [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1851, but this did not catch on, and he remained for several more years in the provinces, acting and continuing with play writing and writing for newspapers.  In 1860, he moved to London and worked as an editor, also writing a novel, later dramatised under the title ''Shadow Tree Shaft''.  He also wrote a farce entitled ''A Cantab'', which was played at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] in 1861.  This brought him a reputation among a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] clique of writers, the ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine gang (including [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]], and [[F. C. Burnand]]), but so little profit that he thought of abandoning the profession to become a tobacconist.  Finally, in 1864, he had his first notable playwriting success, ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] with [[Edward Sothern]] in the title role.  Robertson also wrote the libretto to the 1865 [[comic opera]] ''Constance'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]].

Robertson found fame in 1865 with the production of his comedy ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', under the management of [[Squire Bancroft]] and his wife [[Effie Bancroft|Marie (née Wilton)]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The play includes a scene that fictionalized the ''Fun'' gang, who frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Information about the bohemian round tables]&lt;/ref&gt;  This play became regarded as a milestone in Victorian drama because of its realism in sets, costume, acting and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Edgar Pemberton|Pemberton, T. Edgar]]. [https://archive.org/stream/societyandcastee00robeuoft/societyandcastee00robeuoft_djvu.txt ''The English Drama from its Beginning to the Present Day'' – ''Society'' and ''Caste''], D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Publishers Boston USA and London (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Robertson's popular plays, except for ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', were produced by the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.  Other Robertson successes included the domestic dramas ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869), and ''M.P.'' (1870).  He also wrote ''Dreams'' for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], which opened that new theatre in 1868 together with Gilbert's ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]''.  His last play, ''War'', was produced at the [[St. James's Theatre]] in 1871, the year in which he died.  Robertson's plays are still occasionally seen.  For example, ''Ours'' was given a professional production in July 2007 at the [[Finborough Theatre]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/2007/ours.htm Information about the 2007 production of ''Ours'' at the Finborough Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations in realism and directing===
Robertson's plays became known as 'problem plays', because they dealt seriously and sensitively with issues of the day.  In the 1850s and 1860s, Robertson's plays, both in style and substance, were considered revolutionary.  ''Caste'' was about marriage across the class barrier and explored prejudices towards social climbing.&lt;ref name=Cup&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/0-9/19th-century-theatre/ "Cup and Saucer drama,"] 19th Century Theatre, Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://members.tripod.com/FootlightNotes/index.html Information about ''Caste'', especially the 1910 revival.]  Footlight Notes, No. 315, 27 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These plays were notable for their "cup and saucer" realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were realistic, unlike the oversize acting in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s that were popular at the time.&lt;ref name=bruegge&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Vorder Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=2011-05-03 }}, accessed March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, whereas previously a designer would put as many chairs into a dining room scene as there were actors who needed to sit down, Robertson would place on stage as many chairs as would realistically be found in that dining room, even if some were never actually used.  Or, if someone came in from a blizzard, snow would blow in from the doorway.  In ''Ours'', a pudding was made on stage, and this caused a major furore – people were not used to seeing such realistic tasks in a stage setting.  Also, the characters spoke in normal language and dealt with ordinary situations rather than declaiming their lines.&lt;ref name=Cup/&gt;

In addition, the importance of everyday incidents, the revealing of character through apparent "small talk", and the idea that what is not said in the dialogue is as important as what is said are all Robertson trademarks.  Some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson's plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, but many admired the new style of play and new style of acting.  [[George Bernard Shaw]] called Robertson's play ''Caste'' "epoch making" and referred to Robertson's innovations as a "theatrical revolution".  It is now disputed whether Robertson really originated some of his innovations, but ''Society'' and its successors were viewed at the time as something new and, in a quiet way, revolutionary.

The Bancrofts, impressed with Robertson's dedication and skill, gave Robertson unusual artistic freedom to control his scripts and direct (or as it was then called, "stage manage") his plays.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  Before Robertson and [[James Robinson Planché]], star actors generally had control of scripts, and theatre managers had control of casting in the theatre.  Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions - a novel concept at that time.  Robertson directed his own plays and aimed to get rid of the unreal stylisation and bombast of the old [[melodrama]]s.  He did not act in his plays but instead took on the role of a professional director to control the action on stage.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  W. S. Gilbert attended Robertson's rehearsals to learn from the older playwright's use of "stagecraft" and personally directed his own plays and operas based on what he had learned. Gilbert later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why, he invented stage management. It was an unknown art before his time. Formerly, in a conversation scene for instance, you simply brought down two or three chairs, and people sat down and talked, and when the conversation was ended the chairs were replaced. Robertson showed how to give life and variety and nature to the scene, by breaking it up with all sorts of little incidents and delicate by-play. I have been at many of his rehearsals and learnt a great deal from them.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. ''Real Conversations'', 1904, ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These pioneers opened the way for later proponents of realism in drama, such as Shaw, and for modern methods of play production.  Robertson was also a leader in requiring a fee from his managers for every performance of his plays, thus pioneering the modern royalty system.

'''Twipsy''' was the official [[Mascot]] of the [[EXPO 2000]] World's Fair held in [[Hannover]]. The character was created by the [[Spain|Spanish]] designer [[Javier Mariscal]]. His draft was selected in 1995 by an international jury out of 17 proposals in total.  During the course of the Expo, Twipsy could be acquired on the EXPO area on forms of merchandise, ranging from a [[plush toy|stuffed plush toy]], to apparel such as on [[T-shirt]]s, [[mug]]s, [[watch]]es and other souvenirs, in addition to those with the EXPO logo. Apart from that, [[postage stamp|stamp]]s showing Twipsy were released, and full-sized versions of Twipsy were running around on the EXPO area and advertising for the EXPO in other countries.

== Appearance ==
Twipsy has a drop-shaped, colourfully striped body and a demilune yellow head with a large turquoise-colored nose. The area around the eyes, the extension at the back of the head and the chin are black. He's wearing a pointed, high-heeled shoe as well as a rounded flat one. He also has a "normal" thin and an oversized orange arm (which resembles a wing). The colour scheme may vary depending on the version.

===Selection===
During a design contest in 1995 to elect the ideal official mascot for the Expo 2000 in Hannover, Twipsy was chosen out of 17 proposals in total by an international jury, despite receiving only 1% of the public vote.&lt;ref&gt;Kleine Helden, 1996. Little Heroes: EXPO 2000, Hannover. First Edition. Verlag Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mariscal, Twipsy is said to be a burst of energy who came "...from a distant past such as is the Big Bang, a spark in expansion that became a star, a cell, an invertebrate, a reptile, a bird, a mammal..." and into his present form.&lt;ref&gt;Estudio Mariscal, 2015. Twipsy (mascot) [ONLINE] Available at: http://www.mariscal.com/en/projects/100/twipsy [Accessed on 25th April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Mariscal cites that it was his intention to "...embody the triangular aspects of the key theme "Humankind - Nature - Technology" in one figure... therefore [Twipsy] resembles a new type of being, a new human-animal-technological species." Additionally, Twipsy "...harmonise[d] with the corporate design of [the EXPO],", and was also "...adaptable in terms of shape and colour, and [therefore] a suitable playful and informative partner for the EXPO logo."&lt;ref&gt;EXPO 2000, 1997.

== TV series ==
On November 1, 1999, the animated series ''Twipsy'' aired on the German TV channel [[KI.KA]] with 52 short episodes, 13 minutes each (they were often paired to make 26 episodes, having a total length of 25 minutes per pair.) Seven months prior to the start of the EXPO 2000, the series premiere was used to get children accustomed to the upcoming World Exposition, however it focused only on character backstory, and had no connection to the Expo.

In the first episode, 13-year-old Nick was pulled by accident into the [[Cyberspace]]. He then meets the colourful and feisty E-Mail delivery man Twipsy, who introduces Nick to the virtual realm; of course Nick gets homesick and together, Twipsy sends him back to the real world, while inadvertently ending up there too.

A modified scanner is since being used as a [[Teleportation|Transporter]] into the universe of the internet. Through way, many other children, for example Nick's 8-year-old sister Lissie or his friend Albert experience many adventures and get to know the cyberspace realm, and most of the time, for Twipsy to get to know the aspects of the real world, such as weather, or his newfound love (and gluttony) of food.

The characters are displayed using [[computer graphics]] when they're residing in the Cyberspace, and in the "real world" using conventional comic style. Apart from that, all persons are nearly the same size and appearance as Twipsy himself.

The '''Baron Vladimir Harkonnen''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] and antagonist from the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]]. He is primarily featured in the 1965 novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and is also a prominent character in the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' [[prequel]] [[trilogy]] (1999-2001) by [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]]. The character is brought back as a [[ghola]] in the Herbert/Anderson [[sequel]]s which conclude the original series, ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007).

==Conception==
Frank Herbert wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonists of his novel, ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. Herbert came across the name "Härkönen" in a California telephone book and thought that it sounded "Soviet" (it is in fact Finnish), which touched a nerve with Cold War-era readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Herbert|year=2003 |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9781429958448 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier drafts of his novel, the lead villain was called "Valdemar Hoskanner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Brian|last1=Herbert|first2=Kevin J.|last2=Anderson|chapter=Spice Planet|title=The Road to Dune|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London, England|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Herbert's "Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)" in ''Dune'' says of Harkonnen (in part):
{{quote|VLADIMIR HARKONNEN (10,110-10,193) Commonly referred to as Baron Harkonnen, his title is officially Siridar (planetary governor) Baron. Vladimir Harkonnen is the direct-line male descendant of the Bashar [[Abulurd Harkonnen]] who was banished for cowardice after the [[Battle of Corrin]]. The return of [[House Harkonnen]] to power generally is ascribed to adroit manipulation of the [[whale fur]] market and later consolidation with [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]] wealth from [[Arrakis]].&lt;ref name="Appendix"&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank |last=Herbert |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |chapter=Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses): VLADIMIR HARKONNEN |year=1965 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London, England|isbn=978-0441172719}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Dune'', Herbert writes that the Baron possesses a "[[Basso profondo|basso]] voice" and is so "grossly and immensely fat" that he requires [[anti-gravity]] devices known as [[suspensor (Dune)|suspensors]] to support his weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank |last=Herbert |authorlink=Frank Herbert |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |year=1965 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London, England|isbn=978-0441172719|quote=As [Baron Vladimir Harkonnen] emerged from the shadows, his figure took on dimension — grossly and immensely fat. And with subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than fifty of them."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ruthless and cruel as he is intelligent and cunning, the Baron has a talent for manipulating others and exploiting their weaknesses. His sexual preference for young men is implied in ''Dune'' and ''Children of Dune''.&lt;ref&gt;From ''Dune'': "I'll be in my sleeping chambers," the Baron said. "Bring me that young fellow we bought on [[Gamont]], the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't feel like wrestling."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From ''Dune'': "Why haven't you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?" Feyd-Rautha asked. "With a Truthsayer at your side —" "You know my tastes!" the Baron snapped.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Baron says to Feyd in ''Dune'': "This old fool saw through the shielded needle you'd planted in that slave boy's thigh. Right where I'd put my hand on it, eh?"&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted, however, that he "once permitted himself to be seduced" in the liaison which produced his secret daughter.&lt;ref name="Jessica's father"&gt;Paul says to Jessica in ''Dune'', "And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should — we are Harkonnens ... take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens ... You're the Baron's own daughter," he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. "The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plotlines ==

=== ''Dune'' ===
As ''Dune'' begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of [[Giedi Prime]] and the [[House Atreides|Atreides]] of [[Caladan]]. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition as [[Leto I Atreides|Duke Leto Atreides]] is lured to the [[desert planet]] Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto's own physician, the trusted [[Suk School|Suk doctor]] [[Wellington Yueh]]. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's twisted [[Mentat]] [[Piter De Vries]] notes:

{{quote|It's assumed that ultimate conditioning cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as [[Archimedes|someone]] once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that moved the doctor.}}

The Baron has taken Yueh's wife [[Wanna (Dune)|Wanna]] prisoner, threatening her with interminable torture unless Yueh complies with his demands. Harkonnen also distracts Leto's Mentat [[Thufir Hawat]] from discovering Yueh by guiding Hawat toward another suspect: Leto's [[Bene Gesserit]] [[concubinage|concubine]] [[Lady Jessica]], of whom Hawat is already distrustful. The Atreides are soon attacked by Harkonnen forces (secretly supplemented by the seemingly unstoppable Imperial [[Sardaukar]]) as Yueh disables the protective shields around the Atreides palace on Arrakis. As instructed, Yueh takes Leto prisoner; however, desiring to slay the Baron, Yueh provides the captive Leto with a fake tooth filled with poisonous gas as a means of simultaneous [[assassination]] and [[suicide]]. De Vries kills Yueh but he also dies with Leto in the assassination attempt; however Harkonnen survives. The Baron then manipulates Hawat into his service, by convincing Hawat that Lady Jessica was the traitor and using Hawat's desire for revenge on Lady Jessica and the Emperor as motivation to assist House Harkonnen.

Leto and Jessica's son [[Paul Atreides]] flee into the desert with Jessica, and both are presumed dead. Paul's [[prescience]] helps him determine the identity of Jessica's father, the "maternal grandfather who cannot be named" — the Baron himself.&lt;ref name="Jessica's father"/&gt; Over the next two years, Harkonnen learns that his nephews [[Glossu Rabban]] and [[Feyd-Rautha]] are conspiring against him to usurp his throne; he lets them continue to do so, reasoning that they have to somehow learn to organize a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]]. As punishment for a failed assassination attempt against him, Harkonnen forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as Feyd's lovers. He explains that Feyd has to learn the price of failure.

The Baron's plan to assure Feyd's power is to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people. However, a crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious [[Muad'Dib]] emerges as a leader of the native [[Fremen]] tribes against the rule of the Harkonnens. Eventually, a series of Fremen victories against Beast Rabban threaten to disrupt the trade of the spice. The [[Padishah Emperor]] [[Shaddam IV]] decides to intervene himself and arrives on Arrakis along with legions of Sardaukar forces.  Shaddam and the Baron are shocked to learn that Muad'Dib is, of course, a very-much-alive Paul Atreides. The Imperial forces fall prey to a surprise attack by the Fremen.  Part of the Fremen/Atreides strategy is to wait until a sandstorm shorts out the force field shields of the Harkonnen/Imperial transport ships, disable them with projectile weapons, and then attack with a vast assault force, using [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s under cover of the severe weather to break the enemy lines.  The Sardaukar and Harkonnen forces are trapped on the planet, astonished at the sandworm mounts and vast numbers of their attackers. Their past ruthlessness gives them little hope of quarter from the enraged Fremen.

Rabban dies in the initial part of the battle; the Harkonnen army is massacred to the last man and almost all the Imperial Sardaukar are killed. Baron Harkonnen himself is poisoned with a [[gom jabbar]] by Paul's young sister [[Alia Atreides]], his own granddaughter, and dies at the age of 83, with the latter also revealing her direct lineage to him just beforehand. Paul then kills Feyd in ritual combat. House Harkonnen's virtual extermination removes it as a galactic power, but Paul's ascension to the Imperial throne in Shaddam's place guarantees that Vladimir's descendants will long reign as the Imperial House Atreides.

=== ''Children of Dune'' ===
Alia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit refer to as [[abomination (Dune)|Abomination]], because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. In ''[[Children of Dune]]'', Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power. Alia eventually commits [[suicide]], realizing that Harkonnen's [[consciousness]] has surpassed her abilities to contain him.

=== ''Prelude to Dune'' ===
In the ''Prelude to Dune'' prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of [[Dmitri Harkonnen]] and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen's father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor,  Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother [[Abulurd Harkonnen|Abulurd]] (namesake of the original). Unhappy with his brother's doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title. Under the name Abulurd Rabban, he reigns as governor of the secondary Harkonnen planet [[Lankiveil]]. Abulurd and his wife have two sons: Glossu Rabban (later nicknamed "Beast Rabban" after he murders his own father) and Feyd-Rautha; Vladimir later adopts the boys back into House Harkonnen, and Feyd becomes his designated heir.

The Baron's most prominent political rival is Duke Leto Atreides; the Harkonnens and the Atreides have been bitter enemies for millennia, since the [[Battle of Corrin]] that ended the [[Butlerian Jihad]]. When Emperor Shaddam IV orchestrates a plot to destroy the "Red Duke" Leto, the Baron eagerly lends his aid.

The young Baron Vladimir is described as an exceedingly handsome man, possessing red hair and a near-perfect physique. The Bene Gesserit [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Gaius Helen Mohiam]] is instructed by the Sisterhood to collect the genetic material of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (through conception) for their breeding program.  As the Baron's [[homosexuality]] is something of an open secret, Mohiam [[blackmail]]s him into having sexual relations with her and conceives his child.  When that daughter proves genetically undesirable, Mohiam kills her and returns to Harkonnen for a second try; at this point he drugs and viciously rapes her.  She exacts her retribution by infecting him with a rare, incurable disease that later causes his obesity.  Mohiam's second child with the Baron is Jessica.&lt;ref&gt;According to the authors, the revelation that Mohiam is Jessica's mother was pulled directly from Frank Herbert's working notes for the original ''Dune'' series. See: {{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/herbertandanderson.html  |title=Chat with Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson: ''Dune: House Harkonnen'' |year=2000 |publisher=SciFi.com (Internet Archive) |accessdate=November 5, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071105073412/http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/herbertandanderson.html |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Dune: House Harkonnen]]'', the deteriorating Baron at first walks with the assistance of a cane, then relies on belt-mounted suspensors to retain mobility. He consults numerous doctors in the expanse of time between the ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]'' and ''Dune: House Harkonnen'', up to and including his future instrument Dr. Yueh, all of whom are ultimately no help.  To conceal this debilitation, he pretends that his obesity is due to intentional overindulgence, lest the [[Landsraad]] remove him from power. When he determines that Mohiam inflicted him with the disease, he attempts to coerce her into revealing the cure, but soon discovers that there is none.

The Baron, Duke Leto, and Jessica herself are unaware that Jessica is secretly the Baron's daughter or that he has even fathered one; in the year 10,176, the Baron's grandson Paul is born to Leto and Jessica.

=== ''Hunters of Dune'' ===
In ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the [[Lost Tleilaxu]] [[Uxtal]], acting on orders from the [[Face Dancer]] [[Khrone]]. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named [[Paolo (Dune)|Paolo]]. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron's genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron's [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] nature. Khrone is successful when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron's memories of his former life return. The reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind; the source of this inner Alia is never explained.

==In adaptations==
[[File:McNeice as Harkonnen (2000).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian McNeice]] as Vladimir Harkonnen in the [[Frank Herbert's Dune|''Dune'' miniseries]] (2000)]]
In [[David Lynch]]'s [[Dune (film)|1984 film]], Baron Harkonnen was portrayed by [[Kenneth McMillan (actor)|Kenneth McMillan]]. In this characterization, he is grotesquely overweight, dressed in filthy garments and covered in large, black [[pustule]]s which require constant draining and treatment. This version of the character is more overtly unstable than in the novel, screaming and laughing incoherently at any given moment and even drinking the blood of a servant after removing a "heart plug." Diverging from the novel, after Alia pricks Harkonnen with the gom jabbar, she pushes him and sends him flying through a hole in the palace wall, to be devoured by a giant sandworm.

British actor [[Ian McNeice]]'s interpretation of the Baron in the 2000 [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Frank Herbert's Dune]]'' (and its [[sequel]], 2003's ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|Children of Dune]]'') is, though dramatic, somewhat lighter, more eloquent and sane in comparison to Lynch's version, and therefore more consistent with the novel. Though the Baron still takes [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] enjoyment in the suffering of others, he is portrayed as somewhat flamboyant, pompous, calculating and self-indulgent, with a tendency to speak in [[iambic pentameter]] when the mood strikes him.

Though Herbert's novel ''Dune'' seems to describe Harkonnen's suspensor belt as simply enabling him to stand and walk upright rather than actually "fly," both the 1984 film and the 2000 miniseries feature the Baron utilizing the suspensors to levitate off the ground and float through the air in a flying-like manner.  The later ''Prelude to Dune'' prequels also employ this floating ability. Herbert does, however, note Harkonnen floating slightly off the floor after he is killed.&lt;ref name="Floating"&gt;From ''Dune'': "He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging open."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The video game ''[[Emperor: Battle for Dune]]'', whose in-game [[cut scene]]s are visually inspired by David Lynch's film, features a character named Baron Rakan Harkonnen, portrayed by [[Mike McShane]]. This Harkonnen is nearly identical to the film's version of Vladimir in both appearance (minus the belt-mounted suspensors) and personality, and also dies by poisoning.

[[H. R. Giger]]'s [[Harkonnen Capo Chair]] is a chair originally designed by the artist as set dressing for an unrealized 1970s adaptation of ''Dune'' by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.

'''Vladimir Mikhailovich Zenzinov''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Михайлович Зензинов}}; historically, his surname was also transcribed as '''Sensinoff''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E4D61E31E233A25751C2A9679C946396D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=Siberia Made Him Suicidal.; Jailed Professor's Attempt Fails -- Scientific Instruments Calm Him | date=22 January 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; 29 November 1880 — 20 October 1953) was a member of Russia's [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]], a participant of the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|First]] (1905), [[February Revolution|Second]] (February 1917), and [[October Revolution|Third]] (November 1917) Russian Revolutions, and an author of a number of books.

==Biography==
Vladimir Zenzinov was born in Moscow in 1880, the son of a merchant. He studied at several universities in Germany and was known as one of the 'Heidelberg SRs'. His friendship with [[Nikolai Avksentiev|N.D. Avksentiev]] and [[Avram Gots|A.R. Gots]] dates from that period. He joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (PSR) in 1901 and returned to Russia in 1904. Arrested at the beginning of the [[Revolution of 1905]] and sentenced to five years banishment in Siberia, he escaped to Western Europe, then returned to St. Petersburg in 1906. He worked for the PSR in various capacities and was elected to its Central Committee. He was active in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev. In September 1906, he was arrested again and banished to Siberia. In 1907, he escaped, making his way to Western Europe via Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, and the [[Suez Canal]]. He soon returned illegally to Russia.

Arrested again in 1910, Zenzinov was banished to northern [[Yakutsk]] to make escape impossible. There he devoted himself to ethnographic studies and wrote several pioneering anthropological works on the subject, e.g.: ''Starinnye liudi u kholodnogo okeana'' (Moscow, 1914) and ''Ocherki torgovli na severe Yakutskoi oblasti'' (Moscow, 1916). In his memoirs, he tells of some extremely isolated places he visited, such as the village of [[Russkoye Ustye]] in the Arctic [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]]. In 1915 Zenzinov returned to European Russia and lived in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He participated in the [[February Revolution of 1917]], played various roles in the All-Russian Soviet of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies and supported the Provisional Government under [[Alexander Kerensky|A.F. Kerensky]]. With respect to World War I, which bitterly divided the PSR, Zenzinov adopted a '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Revolutionary Defencist]]' position: opposed to the war before the February Revolution, he supported the 'defence of the revolution' against Germany. Zenzinov tried to mediate between more radical 'Defencists' (like [[Andrei Argunov|A.A. Argunov]] and the 'Internationalists' led by [[Victor Chernov|V.M. Chernov]] and [[Mark Natanson|M.A. Natanson]].

Zenzinov opposed the [[October Revolution]]. He was elected as an SR deputy to the one-day Constituent Assembly, dispersed by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Thereafter Zenzinov joined the [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly|rump Constituent Assembly government]] in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] in 1918. He was briefly one of the Directors of the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]], together with [[Nikolai Avksentiev|N.D. Avksentiev]] and others. Arrested during a military coup by [[Admiral Kolchak]] in November 1918, Zenzinov was exiled to China. From there he made his way back to Western Europe. He lived in Berlin until [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] came to power in 1933, then moved to Paris. During this time he published several more books and worked for a variety of émigré socialist journals, including ''Volya Rossiya'', ''Golos Rossii'', ''Dni'', ''Novaya Rossiya'' and ''Sovremennye Zapiski''.

In 1939, Zenzinov went to Finland to witness the beginning of World War II and the Soviet attack on Finland, and to gather information on Russia. In 1940, Zenzinov emigrated to the United States, settling in New York and writing his memoirs.

William Ruto was among the list of people who were tried at the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) for their involvement in Kenya's 2007-8 electoral violence. However, the case was faced with challenges especially concerning withdrawal of key prosecution witnesses. In April 2016, the prosecution of Ruto was abandoned by the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/international-criminal-court-william-ruto-kenya-deputy-president-election-violence|title=International criminal court abandons case against William Ruto|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=6 April 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Ruto was born 21 December 1966 in Sambut village, [[Kamagut]], [[Uasin Gishu]] to Daniel Cheruiyot and Sarah Cheruiyot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.africa-confidential.com/whos-who-profile/id/3440/William_Ruto|title=William Samoei arap Ruto|publisher=Africa Confidential|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Kerotet Primary School for his primary school education then joined Wareng Secondary School for his Ordinary Levels education before proceeding to Kapsabet Boys, Nandi for his Advanced Levels. He then went on to receive a BSc (Botany and Zoology) from the [[University of Nairobi]], graduating in 1990.He was honoured with PhD from the University of Nairobi graduating in September 2018. He was also a member of Christian Union where he served as Chairman. He was ranked the best student in his class. He later enrolled for MSc in Environmental Science, graduating in 2011.

==Political career==
Ruto was Organising Secretary of [[Youth for Kanu '92]] (YK92), a group that was formed to drum up support for President [[Daniel arap Moi]] in the 1992 election.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 18 November 2002: He was first elected as a member of parliament for Eldoret North in 1997 through KANU ticket after defeating the incumbent Reuben Chesire. He previously served as the Secretary-General for KANU following the party’s 2005 national elections till 2007 when he formally quit to join the Orange Democratic Movement [https://web.archive.org/web/20170718044156/http://www.nationaudio.com/news/dailynation/18112002/news/election+20001.html Lobby groups resurface to cash in on election euphoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Ruto declared publicly that he would stand for the presidency in the next general election, scheduled for December 2007. His statement was condemned by some of his KANU colleagues, including former president Moi. Ruto sought the nomination of the [[Orange Democratic Movement]] (ODM) as its presidential candidate, but in the party's vote on 1 September 2007, he placed third with 368 votes, behind the winner, [[Raila Odinga]] (with 2,656 votes) and [[Musalia Mudavadi]] (with 391).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143973896 "It's Raila for President"], ''East African Standard'', 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruto expressed his support for Odinga after the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Maina Muiruri, [http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143973907 "ODM ‘pentagon’ promises to keep the team intact"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Standard'' (Kenya), 2 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from his post as KANU secretary general on 6 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, 7 October 2007: [http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143954753 Ruto abandons Kanu’s top post]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presidential election of December 2007 ended in an impasse. Kenya's electoral commission declared Kibaki the winner, but Raila and ODM claimed the victory. In a scene that has been replicated all over Africa, Mwai Kibaki was hurriedly sworn in as the president [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|December 2007 presidential election]]. Following the election and dispute over the result Kenya was engulfed by a [[Kenyan crisis, 2007-2008|violent political crisis]]. Kibaki and Odinga agreed to form a power-sharing government.&lt;ref name=PM&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E991FAE0-2FD8-4B72-AFE7-0C2B1F9E89FC.htm "Odinga sworn in as Kenya PM"], Al Jazeera, 17 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Names&gt;Anthony Kariuki, [http://politics.nationmedia.com/inner.asp?pcat=NEWS&amp;cat=TOP&amp;sid=1787 "Kibaki names Raila PM in new Cabinet"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, nationmedia.com, 13 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the grand coalition Cabinet named on 13 April 2008&lt;ref name=Names/&gt; and sworn in on 17 April,&lt;ref name=PM/&gt; Ruto was appointed as Minister for Agriculture.&lt;ref name=Names/&gt;

On 21 April 2010, Ruto was transferred from the agriculture ministry and posted to the higher education ministry, swapping posts with Sally Kosgei.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=nw20100421190710818C799864 Kenya's cabinet reshuffled] ''IOL''&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2011, William Ruto was relieved of his ministerial duties, and remaining a member of parliament. He joined with Uhuru Kenyatta to form the Jubilee alliance for the 2013 presidential election.

On 6 October 2014 Ruto was appointed acting president of Kenya by President Uhuru Kenyatta following his summons to appear before the ICC.

==International Criminal Court summons==
In December 2010, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that he was seeking summonses of six people, including Ruto over their involvement in the 2007-8 electoral violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/blob/view/-/1072970/data/221745/-/8cjsjj/-/statement.pdf |title=Kenya’s post election violence: ICC Prosecutor presents cases against six individuals for crimes against humanity |publisher=International Criminal Court |date=15 December 2010 |work=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber subsequently issued a summons for Ruto at the prosecutor's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1037044.pdf |title=Decision on the Prosecutor's Application for Summons to Appear for William Samoei Ruto, Henry Kiprono Kosgey and Joshua Arap Sang |publisher=[[International Criminal Court]] Pre-Trial Chamber II |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruto is accused of planning and organising crimes against supporters of President Kibaki's Party of National Unity. He is charged with three counts of [[crimes against humanity]], one of each of murder, forcible transfer of population and persecution. On 23 January 2012, the ICC confirmed the charges against Ruto and [[Joshua Sang]], in a case that also involved Uhuru Kenyatta, [[Francis Muthaura]], [[Henry Kosgey]] and [[Major General Mohammed Hussein Ali]].

He told the American government that the Kiambaa church fire on 1 January 2008 after the [[Kenyan general election, 2007|2007 Kenyan general election]] was accidental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201103071351.html Ruto explains Kiambaa] ''Wikileaks''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Waki Commission report stated in 2009 that "the incident which captured the attention of both Kenyans and the world was the deliberate burning alive of mostly Kikuyu women and children huddled together in a church" in Kiambaa on 1 January 2008.

The death toll was 17 burned alive in the church, 11 dying in or on the way to hospital, 54 others suffered various injuries and were treated and discharged.

In April 2016, the prosecution of Ruto was abandoned by the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt;

William Ruto was on trial charged with defrauding the [[Kenya Pipeline Company]] (KPC) of huge amounts of money through dubious land deals, but he has been out on bond. The Constitutional Court suspended further hearing of the case due to complaints by Ruto that the prosecution was politically engineered. However, the High Court cleared the path for criminal charges against the Higher Education minister over the alleged sale of a piece of land in Ngong' forest to Kenya Pipeline Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 2 July 2006: [http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143954753 Litany of big money graft cases pending in courts]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Standard, 29 June 2004: [https://web.archive.org/web/20040630152013/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/june/tue29062004/headlines/news29060405.htm Ruto now charged with Sh96m fraud]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maize scandal ===
{{Main|2009 Kenyan Maize Scandal}}
In early 2009 after parliamentary debate on a [[2009 Kenyan Maize Scandal|maize scandal]], Ruto was accused of illegally selling maize by Ikolomani MP Bonny Khalwale. Fake documents bearing the National Cereals and Produce Board seal that linked Mr Ruto to the illegal sale of maize were rejected by Parliament’s deputy speaker.

William Ruto attributed the maize scandal allegations and claims of his involvement in corruption to the work of his "political enemies".

=== Lang'ata Primary Land Scandal ===
In early 2015, William Ruto was accused of illegally acquiring land belonging to Lang'ata Road Primary School to pave way for a car parking lot for a hotel allegedly belonging to him. The incident, which was widely reported around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Kenyan Police Accused Of Tear-Gassing Schoolchildren In Protest Over Playground|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/19/kenya-school-teargas_n_6500476.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed pictures of hapless pupils being teargassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Kenya school children tear gassed over playground|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/kenya-school-children-tear-gassed-over-playground/|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruto denied his involvement in the land saga but later admitted that he owned the hotel that had allegedly grabbed the school's playground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Standard Digital News – KTN Home: Deputy President William Ruto admits to have "interests" at the controversial Weston hotel|url = http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ktnmobile/video/2000093686/deputy-president-william-ruto-admits-to-have-interests-at-the-controversial-weston-hotel|website = KTN News|accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
So wide was the outrage against the treatment of children at Lang'ata Road Primary School that the Cabinet Secretary in charge of Land in Kenya gave a statement that said the hotel that had grabbed the school land belonged to some Singh brothers. At a press conference in her office, Mrs Ngilu named Nairobi businessmen Mandip Singh Amrit, Manjit Singh Amrit, Harbans Singh Amrit and Kamal Prakash Amrit as the owners of the company linked to the controversial acquisition of Lang’ata Road Primary School land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charity Ngilu names firm linked to school land controversy|url = http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Charity-Ngilu-Langata-Land-Grab-Airport-View/-/1056/2599336/-/c64bv/-/index.html|website = www.nation.co.ke|accessdate = 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New constitution ===
While Ruto and Odinga were both from the Orange Democratic Movement of the power-sharing government, they disagreed on the issue of the proposed constitution draft, with Ruto calling for rejection of the draft in the upcoming constitutional referendum, arguing that some of its clauses are unsuitable, while Odinga and Kibaki campaigned for the constitution.

=== Marriage and affairs ===
Ruto married [[Rachel Ruto|Rachel Chebet]] in 1991; they have six children.

In February 2017 [[Prisca Chemutai Bett]] claimed that Ruto had fathered her 11-year-old daughter [[Abby Cherop Ruto]], a claim that Ruto accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/ruto-child-out-of-wedlock/|publisher =Nairobi News|date=2 February 2017|title=Ruto owns up to fathering child out of wedlock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
On 28 July 2017, Ruto's home in Sugoi village near Eldoret was targeted by at least one attacker armed with machete and a police officer guarding the residence was injured during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/kenyas-deputy-president-ruto-targeted-by-gunmen-10966411|title=Kenya's deputy president William Ruto targeted by gunmen|publisher=Sky News|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the attack, he and his family were not at the compound as he had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in [[Kitale]]. There were also reports of gunfire and several security sources said the attack was staged by multiple people using guns. Police also thought there are a few attackers initially because the attacker used different firearms..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40764446|title=Kenya Deputy President Ruto's home entered by knifeman|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Police-sent--William-Ruto-home-attacker-/1056-4037948-14tyu68z/index.html|title=More police sent to fight attacker at DP Ruto's home|publisher=Daily Nation|date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hours later on 30 July, Kenya Police chief Joseph Boinnet  announced that the attacker was shot dead and the situation was under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://citifmonline.com/2017/07/30/kenya-police-kill-gunman-at-deputy-president-rutos-home/|title=Kenya police kill gunman at Deputy President Ruto’s home|publisher=Citifm Online|date=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zell Kravinsky''' is an [[United States|American]] [[investment|investor]] and [[utilitarian]] who is known for making a non-directed [[kidney]] [[Organ donation|donation]] to a stranger and for donating over $45 million of his personal wealth to charity.  He is also a poet.

==Early life and education==
Kravinsky was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2004/02/24/archive/among-americas-mega-donors-many-jews-but-few-gifts-to-jews Jewish Telegraph Agency: "Among America’s Mega- Donors, Many Jews, but Few Gifts to Jews"] February 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and earned two [[Ph.D.]] degrees from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], one in 1989 in [[Rhetoric]] with a dissertation on [[Aristotle]]’s [[topoi]], and the other in 1994 in [[English Literature]] with a dissertation on paradoxical [[polysemy]] in [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.  He also completed required courses for a third doctoral degree, in [[cultural anthropology]] from [[The New School]] For Social Research, but did not take the preliminary examination or write a [[dissertation]].  His [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Dartmouth College]] was in [[Asian Studies]], with a specialty in [[Indian Studies]].

==Career==
He lectured full-time at Penn for some years, was a Faculty in Residence for four years, and one year was selected, in the University's published book of student evaluations, as the most overall highly ranked faculty member at Penn. Kravinsky then worked for insurance companies designing and teaching training workshops in [[management development]]; taught [[handicapped]] ("[[learning disabled]]" and “socially and [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotionally disturbed]],” i.e., conduct-disordered) children in inner-city [[Philadelphia]] schools; and taught [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The trouble with compassion|first=Ian|last=Cooper|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto, Ont.|date= December 24, 2004|page=F.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
After amassing a real estate fortune, having started with one thousand dollars, Kravinsky gave away virtually all of it to various charities, concentrating on public health organizations. Specifically, he donated almost all of the $45 million he amassed in real estate to charities dealing with improving health; he made the largest individual contribution ever to the foundation supporting the United States government [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and also made major donations to [[The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] and to the [[Ohio State University]] College of Public Health.

==Kidney donation==
After Kravinsky learned that many [[African-American]]s have difficulty obtaining kidneys from family members, he sought out a hospital in [[Philadelphia]] that would allow him to donate one of his kidneys to a lower-income [[black (people)|black]] person.

According to [[Peter Singer]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Kravinsky justified the donation mathematically when speaking to Singer's students, noting that the chances of dying as a result of the procedure would have been about 1 in 4,000. Kravinsky believed that, under the circumstances, "to withhold a kidney from someone who would otherwise die means valuing one’s own life at 4,000 times that of a stranger", a ratio he termed "obscene."

Following the kidney donation, Kravinsky did several interviews with the media, including a radio conference with [[Robert Siegel]] of [[NPR]] and a TV appearance on [[CBS]] among others. During some of these public interviews, Kravinsky argued that should someone be, for instance, on the verge of curing cancer but would die unless Kravinsky were to donate his second kidney, that being the only match in the world, that it would be morally correct to donate the kidney in order that millions of people would be saved.   Kravinsky has noted that this admittedly theoretical and highly improbable scenario is the logical extension of someone risking his life by jumping into icy water to save a child, or a soldier cradling a hand grenade to save his buddies.

He is mentioned in former President [[Bill Clinton]]'s book ''Giving,'' and in an article in the December 10, 2008 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]], The Economics of Health Equity.
