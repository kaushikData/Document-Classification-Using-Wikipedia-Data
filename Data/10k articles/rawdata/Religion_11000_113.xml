'''Adhikārivāda''' is the [[doctrine]] of special rights and privileges with regard to the right to universal [[knowledge]] of the [[Upanishads]]. 

[[Vivekananda]] rejected this doctrine which, in his view, was the outcome of pure [[selfishness]] and ignored both the infinite possibilities of the [[human]] [[soul]] and the fact that all men are capable of receiving knowledge if it is imparted in their own respective [[language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda Vol.5|publisher=Kartindo.com|page=361|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AAGNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hd1g1wRqYv&amp;sig=a8cfyj_VJk53Ed_zvYqf4WczlWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he claimed, there is no reason for access to the universal knowledge of the Upanishads to be restricted on the basis of [[caste]] or [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit’s Inheritance in Hindu Religion|author=Mahendra Singh|publisher=Gyan Publishing|page=63|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7CoelGoA6l8C&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vgJy6_sCBH&amp;sig=6nZYD6YbHb5k2osjhxJIvj4la2U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allgemeinezeitungdesjudenthums1844.png|thumbnail|Cover of the magazine, 1 January 1844]]
'''''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums''''' (until May 1903: ''Allgemeine Zeitung des Juden'''th'''ums'') was a [[Jewish]] German magazine devoted to Jewish interests, founded in 1837 by [[Ludwig Philippson]] (1811–89), published first in [[Leipzig]] and later in Berlin. In 1860 it had a circulation of approximately 1,500.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica&gt;Carlebach, Ezriel, et al. (2007). "Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. vol.&amp;nbsp;1. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. p. 670-671. Available online [https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/allgemeine-zeitung-des-judentums via ''Encyclopedia.com''].&lt;/ref&gt; It was read not only in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands but also in Eastern Europe, and continued to appear until 1922.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt;

At the time of its founding several [[Jewish journals]] had recently been launched in Germany&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Sulamith]]'' (1806-1843), ''[[Jedidja]]'' (1817-1831), and [[Abraham Geiger]]'s ''[[Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift für Jüdische Theologie]]'' (1835-1847), as well as the ''[[Unparteiische Universal-Kirchenzeitung]]'' (1837), of [[Julius Vinzenz Höninghaus]], which had a Jewish section edited by Michael Hess and [[Isaac Markus Jost]] – and Philippson recognized that none had kept pace with the needs of the times.&lt;ref&gt;Kayserling, Meyer (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vz5AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 Ludwig Philippson: eine Biographie]''. Leipzig: Hermann Mendelsohn. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer1906&gt;Singer, Isidore (1906). "[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1262-allgemeine-zeitung-des-judenthums Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums]." ''Jewish Encyclopedia''. New York: Funk and Wagnalls.&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed to produce a journal for the intelligent lay person that would both advance knowledge of Jewish history and plead the cause of the Jews of his day.&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt;

The first number of the paper appeared May 2, 1837, and was published by [[Baumgärtner]] in Leipzig with the subtitle "Unparteiisches Organ für Alles Jüdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde, und Belletristik" (Impartial Organ for All Matters of Jewish Interest Pertaining to Politics, Religion, Literature, History, Philology, and Belles-lettres).&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt; During the first two years the paper appeared three times per week. For a year and a half a supplement was published three times a month, devoted to literature and homiletics.&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt; In the course of 1839 it was first published twice weekly and then eventually became a weekly.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt;

Isidore Singer, writing in 1906, highlighted the paper's editorial independence, noting that it had not ever received a subsidy from any Jewish body, and that during the [[revolutions of 1848]], "when the publication of nearly all other Jewish journals was interrupted, the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' braved the storm and spoke out plainly in the political turmoil."&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt; According to [[I. M. Jost]], who devoted a chapter to the journal in his ''Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten'' (1847),&lt;ref&gt;Jost, Israel Mark. "[http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10571063.html?pageNo=159 Ludwig Philippson, Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums]," chapter 16, in: ''Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten'', vol. 3. Breslau: Jacobsohn, 1847. p. 149-156.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' "became epoch-making in Jewish history by attempting for the first time to give a general view of the life and conditions of the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Translation as cited in Singer (1906), ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippson's chief aim was the civil emancipation of the Jews,&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt; carrying on the fight for that cause in the spirit of [[Gabriel Riesser]]'s earlier periodical ''Der Jude'' (1832-1835).&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt; The paper was a voice for moderate religious reform, focusing attention on the organization of religious instruction, the form of worship in the synagogue, and the cultivation of all branches of Jewish learning.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt; It also advocated for closer relations with non-Jews.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt; It exercised considerable influence on Judaism in general, and, in particular, on the evolution of Judaism in Germany. It played a role in the establishment of a [[rabbinical seminary]] ([[Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums]]) in Berlin, and of a [[Jewish Publication Society]] ''([[Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Literatur]])'', as well as the calling together of a Jewish synod (Leipzig, 1869).&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt;

From the outset the ''Allgemeine Zeitung'' met with success, drawing the interest of cultured Jewish circles of Germany, [[Austria]], and the Netherlands. Within the first months of its publication a society of students in [[Leyden]] (Netherlands) had formed to aid its circulation, and it even obtained several hundred subscribers in [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt;

During the first years of its existence the paper had among its collaborators a number of the most distinguished scholars, including Gabriel Riesser, [[E. Carmoly]], [[J. L. Saalschütz]], [[S. D. Luzzatto]], [[Leopold Zunz]], [[Leopold Dukes]], [[Julius Fürst]], [[Leopold Löw]], [[Franz Delitzsch]], [[Adolph Jellinek]], Abraham Geiger, and I. M. Jost. During the first year [[Phoebus Philippson]], brother of Ludwig, contributed a series of 11 articles under the title "Ideas for an Encyclopedia and a Methodology of Jewish Theology."&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt;

In the mid 1850s a supplement was published regularly, entitled ''[[Jüdisches Volksblatt zur Belehrung und Unterhaltung auf Jüdischem Gebiete]]'' (A Popular Jewish Journal for Instruction and Entertainment on Jewish Subjects).

After Philippson's death [[Gustav Karpeles]] assumed the editorship, beginning with the issue of February 9, 1890.&lt;ref name=Singer1906/&gt; Under his tenure the paper's interests shifted toward the lives and situation of the Jews of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt; At that time a change was made in the format so that the literary part, which formed the bulk of the paper, was separated from the part containing the news. The latter was paged separately as a supplement entitled ''[[Der Gemeindebote]]'', which continued to appear until 1922.

In 1890 the journal was acquired by [[Rudolf Mosse]] and from then on was published in Berlin.

Later, beginning in the second half of 1920, the journal appeared only once every two weeks.&lt;ref name=EncycJudaica/&gt; It ceased publication with the issue of April 28, 1922,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/3224737 overview of the complete digital edition], found in the "Compact Memory" digital archive of German-Jewish periodicals, hosted online at the Goethe Universität, Frankfurt am Main.&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by the ''C.V.-Zeitung'' (C.V.-Newspaper), the organ of the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens]] (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith).&lt;ref&gt;See editorial notice, [http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/3229518 ''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums'', April 28, 1922], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alomancy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''halo'', 'salt', and ''manteia'', divination), also called Adromancy, ydromancie, idromancie, and halomancy, is an ancient form of [[divination]]. Similar to many other forms of divination, the diviner casts [[salt]] crystals into the air and interprets the patterns as it falls to the ground or travels through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Sara Sklaroff|title = Stolen babies, a lost ship and a new kind of alchemy. By Sara Sklaroff|quote = |publisher = The Washington Post|date = July 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Ron Wolfe|title = Entry-level instructions for wizards|quote = |publisher = Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|date = August 13, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diviner can also interpret patterns formed from the residue of a salt [[solution]] as it evaporates in the bowl. The exact interpretations are unknown, but it probably follows a similar method to [[aleuromancy]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Salt itself is often intertwined with [[luck]] and some of this ancient tradition can be seen in the [[superstition]]s, such as perceived misfortune when the salt cellar is overturned and the custom of throwing salt over the left shoulder for good luck.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Alomancy  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | volume =   | pages = 17  | publisher = Harper Element  | year = 2006  | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of alomancy consists of the casting of salt into a fire, which is considered a type of [[pyromancy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1079">The '''Anjeyandari hill''' in [[Hampi]] lies in the  centre of [[Anegondi]] area, [[Karnataka state]], India. It is believed to be the birthplace of [[Lord Hanuman]] ( The monkey warrior God). According to [[Hindu mythology]], Hanuman was born to [[Añjanā|Anjana]] and thus Hanuman was also called as Anjaneya, and his birthplace Anjeyandari (Anjana's Hill).

The hill has a white washed Hanuman temple at the top. It has about 570 steps. The view from the top is breathtaking as you see patches of paddy fields and the Hampi city ruins around.

The temple has a rock carved idol of Lord Hanuman. There are also shrines of [[Lord Ram]] and his consort [[Sita]] and [[Anjana Devi]] temple in the same vicinity.

The '''Archdiocese of Turku''' ({{lang-fi|Turun arkkihiippakunta}}, {{lang-sv|Åbo ärkestift}}), historically known as ''[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Åbo|Archdiocese of Åbo]]'', is the seat of the Archbishop of Turku. It is a part of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], and its [[see city]] is [[Turku]].  The Archbishop has many administrative tasks relating to the National church, and is the Metropolitan and [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of the church. In common with other Lutheran and Anglican churches the Archbishop is considered ''[[primus inter pares]]'', whilst all [[diocesan bishop]]s retain their independence within their respective jurisdictions.

== History ==
Influenced by [[papal bull]]s, Swedish magnates in the 12th century set up [[crusade|crusading]] expeditions to convert the heathens in the eastern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. This resulted in the establishment of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Christian]] religion and the [[Sweden|Swedish]] conquest of southern [[Finland]] in 1249. [[Turku]], or ''Åbo'', became the principal city in Finland and residence of a Bishopric. 
As a result of [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century the Catholic Church had to give way for the [[Church of Sweden|Lutheran state church]] which was established by [[Gustav Vasa|King Gustav Vasa of Sweden]], whose principal reformer in Finland was [[Mikael Agricola]] and from 1554 also the Bishop. 

After the [[Finnish War]] in 1809, Finland became a part of the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]] as an autonomous grand duchy. In 1817 the [[Bishop]] was created [[Archbishop]] and became head of the Church in Finland, which thereupon became the state church of the grand duchy. In 1870, the church was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity. After Finland had gained independence in 1917, through the constitution of 1919 and the act on religious freedom of 1922 the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] became a [[national church]] of Finland (along with the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]], which however did not get a constitutional position).

==Archbishop of Turku==
The bishopric of Turku was elevated to an archbishopric in 1817, and since then the Ordinary has held the full official title of Archbishop of Turku and Finland. There has been a continuous [[List of bishops of Turku|succession of archbishops]] since that time. Since the retirement of Archbishop Jukka Paarma in 2010, [[Kari Mäkinen]] has been the incumbent Archbishop of Turku and Finland. He previously served in the archdiocese as the Bishop of Turku.

==Bishop of Turku==
Since 1998, the Diocese of Turku has had a bishop in addition to the Archbishop. The Bishop of Turku is responsible for the oversight of all the parishes of the diocese except for those in the deaneries of Turku and Naantali, which are led by the Archbishop. This arrangement allows the Archbishop to take a leading role on the national and international stages.

The '''Battle of Muktsar''' or '''Battle of Khidrāne Dee Dhāb''' took place on 29 December 1705,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vZFBp89UInUC&amp;pg=PA855&amp;lpg=PA855&amp;dq=when+was+battle+of+muktsar+bhatt+vahi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BuuE3VYf4A&amp;sig=kaUHUE-y6896nsqusrd5YSeANPk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_9u3VN3VJqKL7AaZmoDABw&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=december&amp;f=false History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1606-1708 C.E Surjit Singh Gandhi]&lt;/ref&gt; (29 [[Poh]]) following the siege of [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]].

They arrived in the village of [[Jhabal]] where a Sikh woman named [[Mai Bhago]], upon hearing their tale of desertion, motivated them into returning to Guru Ji at Anandpur Sahib.

{{History of Gujarat}}
The '''Chavda''' ([[IAST]]:Chávaḍá), also spelled '''Chawda''' or '''Chavada''',  dynasty ruled region of modern-day northern [[Gujarat]] in India, from c. 690 to 942. Variants of the name for the dynasty include '''Chapa''', '''Chahuda''', '''Chávoṭakas''' and '''Chāpoṭkata'''.

During the seventh century, [[Panchasar]] was the capital of Chavda ruler Jayaśekhara. In c. 697, Panchasar was attacked and Jayaśekhara was killed. His wife had fled and she gave birth to [[Vanraja Chavda|Vanraja]], the founder (746 or 765) of [[Anhilwad Patan|Aṇahilaváḍa]] and most prominent ruler of dynasty. According to ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'', he ruled for 60 years. He was succeeded by Yogaraja (ruled 35 years), followed by Kshemraja (25 years), Bhuyada (29 years), Virsimha (25 years) and Ratnaditya (15 years). Ratnaditya was succeeded by Samantsimha (also known as Chuyadadeva) who ruled seven years. Samantsimha did not have any children so he adopted his nephew [[Mularaja]] who overthrew him in 942 and established the [[Chaulukya dynasty]].

==Sources of information==
The chief sources of information regarding the Chavda rule are the opening chapters of the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' and ''Vicháraśreṇi'', ''Sukṛitasankírtana'', and ''Ratnamálá''. All of these works are written during rule of [[Chaulukya dynasty]], successors of Chavdas. The ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' and ''Vicháraśreṇi'' were written by [[Merutunga]]. The ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' is a short historical compilation; the ''Vicháraśreṇi'', though a mere list of kings, is more reliable. Kṛishṇabhaṭṭa's ''Ratnamálá'' is a poetic history with good descriptions and many fables taken from the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi''. Arisiṇha's ''Sukṛitasankírtana'' is a short work largely borrowed from the ''Vicháraśreṇi''.&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP"&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[James Macnabb Campbell]]|title=History of Gujarát|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54652/54652-h/54652-h.htm|series=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|volume=Volume I.

The reference to them was found in a Navsari copperplate of [[Chalukya]] governor of [[Lata (region)|Lata region]] (modern-day South Gujarat) [[Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin]] dated 738-39 CE which enlisted the dynasties defeated by Arabs (''Tajika'') and finally repelled by him. In it, Chávoṭaka is mentioned after Kachchela and [[Saindhava]]s.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979"/&gt;

Dharanivaraha's Haddala grant dated Shaka 836 (914 CE) mentions himself as Chapas of Vardhamana (now [[Wadhwan]]). Dharanivaraha was subordinate of [[Mahipala I|Mahipala]] of [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] (of Kanauj). The grant was issued to Acharya of Amardaka Santana of Vimkala village ([[Shaiva]] sect). It also mentions his ancestors; Vikramarka, Addaka, Pulakeshin, Dhruvabhata followed by himself.&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2Tnh2QjGhMQC|title=History of Kanauj: To the Moslem Conquest|last=Tripathi|first=Rama S.|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=|isbn=9788120804043|location=|pages=266|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a common practice at that time to associate one's origin with Puranic or mythological traditions.&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979"/&gt;

== History ==
===Early history===
A small Chávaḍá chiefship centred at [[Panchasar|Pañchásar]] (now a village in [[Patan district]], Gujarat) in the 7th century. The Navsari copperplate prove the early existence of the domain. They were probably feudatory of rulers of Bhinmal.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Jayaśekhara===
The author of the ''Ratnamálá'' ({{circa|1230 CE}}) says that in 696 CE ([[Samvat]] 752) Jayaśekhara, the Chavda king of Pañchásar was attacked by the Chaulukya king Bhuvaḍa of Kalyánakaṭaka in Kanyákubja (probably [[Kanauj]]) and slain by Bhuvaḍa in battle. Before his death Jayaśekhara, he sent his pregnant wife Rupasundarí to the forest in charge of her brother Surapála, one of his chief warriors. After Jayaśekhara's death, Rupasundarí gave birth to a son named Vanarája.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. V. Vaidya|title=History of Medieval Hindu India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xT5nAAAACAAJ|volume=II|year=1924|publisher=Oriental Books-Supplying Agency|isbn=978-0-89684-146-8|pages=114–116|chapter=Chapter V. The Chavdas of Anhilwad Patan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The truthfulness of the tradition is doubtful. In the seventh century, not Chaulukyas but [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] kings flourished in Kanauj. No place of importance called Kalyánakaṭaka is recorded in the Kanauj territory. The [[Chalukyas of Kalyani|Western Chalukya]] kingdom with its capital at Kalyán was only established about the middle of the eleventh century. The [[Chalukyas of Vemulavada]] lists contain no king named Bhuvaḍa, unless he be the great Chálukya king Vijayáditya also called Bhuvanásraya, who warred in the north and was there imprisoned but made his escape. The ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' and other old records do not mention of an invasion from Kanauj.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt; The attack may be carried out by Gurjara-Pratihara&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cort |first=John E. |authorlink=John E.

===Vanraja===
{{main|Vanraja Chavda}}
[[Merutunga]], the author of the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'', tells a story that Rupasundarí was living in the forest swinging her son in a hammock, when a Jain monk named Śílaguṇasúri noticing as he passed royal marks on the boy bought him from his mother. The story adds that a nun named Víramatí brought up the boy whom the monks called Vanarája, literally "the forest king". When eight years old, the monk told Vanarája to protect his place of worship from rats. The boy's skill in shooting rats convinced the monk he was not fit to be a monk but was worthy of a kingdom. He therefore returned the boy to his mother. These details seem invented by the Jain writers themselves. No mention of any such story occurs in the ''Ratnamálá''.{{efn-ua|In the ''Satyapurakalpa'' of his ''Tírthákalpa'', Jinaprabhasúri tells an almost identical story of another king.}}&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

In the forests where Vanarája passed his youth lived his maternal uncle Surapála, one of Jayaśekhara's generals, who, after his sovereign's defeat and death, had become an outlaw. Vanarája grew up under Surapála's charge. The ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' records the following story of the origin of Vanarája's wealth. A Kanyákubja king married Maháṇaká, the daughter of a Gujarát king. To receive the proceeds of the marriage cess which the Gujarát king had levied from his subjects, a deputation or ''panchkúla'' came from Kanyákubja to Gujarát. The deputation made Vanarája their leader or ''sellabhrit'' to realize the proceeds of the cess. In six months Vanarája collected 24 ''lákhs'' of ''Páruttha drammas''{{efn-ua|This name often recurs in Jain works. These would seem to be Kshatrapa coins as Gadhaiya coins are simply called drammas.}} and 4000 horse, which the deputation took and started for Kanyákubja. Vanarája waylaid and killed them, secured the money and horses, and remained in hiding for a year. With the wealth thus acquired Vanarája enrolled an army and established his power assuming the title of king.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

Founding of Aṇahilaváḍa (now [[Patan, Gujarat]]), 746–765 CE, he fixed the site of a capital which afterwards rose to be the great city of Aṇahilapura. Vanarája is said to have asked a Bharváḍ or Shepherd named Aṇahila, son of Śákhadá to show him the best site. Aṇahila agreed on condition that the city should be called by his name. Aṇahila accordingly showed Vanarája the place. The city may have been called after some local chief since it was popularly known as Aṇahilaváḍa (Sanskrit:Aṇahilaváta) that is "the place of Aṇahila". In the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'', Merutuṇga gives 746 CE (S. 802) as the date of the installation of Vanarája, while in his ''Vicháraśreṇi'' the same author gives 765 CE (S. 821 Vaisakha Śukla 2) as the date of the foundation of the city. The discrepancy may be explained by taking 746 CE (S. 802) to refer to the date of Vanarája's getting money enough to fix the site of his capital, and 765 CE (S. 821) to refer to the date of his installation in the completed Aṇahilaváḍa.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

''Vicháraśreṇi'' gives 765 (S. 821) seems the more probable date for the installation as the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' says that Vanarája got himself installed at Aṇahilapura when he was about fifty.{{efn-ua|The text is “Pañcháśatavarshadesyaḥ.”}} This accords with the date fixed on other grounds. Placing Vanarája's birth at about 720 CE would make him 44 in 765 CE (S. 821) corresponding to date mentioned in the ''Vicháraśreṇi''. Merutuṇga in both his works gives the length of Vanarája's life at 109 and of his reign at sixty years. The figure 60 seems to mark the length of his life and not of his reign. So long a reign as sixty years is barely possible for a sovereign who succeeded late in life, and the 109 years of his life can hardly be correct. Taking Vanarája's age at 45 when he was installed in 765 CE (S. 821) and allowing fifteen years more to complete the sixty years, he probably died circa 780 (S. 836), the closing year of his reign.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

It is unclear that he had a war with Arab or not as mentioned in Navsari copperplate (739 CE).&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979"/&gt;

====Successors====
The lists of Vanarája's successors vary so greatly in the names, in the order of succession, and in the lengths of reigns, that little trust can be placed in them. The first three agree in giving a duration of 196 years to the Chávaḍá dynasty after the accession of Vanarája. The accession of the Chaulukya dyansty founder [[Mularaja]] is given in the ''Vicháraśreṇi'' at Saṃvat 1017 and in the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' at Saṃvat 998 corresponding with the original difference of nineteen years (S. 802 and 821) in the founding of the city. This shows that though the total duration of the dynasty was traditionally known to be 196 years the order of succession was not known and guesses were made as to the duration of the different reigns. Certain dates fixed by inscriptions or otherwise known to some compilers and not known to others caused many discrepancies in the various accounts.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Yogaraja===
According to the calculations given above Vanarája's reign lasted to about CE 780. Authorities agree that Vanarája was succeeded by his son Yogarája. The length of Yogarája's reign is given as thirty-five years by the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' and the ''Ratnamálá'', and as twenty-nine by the ''Vicháraśreṇi''. That is according to the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' and ''Ratnamálá'' his reign closes in CE 841 (S. 897) and according to the ''Vicháraśreṇi'' in CE 836 (S. 891). On the whole the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' date CE 841 (S. 897) seems the more probable. The author of the ''Vicháraśreṇi'' may have mistaken the 7 of the manuscripts for a 1, the two figures in the manuscripts of that date being closely alike. If CE 780 is taken as the close of Vanarája's reign and CE 806 as the beginning of Yogarája's reign an interval of twenty-six years is left. This blank, which perhaps accounts for the improbably long reign and life assigned to Vanarája, may have been filled by the forgotten reign of a childless elder brother of Yogarája.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

Of Yogarája the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' tells the following tale. Kshemarája, one of Yogarája's three sons, reported that several ships were storm-stayed at [[Prabhas Patan|Prabhása or Somanátha]]. The ships had 10,000 horses, many elephants, and millions of money and treasure. Kshemarája prayed that he might seize the treasure. Yogarája forbade him. In spite of their father's orders the sons seized the treasure and brought it to the king. Yogarája said nothing. And when the people asked him why he was silent he answered: "To say I approve would be a sin; to say I do not approve would annoy you. Hitherto on account of an ancestor’s misdeeds we have been laughed at as a nation of thieves. Our name was improving and we were rising to the rank of true kings. This act of my sons has renewed the old stain. Yogarája would not be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre".&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Kshemarája===
According to the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' in CE 841 (S. 898) Yogarája was succeeded by his son Kshemarája. The ''Vicháraśreṇi'' says that Yogarája was succeeded by Ratnáditya who reigned three years, and he by Vairisiṃha who reigned eleven years. Then came Kshemarája who is mentioned as the son of Yogarája and as coming to the throne in CE 849 (S. 905). The relationship of Yogarája to Ratnáditya and Vairisiṃha is not given. Probably both were sons of Yogarája as the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' mentions that Yogarája had three sons. The duration of Kshemarája's reign is given as thirty-nine years. It is probable that the reigns of the three brothers lasted altogether for thirty-nine years, fourteen years for the two elder brothers and twenty-five years for Kshemarája the period mentioned by the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi''. Accepting this chronology CE 880 (S. 936) will be the date of the close of Kshemarája's reign.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Chámuṇḍa===
According to the Vicháraśreṇi and the Sukṛitasankírtana Kshemarája was succeeded by his son Chámuṇḍa. Instead of Chámuṇḍa the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' mentions Bhúyada perhaps another name of Chámuṇḍa, as in the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' the name Chámuṇḍa does not occur. The ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' notes that Bhúyada reigned twenty-nine years and built in Aṇahilaváḍa Patan the temple of Bhúyadeshvar. The ''Vicháraśreṇi'' gives twenty-seven years as the length of Chámuṇḍa's reign an insignificant difference of two years. This gives CE 908 (S. 964) as the close of Chámuṇḍa's reign according to the ''Vicháraśreṇi''.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Ghaghaḍa===
After Bhúyada the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' places Vairisiṃha and Ratnáditya assigning twenty-five and fifteen years as the reigns of each. The ''Vicháraśreṇi'' mentions as the successor of Chámuṇḍa his son Ghaghaḍa who is called Ráhaḍa in the ''Sukṛitasankírtana''. Instead of Ghaghaḍa the ''Prabandhachintámaṇi'' gives Sámantasiṃha perhaps a title of Ghághaḍa's. The ''Vicháraśreṇi'' gives Ghaghaḍa a reign of twenty-seven years and mentions as his successor an unnamed son who reigned nineteen years. The ''Sukṛitasankírtana'' gives the name of this son as Bhúbhaṭa. According to these calculations the close of Ghághaḍa's reign would be CE 936 (Saṃvat 965 + 27 = 992). Adding nineteen years for Bhúbhaṭa's reign brings the date of the end of the dynasty to CE 956 (Saṃvat 993 + 19 = 1012) that is five years earlier than S. 1017 the date given by the ''Vicháraśreṇi''. Until some evidence to the contrary is shown Merutuṇga's date CE 961 (S. 821 + 196 = 1017) may be taken as correct.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

Ratnaditya was succeeded by Samantsimha (also known as Chuyadadeva) who ruled seven years. Samantsinh Chavda did not have any children so he adopted his nephew [[Mularaja]] who overthrew him c. 942 and established the [[Chaulukya dynasty]].&lt;ref name=GB&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUBAAAAYAAJ|year=1880|publisher=Government Central Press| pages=131, 345}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sailendra Nath Sen|title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA343|date=1 January 1999|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1198-0|pages=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gir Forest and the Saga of the Asiatic Lion  By Sudipta Mitra|year=2005|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0rME6RjC1sC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activities==
===Temples===
[[File:Ruins of Punvareshwar Mahadev temple at Manjal, Kutch, Gujarat.jpg|thumb|Ruined Shiva temple at Puaranogadh at [[Manjal]], Kutch]]
The [[Merutunga]]'s ''Prabandhachintamani'' states about Vanrajavihara temple at Anahilapathaka (now [[Patan, Gujarat]]) as well as the construction of Kanteshwari-prasada by Vanraja. Kanteshwari was the petron goddess of later [[Chaulukya]] kings too. [[Kumarapala (Chaulukya dynasty)|Kumarapala]] has prohibited the animal sacrifice at this temple later. The ''Prabandhachintamani'' mentions the construction of the temple of Bhattaraka Shri Yogishwari by Yogaraja at Patan in early 9th century. The ''Prabandhachintamani'' also mentions the construction of Bhuyadeshwara temple built by Bhuyada at Patan in last quarter of the 9th century. According to Haribhadra Suri (middle of 12th century), Minister Nihhaya's son Lahara had built the temple of [[Vindhyavasini]] (Laharadhanuhavi) at Sander in [[Patan district]]. He had also founded Narangpura town and built a [[Parshwanatha]] temple for merit of his mother. In later half of 9th century, king Yashobhadra had built a Jain temple at Dinduanapura, which is mentioned in ''Purnagaccha-pattavali''. According to an inscription on a bronze, king Raghusena had built Raghusena-vihara at Ramasaiyanpura in 928 CE.&lt;ref name="Dhaky1961"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Madhusudan A.|last=Dhaky|author-link=Madhusudan Dhaky|date=|year=1961|editor-last=Deva|editor-first=Krishna|title=The Chronology of the Solanki Temples of Gujarat|url=http://vmis.in/Resources/digital_publication_popup?id=136#page/44|journal=Journal of the Madhya Pradesh Itihas Parishad|publisher=Madhya Pradesh Itihas Parishad|publication-place=[[Bhopal]]|volume=3|pages=3–7, 70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The extant temples this period (Early Nagara Phase) include the [[Roda Group of Temples]], Lakodra in Vijapur Taluka, old temple at [[Thangadh]], [[Ranakadevi|Ranakdevi]] Temple at [[Wadhwan]], the Sun Temple at [[Kanthkot]], Shiva temple at Puaranogadh at [[Manjal]] in [[Kutch]]. Harishchandra-ni-Chori at [[Shamlaji]], older [[Bhadreshwar Jain Temple]] (rebuilt now) and the Temple III of [[Roda Group of Temples]] are some other extant temples of the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="Dhaky1961"/&gt;

==Related dynasties and descendants==
Based on Dharanivaraha's grant, it is known that in 914 CE, he, a Chapa or Chavda king, was ruling at Vardhamana (now [[Wadhwan]]) as a fuedatory of Gurjara-Pratiharya [[Mahipala Pratihara|Mahipaladeva]]. It also mentions his ancestors; Vikramarka, Addaka, Pulakeshin, Dhruvabhata followed by Dharanivaraha.&lt;ref name="Vaidya1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.31980|title=Appendix To Epigraphia Indica And Record Of The Archaeological Survey of India|last=Bhandarkar|first=D.

Circa 942, one of queens of  Sámantasiṃha fled with her year-old child to his father's house in [[Jaisalmer]]. This son Ahipata became a formidable outlaw and he was used to ravage dominions of Anahilawada. He conquered more than 900 villages in [[Kutch]] and established Morgadh as its capital. He reigned for many years and was succeeded by his son Vikramsi. The lineage of succession was Vibhuraja, Takulji, Seshkaranji, Vaghji, Akheraja, Tejasi, Karamsinha, Takhansinha, Mokasinha, Punjaji. Punjaji lived in the reign of [[Alauddin Khalji]] around the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt;

During the [[British Raj]], the small [[Varsoda State|Varsoda]] and [[Mansa State|Mansa]] [[princely state]]s under the [[Mahi Kantha Agency]] (now in Gujarat) remained ruled by the claimed descendants of the Chavda dynasty until [[independence of India]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="(India)1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gujarat (India)|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Mehsana District|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycbAAAAIAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Leopold Cohn, a Hungarian immigrant to the United States who became a Jewish believer in Jesus, and founded the Brownsville Mission to the Jews in 1894.  The Brownsville Mission was later relocated to the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] section of Brooklyn, New York and became the Williamsburg Mission to the Jews from 1897 until 1924. In 1897, the Williamsburg Mission headquarters housed a medical clinic, boys' club, Girl Scouts, and sewing and English classes, in addition to evening Gospel services. &lt;ref name=Ariel2000p32&gt;{{cite book

In 1896 the mission opened a second branch, also in Brooklyn, and moved its headquarters to Williamsburg, and changed its name in 1897 to the Williamsburg Mission to the Jews.  Its new headquarters was much larger and included, among other things, a medical clinic that offered needy Jews free medical services.  Contrary to a prevailing myth, Jews did not boycott missions, and the physicians working at the clinic were nonconverted Jews who worked for pay.  Like the patients who patronized the clinic, they did not consider the mission to be a danger.  The mission's program included "Gospel services" on Sunday and Monday nights and sewing and English classes on other nights.  The establishment of a boys' club and a Girl Scout troop indicated a growing attempt to evanglize youth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Chosen People Ministries attracted attention when it acquired a former funeral home in the heart of an Orthodox Jewish community located in [[Midwood, Brooklyn]]. This acquisition has sparked anger from the Jewish community in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Jewish leaders angry over Chosen People Ministries' Messianic outpost." (October 11, 2010).[[New York Daily News]][http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/10/11/2010-10-11_an_unorthodox_ministry_jewish_leaders_angry_over_messianic_outpost.html#ixzz12AaL3jGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center opened in 2014 and currently houses an English-speaking congregation, a Russian-speaking congregation, and an accredited seminary program.

{{notable|date=October 2018}}
The '''Christian Business Faculty Association''' ('''CBFA''') is an organization created in the United States in the 1990s to further [[Christian education]] in colleges and universities. As of 2009 the organization had a total of 400 Christian business faculty members currently employed at colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The CBFA holds an annual conference that brings Christian business faculty together from the USA and around the globe. The CBFA provides opportunities for college students and faculty to be able to travel overseas and study abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | last = Christian Business Faculty Association
 | first =
 | url = http://cbfa.org/html/international_opportunities.html
 | accessdate = 2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBFA is led by an eleven-member board.  Seven of the board positions are elected by the membership.  Each year two new members of the board are elected at the annual conference for a three-year term.  After his or her first year on the board, one of those individuals is chosen to become the vice-chair/ chair-elect of the board; that person then becomes the chair of the board, and then serves an additional year as the immediate past chair.  The year in which each board member’s term ends is given in parentheses.

Four board positions are appointed by the elected members of the board:  the secretary, the treasurer, the senior editor, and the program chair

==History==
The association began in April, 1980 when the leaders of the American Studies Program and the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (then known as the Christian College Coalition) organized a meeting of 12-15 business professors from member schools in Washington, D.C. 
The group kept growing every year. Over 40 professors attended the year after in Washington, D.C. Also Regional conferences started at several member schools in 1982 and 1983. In 1984 over 70 faculty attended a convention at  [[Seattle Pacific University]] on business ethics sponsored by the CCCU with a grant from the Murdock Foundation. The convention created friendships and interest that pushed the professors to have more meetings. In 1987, the association appointed a steering committee with regional representatives  that decided to increments services to the membership, and the creation of a regular newsletter.

==Mission, Vision, Values==
The stated mission of the Christian Business Faculty Association is "We empower Christian business faculty to transform the world for the glory of God."
{{peacock|date=October 2018}}
The CBFA's vision consists of three goals: "The Christian Business Faculty Association strives to be an organization recognized:
*For its commitment to Christ as the focus of all its activities,
*For its leadership in faith-business integration, related scholarship; and
*As a community of support for Christians devoted to teaching business."

Additionally, the CBFA has a list of values they adhere to: "The Christian Business Faculty Association operates according to the guiding values:
* Biblical - We are committed to God's Word. We are faithful.
* Relational - We are eager to connect with and energize others. We are community.
* Scholarly - We are compelled to explore and teach about God's world. We are intellectually curious. 
* Ecumenical - We embrace diversity within the body of Christ. We are welcoming. 
* Edifying - We invest in others to make them better. We are encouraging."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15541">'''Christian humanitarian aid''' is work performed by Christian non-governmental organizations [[Non-governmental organization|(NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) to alleviate the suffering of people around the world. [[Charity (practice)|Charity]] is a concept of great importance in [[Christianity]]. Humanitarian aid occurs in areas where some [[Christian Church|churches]] choose to invest time and money in the spirit of [[compassion]].

== Origins ==
The modern concept of Christian humanitarian aid is based on teachings from the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Buckley, Ryan Dobson, ''Humanitarian Jesus: Social Justice and the Cross'', Moody Publishers, USA, 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Charity (practice)|Charity]] and providing assistance to the poor are concepts established in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Loewenberg, ''From Charity To Social Justice'', Transaction Publishers, USA, 2001, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], part of one's [[tithe]] was devoted to the needy ([[orphan]]s, [[widows]], [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]). In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] taught much about the subject of charity. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]], he called for people to help not only friends but also enemies,&lt;ref&gt;Luke 6:35&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those rejected by society, such as people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 14:14&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], he described the medical care paid by a [[Samaritan]] to a [[Jews|Jew]] (both peoples were enemies), as a model of love for his neighbor. &lt;ref&gt; Brian D. Lepard, ''Rethinking Humanitarian Intervention: A Fresh Legal Approach Based on Fundamental Ethical Principles in International Law and World Religions'', Penn State Press, USA, 2010, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; CHESTER, Tim, La responsabilité du chrétien face à la pauvreté, Marne-la-Vallée, Farel, 2006, p.19-20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]] has also raised funds for the underprivileged. &lt;ref&gt; Michael Barnett, Janice Gross Stein, ''Sacred Aid: Faith and Humanitarianism'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2012, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating back as early as the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic]] [[monasteries]] and [[monastic orders]] have a long tradition of providing charity, asylum, and assistance to the poor.&lt;ref name="Ferris"&gt;E. Ferris, [https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_858_ferris.pdf Faith-based and secular humanitarian organizations], ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 87, 858 (2005), pages 311-325&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant churches]] established the Department of [[Deacon]]s responsible for helping the poor. Missionary societies of the 18th and 19th centuries often offered humanitarian assistance in addition to their main activity of [[evangelism]].&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;

In the 19th century, the first Christian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) began emerging. [[YMCA]], a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] NGO, was created in 1844 in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Infobase Publishing, USA, 2005, p.  591&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caritas Internationalis|Caritas]], a Catholic NGO, was founded in [[Cologne]] in 1897. &lt;ref&gt; Yves Beigbeder, ''The Role and Statuts of International Humanitarian Volunteers and Organizations: The Right and Duty to Humanitarian Assistance'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Belgium, 1991, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The entrepreneurial culture of [[Evangelical]] churches also led to their creation of multiple NGOs. 
&lt;ref name="Fayner"&gt;E. Fayner, [http://temoignagechretien.fr/articles/international/world-vision-long-la-plus-riche-au-monde World Vision:l'ONG la plus riche au monde], ''Témoignage chrétien'', October 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the humanitarian movement, Christian NGOs attracted more attention in the 1970s. Some Christian NGOs, such as those run by evangelical doctors providing medical assistance in impoverished countries, are recognized for their contributions to development. &lt;ref&gt;Voir, par exemple, [http://www.christianismeaujourdhui.info/articles.php/la-suisse-reconnait-l-apport-des-ong-chretiennes-5896.html La Suisse reconnaît l'apport des ONG chrétiennes], christianismeaujourdhui.info, Switzerland, August 22 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister's Office, [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/churches-network-wins-big-society-award Churches network wins Big Society Award], UK, 3 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Kristof, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-a-little-respect-for-dr-foster.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1 A Little respect for Dr. Foster], The New York Times, USA, March 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and Benefits ==
There is no universal definition of these organizations. A Christian humanitarian NGO has at least one of the following traits:&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt; 
* Affiliation with a Christian religious organization
* Explicit references to a Christian religion in its statutes
* Financial support from a Christian religious organization
* Selection of its Board of Directors or teams based on Christian principles or religious affiliation
* Decision-making based on Christian religious principles

Affiliation with local Christian churches across the world often make it possible for Christian NGOs to work in countries or regions that are otherwise difficult for governmental or international organizations to access. The international network of many Christian religions allows their NGOs to gather significant funding and publicity to promote their humanitarian actions across the world.&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;

== Humanitarian staff ==
In some Christian NGOs, the staff is not only Christian. &lt;ref&gt; Michael Barnett, Janice Gross Stein, ''Sacred Aid: Faith and Humanitarianism'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2012, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, common spiritual values are a common feature among Christian NGO employees and volunteers. &lt;ref&gt; Michael Barnett, Janice Gross Stein, ''Sacred Aid: Faith and Humanitarianism'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2012, p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christian aid workers, their commitment is motivated by spiritual values of [[compassion]] and [[mercy]]. &lt;ref&gt; Frederick Klaits, ''The Request and the Gift in Religious and Humanitarian Endeavors'', Springer, USA, 2017, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Brian Steensland, Philip Goff, ''The New Evangelical Social Engagement'', Oxford University Press USA, USA, 2014, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Michael Barnett, Janice Gross Stein, ''Sacred Aid: Faith and Humanitarianism'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2012, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;In some NGOs, such as [[Mercy Ships]], all employees are volunteers and have to pay for accommodation and food, as well as work for free. &lt;ref&gt; RTS, [http://www.rts.ch/info/monde/6500352-le-navire-hopital-d-une-ong-suisse-offre-des-soins-a-madagascar.html#timeline-anchor-Historique Le navire-hôpital d'une ONG suisse offre des soins à Madagascar], rts.ch, Swiss, February 01, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention policies ==
The majority of Christian NGOs help everyone, regardless of religion. &lt;ref&gt; E. Ferris, "[https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_858_ferris.pdf Faith-based and secular humanitarian organizations]", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' 87, 858 (2005), p.317&lt;/ref&gt;With the growth of secularization in some countries, some Christian NGOs have downplayed their religious identity. &lt;ref&gt; Stanley D. Brunn, ''The Changing World Religion Map: Sacred Places, Identities, Practices and Politics'', Springer, USA, 2015, p. 3118&lt;/ref&gt; In some NGOs this depends on the cultural context of the national antenna. &lt;ref&gt; THOMAS J DAVIS, ''Religion in Philanthropic Organizations: Family, Friend, Foe?'', Indiana University Press, USA, 2013, p. XVIII&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marie Lefebvre-Billiez, contrary to certain clichés, many [[Evangelical]] NGOs do not mix [[humanitarian]] and [[evangelization]]. &lt;ref&gt; Verna, G., [https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/as/2007-v31-n2-as2394/018681ar/resume/ Le comportement des ONG engagées dans l’aide humanitaire : Selon leur culture d’origine et les pressions politiques subies], Revue Anthropologie et Sociétés, Volume 31, Numéro 2, Université Laval, Canada, 2007, p. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;But on the other hand, some evangelical NGOs can not provide help without accompanying evangelization. The diversity of evangelical movements makes both scenarios possible. In some parts of the world, as on the [[African continent]], local culture places a great deal of importance on spiritual things, which makes it difficult for some people to understand or accept the work of Humanitarian NGOs that do not display their religious identity.

== Results and budgets ==
In 2007, Christian NGOs comprised 57.4% of the NGOs affiliated with the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Duriez, François Mabille, Kathy Rousselet, ''Les ONG confessionnelles: Religions et action internationale'', Editions L'Harmattan, France, 2007, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British study by Elizabeth Ferris, published in 2005 in the periodical ''International Review of the Red Cross", Christian NGOs have large budgets and provide considerable financial support worldwide.&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt; This same study gives the following figures:

* NGOs related to the [[World Council of Churches]] and those of the group of [[Caritas Internationalis]] spend over a billion dollars a year in aid and development.
* The [[Lutheran World Federation]] has a budget of $73 million for aid and development.
* According to a 1953 study, religious NGOs gave 90% of the assistance provided after [[World War II]].
* According to William Headley of ([[Catholic Relief Services]]), 1/3 of the persons living with  [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome|AIDS]] in the world are treated with the help of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]].
According to Sébastien Fath,&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Fath, ''Dieu XXL, la révolution des mégachurches'', Édition Autrement, France, 2008, p. 42, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical churches and their respective NGOs develop an international humanitarian entrepreneurship that influences policy decisions. Therefore, they are unavoidable geopolitical players in the humanitarian field.

==International Catholic Organizations==
Among the most important International [[Catholicism | Catholic]] [[Humanitarian]]  [[Non-Governmental Organization | NGOs]], there are [[Caritas Internationalis]] and [[Emmaus (charity)|Emmaus International]]. &lt;ref&gt; Stanley D.

== Problems and critics ==
* Conflicts of collaboration have occurred between Catholic [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and non-confessional NGOs in the fight against [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome|AIDS]], mainly because of different views on the use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Ferrari, "[http://soundideas.pugetsound.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1773&amp;context=faculty_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D140%26q%3D%2522christian%2BNGO%2522%2Bcriticism%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5#search=%22christian%20NGO%20criticism%22 Catholic and Non-Catholic NGOs Fighting HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa: Issue Framing and Collaboration]", ''International Relations'' 25(1) (2011), pages 85-107&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Bangladesh]], some Christian NGOs are criticized for their activity of [[evangelism]]. According to the [[sociologist]] Geoffrey Martin, there is no overall policy, but some employees of Christian NGOs distribute bibles to the people they assist.&lt;ref name = "Fayner"/&gt; [[Evangelical]] aid has been criticized by more traditional Christian NGOs because they have not separated [[evangelism]] and humanitarian aid, which could affect all Christian humanitarian NGOs.&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;

* In areas of armed conflict, some Christian NGOs have been criticized for not respecting the principle of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].&lt;ref name="Ferris"/&gt;
* Some have criticized the actions of [[Mother Teresa]] as "an imperialist enterprise of the Catholic Church, against an Eastern population, in an oriental city" and a "cult of suffering" little concerned about hygiene .&lt;ref&gt;K.

'''Cornerstone Community'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornerstone.edu.au|title=Home :: Cornerstone Community|website=www.cornerstone.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian non-denominational evangelical Christian training and mission movement. 

Founded in 1978, Cornerstone used to operate from several training campuses in regional Australia and attempted to support a network of what it described as ‘mission teams’, mainly in Victoria and NSW. 

Cornerstone includes a broad cross section of individuals from all walks of life and works alongside churches, schools, Universities and Christian ministries both within Australia and internationally. 

Students spend the first year of the two-year course engaged in a program of study, work, community living and mission within one of the remaining Cornerstone centers. The subsequent year (or years) is spent as part of a smaller self-supporting mission team within small Australian towns. 

Students work alongside churches within neighborhoods, schools, universities, youth groups and sporting clubs to serve the community and build bridges with those not connected with the traditional church. 

Cornerstone is a non-profit organisation, and used to operate several businesses to finance its training centers and mission teams.

== History ==


Cornerstone Community was founded on a cotton farm in Outback Australia in 1978 by two friends who shared a passion to make practical sense of Jesus and his teaching.

[[Laurie McIntosh]], a civil engineer, anthropologist, professional thumb wrestler and theologian, developed the idea for a [[self-sufficient]] 'mission-minded' community of [[Christians]] while working with Campus Crusade on universities in England and Australia.

Together with history teacher Paul Roe and with the financial support of local farmers Jack Buster and Owen Boone, they founded the first Cornerstone Community west of [[Bourke, New South Wales]].

The first intake of students arrived in 1978 and divided their time between farm work and study. 

Early facilities included a ramshackle collection of farm buildings, caravans and sheds and students and staff lived in close quarters. Lectures occasionally took place outside under the shade of a tree to escape the harsh Bourke summer. 

From these humble beginnings Cornerstone has at various times maintained centres in Bourke, [[Broken Hill]] and [[Canowindra]] in New South Wales, [[Emerald, Queensland|Emerald]] and [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] in Queensland and [[Swan Hill]] in Victoria. Cornerstone mission teams have worked in many Australian towns and cities in most states. 

Cornerstone remains a small, [[non-denominational]], community-based fellowship focused on [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] and training.

They are officially described as an Australian 'Christian Mission Order'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-archive.biblesociety.org.au/news/cornerstone-co-founder-jack-buster-remembered-spontaneous-radical-generosity|title=Cornerstone co-founder Jack Buster remembered for his “spontaneous radical generosity”|date=4 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cornerstone's Director of Mission, Peter Volkofsky, published a book called "Beautiful Quest". It tells small stories about different aspects of Cornerstone life, such as training at one of the first year campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Volkofsky |first=Peter |date=2015 |title=Beautiful Quest |url=http://arkhousepress.com/beautiful-quest.html |publisher=Arkhouse Press |isbn=9780994194183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==

Cornerstone Community used to operate Training Centres, which were described as [[intentional communities]] similar to the Israeli [[kibbutz]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Leffman, David; Dehne, Anne, Scott, Chris; Daly, Margo. ''The Rough Guide to Australia 6.'' Page 365. London: Rough Guides Ltd, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These Centres used to be based in [[Broken Hill]], [[Canowindra]], [[Dubbo]] and [[Swan Hill]], but are now either sold or functionally vacant. They also have an overseas Training Centre in [[Ghana]] which is operated by one of their graduates named Kwadwo. [https://www.facebook.com/kwadwo.oduro.9]

Cornerstone’s courses were allegedly designed to extend beyond an academic understanding of [[theology]],(including [[ethics]], [[apologetics]], [[Christian history]] and [[discipleship]])and students are encouraged to develop a practical understanding of how their faith impacts everyday life.

Mentors were assigned to students to assist in their course and personal discipleship, integrating Biblical studies with modern scholarship, personal experience and awareness of current issues. 

Cornerstone suggest their emphasis is on training the [[laity]] in relevant and life-style based mission.  Critics suggest they are insular and anti-church.

== Community ==

Cornerstone Community maintains that their community lifestyle is not an attempt to retreat from the realities of modern life, but to help men and women discover life (as [[Jesus]] put it) "in all its fullness" right in the middle of common things and daily experience.

Graduates come from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life. Over the years, cornerstone has attracted everyone from doctors to builders with Australian children's entertainer and Christian musician [[Colin Buchanan (entertainer)|Colin Buchanan]] their most famous graduate. 

Cornerstone's website used to host a discussion forum called "Cornerstone Interactive".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905191037/http://interact.cornerstone.edu.au/]&lt;/ref&gt; This sub-domain of the cornerstone website contains a 'news' page where articles are posted for discussion and 'forums' section where discussion topics are open. 
Membership to 'Interactive' is open (public) and free (no charge). It was discontinued around 2012 through looking at the Wayback Machine &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive.org or Wayback Machine|url=http://cachedpages.net/|website=cachedpages.net/|accessdate=2 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111153101/http://cachedpages.net/|archive-date=2014-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Businesses ==

Cornerstone once operated a variety of commercial enterprises.

Rather than pay tuition fees students were forced to work in these Cornerstone owned businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/08/1060145865876.html | title = How they fell for Mr Foo | date = August 9, 2003 | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most community members were expected to work without pay at least part-time while in Cornerstone by the Cornerstone leadership.  

Cornerstone Community has at times drawn fire from competitors who claim that they have an unfair advantage in that they do not need to pay wages or Company Tax on their business activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/more/|title=Page not Found|date=19 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/03/1017206222042.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Non-profit groups keep $11bn from Tax Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This issue gained particular prominence in 2002 when one of Cornerstone’s businesses, “''Turf the Lot''”, became involved in the so-called “turf wars” in [[Canberra]]. This drew the attention of the [[Australian Taxation Office]] who examined Cornerstone’s business affairs.

'''David Bowen''' (11 December 1774 – 18 November 1853) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister. He was born in [[Felinfoel]], [[Carmarthenshire]]. In 1797 he was baptised at the local church; he began preaching at that same church in 1798. In 1806 he was ordained by Titus Lewis and Joshua Watkins and was appointed as joint-minister with Daniel Davies. In 1831 the congregation of the newly formed [[Zion Baptist Chapel, Llanelli|Capel Seion]] in [[Llanelli]] chose him to be its pastor, a position he held until his death in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Bowen|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s3-BOWE-DAV-1774.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deva''' are a mythical people of [[Sri Lanka]] according to the [[Sanskrit epics]].
According to the [[Mahavamsa]] and [[Ramayana]] they lived among the [[Naga people of Sri Lanka|Naga]], [[Yakkha people of Sri Lanka|Yakkha]] and [[Raksha people of Sri Lanka|Raskha]]. 
They ousted their arch enemies the [[Raksha people of Sri Lanka|Raskha]] from Sri Lanka, with the help of [[Lord Vishnu]].
They were then subsequently conquered by King [[Ravana]] of the Raskha. After the Yakkhas had left to live in the mountains and remote dense forests, they met [[Gautama Buddha]] who converted them to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="tribe"&gt;W. L. Wijayawansa . (2009).

Colombo: Asian Educational Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mahavamsa]], [[Gautama Buddha]] met the Deva at [[Mahiyangana]].&lt;ref name="ama"/&gt; Buddha gave Sumana Saman (A leader of the Deva) a few hairs from his head, which were placed in a golden urn and enshrined in a sapphire stupa. A buddhist monk called Sarabhu is then said to have deposited Buddha's ashes in this Stupa. This stupa is now called the "Mahiyangana Stupa" and can be found in the [[Anuradhapura]] museum.&lt;ref&gt;Ven. S. Dhammika &amp; BuddhaNet/Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc. (2007).

==Migration==

During the ascension of the mythical Raksha demon King Ravana, some Deva people migrated to other places like present-day North Malabar of Kerala where they followed Buddhism before the advent of Brahminism.  Having their own complete social fabric and systems of precedence and worship, they dominated the area until their power was seriously undermined by the Brahmin lead power lobby.{{further explanation needed|date=April 2017}} However, they still survive in Malabar, and are known as "Thiyya", a localization of the name "Deyva" equivalent to Deva. The ancestor worship of Thiyyas springs from the fact that they consider themselves as descendants of "Deyva" or God. The ceremonial oracles, who represent the spirit of their ancestors of Lanka, in the temple are known as "Theyyam", originating from the word "Deyvam" meaning God. However, by the time of the arrival of Vijaya to Sri Lanka, a significant number of the Deva clan had intermingled with North Indians, Nagas and Yaksas, to create the Modern Sinhalese lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramayanaresearch.com/heladiva.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503033612/http://ramayanaresearch.com/heladiva.html |archivedate=3 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Justin Martyr.jpg|thumb|Justin Martyr]]
The '''''Dialogue with Trypho,''''' along with the First and Second Apologies, is a second-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] text, documenting the attempts by theologian [[Justin Martyr]] to show that Christianity is the new law for all men, and to prove from Scripture that Jesus is the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref name=Ron48&gt;''Reading the Old Testament with the Ancient Church: Exploring the Formation of Early Christian Thought''; by Ronald E. Heine (Sep 1, 2007) pages 48-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dialogue'' utilizes the literary device of an intellectual conversation between Justin and Trypho, a Jew. The concluding section propounds that the Christians are the true people of God.

==Identity of Trypho==
{{See also|Justin Martyr}}

The identity of Trypho as rabbi [[Tarfon]] (the Hebrew name Tarfon likely derived from Greek Trypho) has been proposed, but virtually all scholars mentioned in Setzer's 'Jewish Responses to Early Christians' do not accept the notion that Trypho is Tarfon.&lt;ref name=Claudia215&gt;''Jewish Responses to Early Christians''; by Claudia Setzer (Nov 1, 1994) {{ISBN|080062680X}} page 215&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars say that Trypho is a fictional character invented by Justin for his literary goals.&lt;ref name=Claudia215/&gt;&lt;ref name=Larry493&gt;''Exploring Jewish Literature of the Second Temple Period''; by Larry R. Helyer (Jul 5, 2002) {{ISBN|0830826785}} page 493&lt;/ref&gt; Setzer's book further claims that, whether a character on which Trypho was based existed or not, one can generally assume that Trypho's words are "largely put in his mouth by Justin".&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Responses to Early Christians''; by Claudia Setzer (Nov 1, 1994) {{ISBN|080062680X}} page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting and structure==
The setting is presented as a chance meeting between Justin and Trypho in [[Ephesus]]. Justin had just converted to Christianity from a philosophical background and Trypho had just fled the disturbances in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Ron48/&gt;

When Justin suggests to Trypho to convert to Christianity, the dialogue becomes animated. Trypho criticizes Christians on a number of grounds, and Justin provides answers to each criticism.&lt;ref name=Ron48/&gt;

In the opening of the "dialogue", Justin relates his vain search among the Stoics, [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, and [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]s for a satisfying knowledge of God; his finding in the ideas of [[Plato]] wings for his soul, by the aid of which he hoped to attain the contemplation of the God-head; and his meeting on the sea-shore with an aged man who told him that by no human endeavor but only by divine revelation could this blessedness be attained, that the prophets had conveyed this revelation to man, and that their words had been fulfilled. Of the truth of this he assured himself by his own investigation; and the daily life of the Christians and the courage of the martyrs convinced him that the charges against them were unfounded. So he sought to spread the knowledge of Christianity as the true philosophy.

In the ''Dialogue'', Justin also wrote, "For I choose to follow not men or men's doctrines, but God and the doctrines [delivered] by Him. For if you have fallen in with some who are called Christians, but who do not admit this [truth], and venture to blaspheme the God of [[Abraham]], and the God of [[Isaac]], and the God of [[Jacob]]; who say there is no resurrection of the dead, and that their souls, when they die, are taken to heaven; do not imagine that they are Christians." &lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/Dialogue with Trypho#Chapter 80|Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter 80]]&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is sometimes cited as evidence that the [[early church]] subscribed to the doctrine of [[soul sleep]], though some claim that Justin's emphasis is on saying that denial of the [[resurrection of the dead]] is what makes them non-Christian, especially considering that he claims that "even after death souls are in a state of sensation" in Chapter 18 of his ''First Apology''.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Christian Library/The First Apology of Justin Martyr#Chapter 18|First Apology, Chapter 18]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his critical edition (with French translation), Philippe Bobichon demonstrates the particular nature of this text, equally influenced by Greek and Rabbinic thought.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Bobichon (ed.), ''Justin Martyr, Dialogue avec Tryphon'', édition critique, introduction, texte grec, traduction, commentaires, appendices, indices, (Coll. Paradosis nos. 47, vol. I-II.) Editions Universitaires de Fribourg Suisse, (1125 pp.), 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
Because the text mentions Justin Martyr's ''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]]'', which was written sometime between 150-155 CE, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' must have been written after it.

==Authenticity==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The ''Dialogue with Trypho'' and the two ''Apologies'' is preserved only in the ''[[Sacra parallela]]''; but, besides that they were known by Tatian, Methodius, and Eusebius, their influence is traceable in [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Theophilus of Antioch]], the Pseudo-Melito, and especially Tertullian. Eusebius speaks of two ''Apologies'', but he quotes them both as one, which indeed they are in substance. The identity of authorship is backed up not only by the reference in chapter 120 of the ''Dialogue'' to the ''Apology,'' but by the unity of treatment. Zahn showed that the ''Dialogue'' was originally divided into two books, that there is a considerable lacuna in chapter 74, as well as at the beginning, and that it is probably based on an actual occurrence at [[Ephesus]], the personality of the Rabbi [[Tarfon]] being employed, though in a Hellenized form.

[[File:Achaemenid_Empire_under_different_kings_(flat_map).svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent under [[Darius I]]]]

The '''European Scythian campaign of Darius I''' was a military expedition into parts of European [[Scythia]] by [[Darius I]], the king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], in 513 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Ivanov Vasilev. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=Rh2oBgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=darius+I+invaded+scythia+in+513&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "The Policy of Darius and Xerxes towards Thrace and Macedonia"] {{ISBN|9004282157}} p 70&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scythians]] were an [[East Iranian]]-speaking people who had invaded [[Media (region)|Media]], revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and the shores of the [[Black Sea]] as they lived between the [[Danube]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]] and the Black Sea.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=41}}{{sfn|Woolf|2004|p=686}} The campaigns took place in parts of the [[Balkans]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proper, while principally in what is modern-day [[Ukraine]] and southern [[Russia]].

The Scythians managed to avoid a direct confrontation with the Persian army due to their mobile lifestyle and lack of any settlement (except [[Gelonus]]), while the Persians suffered losses due to the Scythians' [[scorched earth]] tactic. However, the Persians conquered much of their cultivated lands and damaged their allies, forcing the Scythians to respect the Persian force. Darius halted the advance to avoid further losses, and built a defence line.

==The campaign==
[[File:Orbis Herodoti.jpg|thumb|Map of the world based on Herodotus' ''Histories'']]
Darius crossed the [[Black Sea]] at the [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Straits]] using a [[Pontoon bridge|bridge of boats]]. Darius conquered large portions of [[Eastern Europe]], even crossing the [[Danube]] to wage war on the [[Scythians]]. Darius invaded [[Scythia]] with his general [[Megabazus]], where the Scythians evaded Darius's army, using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to the countryside, by blocking wells, intercepting convoys, destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against Darius's army.{{sfn|Ross|2004|p=291}} Seeking to fight with the Scythians, Darius's army chased the Scythian army deep into Scythian lands, mostly in what is modern-day Ukraine, where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage. In frustration Darius sent a letter to the Scythian ruler [[Idanthyrsus]] to fight or surrender. The ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with Darius, unless the Persians found and desecrated the graves of the Scythians' forefathers. Until then, they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=68-69}} Despite the evading tactics of the Scythians, Darius' campaign was so far relatively successful.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} As presented by [[Herodotus]], the tactics of the Scythians resulted in the loss of their best lands and damage to their loyal allies.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} The fact is thus that Darius held the initiative.{{sfn|Boardman|2012|pp=239-243}} As he moved eastwards in the cultivated lands of the Scythians, he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off of the land.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

While moving eastwards in the European Scythian lands, he captured the large fortified city of the [[Budini]], one of the allies of the Scythians, and burnt it.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

===Towards the end of the campaign===
Darius ordered a halt at the banks of [[Oarus]], where he built "eight great forts, some eight miles distant from each other", no doubt as a frontier defence.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} As the ''[[Cambridge Ancient History|Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece and the Western Mediterranean C. 525 to 479 B.C.]]'' states, this evidently was as far eastwards as Darius intended to go, at least for the time being. After chasing the Scythians for a month, Darius's army was suffering losses due to fatigue, privation and sickness.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} In his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', Herodotus states that the ruins of the forts were still standing in his day.{{sfn|Herodotus|2015|pp=352}} Concerned about losing more of his troops, Darius halted the march at the banks of the [[Volga River]] and headed towards [[Thrace]].{{sfn|Chaliand|2004|p=16}} He had failed to bring the Scythians to a direct battle, and until he did so he did not have much reason to secure the conquered territories. The initiative still lay with him.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} As the tactics of evading Darius' army and [[scorched earth]] were continued by the Scythians, they had failed however completely, though Darius had failed too as still he wasn't able to bring it to a direct confrontation.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} He had conquered enough Scythian territory to force the Scythians to respect the Persian forces.{{sfn|Shahbazi|1996|p=45}}

==Further reasons behind the invasion past the Danube==
The whole area from central [[Thrace]] to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and from the [[Ukraine]] to the north-east Mediterranean formed a compact area with mutual economic interests between Scythians, [[Thracians]] or Ionians, and Iranians.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} In strategic terms, Darius must have seen that some Scythian-type peoples extended from the Ukraine all the way to what is modern-day Uzbekistan, forming a continuum of dangerous nomadic raiders.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} Furthermore, control of the Black Sea recognized no international divisions. The Persians and the Greeks (many of whom lived in the Persian Empire, while another number lived in the Greek colonies in what is nowadays southern Ukraine) had a common interest in seeking to control the source of Scythian exports of gold, grain, hides, and furs. As the ''[[Cambridge Ancient History]]'' further states, [[Ctesias]], a Greek doctor at the Persian court ca. 400 BC, wrote that before the invasion of Darius into the European Scythian lands a [[satrap]] of [[Cappadocia]] named Ariaramnes had crossed the Black Sea to the north, raiding the European Scythian regions with a fleet of thirty [[penteconter]]s, returning with Scythian men and women, including the brother of a Scythian king.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

While some have supposed that the reason for Darius' invasions was merely to destroy the Scythian lands, the erection of a bridge over the [[Hellespont]] contradicts this; his superior fleet could have easily shipped the troops over as the Scythians had no navy at all.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

==Date of the invasion==
Though Herodotus does not mention the season of the year, as the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' states, it is possible to infer it, knowing that if Darius marched from [[Susa]] in spring 513, he would have reached [[Chalcedon]] in May, and mustered his forces on the European side in June. Thus, he may have started to go beyond the [[Danube]] in late August.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Saka_beyond_the_sea,_Xerxes_I_tomb_relief.jpg|thumb|upright|"Scythian across the Sea", depicted as a soldier of the [[Achaemenid army]] circa 480 BCE on the tomb of [[Xerxes I]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]].]]
As the ''Cambridge History'' states, Darius inflicted widespread damage on the Scythians and their allies, weakened the prestige of the Royal Scythians especially, and upset the balance of power among the various peoples of the region.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} But because he failed to bring the Scythians to battle, he was unable to secure any territorial gains and he did not even complete the building of the forts at what could have been a frontier.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} The campaign was little more than an expansive stalemate.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} As winter now had come, Darius did not return to attack, and marched towards [[Thrace]], towards his firmly secured territories.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

Some form of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] authority perhaps remained after Darius withdrew, for the "Scythians across the Sea" ([[Old Persian cuneiform]]: 𐎿𐎣𐎠𐏐𐎫𐎹𐎡𐎹𐏐𐎱𐎼𐎭𐎼𐎹, ''Sakā tayaiya paradraya'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DNa - Livius |url=http://www.livius.org/sources/content/achaemenid-royal-inscriptions/dna/? |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] as one of the peoples the king conquered outside of Persia.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|p=67}} Persian rule could have never extended beyond the Danube in any strength, however.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|p=67}}

==Assessment==
The Scythian campaign was decisive in that the Persians abandoned the attempt to subjugate the European Scythians.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} Herodotus was correct in his assessment that the Scythians owed their escape to their mobility, their lack of inhabited centres, and the skill of their mounted archers.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} He furthermore states that their refusal to yield to Persia was due to such factors as the authoritarian power of the kings, the widespread hatred of foreigners (IV.76.1),{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} and the ordinary man's belief that what brought him and his tribe honour was the killing of enemies.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} The various Scythian tribes co-operated with each other, winning support of other neighboring peoples as well.{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}} In that regard, as the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' states, they showed more of a sense of a community than the Greek city-states were to show through much of the subsequent [[Greco-Persian Wars]].{{sfn|Boardman|1982|pp=239-243}}

Baron '''Ferenc Hatvany'''  (29 October 1881 – 7 February 1958) was a Hungarian painter and art collector. A son of [[Sándor Hatvany-Deutsch]] and a member of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hatvany-Deutsch family|hu|3=Hatvany-Deutsch család}}, he graduated in the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris. His collection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html Inventory of art works which Hatvany placed in the strongrooms of major Budapest banks in 1942] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525162759/http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included paintings from [[Tintoretto]], [[Cézanne]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], most notably ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'' and  ''[[Femme nue couchée]]''.

Towards the end of the [[Second World War]] his paintings were looted by Soviet troops but some were ransomed by Hatvany. In 1947 he emigrated to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2008/02/01/the-mysterious-journey-of-an-erotic-masterpiece/ ARTNews; The Mysterious Journey of an Erotic Masterpiece]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 ''L'Origine du monde'' was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs (the buyer was psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]).

Paintings that were looted from Hatvany's collection are still hanging on museum walls in Budapest, Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod.{{Specify |reason=Add the name of the museums rather than just the cities. |date=August 2016}} [[John Constable]]'s "Beaching A Boat, Brighton" was identified in the collection of [[The Tate]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10728354/Tate-to-return-Constable-painting-looted-by-Nazis.html "Tate to return Constable painting looted by Nazis"] The Telegraph;  28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatvany died in [[Lausanne]] in 1958.

'''Gopastami''' ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: Gopāṣṭamī) is a festival that is dedicated to [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and cows. It is the coming-of-age celebration when Krishna's father, Nanda Maharaja, gave Krishna the responsibility for taking care of the cows of Vrindavan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/the-splainer-what-makes-the-cow-sacred-to-hindus/2015/11/05/acdde3e2-840c-11e5-8bd2-680fff868306_story.html|title=The 'Splainer: What makes the cow sacred to Hindus?|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
Nanda Maharaj is the father of Krishna and [[Balarama]]. Those days children were given the charge to take care of the calves. Both Krishna and Balarama having passed their fifth year, cowherd men conferred and agreed to give those boys who had passed their fifth year charge of the cows in the pasturing ground. Nanda Maharaj decided to organise a ceremony for Krishna and Balarama while going for cow grazing for the first time in Vrindavan. Raddha, a Hindu goddess, wanted to graze cows but was denied of being a girl. So, she disguised herself in a boy because of her resemblance to Subala-sakha, She put on his dhoti and garments and joined Krishna for cow herding along with her companions for funs. The festival is celebrated on the eighth day in the bright half of Karthik month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: In 36 Volumes.

== Celebrations ==
Go-puja is done on this day. Devotees visit the gosala, bathe and clean the cows and the gosala. Cows are decorated with cloth and jewellery before offering special ritual by the devotees. Special fodders are fed for good health and special drive is organized for its preservation. On this day, Sri Krishna puja and cow Puja is performed along with pradakshina to acquire blessing for a good and happier life. Devotees also pay special respect to cows for its utilities in daily life. Cows provide milk that helps in fulfilling the nutritional requirement of the people like a mother. This is why cows are held sacred and worshipped in Hindu religion as a mother.  The glories of the cow and her protection are discussed by senior devotees. All of them feed the cows and take part in a feast near the gosala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.northeastindia24.com/guwahati-three-daylong-gopastami-mela-concludes/|title=Guwahati; three daylong Gopastami Mela concludes|date=2017-10-29|work=NorthEast India24.com|access-date=2018-07-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fairs and Festivals of India: Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura|last=Gopal|first=Dr. Krishna|publisher=Gyan Pub.

'''Har Senaim''' or '''Senaim''' is an [[archaeological]] site that sits on a peak near [[Mount Hermon]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] portion of the [[Golan Heights]], {{convert|15|km|mi}} north east of [[Kiryat Shmona]] and {{convert|4|km|mi}} from [[Banias]].&lt;ref name="Reyes"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1357474?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101241332727 Book Review of "Archaic Cyprus: A Study of the Textual and Archaeological Evidence" by A.T.

"'''Hell Money'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 3)|third season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]'' and 68th episode overall. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 29, 1996. It was written by [[Jeffrey Vlaming]] and directed by [[Tucker Gates]]. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Hell Money" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.9, being watched by 14.86 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mostly mixed to positive reviews from television critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a murder in [[San Francisco's Chinatown]] involving masked intruders, strange Chinese symbols, a lottery, and the [[Organ trade#Illegal organ trading|clandestine selling of body parts]].

The premise of the episode was based on three major ideas: a [[pyramid scheme]] involving body parts, a lottery in a small town, and the corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. The episode's writer, Vlaming, developed the latter two ideas and series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] merged all three ideas in the finalized script. The episode contained several elaborate special effects shots, most notably the scene wherein a frog bursts out of a victim's chest, which was created by using molds to create a fake human torso that was then placed over an actor.

== Plot ==
In [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown (San Francisco)|Chinatown]], a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant, Johnny Lo, makes his way to his [[apartment]]. There, he is confronted by someone telling him to "pay the price", and is overtaken by three figures wearing [[Mask#China|''shigong'' masks]]. A [[security guard]] later finds the three figures near a [[crematory]] oven, in which Lo is being burned alive.

[[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] investigate Lo's death, the latest in a series of fatal incinerations in Chinatown; Mulder believes that [[ghost]] activity is behind the deaths, while Scully suspects a [[cult]]. The agents collaborate with Glen Chao ([[BD Wong]]), a [[Chinese-American]] detective with the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]]. When they find a Chinese character written inside the oven, Chao translates it as meaning "ghost." Mulder also finds a scrap of burned paper in the ashes, which Chao identifies as "[[Joss paper|hell money]]", a symbolic offering to deceased spirits. The agents locate Lo's apartment, where they find his collection of charms, as well as bloodstains underneath the recently installed carpet.

Meanwhile, another immigrant, Hsin, tends to his [[leukemia]]-stricken daughter, Kim ([[Lucy Liu]]). To pay for her treatments, Hsin attends an underground [[Organ trade#Illegal organ trading|lottery in which participants either win money or lose an organ]], depending on tiles chosen from a pair of [[vase]]s. One man wins the lottery but selects a bad tile, and his body is found later that day. Scully performs an autopsy and finds that he had been selling body parts, noticing his numerous surgical scars. The agents question Chao, who claims that the local community maintains a code of silence and does not reveal anything, even to him.

Chao finds information that leads them to Hsin, who installed the carpet in Lo's apartment. Hsin has a bandage over his eye, having lost it to the lottery earlier. Returning to his home, Chao is confronted by the three masked figures. Scully is informed about the attack on Chao and his admittance in the hospital, the agents then go to see him at the hospital. Meanwhile, Hsin is visited by the Hard Faced Man ([[James Hong]]), one of the proprietors of the lottery. Hsin tells the man that he wants to end his participation, to which the man replies that the rules cannot be broken and warns him that the ghostly fire will consume him if he leaves the lottery.  Upon arriving at the hospital, the agents find Chao gone. They trace his blood to that on the carpet in Lo's apartment, finding a match. This causes the agents to visit Hsin, but find only his daughter at his apartment.

Hsin wins the lottery, but selects the tile representing his [[heart]]. Chao comes in and tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over the table with the vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced Man, after which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They [[interrogate]] the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an [[organ donor]] list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.&lt;ref name="plot"&gt;Lowry, pp. 187–190&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

[[File:Chinatown Vancouver.JPG|thumb|right|Exterior shots for the episode were filmed at [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown, in Vancouver]].]]

===Writing===
"Hell Money" was written by [[Jeff Vlaming]], his last script for the series. The episode was directed by [[Tucker Gates]], making it the first of only two episodes of ''The X-Files''—the other being [[The X-Files (season 4)|the show's fourth season]] entry "[[El Mundo Gira]]"—that he directed.&lt;ref name="BigbookDirector"&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236–240&lt;/ref&gt; The episode features pre-fame [[Lucy Liu]] in a guest star role. Liu would later gain prominence as a cast member of the show ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;

The premise of the episode evolved from an idea that series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had about a "pyramid scheme for body parts".&lt;ref name="offprod"/&gt; Writer Jeff Vlaming took this concept and combined it with two other ideas: The first involved "a lottery in a small town" and the other concerned a corporate entity controlling the poor in [[Chinatown]]. When the initial script for "Hell Money" was submitted, Carter streamline the three stories into one.&lt;ref name="offprod"&gt;Lowry, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' later noted that "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you think it must be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode would end with Scully being correct{{em dash}}a rare occurrence on the show. In the end, however, Mulder is once again vindicated.&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;Edwards, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Exterior scenes for the episode were filmed in [[Chinatown, Vancouver]], while the scenes taking place in a crematorium were shot on a soundstage.&lt;ref name="offprod" /&gt; Interior shots of the gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;Gradnitzer and Pittson, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The production staff created a second balcony in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to tear it down once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place "for aesthetic reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Gradnitzer and Pittson, pp. 108–110&lt;/ref&gt; The vase and tiles used in the episode were created by the show's production department. The scene where a frog pops out of a victim's chest was created by using a live actor pretending to be a corpse, covered with a faux torso. For a close-up shot, the torso itself, which had a discrete access hole in it, was placed on the autopsy table, and an animal wrangler pushed a real frog up through the slit.&lt;ref name="offprod" /&gt; After filming wrapped up, actors Michael Yama and Lucy Liu were asked to re-record their dialogue, this time affecting [[Cantonese]] accents. Their lines were then added over the original footage in [[post-production]].&lt;ref name="offprod" /&gt;

== Reception ==
"Hell Money" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="airdate"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Third Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 3) |origyear=1995–1996 |others=[[R.W. Goodwin]], [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], et al |type=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 9.9, with a 17 share, meaning that roughly 9.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 17 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.&lt;ref name="ratings"/&gt; This totaled 14.86 million viewers.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;Lowry, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics, ranging from largely positive to negative. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the episode an A–, calling it "gorgeously shot", citing the "lush, smoky gaming sequences" in particular.&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295173_4,00.html|title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 3|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 29, 1996|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television Without Pity]] ranked "Hell Money" the eleventh most nightmare-inducing episode of the show noting, "If there’s one thing you don’t want to mess with, it’s the Chinese mafia. Especially the branch that dresses up like [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and either a) burns you alive, if you’re lucky, or b) forces you to participate in a haunted organ-harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on the black market, whether you like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/xfiles-the-11-most-nightmarein.php |title=Photo Gallery - X-Files: The 11 Most Nightmare-Inducing Episodes Ever - TV Shows &amp; TV Series Pictures &amp; Photos |publisher=[[Television Without Pity]] |accessdate=February 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302194555/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/xfiles-the-11-most-nightmarein.php |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it a "hard episode to love [but] sincere and purposeful".&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; The two praised the conceit of the episode, arguing that by presenting the situation from the Chinese immigrants—members of an alien culture—and Chao's point of view, "Mulder and Scully seem clumsy and arrogant. And by implication, the audience are made to feel just as arrogant."&lt;ref name="shearman"&gt;Shearman and Pearson, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were more mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 5/10, noting "Overall, this episode attempted to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing the agents to interact with an 'alien' culture. Unfortunately, the structure of the episode gave the audience answers long before the agents discovered them, making the bulk of the episode an exercise. By not taking the theme far enough or deepening the mystery, the writers ultimately fail to reach their goals."&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season3/3-19.html | title=Hell Money|last=Keegan|first=John | publisher=Critical Myth | accessdate=May 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from [[The A.V. Club]] gave the entry a C+ and wrote that the episode "was also fairly bold for its time, providing a whole subplot that's mostly told through subtitles [but] it feels like a series of shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup."&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hell-moneyjose-chungs-from-outer-spaceavatar,44032/|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|title="Hell Money"/"Jose Chung's From Outer Space"/"Avatar"|date=August 15, 2010|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, VanDerWerff concluded that, "the major problem with 'Hell Money' is that it feels, at times, like a backdoor pilot for a new series starring B.D. Wong as corrupt detective Glen Chao."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Paula Vitaris from ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four.&lt;ref name=cinepaularev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1996|volume=28|issue=3|pages=18–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; She critiqued the fact that the episode lacked a paranormal mystery, noting that the theme of the episode "would fit nicely into any other police drama".&lt;ref name=cinepaularev/&gt; Vitaris described the "three actors in the black suits and ghost masks" as "not very convincing."&lt;ref name=cinepaularev/&gt;

Co-producer [[Paul Rabwin]] was not a fan of "Hell Money": he believed that the premise was not really an [[X-File]] due to the fact that nothing paranormal happened during the episode. He claimed that if Mulder and Scully were removed from the story, it would not have changed anything and that the two were not affected personally by the case.&lt;ref name="conf" /&gt;

"'''Jesus Christ Pose'''" is a song by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Soundgarden]], released in 1991 as the first single from the band's third studio album, ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'' (1991). The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, ''[[A-Sides]]''.

==Origin and recording==
"Jesus Christ Pose" features lyrics written by frontman [[Chris Cornell]] and music co-written by Cornell, drummer [[Matt Cameron]], bassist [[Ben Shepherd]], and guitarist [[Kim Thayil]]. Some see the song as defining the "essence" of Soundgarden, as it is credited to all four band members. Cameron said, "As soon as I played this pattern everyone dove right in, and within an hour we had the guts of the song. The approach we took on this one was pure assault of the senses. Canadians dance to this song."&lt;ref&gt;Peiken, Matt. "Soundgarden's Matt Cameron: Breaking New Ground". ''[[Modern Drummer]]''. June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Rolling Stone interview, Kim Thayil explained the origin of this song:

{{quote|[It] was definitely a jam at rehearsal. I think Ben was just jamming up this loud and blurry, detuned bass line flopping around there. And Matt starts making it precise and coherent; Matt's drum part is insane – it's so fast and coordinated. And I picked up my guitar, thinking, "What the hell are they doing?" It took me a while to figure out what's going on rhythmically and where to punctuate the one, so what I start hearing is that swirling, kamikaze bat [guitar] sound at the beginning. And that was a groove. Then I revisit the feedback and beneath-the-bridge guitar squeals that I used to do in '84 and '85. I did that mostly out of necessity because I really didn't understand what it was Ben and Matt were playing; it was just too fast and involved.

Eventually, Matt and Ben lost each other, so we recorded it. Chris takes it home. We loved the groove, the action and dynamic of it. So Chris takes a recording home and works lyrics and around the lyrics finds a chorus. So he writes a couple other sections to help flesh out the arrangement dynamic and give room for the vocals. He brought that to rehearsal and we're like, "Holy shit, this crazy, insane car wreck is now a song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/soundgardens-badmotorfinger-at-25-kim-thayil-looks-back-w449590|title=Soundgarden's 'Badmotorfinger' at 25: Kim Thayil Looks Back|newspaper=Rolling Stone|access-date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Composition==
"Jesus Christ Pose" was performed in [[drop D tuning]] and is in 4/4 time. Regarding the song, Thayil said, "The song's groove reminds me of helicopter blades. I bent the strings at the beginning and end of the song."&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;Gilbert, Jeff. [http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/gschool_5-94.shtml "Primecuts: Kim Thayil"]. ''Guitar School''. May 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
The band explained that the lyrics for "Jesus Christ Pose" concern the exploitation of religion for personal benefit. The song is a criticism of how public figures use religion (particularly the image of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) to portray themselves as being "better" than others, or as "[[martyr]]s". Chris Cornell specifically mentioned [[Jane's Addiction]]'s frontman [[Perry Farrell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuffarophoto.com/jesus-christ-pose/ Jesus Christ Pose]. ''Chris Cuffaro''. February 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; as an influence on the song, explaining, "It became fashionable to be the sort of persecuted-deity guy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/request_10-94.shtml "Interview with Chris Cornell"]. ''Request''. October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|Spin magazine]] in 1992, Cornell explained the term "Jesus Christ Pose":
{{quote|You just see it a lot with really beautiful people, or famous people, exploiting that symbol as to imply that they're either a deity or persecuted somehow by their public. So it's pretty much a song that is nonreligious but expressing being irritated by seeing that. It's not that I would ever be offended by what someone would do with that symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Magnuson, Ann. [http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/spin_2-92.shtml "Sub Zep?"]. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Release and reception==
"Jesus Christ Pose" was released as a single in 1991 in various versions with the previously unreleased [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s "Stray Cat Blues" and "[[Into the Void (Black Sabbath song)|Into the Void]] (Sealth)". Outside the United States, the single was released commercially in the [[United Kingdom]].

Greg Prato of [[AllMusic]] said, "In addition to Cornell's biting lyrics and vocals, the rest of the band helped fuel unquestionably one of Soundgarden's most vicious and venomous rockers. Breakneck guitar riffs do battle with sledgehammer drumming for most of the song's five minute and 50 seconds."&lt;ref&gt;Prato, Greg. [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2765650|pure_url=yes}} "Jesus Christ Pose &gt; Review"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved on May 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gina Arnold]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "On songs like the cynical 'Jesus Christ Pose'&amp;nbsp;... Soundgarden sound a hell of a lot smarter than their peers, who seldom get beyond extolling booze, girls, and cars."&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Gina. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315669,00.html "Badmotorfinger"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. September 27, 1991. Retrieved on October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is featured on the [[S.F.W.#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the 1994 film, ''[[S.F.W.]]'' "Jesus Christ Pose" is available as downloadable content for the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series as a master track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/dlc |title=DLC Credits |work=RockBand.com |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113025751/http://www.rockband.com/dlc |archivedate=January 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Jesus Christ Pose" was directed by Eric Zimmerman, who would later direct the music video for "[[Rusty Cage]]".&lt;ref name="gripping"&gt;Soundgarden Rail Against the "Jesus Christ Pose" 
in New and Gripping Video. Levine Schneider Public Relations. October 30, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The video's intro includes words similar to [[John 3:16]]; "And God So Loved Soundgarden He Gave Them His Only Song". The video features the band members wandering around a desert interspersed with various images of crosses, cyborgs, a crucified girl, a crucified skeleton and even cruciform vegetables crucified in a human form. Thayil said, "A lot was chosen by the director Eric Zimmerman, and we checked it out and decided what we liked and didn't like."&lt;ref name="gripping"/&gt; Cornell said, "It was a pretty unanimous decision by the band to have a woman being crucified in the video&amp;nbsp;... As a visual, it's powerful and it's also challenging to people, because women basically have been persecuted since before recorded history, and it would almost make more sense than seeing a man on it." He also added, "There's upside down crosses and right-side up ones. But there's certainly no blatant direction as far as religious conviction in the video."&lt;ref name="gripping"/&gt;

Thayil said that the video was one of the few Soundgarden videos the band was satisfied with.&lt;ref&gt;Maloof, Rich. [http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/guitar_7-96.shtml "Kim Thayil of Soundgarden: Down on the Upbeat"]. ''Guitar Magazine''. July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that "on the "Jesus Christ Pose" video we did a lot of experimenting at different kinda fun, cool things. I guess it seems fun to me because I didn't end up getting disappointed by it."&lt;ref&gt;Thayil, Kim. "Soundgarden Television Interview". ''[[rage (TV program)|rage]]''. [[ABC1]].&lt;/ref&gt; The video was released in October 1991.&lt;ref name="mvdbase"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mvdbase.com/artist.php?last=Soundgarden&amp;first=&amp;sortord=1=|title=Soundgarden music videos|accessdate=February 22, 2008|publisher=Music Video Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
"Jesus Christ Pose" garnered attention when [[MTV]] banned its corresponding music video in 1991—it has not been shown by the channel in its entirety since. Many listeners were outraged by the song and its video, perceiving it as anti-Christian. The band actually received death threats about it on a UK tour in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/raw_9-28-93.shtml "I Don't Care About Performing for 20,000!"]. ''Raw''. September 15, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thayil on the "Jesus Christ Pose" music video and controversy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That was our first single from ''Badmotorfinger'', but it never got any airplay because of the references to Jesus. And MTV wouldn't play the video because they didn't like the idea of a girl on the cross. There are no guitars in the video at all. There's not even a picture of a guitar in the video. It's like this hard, rock-fast, punk-metal video that has no instruments in the whole thing. And it's a six minute video!&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cornell stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way [MTV's] programming works is like a commercial radio station, the shorter the video, the more videos they can play, and—they figured I guess that in the normal hours people watch videos they're not going to want to watch something for six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Chris. "Interview with Chris Cornell". [[bFM (radio)|bFM]], [[New Zealand]]. January 16, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Live performances==
A live performance of "Jesus Christ Pose" can be found on the "[[Black Hole Sun]]" single and the compilation album ''[[Telephantasm]]''. A performance of the song is also included on the ''[[Motorvision]]'' home video release.

==Cover versions==
[[The Killing Tree]] performed a cover of "Jesus Christ Pose" on the band's 2003 EP, ''[[We Sing Sin]]''. A cover of "Jesus Christ Pose" was done by the band [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] which was featured on the 2006 cover album, ''[[High Voltage!: A Brief History of Rock]]'', as well as the band's 2006 EP of cover songs, ''[[Plagiarism (EP)|Plagiarism]]''. Fellow grunge rockers [[Pearl Jam]] have jammed to this song live. A version appeared on Kearney Barton's Wheedle's Groove (2009), a collection featuring Funk and Soul acts from Seattle such as Ron Buford, Robbie Hill, Ural Thomas, Pat Wright and the Total Experience Gospel Choir, Overton Berry, Broham, Calvin Law, and Johnny Horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pastorek |first1=Whitney |title=Soundgarden's 'Jesus Christ Pose'... as a gospel song? |url=https://ew.com/article/2009/08/31/kearney-barton-soundgarden-exclusive/ |website=EW.com |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Montreal Indie Artist, NeeNee Knightly, released an Industrial/Electronica version in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knightly |first1=NeeNee |title=Jesus Christ Pose |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Christ-Pose-NeeNee-Knightly/dp/B07FFJ2S16 |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kingu''', also spelled '''Qingu''', meaning "unskilled laborer", was a god in [[Babylonian mythology]],  and—after the murder of his father [[Abzu]]—the consort of the goddess [[Tiamat]], his mother, who wanted to establish him as ruler and leader of all gods before she was killed by [[Marduk]].  Tiamat gave Kingu the 3 [[Tablets of Destiny]], which he wore as a breastplate and which gave him great power. She placed him as the general of her army.  However, like Tiamat, Kingu was eventually killed by Marduk. Marduk mixed Kingu's blood with earth and used the clay to mold the first human beings, while Tiamat's body created the earth and the skies. Kingu then went to live in the underworld kingdom of [[Ereshkigal]], along with the other deities who had sided with Tiamat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/humm/Resources/Ane/enumaA.html |title=Babylonian Creation Myth |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Religion at Java}}
A '''kyai''' (kyaa-ee) is a ([[Java]]nese) expert in [[Islam]].

==Origins==
The word is of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] origin. Sometimes it is spelled '''kiai'''. Traditionally, students of [[Islam in Indonesia]] would study in a boarding school known as a [[pesantren]]. The leader of the school was called kyai, as a form of respect. The traditional word for a teacher in Islam is [[ustad]], which is a [[Persian language|Persian]] word. There are many ustads in Indonesia who teach the religion, but most of them do not have a boarding school.

==Education==
Kiai were educated in various [[pesantren]]:
{{quote|Highly motivated students went from pesantren to pesantren, studying in each the texts in which its kiai was specialised. After a few pesantrens in Banten, they would go on to pesantrens in Bogor, Cianjur, Cirebon, Central or East Java and finally, if their families could afford it, to Mecca, the most prestigious centre of Islamic learning.{{sfn|Bruinessen|1995}}}}

A student in a pesantren is called a '''santri'''. After the founding kyai of a pesantren dies, his son or another santri may take over the supervision of the school, and would then be called kyai. It is possible for a large boarding school to have several kyai living and teaching there.&lt;ref name="ZamakhsyariDhofier" /&gt; However, most pesantren have a few hundred students, with only one person who is called kyai. The other teachers in the school are called ustadz. Many Indonesian Muslims consider a kyai to be higher ranked than an ustadz because a kyai runs his own boarding school and has mystical abilities.&lt;ref name="RonaldLukensBull" /&gt;

==Function==
Kiai were distinct from the ''pangulu'', the state officials:
{{quote|The pesantrens were typically (although not uniquely) located in rural districts, away from the major roads. Their geographical isolation symbolised, as it were, their ideological distance from the state. The '''pangulu''', as a state official, and the independent teacher, the ''kiai'', were two contrasting types, in Banten as well as elsewhere in Java."{{sfn|Bruinessen|1995}}}}

A kyai is not a [[cleric]] in the same way as a [[priest]] in [[Christianity]] or [[Buddhism]].  There is no governing body that ordains or authorizes a kyai. Likewise, no organization can defrock a kyai or remove him from his position.  The reason is that a kyai has his position and authority because people will listen to what he says.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lukens-Bull  2005  A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java.  New York: Palgrave McMillian.  Pp. 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Indonesians refer to a widely regarded kyai as an [[ulama]]. This word is actually the plural form of the [[Arabic]] word '''alim''' which means knowledgeable person. Through common usage in Indonesia, the word '''ulama''' grew to signify a high-level kyai, even though this is a grammatical misuse of the Arabic word.&lt;ref name="ZamakhsyariDhofier"&gt;Zamakhsyari Dhofier The Pesantren Tradition: A Study of the Role of the Kyai in the Maintenance of the Traditional Ideology of Islam in Java Tempe, AZ: Arizona State University Program for Southeast Asian Studies Monograph Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

In legend, if not in fact, a kyai combines the skills and roles of both the Islamic scholar and the Sufi master ([[sheikh]] or '''syehk'''). Stories abound about kyai that can perform such feats as:&lt;ref name="RonaldLukensBull"&gt;Ronald Lukens-Bull  2005  A Peaceful Jihad: Negotiating Identity and Modernity in Muslim Java.

===Wali Songo===
In some parts of Indonesia, famous students of the [[Wali Songo]] mystics are referred to historically as kyai or kiai or '''ki'''. One of them, Ki Ageng Gribig, is said to have returned from [[Mecca]] with a small kind of pastry which did not spoil during the long journey. To commemorate this feat, the people of [[Jatinom]] hold a festival each year, wherein thousands of these little cakes (called '''apem''') are blessed and tossed out to participants. The main road from [[Klaten]] to [[Boyolali]] in [[Central Java]], which passes through the town of Jatinom, is officially named after Ki Ageng Gribig, though known colloquially as '''Jalan Boyolali''' (Boyolali Road).

This is a list of the '''Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch and all the East''', the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the [[Maronite Church]], one of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. After becoming [[patriarch]] of the [[Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch]], they assume the name "Peter" (Boutros in Arabic, بطرس ), after the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|Bishop of Antioch]], [[St. Peter]], who was also the head of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. The official title that the Maronite Patriarch assumes is "Patriarch of Antioch and All the East".

For the Patriarchs of Antioch before John Maron, see [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch]].

==Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch, from John Maron==
A famous list of Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch was written and published by [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]],&lt;ref&gt;J.S.Assemani ''Serie chronologica Patriarchorum Antionchiae'', edited and integrated by Joanne Darauni, Rome 1881&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simon Awad]], which follows the ''Series of Maronite Patriachs'' written by Patriarch [[Estephan El Douaihy]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Graf3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graf |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Graf | title = Geschichte der christlichen arabischen Literatur, Volume 3 | publisher=Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana |year=1960 |chapter=90.5 |pages=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is incomplete for the first centuries. Besides the Assemani's list, an other list more detailed was written in Bejjeh in 1766 by Georges Saad.&lt;ref name="dau"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dau| first = Butros| title =Religious, cultural and political history of the Maronites |year = 1984 | location=Lebanon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CbZAAAAMAAJ |pages=228–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the list here below the names shifted on the right are not included in the incomplete Assemani's list and derive from the Bejjeh's list.

The '''Patriarch of Alexandria''' (also known as the '''Bishop of Alexandria''' or '''[[Pope (word)|Pope]] of Alexandria''') is the highest-ranking [[bishop]] of Egypt. The Patriarchs trace back their lineage to [[Mark the Evangelist]].

Following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] occurred in Egypt, between those who accepted and those who rejected the decisions of the Council. The former are known as Chalcedonians and the latter are known as [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]]. Over the next several decades, these two parties competed on the [[See of St. Mark|See of Alexandria]] and frequently still recognized the same Patriarch. But after 536, they permanently established separate patriarchates, and have maintained separate lineages of Patriarchs. The Miaphysites became the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] (part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]) and the Chalcedonians became the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] (part of the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]).

Therefore, this list only contains those Patriarchs who served before 536. For later Popes and Patriarchs, follow the links at the bottom of this page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10373">In [[Scientology]], the '''security check''' (or '''sec check''') is an interrogation technique put into practice by founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="raine"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raine|first=Susan|year=2009|title=Surveillance in New Religious Movements: Scientology as a Case Study|journal=Religious Studies and Theology|publisher=Equinox Publishing|volume=28|issue=1|pages=63–94|issn=1747-5414|doi=10.1558/rsth.v28i1.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves an "[[Ethics officer (Scientology)|Ethics officer]]" probing the thoughts, attitudes and behavior of an individual member by asking them large numbers of questions.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; The bulk of the questions deal with [[crime|criminal]] or [[sexual activity]] or intentions, or other things that the interviewee might be ashamed of.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper|first=Paulette|title=The Scandal of Scientology|publisher=Tower Publications|location=New York|year=1971|pages=85–92|oclc=921001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; The questions also probe negative thoughts that the person might have about Scientology or Hubbard.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; As with traditional [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], the subject holds the electrodes of the [[E-meter]], a simple lie-detector device that measures electrical conductivity in the human body, while they are given a series of highly probing, personal questions.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=June 2006|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356–389|issn=1477-4585|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard described security checking as a remedy for "unreasonable action", specifically "the compulsion or obsession to commit actions" the person feels must be kept secret.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary|publisher=Church of Scientology of California, Publications Organization|location=California|year=1975|isbn=0-88404-037-2|oclc=11210573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Checks are given to all Scientologists on the [[Bridge to Total Freedom]], every six months to all [[Operating Thetan]]s, according to officials, "to make sure they're using the tech correctly",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first = Janet | last = Reitman | title = Inside Scientology | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9363363/inside_scientology/print | publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = 23 February 2006 | accessdate = 2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to members who are leaving staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first = Robert | last = Farley | title = The unperson | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/25/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml | work =  [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 25 June 2006 | accessdate = 2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a "Code of Reform" issued in 1968, Hubbard announced that he was cancelling security checks, along with the policies of [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]] and [[Disconnection]].&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron  (29 November 1968) "Code of Reform" reproduced in {{Cite book|title = Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand and any associated scientology organisation or bodies in New Zealand; report of the Commission of Inquiry| first= Sir Guy Richardson |last=Powles |author2=E. V. Dumbleton  |date=30 June 1969|oclc=147661 |location=Wellington|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later Scientology documents refer to the practice, and former members report that it still continues.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;

Sec Checks are also known in the [[Scientology Justice]] system as "Integrity Processing" or "Confessional Auditing".&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt;

==Security checks==
A security check resembles the [[confessional]] in traditional religions.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; However, it also differs from them in that it is not voluntary.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; Hubbard told security checkers that "you are not merely an observer, or an auditor, you are a detective."&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;

Susan Raine of the [[University of Alberta]] observes that the questions asked in security checks show that L. Ron Hubbard was intensely preoccupied with scrutiny, surveillance and betrayal.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; She notes that this intense form of surveillance makes sense from a [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] perspective as a way of making sure all individuals follow (and internalize) the organisational goals.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; Bent Corydon, an ex-Scientologist, compares security checking to the use of [[thought police]] in the novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]].&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; He writes that Scientologists are punished for having negative thoughts about Hubbard or Scientology and so learn to think only positively.&lt;ref name="raine" /&gt; David Mayo, another former member, reported that sec checks included the question, "Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?" and that such "discreditable thoughts" could land a follower in trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Miller|first=Russell|title=Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard |publisher=Michael Joseph|year=1987|page=289|isbn=0-7181-2764-1|oclc=20634668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the South African Commission of Enquiry published a report on Scientology. It recommended that there should be legislation against sec checks. However, no legislative action was taken as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jon | last=Atack | year=1990| title = A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed |publisher = Lyle Stuart / Carol Publishing Group|isbn=0-8184-0499-X |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HGC Pre-processing Security Check===
HGC stands for "Hubbard Guidance Centre". Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] quotes some questions from this security check dating from 1961.&lt;ref name="wallis"&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (23 October 1961) HCO Policy Letter, "HGC Pre-processing security check" quoted in {{Cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy|title=[[The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology]]|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|location=London|year=1976|page=149|isbn=0-435-82916-5|oclc=310565311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Are you a pervert?
:Are you guilty of any major crimes in this lifetime?
:Have you been sent here knowingly to injure Scientology?
:Are you or have you ever been a Communist?&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallis" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Johannesburg Security Check===
The Johannesburg (also known as "Joburg") Security Check  was described by Hubbard as "the roughest security check in Scientology". An amended form continued to be used for some time thereafter.&lt;ref name=Atack&gt;Jon Atack, ''A Piece of Blue Sky'', Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst Hubbard's list of primarily crime-related questions is the question "Have you ever slept with a member of a race of another color?"&lt;ref name=HCOPLjoburg&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, ''HCOPL 7 April 1961'', "Johannesburg Security Check"&lt;/ref&gt; Other questions include:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Have you ever embezzled money?
:Have you ever been a drug addict?
:Have you ever bombed anything?
:Have you ever murdered anyone?
:Have you ever raped anyone?
:Have you ever had anything to do with a baby farm?&lt;ref name=HCOPLjoburg/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Only Valid Security Check===
The contents of the Joburg security check were later revised into what became "The Only Valid Security Check". Added to the Sec Check are new questions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Do you collect sexual objects?
:Do you have a secret you are afraid I'll find out?
:Are you upset by this security check?
:Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (1961) "The Only Valid Security Check" Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter, 22 May 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Auditor's Sec Check===
This sec check, comprising 170 questions, was meant for staff auditors and field auditors.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Kevin Victor|author2=Board of Inquiry into Scientology|title=Report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology (Parliamentary paper 1-6502/65)|publisher=State of Victoria|location=Melbourne|year=1965|oclc=152418521}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Do you hope you won't be found out?
:Do you think there is anything wrong with having your privacy invaded?
:What do you wish you hadn't done?
:Are you upset by this security check? &lt;ref name="urban" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron (1961) "Auditor's Sec Check" Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter, 7 July 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Security Check Children===
Designed to be applied to children aged 6 to 12. Issued by Hubbard as HCO Bulletin of 21 September 1961, also known as ''HCO WW Security Form 8''. The procedure runs through 99 questions, such as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:What has somebody told you not to tell?
:Have you ever decided you didn't like some member of your family?
:Have you ever taken something belonging to somebody else and never given it back?
:Have you ever pretended to be sick (ill)?
:Have you ever made yourself sick (ill) or hurt yourself to make somebody sorry?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Whole Track Security Check===
This long Sec Check, consisting of hundreds of questions, takes stock of the subject's entire time track, including their "recollections" of any "[[Reincarnation#Scientology|past lives]]" they believe they have had. It includes questions such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?
:Have you ever smothered a baby?
:Have you ever enslaved a population?
:Have you ever destroyed a culture?
:Have you ever torn out someone's tongue?
:Have you ever zapped anyone?
:Have you ever eaten a human body?
:Have you ever made a planet, or nation, radioactive?&lt;ref name=Atack/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==

===Potential blackmail===

Scientology researcher [[Jon Atack]] — a critic of Scientology, and himself a former Scientologist  — explains in his book ''A Piece of Blue Sky'' that sec checks could be applied either as a "confidential" Confessional or as a non-confidential investigation. He alleges that former members have been silenced by the fear that their "confidential" secrets will be used in blackmail against them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2250">The '''"Mormon Political Manifesto"''' (formally, '''"The Political Rule of the Church"''') was a document issued by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) in 1895 to regulate the involvement of its [[general authority|general authorities]] in politics. Up until the mid-1890s, the LDS Church had proactively supported the [[People's Party (Utah)]] and entering politics had been seen as almost a part of several church leader's ecclesiastical responsibilities. Leading up to the issuance of the Manifesto, there was major disagreement about church members entering politics. Utah was transitioning to statehood and to a situation where the two national parties dominated Utah politics, and the church began to adopt a posture of political neutrality.

The leaders of the church, led by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Wilford Woodruff]], decided to establish a written rule that the general authorities of the church would require the approval of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] before seeking public office. [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Moses Thatcher]] did not agree with this new rule and in 1896 was removed from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] over the issue. [[B. H. Roberts]], a general authority of the church, resisted the Manifesto at first, but agreed to it in 1896 under threat of being removed from his position.

More recently, the LDS Church has taken a more stringent rule on political involvement by its leaders. Current policies prohibit general authorities not only from running for office but also from contributing financially to political campaigns. This policy was implemented in 2011.

'''Mount Qingcheng''' ({{zh|c=青城山|p=Qīngchéng Shān}}) is a mountain in [[Dujiangyan City|Dujiangyan]], [[Sichuan]], [[China]]. It is considered one of the birthplaces of [[Taoism]] (Daoism) and one of the most important Taoist centres in China. In Taoist mythology, it was the site of the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s studies with [[Ning Fengzi]]. As a centre of the Taoist religion it became host to many temples. The mountain has 36 peaks. It is home to Dujiangyan Giant Panda Center and is a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">The '''Nuremberg Mahzor''' is a 14th-century manuscript of the [[siddur]] according to the 'Eastern' [[Ashkenazi]] rite.  Written in 1331, the ornamental manuscript includes the [[Jewish services]] for all occasions throughout the year, together with commentaries (in the margins) which have never been published.

The manuscript was written on parchment and, at 20&amp;nbsp;inches high by 14&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and weighing more than 57 pounds (26 kilograms), is one of the largest and heaviest [[codex|codices]] to have survived anywhere.  It contains 521 [[Wiktionary:folio|folio]]s. 

The illuminated Nuremberg Mahzor contains prayers and [[piyyut]]im
for the whole year according to the Eastern Ashkenazi
(Austrian) rite, the five Megillot and the Haftarot.  

The Nuremberg Mahzor got its name from its home for more than 300 years – the Nuremberg municipal library in Germany. 

The manuscript was originally commissioned for private study and synagogue use by a Jewish patron and was most likely used by the Nuremberg community after 1499. From the 16th century until 1951 the manuscript was in the possession of the [[Nuremberg]] Municipal Library. 

In 1951, Salman Schocken, a German-Jewish publisher and book collector, purchased the Nuremberg Mahzor as post-World War II restitution for property confiscated by the Nazis. Since then it was stored for 50 years in the Schocken Institute for Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. During that time it went only once on public display. In 2005 the manuscript was purchased by the private collector Dr. David Jeselsohn, Zurich. 

In the 19th century, 11 leaves were removed from the prayer book by Napoleon’s army, museum officials believe. Schocken acquired four of the missing leaves in the 1930s after he fled Nazi Germany. One leaf, who was in a private collection, has been purchased by Jeselsohn in 2010. Six leaves are still missing.

Immediately after the purchase of the Nuremberg Mahzor by Dr. Jeselsohn, the whole book has been scanned by the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/mss-pr/mahzor-nuremberg/ mahzor-nuremberg]&lt;/ref&gt; and after a six-months restoration at the Israel Museum laboratories it went on display at the Israel Museum's Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem from September 2009 through February 2010. Today, the Nuremberg Mahzor is part of the permanent exhibits of the renewed Israel Museum.

The Nuremberg Mahzor is described as a "unique cultural object from the Middle Ages". It was written in calligraphic script by a scribe who is assumed to be a professional artist. The style of illumination is that of the [[Upper Rhine valley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">The '''Pitris''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पितृ, the fathers), are the spirits of the departed [[ancestor]]s in [[Hindu culture]].
They are often remembered annually.

==The human and divine Pitris==

The most complete accounts about the {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s are found in the ''[[Vayu Purana]]'' and ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' and both are practically identical.
The account in the ''[[Harivamsha]]'' is shorter but agrees closely with them.
The similar but brief accounts are also found in the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' and ''[[Padma Purana]]''.
According to these accounts there are different classes of the {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s and they have different origins, forms, grades and abodes. A broad distinction exists between the ''{{IAST|devāḥ pitaraḥ}}'' (divine {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s) and the ''{{IAST|manuṣyāḥ pitaraḥ}}'' ({{IAST|Pitṛ}}s who were deceased human beings).
Some of the {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s dwell in the heavenly abodes while other dwell in the netherworlds. The former who dwell in the heaven were considered as the gods and the gods were also considered as the {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s.

The {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s are most primeval deities and they never cease to exist. The ''{{IAST|manuṣyāḥ pitaraḥ}}'' (ancestors of human beings) can attain the same level of the divine {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s and live with them in heaven by righteousness.

They are reborn at the end of every thousand ''[[mahayuga]]s'' and revive the worlds. From them all the [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]s and all progeny at the new creation are produced.&lt;ref&gt;Pargiter, F.E (1922, reprint 1972). ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.&amp;nbsp;46-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seven classes of the divine Pitṛs==

There are seven classes of the {{IAST|devāḥ pitaraḥ}} (divine {{IAST|Pitṛ}}s), three of them are ''amurtayah'' (incorporeal) while the other four are ''samurtayah'' (corporeal). The three incorporeal orders of the Pitṛs are ''[[Vairaja]]''s, ''[[Agnishvatta]]''s and ''[[Barhishada]]''s. The four corporeal orders of the Pitṛs are ''[[Somapa]]''s, ''[[Havishmana]]''s, ''[[Ajyapa]]''s and ''Sukalin''s (or ''[[Manasa]]''s)

===The Pitṛ-Vaṁśa (genealogy of the Pitṛs)===

All seven classes of the divine Pitṛs had each one ''mānasī kanyā'' (mind-born daughter). ''Mena'', the wife of Mount [[Himavat]] was the daughter of the ''Vairaja''s. ''Acchoda'', the river was the daughter of the ''Agnishvatta''s. ''Pivari'', the wife of the sage [[Śuka]] was the daughter of the ''Barhishada''s. ''[[Narmada River|Narmada]]'', the river was the daughter of the ''Somapa''s. ''Yashoda'' was the daughter of the ''Havishmana''s was the wife of ''Vishvamahat'' and mother of Dilipa. ''Viraja'', the wife of king [[Nahusha]] was the daughter of the ''Ajyapa''s and ''Go'' or ''Ekshringa'', the wife of the sage [[Shukra]] was the daughter of the ''Manasa''s.&lt;ref&gt;Pargiter, F.E (1922, reprint 1972). ''Ancient Indian Historical Tradition'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pompeii Lakshmi''' is an ivory statuette that was discovered in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], which was destroyed in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] 79 CE. She was found by Amedeo Maiuri an Italian scholar in 1938.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt; The statuette has been dated to the first-century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=i402017|title=Vol. 32, No. 24, May 8, 1939 of The Classical Weekly on JSTOR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette is thought of representing an Indian goddess of feminine beauty and fertility. It is possible that the sculpture originally formed the handle of a mirror.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1939|title=Abstracts of Articles|jstor=4340562|journal=The Classical Weekly|volume=32|issue=18|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakshmi is a reminder of commercial trade of goods and resources between India and Italy in the first century A.D. Over the years historians have been able to connect Roman trade with the far east specifically India.

Originally, it was thought that the statuette represented the goddess [[Lakshmi]], a goddess of fertility, beauty and wealth, revered by early [[Buddhist]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref name="Beard"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-H6HsNEWLhYC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town|last1=Beard|first=Mary|date=2010|publisher=Profile Books|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wangu |first1=Madhu Bazaz |title=Images of Indian Goddesses: Myths, Meanings, and Models |date=2003 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=9788170174165 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8y-vKtqCmIC&amp;pg=PA57 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the iconography reveals that the figure is more likely to depict a ''[[yakshi]]'', a female tree spirit that represents fertility, or possibly a syncretic version of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi from an ancient exchange between Classical Greco-Roman and [[Indian culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt;

The figure is now in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref name="Museo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoarcheologiconapoli.it/en/room-and-sections-of-the-exhibition/3490-2/|title=Lakshmi|work=Museo Archeologico Napoli|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents ==
The statuette was discovered in October 1938 beside the Casa dei Quattro stili at Pompeii.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Standing at 0.25 m. high the statuette is nearly naked apart from her narrow girdle and lavish jewels as well as an elaborate coiffure. She has two female attendants, one facing outward on each side, holding cosmetics containers.&lt;ref name="Beard" /&gt; The statuette has a hole bored down from the top of her head. There is the theory that its purpose may have been a mirror handle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The existence of this statuette in Pompeii by 79 CE, when [[Mount Vesuvius]] erupted and buried the city, testifies to the intensity of [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] during the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Beard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foglia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RainC5KUCIEC&amp;pg=PA43|title=Secrets of Pompeii: Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|last1=De Albentiis|first1=Emidio|last2=Foglia|first2=Alfredo|date=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statuette has been dated by the Naples National Archaeological Museum as having been created in India in the first half of that century.&lt;ref name="Museo"/&gt;

== Trade ==
Though the origin is not entirely certain, based on archeological finds and historian work, the Pompeii Lakshmi has had a questionable origin. There is evidence of the then active trade routes between the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] and India during this time period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollard|first=Elizabeth Ann|date=2013-08-07|title=Indian Spices and Roman "Magic" in Imperial and Late Antique Indomediterranea|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516208|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0012|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pollard, with the Roman long-distance trade, she is believed to have found herself in the city during the reign of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The archeological evidence suggests that the height of trade between Roman and India appears to have been the first and second centuries C.E. This trade took place along several routes, both overland as documented by [[Isidore of Charax]]’s ''Parthian Stations,'' and by sea as the merchant guide known as the ''[[Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' reveals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a possibility that the statuette found its way to the west during the rule of [[Western Satrap]] [[Nahapana]] in the [[Bhokardan]] area, and was shipped from the port of [[Barigaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brancaccio |first1=Pia |title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion |date=2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004185259 |page=64 Note 94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA64 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome played an important part in the Eastern oriental trade of antiquity, they imported many goods from India and at the same time set up their own trading stations in the country.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Matthew Adam|date=April 2013|title=THE RECEPTION AND CONSUMPTION OF EASTERN GOODS IN ROMAN SOCIETY|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/greece-and-rome/article/the-reception-and-consumption-of-eastern-goods-in-roman-society/AB382741FDBC75BFFE346C155DAC84AE|journal=Greece &amp;amp; Rome|volume=60|issue=1|pages=136–152|doi=10.1017/S0017383512000307|issn=0017-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cobb, trading through land routes such as crossing the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Mesopotamia]], and through seaborne trade from the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] were used by the Romans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The sea routes that utilized the winds of the Indian Ocean was able to create a significant volume of goods to be imported from the East on ships. The wealth of the trade was significant enough for Pliny to claim that 100 million sesterces were being sent annually to India, China, and Arabia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With shipments of nard, ivory, and textiles it is clear from the archaeological evidence, that Roman trade with the East peaked in the first and second centuries A.D.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Pompeii Lakshmi before reconstitution.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The statuette before reconstitution.]]
[[File:Letter Shi in Kharosthi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Kharosthi]] letter ''śi'' was inscribed on the base of the statuette.&lt;ref name="Maiuri"/&gt;]]
It was initially assumed that the statuette had been produced at [[Mathura]], but according to Dhavalikar, it is now thought that its place of production was [[Bhokardan]] since two similar figurines were discovered there.&lt;ref name=MKD&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhavalikar |first=M. K. |editor1-last=Kulkarni |editor1-first=A. R. |editor2-last=Wagle |editor2-first=N.

There is also an inscriptive mark in [[Kharosthi]] at the base of the Pompeii statuette (the letter śi, as the śi in [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name="Maiuri"&gt;Statuetta eburnea di arte indiana a Pompei, Maiuri [http://www.bollettinodarte.beniculturali.it/opencms/multimedia/BollettinoArteIt/documents/1434379819195_03_-_A._Maiuri_p._111.pdf p.112]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests she might have originated from the northwestern regions of India, Pakistan, or Afghanistan, or at least passed through these areas.&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;Afghanistan: Forging Civilizations Along the Silk Road, Joan Aruz, Elisabetta Valtz Fino, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=p4_it5yw9WsC&amp;pg=PA75 p.75]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Pompeii statuette was necessarily made sometime before 79 CE, if it was indeed manufactured in [[Gandhara]], it would suggest that the [[Begram ivories]] are also of this early date, in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

===Iconography===
The statuette is represented in the round, and the center of two other female figures. The legs are turned to its side and one arm bent to hold earrings. She is presumed to only be looked at front the front because the details from the back are very flat. As stated by D’Ancona, the iconography falls into the broad category of female deities in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RainC5KUCIEC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Secrets of Pompeii: Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|last=Albentiis|first=Emidio De|last2=Foglia|first2=Alfredo|date=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892369416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case of cross-cultural pollination, the theme of the goddess attended by two child attendants, which can be seen in the case of the Pompeii Lakshmi, is an uncommon depiction of Lakshmi or Yashis in [[Indian art]]. It lacks the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]] found in Lakshmi iconography. According to D'Ancona, the iconography represented in this statuette may have been imported from the Classical world, possibly derived from the iconography of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] attended by [[Putto|cherubs]] holding cosmetics containers, which are well known in Greco-Roman art. She may be one of the several representations of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi that appeared in the 1st century CE, states D'Ancona.&lt;ref name="Ancona"&gt;An Indian Statuette from Pompeii, Mirella Levi D' Ancona, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 13, No. 3 (1950), [https://ja.scribd.com/document/260301968/An-Indian-Statuette-From-Pompeii pp. 166-180]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pompeii Lakshmi would therefore be a mixture of Indian and Classical art.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt;

[[:File:Lakshmi Sanchi Stupa 2.jpg|An early relief]] from [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] with a broadly similar scene of Lakshmi with two child attendants may have served as the initial inspiration for the Pompeii Lakshmi, especially knowing that the [[Satavahanas]] were in control of Sanchi from 50 BCE onward.&lt;ref name="Ancona"/&gt; It is thought that these early reliefs at Sanchi Stupa No.2 were made by craftsmen from the northwest, specifically from the [[Indo-Greek]] region of [[Gandhara]], as the reliefs bear mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]], as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; The craftsmen were probably responsible for the foreign-looking motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] has long been a cradle and host to a variety of the most enduring [[religion|religio]]-[[philosophy|philosophical]] traditions of the world. [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]], later joined by [[Buddhism]], constitute the "[[three teachings]]" that have shaped Chinese culture. There are no clear boundaries between these intertwined religious systems, which do not claim to be exclusive, and elements of each enrich [[Chinese folk religion|popular or folk religion]]. The [[emperors of China]] claimed the [[Mandate of Heaven]] and participated in Chinese religious practices. In the early 20th century, reform-minded officials and intellectuals attacked all religions as "superstitious", and since 1949, China has been governed by the [[Communist Party of China]], an [[Marxist atheism|atheist]] institution that prohibits party members from practising religion while in office. In the culmination of a series of campaigns against religions already underway since the late 19th century, the [[Cultural Revolution]] against [[Four Olds|old habits, ideas, customs and culture]], lasting from 1966 to 1967, destroyed or forced them underground.&lt;ref name=RMW2ed2009&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Woodhead|editor-first1=Linda|editor-last2=Kawanami|editor-first2=Hiroko|editor-last3=Partridge|editor-first3=Christopher H.|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|edition=2nd|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415458900|oclc=237880815}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}} Under following leaders, religious organisations were given more autonomy. The government formally recognises five religions: [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Catholicism]] (though the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Chinese Catholic Church]] is independent of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church in Rome]]). In the early twenty-first century there has been increasing official recognition of [[Confucianism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] as part of [[Culture of China|China's cultural inheritance]].

Folk or popular religion, the most widespread system of beliefs and practices, has evolved and adapted since at least the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties in the second millennium BCE. Fundamental elements of a [[Chinese theology|theology and spiritual explanation]] for the nature of the universe harken back to this period and were further elaborated in the [[Axial Age]]. Basically, Chinese religion involves allegiance to the ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'', often translated as "spirits", defining a variety of [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods and immortals]]. These may be [[deity|deities]] of the natural environment or [[progenitor|ancestral principles]] of human groups, concepts of civility, [[culture hero]]es, many of whom feature in [[Chinese mythology]] and history.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996}} Confucian philosophy and religious practice began their long evolution during the later Zhou; Taoist institutionalised religions developed by the [[Han dynasty]]; [[Chinese Buddhism]] became widely popular by the [[Tang dynasty]], and in response Confucian thinkers developed [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosophies; and [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular movements of salvation]] and local [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] thrived.

[[Christianity in China|Christianity]] and [[Islam in China|Islam]] arrived in China in the 7th century. Christianity did not take root until it was reintroduced in the 16th century by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]].{{sfnb|Bays|2012|pp=7–15, 18–21}} In the early 20th century Christian communities grew, but after 1949, foreign missionaries were expelled, and churches brought under government-controlled institutions. After the late 1970s, religious freedoms for Christians improved and new Chinese groups emerged.&lt;ref name=Blainey&gt;{{cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=[[A Short History of Christianity]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|508, 532}} China is also often considered a home to [[humanism|humanist]] and [[secularism|secularist]], this-worldly thought beginning in the time of [[Confucius]].

Because many, perhaps most, [[Han Chinese]] do not consider their spiritual beliefs and practices to be a "religion" and in any case do not feel that they must practise any one of them exclusively, it is difficult to gather clear and reliable statistics. According to scholarly opinion, "the great majority of China's population of 1.4+ billion" takes part in Chinese cosmological religion, its rituals and festivals of the lunar calendar, without belonging to any institutional teaching.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=144}} [[Religion in China#Demographics|National surveys]] conducted in the early 21st century estimated that some 80% of the population of China, that is more than a billion people, practise some kind of Chinese folk religion or Taoism; 10–16% are Buddhists; 2–3% are [[Christianity|Christians]]; and 1–2% are Muslims. [[Chinese salvationist religions|Folk religious movements of salvation]] constitute 2–3% to 13% of the population, while many in the intellectual class adhere to Confucianism as a religious identity. In addition, [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority groups]] practise distinctive religions, including [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and Islam among the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Uyghur people]]s.

{{Further information|Chinese shamanism|Wu (shaman)|Sino-Babylonianism}}
Prior to the formation of [[Chinese culture|Chinese civilisation]] and the spread of [[world religion]]s in the region known today as [[East Asia]] (which includes the territorial boundaries of modern-day China), local tribes shared [[animism|animistic]], [[shamanism|shamanic]] and [[totemism|totemic]] worldviews. Mediatory individuals such as shamans communicated prayers, sacrifices or offerings directly to the spiritual world, a heritage that survives in some modern forms of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Yang|Lang|2012|p=112}}

Ancient shamanism is especially connected to ancient Neolithic cultures such as the [[Hongshan culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Nelson|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Matson|first2=Rachel A.|last3=Roberts|first3=Rachel M.|last4=Rock|first4=Chris|last5=Stencel|first5=Robert E.|title=Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish philosopher [[Ulrich Libbrecht]] traces the origins of some features of Taoism to what [[Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]] called "Wuism",{{sfnb|De Groot|1892|loc=''passim'' Vol. 6}} that is Chinese shamanism.{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}}

Libbrecht distinguishes two layers in the development of the [[Chinese theology]] and religion that continues to this day, traditions derived respectively from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1046 BCE) and subsequent [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties (1046–256 BCE). The religion of the Shang was based on the worship of ancestors and god-kings, who survived as unseen divine forces after death. They were not transcendent entities, since the universe was "by itself so", not created by a force outside of it but generated by internal rhythms and cosmic powers. The royal ancestors were called ''di'' (帝), "deities", and the utmost progenitor was ''[[Shangdi]]'' (上帝 "Highest Deity"). Shangdi is identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], symbol of the unlimited power (''[[qi]]''),{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} of the "protean" primordial power which embodies [[yin and yang]] in unity, associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] which winds around the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]],{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and slithers between the [[Ursa Minor|Little]] and [[Big Dipper]] (or Great Chariot). Already in Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four 方 ''[[Wufang Shangdi|fāng]]'' ("directions" or "sides") and their 風 ''fēng'' ("winds") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143–144, Vol. II}}

The Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, was more rooted in an [[agriculture|agricultural]] worldview, and they emphasised a more universal idea of ''[[Tian]]'' (天 "Heaven").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} The Shang dynasty's identification of Shangdi as their ancestor-god had asserted their claim to power by divine right; the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}

John C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient [[Chinese characters]] for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=103, Vol. II}} or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader [[Ursa Major]], and [[Ursa Minor]] (Little Dipper).{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|pp=138–148, "Chapter 4: Bringing Heaven Down to Earth"}} Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. I}}

===Latter Zhou and Warring States===
{{Further|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
By the 6th century BCE the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual cauldrons, and the Zhou ritual system) became "diffuse" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Divine right no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvi–xxxvii, Vol. I}}

Besides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as "wild" (野 ''yě'') traditions, or traditions "outside of the official system", developed as attempts to access the will of Tian. The population had lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the "Nine Fields" (九野 ''Jiǔyě'') and of the ''[[Yijing]]'' flourished.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvii–xxxviii, Vol. I}} Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a "Hundred Schools of Thought", each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order.

{{See also|Confucian theology}}
[[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE) appeared in this period of political decadence and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang-Zhou theology, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and human agency,{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}} and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of 愛人 ''àirén'', "loving others").{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=2}} As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of [[meditation]] that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=xxxviii, Vol. I}} Confucius amended and recodified the [[Chinese classics|classical books]] inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}

Philosophers in the Warring States compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classical metaphysics which became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (一 ''Yī''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii–xxxix, Vol. I}}

According to [[Zhou Youguang]], Confucianism's name in Chinese, basically 儒 ''rú'', originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by [[Mencius]] (~372–289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}

===Qin and Han dynasties===

{{See also|Qin-Han theology}}
The [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] (221–206 BCE), and especially [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE), inherited the philosophical developments of the Warring States period molding them into a universalistic philosophy, cosmology and religion. It was in this period that religious focus shifted to the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] (地 ''Dì''), regarded as representative of Heaven's (celestial pole's) power. In the Han period, the philosophical concern was especially the crucial role of the human being on earth, completing the cosmological trinity of Heaven-Earth-humanity (天地人 ''Tiāndìrén''). Han philosophers conceived the immanent virtue of Tian as working through earth and humanity to complete the 宇宙 ''yǔzhòu'' ("space-time").{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xl–xli, Vol. I}}

The short-lived Qin dynasty, started by [[Qin Shihuang]] (247–220 BCE), who [[Qin's wars of unification|reunified the Warring States]] and was the first Chinese ruler to use the title of "emperor", chose [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] as the state ideology, banning and persecuting all other schools of thought. Confucianism was harshly suppressed, with the [[burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of Confucian classics and killing of scholars who espoused the Confucian cause]].{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=771, chapter: Nylan, Michael. "Classics Without Canonization: Learning and Authority in Qin and Han"}}{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=3}} The state ritual of the Qin was indeed similar to that of the following Han dynasty.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=766, chapter: Nylan, Michael. "Classics Without Canonization: Learning and Authority in Qin and Han"}} Qin Shihuang personally held sacrifices to Di at [[Mount Tai]], a site dedicated to the worship of the supreme God since pre-Xia times, and in the suburbs of the capital [[Xianyang]].{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|p=5}}{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=783, chapter: Bujard, Marianne. "State and Local Cults in Han Religion"}} The emperors of Qin also concentrated the cults of the [[Wufang Shangdi|five forms of God]], previously held at different locations, in unified temple complexes.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=784, chapter: Bujard, Marianne. "State and Local Cults in Han Religion"}}

The universal religion of the Han, which became connected at an early time with the proto-Taoist [[Huang–Lao]] movement, was focused on the idea of the incarnation of God as the Yellow Emperor, the central one of the [[Wufang Shangdi|"Five Forms of the Highest Deity"]] (五方上帝 ''Wǔfāng Shàngdì''). The idea of the incarnation of God was not new, as already the Shang royal lineage regarded themselves as divine. Their progenitors were "sons of God", born by women who "stepped on the imprinting" of Di. This was also true for royal ancestors of the early Zhou dynasty.{{sfnb|Zhou|2005|pp=7–8}} The difference rests upon the fact that the Yellow Emperor was no longer an exclusive ancestor of some royal lineage, but rather a more universal archetype of the human being. The competing factions of the Confucians and the ''[[fangshi|fāngshì]]'' (方士 "masters of directions"), regarded as representatives of the ancient religious tradition inherited from previous dynasties, concurred in the formulation of Han state religion, the former pushing for a centralisation of religio-political power around the worship of the God of Heaven by the emperor, while the latter emphasising the multiplicity of the local gods and the theology of the Yellow Emperor.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|pp=777–779, chapter: Bujard, Marianne. "State and Local Cults in Han Religion"}} Besides these developments of common Chinese and Confucian state religion, the latter Han dynasty was characterised by new religious phenomena: the emergence of Taoism outside state orthodoxy, the rise of indigenous [[millenarianism|millenarian]] religious movements, and the introduction of the foreign religion of [[Buddhism]].

====The cult of the Yellow Emperor====
[[File:The god of Thunder.jpg|thumb|200px|The eagle-faced Thunder God (雷神 ''Léishén''), punisher of those who go against the order of Heaven (1923 drawing).

{{See also|Yellow God theology}}
By the Han dynasty, the universal God of early Shang-Zhou theology had found new expression by the names of ''[[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Tàiyǐ]]'' (太乙 "Great Oneness"), "Supreme Oneness of the Central Yellow" (中黄太乙 ''Zhōnghuáng Tàiyǐ''), or the "Yellow God of the Northern Dipper (i.e. Ursa Major)" (黄神北斗 ''Huángshén Běidǒu''), other than by names inherited from the previous tradition. Although the name "Taiyi" became prominent in the Han, it harkens back to the Warring States, as attested in the poem ''[[Taiyi Shengshui|The Supreme Oneness Gives Birth to Water]]'', and possibly to the Shang dynasty as ''Dàyī'' (大一 "Big Oneness"), an alternative name for Shangs' (and universe's) greatest ancestor.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. III, esp. "Chapter 6: Great Ancestor Dayi 大乙; Polar God Taiyi 太乙; Yi 一, "One"; and the Development of Early Imperial Chinese Cosmology"}} Han theology focalised on the [[Yellow Emperor]], a [[culture hero]] and creator of civility, who, according to a definition in apocryphal texts related to the ''[[Yellow River Map|Hétú]]'' 河圖, "proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper", is born to "a daughter of a chthonic deity", and as such he is "a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth".{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=22–28}}

In the myth, the Yellow Emperor was [[miraculous births|conceived by a virgin mother]], Fubao, who was impregnated by Taiyi's radiance (''yuanqi'', "primordial pneuma") from the Big Dipper after she gazed at it. Through his human side, he was a descendant of 有熊氏 ''Yǒuxióng'', the lineage of the Bear (another reference to the Ursa Major). Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in [[Siberia]] or in north Asia.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=153–156, Vol. I}}

In latter Han-dynasty description of the [[Wufang Shangdi|cosmology of the five forms of God]] by [[Sima Qian]], it is important that the Yellow Emperor was portrayed as the grandfather of the [[Heidi (god)|Black Emperor]] (黑帝 ''Hēidì'') of the north who personifies as well the pole stars, and as the tamer of the [[Flaming Emperor]] (炎帝 ''Yándì'', otherwise known as the "Red Emperor"), his half-brother, who is the spirit of the southern Chinese populations known collectively as [[Chu (state)|Chu]] in the Zhou dynasty.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=156, Vol. I}}

[[Emperor Wu of Han]] (142–87 BCE), under the influence of the scholar [[Dong Zhongshu]] (who incorporated into Confucianism the man-focused developments of the common religion, formulating the doctrine of the ''[[Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind]]''),{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=4}} and of prominent ''fangshi'',{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=785}} officially integrated the Confucian state religion and ritual inherited from the erstwhile dynasties with the theology of Taiyi,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=163–164, Vol. I}} while outside the state religion the Yellow God was the focus of Huang-Lao religious movements which influenced the primitive [[Taoism|Taoist Church]].{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=22–28}} Before the Confucian turn of Emperor Wu and after him, the early and latter Han dynasty had Huang-Lao as the state doctrine under various emperors; in Huang-Lao, the philosopher-god [[Laozi]] was identified as the Yellow Emperor and received imperial sacrifices, for instance by [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]] (146-168).{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|p=19}}

====Latter Han: popular millenarian and early Taoist churches====
[[File:Xiwangmu.jpg|thumb|200px|Han dynasty mural representing the Queen Mother of the West.]]
The latter Han dynasty (25–220 CE) struggled with both internal instability and menace by non-Chinese peoples from the outer edges of the empire. Prospects for a better personal life and salvation appealed to the masses who were periodically hit by natural disasters and galvanised by uprisings organised by self-proclaimed "kings" and "heirs". In such harsh conditions, while the imperial cult continued the sacrifices to the cosmological gods, common people estranged from the rationalism of the state religion found solace in enlightened masters and in reviving and perpetuating more or less abandoned cults of national, regional and local divinities that better represented indigenous identities. The Han state religion itself was "ethnicised" by associating the cosmological deities to regional populations.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=1–2}}

By the end of the dynasty (206 BCE–8 CE) the earliest record of a mass religious movement attests the excitement provoked by the belief in the imminent advent of the [[Queen Mother of the West]] (西王母 ''Xīwángmǔ'') in the northeastern provinces (then [[Henan]], [[Hebei]] and [[Shandong]]) in the first half of the year 3 BCE. Though the soteriological movement included improper and possibly reprehensive collective behavior, it was not crushed by the government. Indeed, from the elites' point of view, the movement was connected to a series of abnormal cosmic phenomena seen as characteristic of an excess of 阴 ''[[yin and yang|yīn]]'' (femininity, sinister, reabsorption of the order of nature).{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=2–3}}

Between 184 and 205 CE, the Way of the Supreme Peace (太平道 ''Tàipíngdào'') in the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plains]], the earliest attested popular Taoist religious-military movement led by members of the Zhang lineage—prominently Zhang Jue and Zhang Liu, among leaders from other families—, organised the so-called [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] against the Han dynasty.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=6–10}} Later Taoist religious movements flourished in the Han state of [[Han Shu|Shu]] (modern [[Sichuan]]). A 巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wū]]'' (shaman) of the Supreme Peace named Zhang Xiu was known to have led a group of followers from Shu into the uprising of the year 184. In 191 he reappeared as a military official in the province, together with the apparently unrelated Zhang Lu. During a military mission in Hanning (modern southwest [[Shaanxi]]), Xiu either died in battle or was killed by Lu himself, who incorporated Xiu's followers and seized the city, which he renamed [[Hanzhong]]. A characteristic of the territory governed by Lu was its significant non-Chinese population. Between 143 and 198, starting with the grandfather [[Zhang Daoling]] and culminating with Zhang Lu, the Zhang lineage had been organising the territory into dioceses or parishes, establishing a Taoist [[theocracy]], the early [[Celestial Masters]]' Church (in Chinese variously called 五斗米道 ''Wǔdǒumǐdào'', "Way of the Five Pecks of Rice", and later 天师道 ''Tiānshīdào'', "Way of the Celestial Masters", or 正一道 ''Zhèngyīdào'', "Way of the Orthodox Unity"). Zhang Lu died in 216 or 217, and between 215 and 219 the people of Hanzhong were gradually dispersed northwards, implanting Celestial Masters' Taoism in other parts of the empire.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|pp=11–15}}

====The introduction of Buddhism====
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|200px|"Heroic Gesture of the [[Bodhisattva|Awakened Being]]" from [[Tumxuk]], 6th or 7th-century Buddhist [[Serindian art]], which developed in what is now [[Xinjiang]], whence Buddhism spread to China proper.]]

Buddhism entered China via the [[Silk Road]], transmitted by the Buddhist populations who inhabited the [[Western Regions]] (modern [[Xinjiang]]), then Indo-Europeans (predominantly [[Tocharians]] and [[Saka]]). It began to grow to become a significant influence in China proper only after the fall of the Han dynasty, in the period of political division.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=4}} When Buddhism had become an established religion it began to compete with Chinese indigenous religion and Taoist movements, deprecatorily designated as Ways of Demons (鬼道 ''Guǐdào'') in Buddhist polemical literature.{{sfnb|Espesset|2008|p=18}}

===The period of division of the Six Dynasties===
After the fall of the Han dynasty, a period of disunity defined as the "[[Six Dynasties]]" began. After the first stage of the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280), China was partially unified under the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]], while much of the north was governed by [[Sixteen Kingdoms|sixteen independent states]]. The fall of the Han capital [[Luoyang]] to the [[Xiongnu]] in 311 led the royal court and Celestial Masters' clerics to migrate southwards. [[Jiangnan]] became the epicenter of the "southern tradition" of Celestial Masters' Taoism, which developed characteristic features, among which a meditation technique known as "guarding the One" (''shouyi''), that is visualising the unity God in the human organism.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2016}}{{rp|3.2}}

Representatives of Jiangnan's indigenous religions responded to the spread of Celestial Masters' Taoism by reformulating their own traditions according to the imported religion. This led to the foundation of two new Taoist schools, with their own scriptural and ritual bodies: [[Shangqing Taoism]] (上清派 ''Shàngqīngpài'', "Highest Clarity school"), based on revelations that occurred between 364 and 370 in modern-day [[Nanjing]], and [[Lingbao Taoism]] (灵宝派 ''Língbǎopài'', "Numinous Gem school"), based on revelations of the years between 397 and 402 and recodified later by Lu Xiujing (406-77). Lingbao incorporated from Buddhism the ideas of "universal salvation" and ranked "heavens", and focused on communal rituals.{{sfnb|Pregadio|2016}}{{rp|3.3}}

Buddhism brought a model of afterlife to Chinese people and had a deep influence on Chinese culture. The story ''[[Mulian Rescues His Mother]]'', for instance, is a parable dated back to the 3rd century, which adapts an originally Buddhist fable to show Confucian values of filial piety. In the story, a virtuous monk descends into hell to rescue his mother, who had been condemned for her transgressions.{{sfnb|Teiser|1988|pp=8–9}}

===Sui and Tang dynasties===
In the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) the concept of "Tian" became more common at the expense of "Di", continuing a tendency that started in the Han dynasty. Both also expanded their meanings, with "di" now more frequently used as suffix of a deity's name rather than to refer to the supreme power. "Tian", besides, became more associated to its meaning of "[[Heaven]]" as a [[paradise]] or the hierarchy of physical skies. The proliferation of foreign religions in the Tang, especially Buddhist sects, entailed that each of them conceived their own ideal "Heaven". "Tian" itself started to be used, linguistically, as an affix in composite names to mean "heavenly" or "divine". This was also the case in the Buddhist context, with many monasteries' names containing this element.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|pp=40–41}}

Under the influence of foreign cultures and thought systems, new concepts to refer to the supreme God were formulated, such as ''Tiānzhōngtiān'' (天中天 "God of the Gods"), seemingly introduced by [[Yuezhi]] Buddhist missionaries to render the [[Sanskrit]] ''Devātideva'' (of the same meaning) or ''[[Bhagavan|Bhagavān]]'' from their Iranian sources.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=38}}

Both Buddhism and Taoism developed hierarchic pantheons which merged metaphysical (celestial) and physical (terrestrial) being, blurring the edge between the human and the divine, which reinforced the religious belief that gods and devotees sustain one another.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=42}}

====The cult of the City Gods====
[[File:The Temple of the Town Deity in Sheng County 44 2017-03.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of the City God of [[Sheng County]], [[Zhejiang]]. City God Temples are often built at the heart of trade and economic districts.]]
The principle of reciprocity between the human and the divine, which was strengthened during the Tang dynasty, led to changes in the pantheon that reflected changes in the society. The late Tang dynasty saw the spread of the cult of the [[City God (China)|City Gods]] in direct bond to the development of the cities as centres of commerce and the rise in influence of merchant classes. Commercial travel opened China to influences from foreign cultures.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=43. Cit. Ebrey, Patricia Buckley, and Peter N. Gregory, ed. ''Religion and Society in Tang and Song China''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993. p. 29}}

The City God is a protector of the boundaries of a city and of its internal and economic affairs, such as trade and elections of politicians. In each city, the respective City God is embodied by one or more historical personages, native of the city itself, who distinguished themselves by extraordinary attainments. Scholar Valerie Hansen argues that the City God is not a homegrown cult, but has its prototype in the Indian ''[[Vaiśravaṇa]]'' as a guardian deity.{{sfnb|Chang|2000|p=43. Cit.

Founded by [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rulers, the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912) promoted the teachings of Confucius as the textual tradition superior to all others. The Qing made their laws more severely patriarchal than any previous dynasty, and Buddhism and Taoism were downgraded. Despite this, Tibetan Buddhism began in this period to have significant presence in China, with [[Tibetans|Tibetan]] influence in the west, and with the [[Mongols]] and Manchus in the north.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=148}}

Later, many folk religious and institutional religious temples were destroyed during the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1871).{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=9}} It was organised by Christian movements which established a separate state in south-east China against the Qing dynasty. In the Christian-inspired [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], official policies pursued the elimination of Chinese religions to substitute them with forms of Christianity. In this effort, the libraries of the Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, almost completely in the [[Yangtze River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Tarocco|first=Francesca|p=48|title=The Cultural Practices of Modern Chinese Buddhism: Attuning the Dharma|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=2008|isbn=0415596173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction, the [[Boxer Rebellion]] at the turn of the century (1899–1901) would have been inspired by indigenous Chinese movements against the influence of Christian missionaries—"devils" as they were called by the Boxers—and Western [[colonialism]]. At that time China was being gradually invaded by European and American powers, and since 1860 Christian missionaries had had the right to build or rent premises, and they appropriated many temples. Churches with their high steeples and foreigners' infrastructures, factories and mines were viewed as disrupting ''[[feng shui]]'' ("wind–water" cosmic balance) and caused "tremendous offence" to the Chinese. The Boxers' action was aimed at sabotaging or outrightly destroying these infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Preston|first=Diana|title=The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900|year=2000|publisher=Walker|location=New York|isbn=0802713610}} pp. 25–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

China entered the 20th century under the Manchu Qing dynasty, whose rulers favoured traditional Chinese religions, and participated in public religious ceremonies, with state pomp, as at the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, where prayers for the harvest were offered. [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] recognised the [[Dalai Lama]] as their spiritual and temporal leader. Popular cults were regulated by imperial policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing others.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=46}} During the anti-foreign and anti-Christian [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]] of 1900, thousands of Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries were killed, but in the aftermath of the [[Eight Nation Alliance|retaliatory invasion]], numbers of reform-minded Chinese turned to Christianity.{{sfnb|Bays|2012|pp=84–87}} Between 1898 and 1904 the imperial government issued a measure to "build schools with temple property" (庙产兴学 ''miàochǎn xīngxué'').&lt;ref name=Liang2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=Yongjia|title=The Anthropological Study of Religion in China: Contexts, Collaborations, Debates and Trends|journal=Asia Research Institute Working Paper Series|issue=250|page=25|date=2016|url=https://ari.nus.edu.sg/Assets/repository/files/publications/wps16_250.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011828/https://ari.nus.edu.sg/Assets/repository/files/publications/wps16_250.pdf|archive-date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=50}}

After the [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution of 1911]], with increasing urbanisation and Western influence, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer the worship of heterodox gods as it was the case in imperial times, but the delegitimisation of religion itself, and especially folk religion, as an obstacle to modernisation.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=50}} Leaders of the [[New Culture Movement]] (1916–1923) debated whether religion was cosmopolitan spirituality or irrational superstition, and the [[Anti-Christian Movement (China)|Anti-Christian Movement]] of 1923 was part of a rejection of Christianity as an instrument of foreign imperialism.{{sfnb|Bays|2012|pp=107–113}}

The [[Guomindang]]-governed [[Republic of China (1912–49)]] intensified the suppression of local religion. Temples were widely appropriated, destroyed, or used for schools.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=43}} The 1928 "Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines" formally abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}} [[Sun Yat-sen]], the first president of the Republic of China, and his successor [[Chiang Kai-shek]], were both Christians. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945]] many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=9}}{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=45}}

The People's Republic of China, proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]], established a policy of [[state atheism]]. Initially, the new government did not suppress religious practice, but, like its dynastic ancestors, viewed popular religious movements, especially in the countryside, as possibly seditious. The government condemned religious organisations, labeling them as superstitious. Religions that were deemed "appropriate" and given freedom were those that entailed the ancestral tradition of consolidated state rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Woodhead|editor-first1=Linda|editor-last2=Partridge|editor-first2=Christopher|editor-last3=Kawanami|editor-first3=Hiroko|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|edition=3rd|publisher=Routledge|year=2016}} p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Marxism viewed religion as [[feudalism|feudal]]. The [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] institutionalised Protestant churches in official organisations that renounced foreign funding and foreign control as imperialist. Chinese Catholics resisted the new government's move towards state control and independence from the Vatican.{{sfnb|Bays|2012|pp=159–166}} Later onwards, the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) involved a systematic effort to destroy religion.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=9}}{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=51}} The historian [[Arthur Waldron]] explains that "communism was, in effect, a religion for its early Chinese converts: more than a sociological analysis, it was a revelation and a prophecy that engaged their entire beings and was expounded in sacred texts, many imported from Moscow and often printed in English".{{sfnb|Waldron|1998|p=325}}

The radical policy relaxed considerably in the late 1970s. Since [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1978]], the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guarantees "freedom of religion". Its article 36 states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/92824/92845/92875/6442436.html|title=China's Policy on Religion |publisher=english.people.com.cn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708061748/http://en.people.cn/92824/92845/92875/6442436.html|archive-date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China (Adopted on December 4, 1982)|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::"Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination."

For several decades, the party acquiesced or even encouraged a religious revival. Most Chinese were allowed to worship as they felt best. Although "spiritual practices" such as the [[Falun Gong]] were banned and practitioners have been persecuted since 1999, local authorities were likely to follow a hands-off policy towards other religions. In the late 20th century there was a reactivation of the state cults devoted to the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the [[Red Emperor]].{{sfnb|Sautman|1997|pp=79–84}} In the early 2000s, the Chinese government became open especially to traditional religions such as Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism and folk religion, emphasising the role of religion in building a "[[Harmonious Society]]" (''hexie shehui''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Christopher|title=Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2011|isbn=1441112472}} p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; a Confucian idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solé-Farràs|first=Jesús|title=New Confucianism in Twenty-First Century China: The Construction of a Discourse|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=113473915X}} p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Daniel A.|title=China's New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=0691145857}} p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; China hosted religious meetings and conferences including the [[World Buddhist Forum, 2006|first World Buddhist Forum]] in 2006 and the subsequent World Buddhist Forums, a number of international Taoist meetings and local conferences on folk religions. Aligning with Chinese anthropologists' emphasis on "religious culture",&lt;ref name=Liang2016/&gt;{{rp|5–7}} the government considers these religions as integral expressions of national "Chinese culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koesel|first=Karrie J.|title=Religion and Authoritarianism: Cooperation, Conflict, and the Consequences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=1139867792}} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A turning point was reached in 2005, when folk religious cults began to be protected and promoted under the policies of [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref name=Liang2016/&gt;{{rp|9}} Not only were traditions that had been interrupted for decades resumed, but ceremonies forgotten for centuries were reinvented. The annual worship of the god [[Cáncóng]] of the [[Shu (state)|ancient state of Shu]], for instance, was resumed at a ceremonial complex near the [[Sanxingdui]] archaeological site in [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Te Winkle|first=Kimberley S.|title=A Sacred Trinity: God, Mountain and Bird.

In 2012 [[Xi Jinping]] was elected as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. During his early political career in the 1980s, Xi was the secretary of [[Zhengding County]] in [[Hebei]], where he allied himself with [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] master Youming and helped the reconstruction of the county's Buddhist temples, explicitly expressing interest towards Buddhism. Once he became president of China, fighting moral void and corruption through a return to traditional culture became the primary tasks of the new government.{{sfnb|Johnson|2017|p=280}} The government's project also involved restricting Christian churches, which resulted in some removals of crosses from steeples and churches' demolition. At least one prominent pastor who protested was arrested on charges of misusing church funds. A lawyer who had counselled these churches appeared on state television to confess that he had been in collusion with American organisations to incite local Christians.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ian|title=Decapitated Churches in China's Christian Heartland|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 May 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/world/asia/china-christians-zhejiang.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André Laliberté noted that despite there having been much talk about "persecution against religion (especially Christianity) in China", one should not jump to hasty conclusions, since "a large proportion of the population worship, pray, perform rituals and hold certain beliefs with the full support of the Party. Most of this activity affects people who subscribe to world views that are sometimes formally acknowledged by the state and are institutionalised, or others that are tacitly approved as customs". In this context, Christianity not only represents a small proportion of the population, but its adherents are still seen by the majority who observe traditional rituals as followers of a foreign religion that sets them apart from the body of society.{{sfnb|Laliberté|2011|pp=3–4}}

[[The Associated Press]] reported in September 2018 that "Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982.", which has involved "destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith".&lt;ref&gt;[Group: Officials destroying crosses, burning bibles in China Group: Officials destroying crosses, burning bibles in China] Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting the number of religious people anywhere is hard; counting them in China is even harder. Low response rates, non-random samples, and adverse political and cultural climates are persistent problems.&lt;ref name=Zuckerman&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuckerman|first=Phil|chapter=Atheism: Contemporary Numbers and Patterns|editor-last1=Martin|editor-first1=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=1139827391}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}} One scholar concludes that statistics on religious believers in China "cannot be accurate in a real scientific sense", since definitions of "religion" exclude people who do not see themselves as members of a religious organisation but are still "religious" in their daily actions and fundamental beliefs.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=9}} The forms of Chinese religious expression tend to be [[syncretism|syncretic]] and following one religion does not necessarily mean the rejection or denial of others.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=10}} In surveys, few people identify as "Taoists" because to most Chinese this term refers to ordained [[Taoist priest|priests of the religion]]. Traditionally, the Chinese language has not included a term for a lay follower of Taoism,{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=326}} since the concept of being "Taoist" in this sense is a new word that derives from the Western concept of "religion" as membership in a church institution.

Analysing Chinese traditional religions is further complicated by discrepancies between the terminologies used in Chinese and Western languages. While in the English current usage "folk religion" means broadly all forms of common [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] of gods and ancestors, in Chinese usage and in academia these cults have not had an overarching name. By "folk religion" (民間宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'') or "folk beliefs" (民間信仰 ''mínjiān xìnyǎng'') Chinese scholars have usually meant [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious organisations and salvationist movements]] (folk religious sects).{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=12, quoting: "Chinese sectarianism, millennialism and heterodoxy, called 'popular religious sects' (''minjian zongjiao'' 民間宗教, ''minjian jiaomen'' 民間教門, ''minjian jiaopai'' 民間教派) in the Chinese scholarship, often inextricable from debates on the exact nature of the so-called 'White Lotus' tradition."; p. 14: "The local and anthropological focus of these studies, and their undermining of rigid distinctions between 'sectarian' groups and other forms of local religiosity, tends to draw them into the category of 'popular religion' 民間信仰."}}{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=393|ps=: "[...] The problem started when the Taiwanese translator of my paper chose to render 'popular religion' literally as ''minjian zongjiao'' 民間宗教. The immediate association this term caused in the minds of many Taiwanese and practically all mainland Chinese participants in the conference was of popular sects (''minjian jiaopai'' 民間教派), rather than the local and communal religious life that was the main focus of my paper."}} Furthermore, in the 1990s some of these organisations began to register as branches of the official Taoist Association and therefore to fall under the label of "Taoism".{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=347, quoting: "[Since the 1990s] [...] a number of [...] [[Chinese salvationist religions|lay salvationist groups]] (such as Xiantiandao in southern China and Hongyangism [弘阳教 ''Hóngyáng jiào''] in Hebei) also successfully registered with the Taoist association, thus gaining legitimacy."}} In order to address this terminological confusion, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed the legal recognition and management of the indigenous religion by the state and to adopt the label "Chinese native (or indigenous) religion" (民俗宗教 ''mínsú zōngjiào'') or "Chinese ethnic religion" (民族宗教 ''mínzú zōngjiào''),{{sfnb|Clart|2014|pp=402–406}} or other names.{{refn|group=note|Other names that have been proposed are:{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=409}}

There has been much speculation by some Western authors about the number of Christians in China. Chris White, in a 2017 work for the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity of the [[Max Planck Society]], criticises the data and narratives put forward by these authors. He notices that these authors work in the wake of a "Western evangelical bias" reflected in the coverage carried forward by popular media, especially in the [[United States]], which rely upon a "considerable romanticisation" of Chinese Christians. Their data are mostly ungrounded or manipulated through undue interpretations, as "survey results do not support the authors' assertions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=White|first=Chris|title=Counting Christians in China: A critical reading of ''A star in the East: The rise of Christianity in China''|url=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/wp/WP_17-03_Chris-White_Counting-Christians-in-China.pdf|series=MMG Working Paper 17-03|publisher=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity|location=Göttingen|issn=2192-2357|year=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613131056/http://www.mmg.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/wp/WP_17-03_Chris-White_Counting-Christians-in-China.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yu Tao's survey of the year 2008 provided a detailed analysis of the social characteristics of the religious communities.&lt;ref name="ECRAN2012"/&gt; It found that the proportion of male believers was higher than the average among folk religious people, Taoists, and Catholics, while it was lower than the average among Protestants. The Buddhist community shew a greater balance of male and female believers. Concerning the age of believers, folk religious people and Catholics tended to be younger than the average, while Protestant and Taoist communities were composed by older people. The Christian community was more likely than other religions to have members belonging to the [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]]. The study analysed the proportion of believers that were at the same time members of the local section of the [[Communist Party of China]], finding that it was exceptionally high among the Taoists, while the lowest proportion was found among the Protestants. About education and wealth, the survey found that the wealthiest populations were those of Buddhists and especially Catholics, while the poorest was that of the Protestants; Taoists and Catholics were the better educated, while the Protestants were the less educated among the religious communities.

The varieties of Chinese religion are spread across the map of China in different degrees.

The deep and rich ritual traditions share close similarities with those of Taiwan and overseas Chinese and financial help from these connections make coastal Fujian a frontrunner in reviving local communal religion."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Waldron|1998|p=325}} although it is present all over China in a great variety of forms, intertwined with [[Taoism]], [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|''fashi'' orders]], [[Confucianism]], [[Nuo folk religion|Nuo rituals]], [[Chinese shamanism|shamanism]] and other religious currents. [[Quanzhen Taoism]] is mostly present in the north, while [[Sichuan]] is the area where [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Tianshi Taoism]] developed and the early [[Celestial Masters]] had their main seat. Along the southeastern coast, Taoism reportedly dominates the ritual activity of popular religion, both in registered and unregistered forms ([[Zhengyi Dao|Zhengyi Taoism]] and unrecognised ''fashi'' orders). Since the 1990s, Taoism has been well-developed in the area.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93, quoting: "By the early 1990s Daoist activities had become popular especially in rural areas, and began to get out of control as the line between legitimate Daoist activities and popular folk religious activities - officially regarded as feudal superstition - became blurred. [...] Unregulated activities can range from orthodox Daoist liturgy to shamanistic rites. The popularity of these Daoist activities underscores the fact that Chinese rural society has a long tradition of religiosity and has preserved and perpetuated Daoism regardless of official policy and religious institutions. With the growth of economic prosperity in rural areas, especially in the coastal provinces where Daoist activities are concentrated, with a more liberal policy on religion, and with the revival of local cultural identity, Daoism - be it the officially sanctioned variety or Daoist activities which are beyond the edge of the official Daoist body - seems to be enjoying a strong comeback, at least for the time being."}}{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=185|ps=: about Taoism in southeastern China: "Ethnographic research into the temple festivals and communal rituals celebrated within these god cults has revealed the widespread distribution of Daoist ritual traditions in this area, including especially Zhengyi (Celestial Master Daoism) and variants of Lushan Daoist ritual traditions. Various Buddhist ritual traditions (Pu'anjiao, Xianghua married monks and so on) are practised throughout this region, particularly for requiem services".

Many scholars see "north Chinese religion" as distinct from practices in the south.&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goossaert|first=Vincent|title=Is There a North China Religion?

The folk religion of central-northern China ([[North China Plain]]), otherwise, is focused on the communal worship of [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of creation and nature as identitary symbols, by villages populated by families of different surnames,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|pp=12–13|ps=: "As for the physical and social structure of villages on this vast flat expanse; they consist of close groups of houses built on a raised area, surrounded by their fields, with a multi-surnamed population of families who own and cultivate their own land, though usually not much more than twenty ''mou'' or about three acres. [...] Families of different surnames living in one small community meant that lineages were not strong enough to maintain lineage shrines and cross-village organizations, so, at best, they owned small burial plots and took part only in intra-village activities. The old imperial government encouraged villages to manage themselves and collect and hand over their own taxes. [...] leaders were responsible for settling disputes, dealing with local government, organizing crop protection and planning for collective ceremonies. All these factors tended to strengthen the local protective deities and their temples as focal points of village identity and activity. This social context defines North China local religion, and keeps us from wandering off into vague discussions of 'popular' and 'elite' and relationships with Daoism and Buddhism."}} structured into "communities of the god(s)" (''shénshè'' 神社, or ''huì'' 会, "association"),{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=xii}} which organise temple ceremonies (''[[miaohui]]'' 庙会), involving processions and pilgrimages,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=10|ps=: "There were and are many such pilgrimages to regional and national temples in China, and of course such pilgrimages cannot always be clearly distinguished from festivals for the gods or saints of local communities, because such festivals can involve participants from surrounding villages and home communities celebrating the birthdays or death days of their patron gods or saints, whatever their appeal to those from other areas. People worship and petition at both pilgrimages and local festivals for similar reasons. The chief differences between the two are the central role of a journey in pilgrimages, the size of the area from which participants are attracted, and the role of pilgrimage societies in organizing the long trips that may be involved. [...] pilgrimage in China is also characterized by extensive planning and organization both by the host temples and those visiting them."}} and led by indigenous ritual masters (''fashi'') who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority.{{refn|group=note|Overmyer (2009, p. 73), says that from the late 19th to the 20th century few professional priests (i.e. licensed Taoists) were involved in local religion in the central and northern provinces of China, and discusses various types of folk ritual specialists including: the ''yuehu'' 樂戶, the ''zhuli'' 主禮 (p. 74), the ''shenjia'' 神家 ("godly families", hereditary specialists of gods and their rites; p. 77), then (p. 179) the ''yinyang'' or ''fengshui'' masters (as "[...] folk Zhengyi Daoists of the Lingbao scriptural tradition, living as ordinary peasants. They earn their living both as a group from performing public rituals, and individually [...] by doing geomancy and calendrical consultations for ''fengshui'' and auspicious days"; quoting: S. Jones (2007), ''Ritual and Music of North China: Shawm Bands in Shanxi''). He also describes shamans or media known by different names: ''mapi'' 馬裨, ''wupo'' 巫婆, ''shen momo'' 神嬤嬤 or ''shen han'' 神漢 (p. 87); ''xingdao de'' 香道的 ("practitioners of the incense way"; p. 85); village ''xiangtou'' 香頭 ("incense heads"; p. 86); ''matong'' 馬童 (the same as southern ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|jitong]]''), either ''wushen'' 巫神 (possessed by gods) or ''shenguan'' 神官 (possessed by immortals; pp. 88-89); or "godly sages" (''shensheng'' 神聖; p. 91). Further (p. 76), he discusses, for example, the ''sai'' 賽, ceremonies of thanksgiving to the gods in [[Shanxi]] with roots in the [[Song dynasty|Song era]], whose leaders very often corresponded to local political authorities. This pattern continues today with former village Communist Party secretaries elected as temple association bosses (p. 83). He concludes (p. 92): "In sum, since at least the early twentieth century the majority of local ritual leaders in north China have been products of their own or nearby communities. They have special skills in organization, ritual performance or interaction with the gods, but none are full-time ritual specialists; they have all ‘kept their day jobs’! As such they are exemplars of ordinary people organizing and carrying out their own cultural traditions, persistent traditions with their own structure, functions and logic that deserve to be understood as such."}} Northern and southern folk religions also have a different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of [[Chinese mythology]].{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=3|ps=: "[...] there are significant differences between aspects of local religion in the south and north, one of which is the gods who are worshiped."; p. 33: "[...] the veneration in the north of ancient deities attested to in pre-Han sources, deities such as Nüwa, Fuxi and Shennong, the legendary founder of agriculture and herbal medicine. In some instances these gods were worshiped at places believed to be where they originated, with indications of grottoes, temples and festivals for them, some of which continue to exist or have been revived. Of course, these gods were worshiped elsewhere in China as well, though perhaps not with the same sense of original geographical location."}}

[[Chinese salvationist religions|Folk religious movements of salvation]] have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern popular religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the great importance given to [[Chinese mother goddess worship|mother goddess worship]] and shamanism,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2009|p=15|ps=: "[...] Popular religious sects with their own forms of organization, leaders, deities, rituals, beliefs and scripture texts were active throughout the Ming and Qing periods, particularly in north China. Individuals and families who joined them were promised special divine protection in this life and the next by leaders who functioned both as ritual masters and missionaries. These sects were more active in some communities than in others, but in principle were open to all who responded to these leaders and believed in their efficacy and teachings, so some of these groups spread to wide areas of the country. [...] significant for us here though is evidence for the residual influence of sectarian beliefs and practices on non-sectarian community religion where the sects no longer exist, particularly the feminization of deities by adding to their names the characters ''mu'' or ''Laomu'', Mother or Venerable Mother, as in ''Guanyin Laomu'', ''Puxianmu'', ''Dizangmu'', etc., based on the name of the chief sectarian deity, ''Wusheng Laomu'', the Eternal Venerable Mother. ''Puxian'' and ''Dizang'' are bodhisattvas normally considered 'male', though in Buddhist theory such gender categories don’t really apply. This practice of adding ''mu'' to the names of deities, found already in Ming period sectarian scriptures called ''baojuan'' 'precious volumes' from the north, does not occur in the names of southern deities."}} as well as their scriptural transmission.&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|92}} Also [[Confucian churches]] and ''jiaohua'' organisations have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the [[Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue]] alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of [[Manchukuo|Manchuria]]{{sfnb|Ownby|2008}} and contemporary [[Shandong]] has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups.{{sfnb|Payette|2016}}

The [[Northeast China folk religion|folk religion of northeast China]] ([[Manchuria]]) has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] and [[Manchu shamanism]]s; these include the practice of ''chūmǎxiān'' (出马仙 "riding for the immortals"), the worship of [[Huxian|Fox Gods]] and other [[animal worship|zoomorphic deities]], and of the Great Lord of the Three Foxes (胡三太爷 ''Húsān Tàiyé'') and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (胡三太奶 ''Húsān Tàinǎi'') usually positioned at the head of [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s.&lt;ref name="Deng-chumaxian"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Deng|first=Claire Qiuju|date=2014|title=Action-Taking Gods: Animal Spirit Shamanism in Liaoning, China|type=Master in East Asian Studies|publisher=McGill University, Department of East Asian Studies|location=Montreal|url=http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1516144818863~461|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116232101/http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1516144818863~461|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, in the [[religion in Inner Mongolia|religious context of Inner Mongolia]] there has been a significant integration of [[Han Chinese]] into the traditional folk religion of the region.

The [[Chinese Buddhism|Han Chinese schools of Buddhism]] are mostly practised in the eastern part of the country. On the other hand, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is the dominant religion in [[Tibet]], and significantly present in other westernmost provinces where ethnic [[Tibetans]] constitute a significant part of the population, and has a strong influence in [[Inner Mongolia]] in the north. The Tibetan tradition has also been gaining a growing influence among the Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Jones|first=A. D.|title=Contemporary Han Chinese Involvement in Tibetan Buddhism: A Case Study from Nanjing|journal=Social Compass|year=2011|volume=58|number=4|pages=540–553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians are especially concentrated in the three provinces of [[Henan]], [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref name="Yip, 2006. p. 186"&gt;Francis Ching-Wah Yip, in Miller, 2006. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two provinces were in the area affected by the [[Taiping Rebellion]], and Zhejiang along with Henan were hubs of the [[Protestant missions in China 1807–1953|intense Protestant missionary activity in the 19th and early 20th century]].

[[Islam]] is the majority religion in areas inhabited by the [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, particularly the province of [[Ningxia]], and in the province of [[Xinjiang]] that is inhabited by the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]]. Many [[list of ethnic groups in China|ethnic minority groups in China]] follow their own traditional ethnic religions: [[Benzhuism]] of the [[Bai people|Bai]], [[Bimoism]] of the [[Yi people|Yi]], [[Bon|Bön]] of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Dongbaism]] of the [[Nakhi people|Nakhi]], [[Miao folk religion]], [[Qiang folk religion]], [[Yao folk religion]], [[Zhuang folk religion]], [[Mongols in China|Mongolian]] shamanism or Tengerism, and Manchu shamanism among [[Manchu people|Manchus]].

Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups. 
* [[Hebei]]: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois{{sfnb|Dubois|2005}} testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the [[Church of the Highest Supreme]], since their "energetic revival since the 1970s" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the [[associations of good-doing|benevolent churches]] and the salvationist movement known as [[Zailiism]] has returned active since the 1990s.
* [[Henan]]: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Heberer|first1=Thomas|last2=Jakobi|first2=Sabine|title=Henan - The Model: From Hegemonism to Fragmentism.

Sects present in the region include the [[Baguadao]] or Tianli ("Order of Heaven") sect, the Dadaohui, the [[Tianxianmiaodao]], the [[Yiguandao]], and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).
* [[Northeast China]]: According to official records by the then-government, the [[Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue]] or Morality Society had 8 million members in [[Manchuria]], or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).{{sfnb|Ownby|2008}} Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.
* [[Shandong]]: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the [[Guiyidao|Way of the Return to the One]] (皈依道 ''Guīyīdào''), the [[Yiguandao|Way of Unity]] (一貫道 ''Yīguàndào''), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.{{sfnb|Payette|2016}}

According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Lu 卢|first=Yunfeng 云峰|title=卢云峰：当代中国宗教状况报告——基于CFPS（2012）调查数据|trans-title=Report on Religions in Contemporary China – Based on CFPS (2012) Survey Data|journal=World Religious Cultures|year=2014|number=1|url=http://iwr.cass.cn/zjwh/201403/W020140303370398758556.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809051625/http://iwr.cass.cn/zjwh/201403/W020140303370398758556.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2014}} p. 13.

===Centring and ancestrality===
{{See also|Chinese ancestral religion}}
[[Han Chinese]] culture embodies a concept of religion that differs from the one that is common in the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic traditions]], which are based on the belief in an omnipotent God who exists outside the world and human race and has complete power over them.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=39}} Chinese religions, in general, do not place as much emphasis as Christianity does on exclusivity and doctrine.{{sfnb|Adler|2005|p=2}}

Han Chinese culture is marked by a "harmonious holism"{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=10–11}} in which religious expression is syncretic and religious systems encompass elements that grow, change, and transform but remain within an organic whole. The performance of rites (礼 ''lǐ'') is the key characteristic of common Chinese religion, which scholars see as going back to Neolithic times. According to the scholar [[Stephan Feuchtwang]], rites are conceived as "what makes the invisible visible", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as "centring" (央 ''yāng'' or 中 ''zhōng''). Rituals may be performed by government officials, family elders, popular ritual masters and Taoists, the latter cultivating local gods to centre the forces of the universe upon a particular locality. Among all things of creation, humans themselves are "central" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}

This primordial sense of ritual united the moral and the religious and drew no boundaries between family, social, and political life. From earliest times, the Chinese tended to be all-embracing rather than to treat different religious traditions as separate and independent. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao]] argues that the term "Chinese religion", therefore, does not imply that there is only one religious system, but that the "different ways of believing and practicing... are rooted in and can be defined by culturally common themes and features", and that "different religious streams and strands have formed a culturally unitary single tradition" in which basic concepts and practices are related.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=10–11}}

The continuity of Chinese civilisation across thousands of years and thousands of square miles is made possible through China's religious traditions understood as systems of knowledge transmission.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} A worthy Chinese is supposed to remember a vast amount of information from the past, and to draw on this past to form his moral reasoning.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=17}} The remembrance of the past and of ancestors is important for individuals and groups. The identities of descent-based groups are molded by stories, written genealogies (''[[zupu]]'', "books of ancestors"), temple activities, and village theatre which link them to history.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}}

This reliance on group memory is the foundation of the Chinese practice of [[Chinese ancestor worship|ancestor worship]] (拜祖 ''bàizǔ'' or 敬祖 ''jìngzǔ'') which dates back to prehistory, and is the focal aspect of Chinese religion.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=18}} Defined as "the essential religion of the Chinese", ancestor worship is the means of memory and therefore of the cultural vitality of the entire Chinese civilisation.{{sfnb|Yang|1961|p=53}} Rites, symbols, objects and ideas construct and transmit group and individual identities.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=144–153}} Rituals and sacrifices are employed not only to seek blessing from the ancestors, but also to create a communal and educational religious environment in which people are firmly linked with a glorified history. Ancestors are evoked as gods and kept alive in these ceremonies to bring good luck and protect from evil forces and [[ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts]].{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=114, 177}}

The two major festivals involving ancestor worship are the [[Qingming Festival]] and the [[Double Ninth Festival]], but veneration of ancestors is held in many other ceremonies, including [[Chinese marriage|weddings]], funerals, and [[triad (underground society)|triad]] initiations. Worshippers generally offer prayers through a ''[[jingxiang]]'' rite, with offerings of food, light [[incense]] and candles, and burning [[joss paper]]. These activities are typically conducted at the site of ancestral graves or tombs, at an ancestral temple, or at a household shrine.

A practice developed in the Chinese folk religion of post-Maoist China, that started in the 1990s from the [[Temple of Confucius|Confucian temples]] managed by the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself), is the representation of ancestors in [[ancestral shrine]]s no longer just through tablets with their names, but through statues. Statuary effigies were previously exclusively used for Buddhist bodhisattva and Taoist gods.{{sfnb|Jing|1996|pp=152–153}}

[[Chinese lineage associations|Lineage cults]] of the founders of [[Chinese surname|surname]]s and [[Chinese kin|kins]] are religious microcosms which are part of a larger organism, that is the cults of the ancestor-gods of regional and ethnic groups, which in turn are part of a further macrocosm, the cults of virtuous historical figures that have had an important impact in the history of China, notable examples including [[Confucius]], [[Guan Yu|Guandi]], or [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]] and [[Chiyou]], the latter three considered ancestor-gods of the [[Han Chinese]] (Huangdi and Yandi) and of western minority ethnicities and foreigners (Chiyou). This hierarchy proceeds up to the gods of the cosmos, the [[Di (Chinese concept)|Earth]] and [[Tian|Heaven]] itself. In other words, ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=76–77}} and are therefore the means connecting back to Heaven as the "utmost ancestral father" (曾祖父 ''zēngzǔfù'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=84, note 282}}

"Theories of Religion in Contemporary China"}} ''Tian'' is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]], manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature. In the ''Wujing yiyi'' (五經異義, "Different Meanings in the [[Five Classics]]"), [[Xu Shen]] explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65. Ch. Zhuo, Xinping. "Theories of Religion in Contemporary China"}}
* ''Huáng Tiān'' 皇天 —"Yellow Heaven" or "Shining Heaven", when it is venerated as the lord of creation;
* ''Hào Tiān'' 昊天—"Vast Heaven", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (''qi'');
* ''Mín Tiān'' 旻天—"Compassionate Heaven", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-Heaven;
* ''Shàng Tiān'' 上天—"Highest Heaven" or "First Heaven", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven;
* ''Cāng Tiān'' 苍天—"Deep-Green Heaven", for it being unfathomably deep.

''Di'' 帝 is rendered as "deity" or "emperor" and describes a divine principle that exerts a fatherly dominance over what it produces.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64. Ch. Zhuo, Xinping. "Theories of Religion in Contemporary China"}}}} ''[[Tengri]]'' is the equivalent of Tian in [[Altaic]] [[shamanism|shamanic]] religions. By the words of Stephan Feuchtwang, in Chinese cosmology "the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy" (''[[hundun]]'' 混沌 and ''[[qi]]''), organising as the polarity of [[yin and yang]] which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''. Yin and yang are the invisible and the visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order).{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}

While Confucian theology emphasises the need to realise the starry order of the Heaven in human society, Taoist theology emphasises the ''[[Tao]]'' 道 ("Way"), which in one word denotes both the source and its spontaneous arising in nature.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} In the Confucian text "On Rectification" (''Zheng lun'') of the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', the God of Heaven is discussed as an active power setting in motion creation.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}} In the tradition of [[New Text Confucianism]], [[Confucius]] is regarded as a "throne-less king" of the God of Heaven and a savior of the world. Otherwise, the school of the [[Old Texts]] regards Confucius as a sage who gave a new interpretation to the tradition from previous great dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chai|first1=Ch'u|last2=Chai|first2=Winberg|title=The Sacred Books of Confucius and Other Confucian Classics|year=1965|publisher=University Books|asin=B0006BN5QY}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] thinkers such as [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200) developed the idea of ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|Lǐ]]'' 理, the "reason", "order" of Heaven, which unfolds in the polarity of yin and yang.{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=13}} In Taoist theology, the God of Heaven is discussed as the Jade Purity (玉清 ''Yùqīng''), the "Heavenly Honourable of the First Beginning" (元始天尊 ''[[Yuanshi Tianzun|Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn]]''), the central of the [[Three Pure Ones]]—who represent the centre of the universe and its two modalities of manifestation. Even [[Chinese Buddhism]] adapted to common Chinese cosmology by paralleling its concept of a triune supreme with [[Shakyamuni]], [[Amithaba]] and [[Maitreya]] representing respectively enlightenment, salvation and post-apocalyptic paradise,{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=151}} while the [[Tathātā]] (真如 ''zhēnrú'', "suchness") is generally identified as the supreme being itself.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}}

In Chinese religion, Tian is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]],{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=5}} inherent in the multiple phenomena of nature ([[polytheism]] or [[pantheism|cosmotheism]], ''yǔzhòu shénlùn'' 宇宙神论).{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71. Ch. Zhuo, Xinping. "Theories of Religion in Contemporary China"}} The ''shén'' 神, as explained in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', "are the spirits of Heaven. They draw out the ten thousand things".{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=33}} ''Shen'' and ancestors (祖 ''zǔ'') are agents who generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the order of Heaven. ''Shen'', as defined by the scholar [[Stephen Teiser]], is a term that needs to be translated into English in at least three different ways, according to the context: "spirit", "spirits", and "spiritual". The first, "spirit", is in the sense of "human spirit" or "psyche". The second use is "spirits" or "gods"—the latter written in lowercase because "Chinese spirits and gods need not be seen as all-powerful, transcendent, or creators of the world". These "spirits" are associated with stars, mountains, and streams and directly influence what happens in the natural and human world. A thing or being is "spiritual"—the third sense of ''shen''—when it inspires awe or wonder.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|pp=31–32}}

''Shen'' are opposed in several ways to ''guǐ'' 鬼 ("ghosts", or "demons"). ''Shen'' are considered ''yáng'' 阴, while ''gui'' are ''yīn'' 阴.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|pp=31–32}} ''Gui'' may be the spirit or soul of an ancestor called back to live in the family's spirit tablet.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=81}} Yet the combination 鬼神 ''guǐshén'' ("ghosts and spirits") includes both good and bad, those that are lucky or unlucky, benevolent or malevolent, the heavenly ad the demonic aspect of living beings. This duality of ''guishen''  animates all beings, whether rocks, trees, and planets, or animals and human beings. In this sense, "animism" may be said to characterise the Chinese worldview. Further, since humans, ''shen'', and ''gui'' are all made of 气 ''qì'' (''[[pneuma]]'' or primordial stuff), there is no gap or barrier between good and bad spirits or between these spirits and human beings. There is no ontological difference between gods and demons, and humans may emulate the gods and join them in the pantheon.{{sfnb|Teiser|1996|p=31-32}} If these spirits are neglected or abandoned, or were not treated with death rituals if they were humans, they become [[hungry ghost|hungry]] and are trapped in places where they met their death, becoming dangerous for living beings and requiring exorcism.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=152}}

The Big Dipper or Great Chariot in Chinese culture (as in other traditional cultures) is a symbol of the ''[[axis mundi]]'', Heaven in its way of manifestation, order of creation (''li'' or ''Tao'').

The symbol, also called the Gate of Heaven (天门 ''Tiānmén''), is widely used in esoteric and mystical literature. For example, an excerpt from [[Shangqing Taoism]]'s texts:
:"Life and death, separation and convergence, all derive from the seven stars. Thus when the Big Dipper impinges on someone, he dies, and when it moves, he lives. That is why the seven stars are Heaven's chancellor, the yamen where the gate is opened to give life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bai Bin|chapter=Daoism in Graves|editor-last1=Marsone|editor-first1=Pierre|editor-last2=Lagerwey|editor-first2=John|title=Modern Chinese Religion I: Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|year=2014|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004271643}} p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There was no term that corresponded to "religion" in [[Classical Chinese]].{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=25}} The combination of ''zong'' (宗) and ''jiao'' (教), which now corresponds to "religion", was in circulation since the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] circles to define the Buddhist doctrine. It was chosen to translate the Western concept "religion" only at the end of the 19th century, when Chinese intellectuals adopted the Japanese term ''shūkyō'' (pronounced ''zongjiao'' in Chinese).{{sfnb|Chen|2012|pp=14–15}} Under the influence of Western rationalism and later Marxism, what most of the Chinese today mean as ''zōngjiào'' are "organised doctrines", that is "superstructures consisting of superstitions, dogmas, rituals and institutions".{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=28}} Most academics in China use the term "religion" (''zongjiao'') to include formal institutions, specific beliefs, a clergy, and sacred texts, while Western scholars tend to use the term more loosely.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|pp=394–395}}

''Zōng'' (宗 "ancestor", "model", "mode", "master", "pattern", but also "purpose") implies that the understanding of the ultimate derives from the transformed figure of great ancestors or progenitors, who continue to support—and correspondingly rely on—their descendants, in a mutual exchange of benefit.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=40}} ''Jiào'' (教 "teaching") is connected to [[filial piety]] (''xiao''), as it implies the transmission of knowledge from the elders to the youth and of support from the youth to the elders.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=40}}

Understanding religion primarily as an ancestral tradition, the Chinese have a relationship with the divine that functions socially, politically as well as spiritually.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=39}} The Chinese concept of "religion" draws the divine near to the human world.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=39}} Because "religion" refers to the bond between the human and the divine, there is always a danger that this bond be broken.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=40}} However, the term ''zōngjiào''—instead of separation—emphasises communication, correspondence and mutuality between the ancestor and the descendant, the master and the disciple, and between the Way (Tao, the way of the divine in nature) and its ways.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=40}} Ancestors are the mediators of Heaven.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=116}} In other words, to the Chinese, the supreme principle is manifested and embodied by the chief gods of each phenomenon and of each human kin, making the worship of the highest God possible even in each [[ancestral temple]].{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=39}}

Chinese concepts of religion differ from concepts in Judaism and Christianity, says scholar Julia Ching, which were "religions of the fathers", that is, patriarchal religions, whereas Chinese religion was not only "a patriarchal religion but also an ancestral religion". Israel believed in the "God of its fathers, but not its divinised fathers". Among the ancient Chinese, the God of the Zhou dynasty appeared to have been an ancestor of the ruling house. "The belief in Tian (Heaven) as the great ancestral spirit differed from the Judeo-Christian, and later Islamic belief in a creator God". Early Christianity's [[Church Fathers]] pointed out that the [[thou shalt have no other gods before me|First Commandment]] injunction, "thou shalt have no other gods before me", reserved all worship for one God, and that prayers therefore might not be offered ''to'' the dead, even though Judaism, Christianity, and Islam did encourage prayers ''for'' the dead.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|pp=18–19}} Unlike the Abrahamic traditions in which living beings are created by God out of nothing, in Chinese religions all living beings descend from beings that existed before. These ancestors are the roots of current and future beings. They continue to live in the lineage which they begot, and are cultivated as models and exemplars by their descendants.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|pp=114–116}}

The mutual support of elders and youth is needed for the continuity of the ancestral tradition, that is communicated from generation to generation.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=40}} With an understanding of religion as teaching and education, the Chinese have a staunch confidence in the human capacity of transformation and perfection, enlightenment or immortality.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=41}} In the Chinese religions, humans are confirmed and reconfirmed with the ability to improve themselves, in a positive attitude towards eternity.{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=41}} [[Hans Küng]] defined Chinese religions as the "religions of wisdom", thereby distinguishing them from the "religions of prophecy" (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and from the "religions of mysticism" (Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism).{{sfnb|Yao|2010|p=41}}

The cults of gods and ancestors that in recent (originally Western) literature have been classified as "[[Chinese folk religion|Chinese popular religion]]", traditionally neither have a common name nor are considered ''zōngjiào'' ("doctrines").{{sfnb|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=1}} The lack of an overarching name conceptualising Chinese local and indigenous cults has led to some confusion in the terminology employed in scholarly literature. In Chinese, with the terms usually translated in English as "folk religion" (i.e. 民間宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'') or "folk faith" (i.e. 民間信仰 ''mínjiān xìnyǎng'') they generally refer to the [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious movements of salvation]], and not to the local and indigenous cults of gods and ancestors. To resolve this issue, some Chinese intellectuals have proposed to formally adopt "Chinese native religion" or "Chinese indigenous religion" (i.e. 民俗宗教 ''mínsú zōngjiào''), or "Chinese ethnic religion" (i.e. 民族宗教 ''mínzú zōngjiào''), or even "Chinese religion" (中華教 ''Zhōnghuájiào'') and "Shenxianism" (神仙教 ''Shénxiānjiào''), as single names for the local indigenous cults of China.{{sfnb|Clart|2014|pp=393–409}}

This religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern [[Taiwan]], and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural China, especially the southern and eastern coasts.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|pp=226–230}}

According to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the reconstruction of patriarchal civilisation:
::"Similar to the case in Taiwan, the practice of folk religion in rural southern China, particularly in the Pearl River Delta, has thrived as the economy has developed. [...] In contrast to [[Max Weber|Weberian]] predictions, these phenomena suggest that drastic economic development in the Pearl River Delta may not lead to total disenchantment with beliefs concerning magic in the cosmos. On the contrary, the revival of folk religions in the Delta region is serving as a countervailing re-embedding force from the local cultural context, leading to the coexistence of the world of enchantments and the modern world."{{sfnb|Law|2005|p=90}}

Yang defined it as an "embedded capitalism", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an "ethical capitalism" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity that foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society.{{sfnb|Yang|2007|p=223}} Hao (2017) defined [[ancestral shrine|lineage temples]] as nodes of economic and political power which work through the principle of [[crowdfunding]] (''zhongchou''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Hao|first=Lizhou|title=Crowdfunding and the Family Temple Economy|date=12 January 2017|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology|series=Realising Eurasia: Civilisation and Moral Economy in the 21st Century|url=https://www.eth.mpg.de/4311046/blog_2017_01_12_01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116060920/https://www.eth.mpg.de/4311046/blog_2017_01_12_01|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::"A successful family temple economy expands its clientele from lineage relatives to strangers from other villages and kin groups by shifting from the worship of a single ancestor to embrace diverse religions. In this way, the management of a temple metamorphoses into a real business. Most Shishi villages have associations for the elderly (''laorenhui''), which are formed through a 'civil election' (''minxuan'') among prosperous businessmen representing their family committees. This association resembles the local government of a village, with responsibilities for popular rituals as well as public order."

{{Main article|Chinese folk religion}}
Chinese popular or folk religion, otherwise simply said "Chinese religion", is the "background" religious tradition of the Chinese, whose practices and beliefs are shared by both the elites and the common people. This tradition includes veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief that a rational order structures the universe, and such order may be influenced by human beings and their rulers. Worship is devoted to [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods and immortals]] (''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'' and ''[[xian (Taoism)|xiān]]''), who may be [[progenitor|founders of human groups and lineages]], [[deity|deities]] of stars, earthly phenomena, and of human behaviour.{{sfnb|Teiser|1995|p=378}}

Chinese popular religion is "diffused", rather than "institutional", in the sense that there are no canonical scriptures or unified clergy—though it relies upon the vast heritage represented by the [[Chinese classics]]—, and its practices and beliefs are handed down over the generations through [[Chinese mythology]] as told in popular forms of literature, theatre, and visual arts, and are embedded in rituals which define the microcosm of the nuclear families, the [[Chinese kin|kins or lineages]] (which are peoples within the Chinese people, identified by the same surnames and by the same ancestor-god), and professional guilds, rather than in institutions with merely religious functions.{{sfnb|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=1}} It is a meaning system of social solidarity and identity, which provides the fabric of Chinese society, uniting all its levels from the lineages to the village or city communities, to the state and the national economy.

Because this common religion is embedded in Chinese social relations, it historically has never had an objectifying name.{{sfnb|Shahar|Weller|1996|p=1}} Since the 2000s, Chinese scholars have proposed names to identify it more clearly, including "Chinese native religion" or "Chinese indigenous religion" (民俗宗教 ''mínsú zōngjiào''), "Chinese ethnic religion" (民族宗教 ''mínzú zōngjiào''), or simply "Chinese religion" (中華教 ''Zhōnghuájiào''), "[[Shenism]]" (神教 ''Shénjiào'') and "Shenxianism" (神仙教 ''Shénxiānjiào'', "religion of deities and immortals"). This search for a precise name is meant to solve terminological confusion, since "folk religion" (民间宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'') or "folk belief" (民间信仰 ''mínjiān xìnyǎng'') have historically defined the [[Chinese salvationist religions|sectarian movements of salvation]] and not the local [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] devoted to deities and progenitors, and it is also meant to identify a "national Chinese religion" similarly to [[Hinduism]] in [[India]] and [[Shinto]] in [[Japan]].{{sfnb|Clart|2014|pp=393–409}}

[[Taoism]] has been defined by scholar and Taoist initiate [[Kristofer Schipper]] as a doctrinal and liturgical framework for the development of indigenous religions.&lt;ref name="Wu2014"&gt;{{cite article|last=Wu|first=Nengchang|title=Religion and Society.

Various [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|vernacular orders of ritual ministers]] often identified as "folk Taoists", operate in folk religion but outside the jurisdiction of the state's Taoist Church or schools clearly identified as Taoist. [[Confucianism]] advocates the worship of gods and ancestors through appropriate rites.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|pp=35–37}}{{sfnb|Shen|Shun|2007|pp=278–279}} Folk temples and ancestral shrines, on special occasions, may use Confucian liturgy (儒 ''rú'' or 正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', "[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]") led by Confucian "sages of rites" (礼生 ''lǐshēng''), who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|pp=3–5}} Taoism in its [[Taoist schools|various currents]], either comprehended or not within Chinese folk religion, has some of its origins from [[Chinese shamanism]] (Wuism).{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}}

Despite this great diversity, all experiences of Chinese religion have a common [[Chinese theology|theological core]] that may be summarised in four cosmological and moral concepts:{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|pp=5–6}} ''[[Tian]]'' (天), Heaven, the [[absolute (philosophy)|"transcendently immanent" source]] of moral meaning; ''[[qi]]'' (气), the breath or energy–matter that animates the universe; ''[[jingzu]]'' (敬祖), the veneration of ancestors; and ''[[bao ying]]'' (报应), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning:{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=21}} ''[[ming yun]]'' (命运), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and ''[[yuan fen]]'' (缘分), "fateful [[coincidence]]",{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=23}} good and bad chances and potential relationships.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2013|p=23}}

In Chinese religion [[yin and yang]] constitute the polarity that describes the order of the universe,{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=13}} held in balance by the interaction of principles of growth or expansion (''shen'') and principles of waning or contraction (''gui''),{{sfnb|Teiser|1996}} with act (''yang'') usually preferred over receptiveness (''yin'').{{sfnb|Do|2003|pp=10–11}} ''[[Ling (Chinese religion)|Ling]]'' ([[numen]] or [[sacred]]) coincides with the middle way between the two states, that is the inchoate order of creation.{{sfnb|Do|2003|pp=10–11}} It is the force establishing responsive communication between yin and yang, and is the power of gods, masters of building and healing, rites and sages.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=151}}

The present-day government of China, like the erstwhile imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing, tolerates popular religious cults if they bolster social stability, but suppresses or persecutes cults and deities which threaten moral order.{{sfnb|Madsen|2010|pp=62–64}} After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate folk religion in order to promote "modern" values while overcoming "feudal superstition". These attitudes began to change in the late 20th century, and contemporary scholars generally have a positive vision of popular religion.{{sfnb|Gaenssbauer|2015|pp=28–37}}

Since the 1980s Chinese folk religions experienced a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official approval as they preserve traditional Chinese culture, including the worship of [[Mazu]] and the school of [[Sanyiism]] in [[Fujian]],&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Religions &amp; Christianity in Today's China|volume=IV|number=1|publisher=China Zentrum|year=2014|issn=2192-9289|url=http://www.china-zentrum.de/fileadmin/downloads/rctc/2014-1/RCTC_2014-1_Complete_Issue.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427152137/http://www.china-zentrum.de/fileadmin/downloads/rctc/2014-1/RCTC_2014-1_Complete_Issue.pdf|archive-date=27 April 2017}} pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] worship,{{sfnb|Sautman|1997|pp=80–81}} and other forms of local worship, for instance the worship of [[Longwang]], [[Pangu]] or [[Caishen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Chau|first=Adam Yuet|title=The Politics of Legitimation and the Revival of Popular Religion in Shaanbei, North-Central China|journal=Modern China|year=2005|volume=31|number=2|pages=236–278|url=https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/faculty/publications/chau/chau-the-politics-of-legitimation-and-the-revival.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808181947/https://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/faculty/publications/chau/chau-the-politics-of-legitimation-and-the-revival.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2015 the government of [[Zhejiang]] began the registration of the province's tens of thousands of folk religious temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=浙江省启动民间信仰活动场所登记编号 昨颁首张证书|trans-title=Zhejiang started yesterday to award registration certificates to folk religious activities|website=Zhejiang News|date=16 April 2015|url=http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/system/2015/04/16/020605163.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427121833/http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/system/2015/04/16/020605163.shtml|archive-date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent [[religion in China#Demographics|demographic analyses]], an average 80% of the population of China, approximately 1 billion people, practises cults of gods and ancestors or belongs to folk religious movements. Moreover, according to one survey approximately 14% of the population claims different levels of affiliation with Taoist practices.&lt;ref name="CSLS2010"/&gt; Other figures from the micro-level testify the wide proliferation of folk religions: in 1989 there were 21,000 male and female shamans (''shen han'' and ''wu po'' respectively, as they are named locally), 60% of them young, in the [[Pingguo County]] of [[Guangxi]] alone;{{sfnb|Jing|1996|p=175}} and by the mid-1990s the government of the [[Yulin, Shaanxi|Yulin Prefecture]] of [[Shaanxi]] counted over 10,000 folk temples on its territory alone,{{sfnb|Chau|2005|p=49}} for a population of 3.1 million, an average of one temple per 315 persons.

====Folk religious movements of salvation====
[[File:河北梅花圣地师祖殿.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of the Founding Father (师祖殿 ''Shīzǔdiàn'') of the principal holy see (圣地 ''shèngdì'') of the [[Meihuaism|Plum Flower]] school in [[Xingtai]], Hebei.]]
{{Main article|Chinese salvationist religions}}
China has a long history of sectarian traditions, called "salvationist religions" (救度宗教 ''jiùdù zōngjiào'') by some scholars, which are characterised by a concern for [[salvation]] (moral fulfillment) of the person and the society, having a [[soteriology|soteriological]] and [[eschatology|eschatological]] character.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=19}} They generally emerged from the common religion but are separate from the lineage cults of [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s, as well as from the communal worship of deities of village temples, neighbourhood, corporation, or national temples.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|pp=19–20}} The 20th-century expression of such religions has been studied under [[Prasenjit Duara]]'s definition of "redemptive societies" (救世团体 ''jiùshì tuántǐ''),{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=17}}{{sfnb|Clart|2014|p=395}} while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as "folk religious sects" (民間宗教 ''mínjiān zōngjiào'', 民间教门 ''mínjiān jiàomén'' or 民间教派 ''mínjiān jiàopài''),{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=12}} overcoming the ancient derogatory definition of ''xiéjiào'' (邪教), "evil religion".{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=23}}

These religions are characterised by [[egalitarianism]], charismatic founding figures claiming to have received divine revelation, a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] eschatology and voluntary path of [[salvation]], an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, [[evangelism]] and [[philanthropy]]. Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and on the recitation of scriptures.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=19}}

Many redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to embody and reform Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=29}} They include{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|pp=4–6}} [[Yiguandao]] and other sects belonging to the [[Xiantiandao]] ({{lang|zh|先天道}} "Way of Former Heaven"), Jiugongdao ({{lang|zh|九宮道}} "Way of the Nine Palaces"), the various branches of [[Luoism]], [[Zailiism]], and more recent ones such as the [[Church of Virtue]], [[Weixinism]], [[Xuanyuanism]] and [[Tiandiism]]. Also the [[qigong]] schools are developments of folk salvationist movements.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=11}} All these movements were banned in the early [[Republic of China (1912–49)]] and later People's Republic. Many of them still remain underground or unrecognised in [[China]], while others—for instance the Church of Virtue, Tiandiism, Xuanyuanism, Weixinism and Yiguandao—operate in China and collaborate with academic and non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"/&gt; [[Sanyiism]] is another folk religious organisation founded in the 16th century, which is present in the [[Putian]] region ([[Putian people|Xinghua]]) of [[Fujian]] where it is legally recognised.&lt;ref name="RCTC2014"/&gt; Some of these movements began to register as branches of the Taoist Association since the 1990s.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=347}}

Another category that has been sometimes confused with that of the folk salvationist movements by scholars is that of the secret societies (會道門 ''huìdàomén'', 祕密社會 ''mìmì shèhuì'', or 秘密結社 ''mìmì jiéshè'').{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|pp=12–13}} They are religious communities of [[initiation|initiatory]] and secretive character, including rural militias such as the Red Spears (紅槍會) and the Big Knives (大刀會), and fraternal organisations such as the Green Gangs (青幫) and the Elders' Societies (哥老會).{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=13}} They were very active in the early republican period, and often identified as "[[heresy|heretical]] doctrines" (宗教異端 ''zōngjiào yìduān'').{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=13}} Recent scholarship has coined the category of "secret sects" (祕密教門 ''mìmì jiàomén'') to distinguish positively-viewed peasant secret societies of the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, from the negatively-viewed secret societies of the early republic which were regarded as anti-revolutionary forces.{{sfnb|Palmer|2011|p=13}}

A further type of folk religious movements, possibly overlapping with the "secret sects", are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the ''wénchǎng'' (文场 "cultural field"), which is a doctrinal aspect characterised by elborate cosmologies, theologies, and liturgies, and usually taught only to initiates; and the ''wǔchǎng'' (武场 "martial field"), that is the practice of bodily cultivation, usually shown as the "public face" of the sect.&lt;ref name="Ambrosi2013"&gt;{{cite article|last=Ambrosi|first=Raymond P.|title=Towards the City!

{{Main article|Confucianism}}
{{See also|Confucian churches|Confucian ritual religion|Holy Confucian Church}}
Confucianism in Chinese is called, 儒教 Rújiào, the "teaching of scholars", or 孔教 Kǒngjiào, the "teaching of Confucius". It is both a teaching and a set of ritual practices. Yong Chen calls the question on the definition of Confucianism "probably one of the most controversial issues in both Confucian scholarship and the discipline of religious studies".{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=9}}

Guy Alitto points out that there was "literally no equivalent for the Western (and later worldwide) concept of 'Confucianism' in traditional Chinese discourse". He argues that the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries of the 16th century]] selected Confucius from many possible sages to serve as the counterpart to Christ or Muhammad in order to meet European religion categories. They used a variety of writings by Confucius and his followers to coin a new "-ism"—"Confucianism"—which they presented as a "rationalist secular-ethical code", not as a religion. This secular understanding of Confucianism inspired both the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe in the 18th century, and Chinese intellectuals of the 20th century. [[Liang Shuming]], a philosopher of the [[May Fourth Movement]], wrote that Confucianism "functioned as a religion without actually being one". Western scholarship generally accepted this understanding. In the decades following the Second World War, however, many Chinese intellectuals and academic scholars in the West, among whom [[Tu Weiming]], reversed this assessment. Confucianism, for this new generation of scholars, became a "true religion" that offered "immanent transcendence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Alitto|editor-first=Guy|title=Contemporary Confucianism in Thought and Action|year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=3662477505}} pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herbert Fingarette]]'s conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which proposes "the [[secularity|secular]] as [[sacred]]",{{sfnb|Fingarette|1972}} Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism. Confucians experience the sacred as existing in this world as part of everyday life, most importantly in family and social relations.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}} Confucianism focuses on a thisworldly awareness of ''[[Tian]]'' (天 "Heaven"),{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}} '''the search for a middle way in order to preserve social harmony and on''' '''respect through teaching and a set of ritual practices'''.{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|pp=34–36}} Joël Thoraval finds that Confucianism expresses on a popular level in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Di]]'' 地), the sovereign or the government (''jūn'' 君), ancestors (''qīn'' 親) and masters (''shī'' 師).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Thoraval|first=Joël|title=Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Ancestors, Masters: Some Remarks on the Politico-Religious in China Today|series=Occasional Papers|number=5|year=2016|publisher=Centre for Studies on China, Korea and Japan|location=Paris, France|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116171349/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confucians cultivate family bonds and social harmony rather than pursuing a transcendental salvation.{{sfnb|Fingarette|1972|pp=1–2}} The scholar Joseph Adler concludes that Confucianism is not so much a religion in the Western sense, but rather "a non-theistic, diffused religious tradition", and that ''Tian'' is not so much a personal God but rather "an impersonal absolute, like ''dao'' and ''Brahman''".{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}}

Broadly speaking, however, scholars agree that Confucianism may be also defined as an [[ethics|ethico]]-[[politics|political]] system, developed from the teachings of the philosopher [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE). Confucianism originated during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and developed [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] elements in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE),{{sfnb|Craig|1998|p=550}} to match the developments in Buddhism and Taoism which were dominant among the populace. By the same period, Confucianism became the core idea of Chinese imperial politics. According to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]-[[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (~1600 BCE–256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=105, note 45}}

By the words of [[Tu Weiming]] and other Confucian scholars who recover the work of [[Kang Youwei]] (a Confucian reformer of the early 20th century), Confucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and Heaven, or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''Li'' or ''Dao'') is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of this order.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Confucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of "sageliness within and kingliness without".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} As defined by Stephan Feuchtwang, Heaven is thought to have an ordering law which preserves the world, which has to be followed by humanity by means of a "middle way" between yin and yang forces; social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is the worship of ancestors and progenitors in the male line, in ancestral shrines.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

In Confucian thought, human beings are always teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor of self-cultivation and self-creation. Some of the basic Confucian ethical and practical concepts include ''rén'', ''yì'', ''lǐ'', and ''zhì''. [[Ren (Confucianism)|''Ren'']] is translated as "humaneness", or the essence proper of a human being, which is characterised by compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time what allows man to achieve oneness with Heaven—in the ''Datong shu'' it is defined as "to form one body with all things" and "when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} [[Yi (Confucianism)|''Yi'']] is "righteousness", which consists in the ability to always maintain a moral disposition to do good things. [[Li (Confucianism)|''Li'']] is a system of ritual norms and propriety of behaviour which determine how a person should act in everyday life. ''Zhi'' is the ability to see what is right and what is wrong, in the behaviour exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt when he fails to uphold the cardinal moral values of ''ren'' and ''yi''.

Confucianism never developed an institutional structure similar to that of Taoism, and its religious body never differentiated from [[Chinese folk religion]]. Since the 2000s, Confucianism has been embraced as a religious identity by a large numbers of intellectuals and students in China.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"&gt;{{cite article|last=Yang|first=Fenggang|title=Cultural Dynamics in China: Today and in 2020|journal=Asia Policy|number=4|date=July 2007|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:-LdyJdpkQ8kJ:www.purdue.edu/crcs/itemPublications/articles/YangChina2020s.pdf+confucian+fundamentalism&amp;hl=it&amp;gl=it&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESize70WNJxoIIOMRBt5DEIi_y2d7zHRgHs0t1XQiaSfoaxX05HWwV5f9yKrIVmFA_nmDge95VJc6DFPpZgQfF23oBelDF6eIoOg7iKV_1cJMVWChRZTQ-uA3FSEby7dk4i5t1Nd&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8emeoEif5P2Tuv3SApNEJDQLzNw}} p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people, a purpose achievable through a standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a [[state church]] is [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]].{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}}

In 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; and ''[[guoxue]]'' ("national learning") started to be implemented in public schools. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers started to appear on television since 2006.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt; The most enthusiast New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"/&gt;

The idea of a "[[Confucian Church]]" as the [[state religion]] of [[China]] has roots in the thought of Kang Youwei (1858–1927), an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism at a time when it fell out of favour with the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] and the end of the Chinese empire.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}} Kang modeled his ideal "Confucian Church" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches devoted to the worship of Confucius and the spread of his teachings.{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=174}}

In contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (''[[shuyuan]]'' 书院 or 孔学堂 ''Kǒngxuétáng'', "Confucian learning halls"),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} the resurgence of [[Confucian rites]] (''chuántǒng lǐyí'' 传统礼仪),{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}} and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (''shèqū rúxué'' 社区儒学). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of [[lineage churches]] and their [[ancestral temples]], as well as of cults and temples of natural gods and national heroes within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015a|p=7}}

Other forms of revival are [[Chinese salvationist religion|folk religious movements of salvation]]{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|pp=203–214}} with a Confucian focus, or [[Confucian churches]], for example the ''Yidan xuetang'' (一耽学堂) of [[Beijing]],{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|p=219}} the ''Mengmutang'' (孟母堂) of [[Shanghai]],{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=29}} [[Confucian Shenism]] (儒宗神教 ''Rúzōng Shénjiào'') or the phoenix churches,{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=34}} the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 ''Rújiào Dàotán'') of northern Fujian,{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=34}} and ancestral temples of the Kong (Confucius') lineage operating as churches for Confucian teaching.{{sfnb|Fan|Chen|2015|p=29}}

Also the Hong Kong [[Confucian Academy]], one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, the establishment of Confucian hospitals, the restoration of temples and other activities.{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=148}} In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 ''Kǒngshèngtáng'') in [[Shenzhen]], affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of [[Qufu]] City.{{sfnb|Payette|2014}}{{sfnb|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|pp=152–156}} It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the [[Holy Confucian Church]] (孔圣会 ''Kǒngshènghuì''). The first spiritual leader of the Holy Church is the renowned scholar Jiang Qing, the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode (阳明精舍 ''Yángmíng jīngshě''), a Confucian academy in [[Guiyang]], [[Guizhou]].

Chinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called 儒 ''rú'' or 正统 ''zhèngtǒng'', "[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 ''lǐshēng'') to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|pp=3–5}} "Confucian businessmen" (儒商人 ''rúshāngrén'', also "refined businessman") is a recently rediscovered concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.{{sfnb|Billioud|2010|p=204}}

{{Main article|Taoism}}
{{See also|Taoist schools|Chinese Taoist Association}}
Taoism (道教 ''Dàojiào'') refers to a variety of related [[Taoist schools|orders of philosophy and rite]] that operate in Chinese religion. They share elements going back to the 4th century BCE and to the prehistoric culture of China, such as the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin and Yang]] and the thought of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. Taoism has a distinct scriptural tradition, with the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Dàodéjīng]]'' (道德经 "Book of the Way and its Virtue") of Laozi being regarded as its keystone. Taoism may be precisely described, as does the scholar and Taoist initiate [[Kristofer Schipper]] in ''The Taoist Body'' (1986), as a doctrinal and liturgical framework or structure for developing the local cults of indigenous religion.&lt;ref name="Wu2014"/&gt; Taoist traditions emphasise living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ([[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanised as ''Dao'']]). The term ''Tao'' means "way", "path" or "principle", and may also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than Taoism. In Taoism, however, ''Tao'' denotes the principle that is both the source and the pattern of development of everything that exists. It is ultimately [[ineffability|ineffable]]: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao" says the first verse of the Tao Te Ching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tao Te Ching|translator-last=Kohn|translator-first=Livia|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, the concept of ''Tao'' is equivalent to the ancient Greek concept of ''[[physis]]'', "nature", that is the vision of the process of generation and regeneration of things and of the moral order.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}

Only by the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) the various sources of Taoism coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organisations and orders of ritualists. In earlier China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or ascetics who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of them, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was involved in local [[shamanism|shamanic]] traditions.{{sfnb|Nadeau|2012|p=42}} Women shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbing fundamental shamanic elements. Shamans revealed texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Despeux|first=Catherine|chapter=Women in Daoism|title=Daoism Handbook|editor-last=Kohn|editor-first=Livia|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|date=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXVk1tr6lEYC}} pp. 403–404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist institutional orders evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped in two main branches: [[Quanzhen Taoism]] and [[Zhengyi Taoism]].{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Taoist schools traditionally feature reverence for Laozi, [[xian (Taoism)|immortals]] or ancestors, along with a variety of rituals for [[divination]] and [[exorcism]], and techniques for achieving [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], longevity or immortality. Ethics and appropriate behaviour that Taoists have to follow may vary depending on the particular school, but in general all of them emphasise ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: compassion, moderation, and humility.

Taoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture over the course of the centuries, and Taoists ({{zh|c=道士|p=dàoshi}}, "masters of the Tao") usually take care to remark the distinction between their ritual tradition and those of [[Chinese ritual mastery traditions|vernacular orders]] which are not recognised as Taoist.

Taoism was suppressed during the Cultural Revolution but its traditions endured in secrecy and revived in following decades. In 1956 a national organisation, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]], was established to govern the activity of Taoist orders and temples. According to [[religion in China#Demographics|demographic analyses]], approximately 13% of the population of China claims a loose affiliation with Taoist practices, while self-proclaimed "Taoists" (a title traditionally attributed only to the ''daoshi'', i.e. the priests, who are experts of Taoist doctrines and rites, and to their closest disciples) might be 12 million (~1%).&lt;ref name="CSLS2010"/&gt; The definition of "Taoists" is complicated by the fact that many [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk sects of salvation]] and their members began to be registered as branches of the Taoist association in the 1990s.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=347}}

There are two types of Taoists, following the distinction between the Quanzhen and Zhengyi traditions.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Quanzhen ''daoshi'' are celibate [[monk]]s, and therefore the [[Taoist temple]]s of the Quanzhen school are monasteries.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}} Contrarywise, Zhengyi ''daoshi'', also known as ''sanju daoshi'' ("scattered" or "diffused" Taoists) or ''huoju daoshi'' (Taoists "who live at home"), are [[priest]]s who may marry and have other jobs besides the sacerdotal office; they live among the population and perform Taoist rituals within common Chinese religion, for local temples and communities.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}

While the Chinese Taoist Association started as a Quanzhen institution, and remains based at the [[White Cloud Temple]] of Beijing, that also functions as the headquarters of the Quanzhen sects, from the 1990s onwards it started to open registration to the ''sanju daoshi'' of the Zhengyi branch, who are more numerous than the Quanzhen monks. The Chinese Taoist Association had already 20.000 registered ''sanju daoshi'' in the mid-1990s,{{sfnb|Overmyer|2003|p=118}} while the total number of Zhengyi priests including the unregistered ones was estimated at 200.000 in the same years.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=332}} The Zhengyi ''sanju daoshi'' are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the [[Celestial Master]],{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}} although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War. Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms, has experienced a strong development since the 1990s, and dominates the religious life of coastal provinces.{{sfnb|Chan|2005|p=93}}

====Vernacular ritual mastery traditions====
{{Main article|Chinese ritual mastery traditions}}
Chinese vernacular ritual masters, also referred to as practitioners of Faism (法教 ''Fǎjiào'', "rites/laws' traditions"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=法教與民俗信仰學術研討會論文集: 2009|trans-title=Faism and Folk Religion: 2009|year=2011|publisher=Taiwan Folk Religion Society|location=Wenjin, Taipei|isbn=9576689457}}&lt;/ref&gt; also named Folk Taoism (民间道教 ''Mínjiàn Dàojiào''), or "Red Taoism" (in southeast China and Taiwan), are orders of priests that operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism.{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}} Such "masters of rites", ''fashi'' (法師), are known by a variety of names including ''hongtou daoshi'' (紅頭道士), popular in southeast China, meaning "redhead" or "redhat" daoshi, in contradistinction to the ''wutou daoshi'' (烏頭道士), "blackhead" or "blackhat" daoshi, as vernacular Taoists call the ''sanju daoshi'' of [[Zhengyi Taoism]] that were traditionally ordained by the [[list of Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]].{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}} In some provinces of north China they are known as ''yīnyángshēng'' (阴阳生 "sages of yin and yang"),&lt;ref name=GoossaertNCR/&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt; and by a variety of other names.

Although the two types of priests, daoshi and fashi, have the same roles in Chinese society—in that they may marry and they perform rituals for communities' temples or private homes—Zhengyi daoshi emphasise their Taoist tradition, distinguished from the vernacular tradition of the fashi.{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Davis|first=Edward L.|title=Daoism (Zhengyi tradition)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=041577716X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western scholars have described vernacular Taoist traditions as "cataphatic" (i.e. of [[cataphatic theology|positive theology]]) in character, while professional Taoism as "[[kenotic]]" and "apophatic" (i.e. of [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coakley|first=Sarah|title=Religion and the Body|series=Cambridge Studies in Religious Traditions|volume=8|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521783860}} p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fashi'' are [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'']] practitioners (southern mediumship), healers, exorcists and they officiate ''jiao'' rituals of "universal salvation" (although historically they were excluded from performing such rites{{sfnb|Pas|1998|p=259}}). They are not shamans (''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]''), with the exception of the order of [[Mount Lu]] in [[Jiangxi]].{{sfnb|Palmer|Shive|Wickeri|2011|p=46}} Rather, they represent an intermediate level between the ''wu'' and the Taoists. Like the ''wu'', the ''fashi'' identify with their deity, but while the ''wu'' embody wild forces, vernacular ritual masters represent order like the Taoists. Unlike the Taoists, who represent a tradition of high theology which is interethnic, both vernacular ritual masters and ''wu'' find their institutional base in local cults to particular deities, even though vernacular ritual masters are itinerant.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|2010|p=80}}

====Chinese shamanic traditions====
[[File:中国法师.jpg|thumb|250px|A 巫 ''wu'' master of the [[Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Xiangxi]] area.]]
{{Main article|Chinese shamanism}}
{{Further information|Shamanism in China (disambiguation){{!}}Shamanism in China}}
Shamanism was the prevalent modality of pre-[[Han dynasty]] Chinese indigenous religion.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"&gt;{{cite article|last=Chirita|first=Andreea|title=Antagonistic Discourses on Shamanic Folklore in Modern China|journal=Annals of Dimitrie Cantemir Christian University|issue=1|year=2014|url=http://aflls.ucdc.ro/I_2014/2Ant.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630051227/http://aflls.ucdc.ro/I_2014/2Ant.pdf|archive-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese usage distinguishes the [[Chinese shamanism|Chinese "Wuism" tradition]] (巫教 ''Wūjiào''; properly shamanic, in which the practitioner has control over the force of the god and may travel to the underworld) from the [[tongji (spirit medium)|''tongji'' tradition]] (童乩; southern mediumship, in which the practitioner does not control the force of the god but is guided by it), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms (萨满教 ''sàmǎnjiào'') which are practised in northern provinces.

With the rise of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] orthodoxy in the Han period (206 BCE–220 CE), shamanic traditions found an institutionalised and intellectualised form within the esoteric philosophical discourse of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; According to Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the [[Shang dynasty]] (~1600 BCE–1046 BCE).&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; What Confucianism did was to marginalise the features of old shamanism which were dysfunctional for the new political regime.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt;

In the Shang and later [[Zhou dynasty]] (~1046 BCE–256 BCE), shamans had an important role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (大宗拍). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and humanity.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; The mission of a shaman (巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'') is "to repair the disfunctionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth":&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt;

::"The female shamans called ''wu'' as well as the male shamans called ''xi'' represent the voice of spirits, repair the natural disfunctions, foretell the future based on dreams and the art of divination ... "a historical science of the future", whereas shamans are able to observe the yin and the yang ...".

Since the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a great revival in Chinese religion as a mean to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialisation.&lt;ref name="Chirita2014"/&gt; Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as "teacher and spirit" of peoples.&lt;ref name="KunShi2006"&gt;{{cite article|last=Kun|first=Shi|title=Shamanistic Studies in China: A Preliminary Survey of the Last Decade|journal=Shaman|volume=1|number=1–2|publisher=Ohio State University|year=1993–2007|url=http://buddhabookclub.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/6/4/4264863/survey_of_shamanic_studies_in_china-1993-updated_2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926115658/http://buddhabookclub.weebly.com/uploads/4/2/6/4/4264863/survey_of_shamanic_studies_in_china-1993-updated_2007.pdf|archive-date=26 September 2017}} pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in [[Jilin City]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="KunShi2006"/&gt;

In China, [[Buddhism]] (佛教 ''Fójiào'') is represented by a large number of people following the ''[[Mahayana]]'', divided between two different cultural traditions, namely the [[Chinese Buddhism|schools of Chinese Buddhism]] followed by the [[Han Chinese]], and the [[Tibetan Buddhism|schools of Tibetan Buddhism]] followed by [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], but also by minorities of Han. The vast majority of Buddhists in China, counted in the hundreds of millions, are Chinese Buddhists, while Tibetan Buddhists are in the number of the tens of millions. Small communities following the ''[[Theravada]]'' exist among minority ethnic groups who live in the southwestern provinces of [[Yunnan]] and [[Guangxi]], bordering [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], but also some among the [[Li people]] of [[Hainan]] follow such tradition.

With the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, religion came under the control of the new government, and the [[Buddhist Association of China]] was founded in 1953. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Buddhism was suppressed and temples closed or destroyed. Restrictions lasted until the reforms of the 1980s, when Buddhism began to recover popularity and its place as the largest organised faith in the country. While estimates of the number of Buddhists in China vary, the [[religion in China#Demographics|most recent surveys]] found an average 10–16% of the population of China claiming a Buddhist affiliation, with even higher percentages in urban agglomerations.

====Chinese Buddhism====
{{Main article|Chinese Buddhism}}
{{See also|East Asian Buddhism}}
Buddhism was introduced into China by its western neighbouring populations during the [[Han dynasty]], traditionally in the 1st century. It became very popular among Chinese of all walks of life; admired by commoners, and sponsored by emperors in certain dynasties. The expansion of Buddhism reached its peak during the [[Tang dynasty]], in the 9th century, when Buddhist monasteries had become very rich and powerful. The wealth of Buddhist institutions was among the practical reasons—the ideal reason was that Buddhism was a "foreign religion"—why the Tang emperors decided to enact a wave of [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecutions of the religion]], starting with the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] (845) by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]], through which many monasteries were destroyed and the religion's influence in China was greatly reduced. However, Buddhism survived the persecutions and regained a place in the Chinese society over the following centuries.

Spreading in China, Buddhism had to interact with indigenous religions, especially Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maspero|first=Henri|translator-last=Kierman|translator-first=Frank A.|title=Taoism and Chinese Religion|year=1981|publisher=University of Massachusetts}} p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Such interaction gave rise to uniquely Han Chinese Buddhist schools (汉传佛教 ''Hànchuán Fójiào''). Originally seen as a kind of "foreign Taoism", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Prebish&gt;{{cite book|last=Prebish|first=Charles|title=Buddhism: A Modern Perspective|year=1975|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271011955}} p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chan Buddhism]] in particular was shaped by Taoism, developing distrust of scriptures and even language, as well as typical Taoist views emphasising "this life", the "moment", and dedicated practices.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dumoulin|first1=Heinrich|last2=Heisig|first2=James W.|last3=Knitter|first3=Paul|title=Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China|year=2005|publisher=World Wisdom|isbn=0941532895}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68, 70–73, 167–168}} Throughout the Tang period, Taoism itself developed elements drawn from Buddhism, including monasticism, vegetarianism, abstention from alcohol, and the doctrine of emptiness. During the same period, Chan Buddhism grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin/&gt;{{rp|166–167, 169–172}}

Buddhism was not universally welcomed, particularly among the gentry. The Buddha's teaching seemed alien and amoral to conservative Confucian sensibilities.&lt;ref name=Dumoulin/&gt;{{rp|189–190, 268–269}} Confucianism promoted social stability, order, strong families, and practical living, and Chinese officials questioned how monasticism and personal attainment of [[Nirvana]] benefited the empire.&lt;ref name=Prebish/&gt; However, Buddhism and Confucianism eventually reconciled after centuries of conflict and assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Charles Alexander|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|year=1967|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824800753}} pp. 133, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary China, the most popular forms of Chinese Buddhism are the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and Chan schools. Pure Land Buddhism is very accessible for common people, since in its doctrine even lay practitioners may escape the cycle of death and rebirth. The goal for followers of this popular form of Buddhism is to be reborn in the Pure Land, which is a place rather than a state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhead|first1=Linda|last2=Partridge|first2=Christopher|first3=Hiroko|last3=Kawanami|title=Religions in the Modern World|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, New York|edition=third}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s and 2010s, the influence of Chinese Buddhism has been expressed through the construction of large-scale statues, [[pagoda]]s and temples, including the [[Spring Temple Buddha|Great Buddha of the Central Plains]], the [[list of statues by height|second highest statue in the world]]. Many temples in China also claim to preserve [[relic]]s of the original [[Gautama Buddha]].

The revival of Chinese Buddhism in the 21st century has also seen the development of the [[Humanistic Buddhism|Humanistic Buddhist]] movement, reintroduced from Taiwan and Chinese overseas communities, with organisations such as the ''[[Tzu Chi|Cíjì]]'' (慈济), which has been working in mainland China since 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laliberté|first=André|title=The growth of a Taiwanese Buddhist association in China: Soft power and institutional learning|journal=China Information|volume=0|number=0|date=2012|doi=10.1177/0920203X12466206}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has opened its mainland headquarters in the 2010s in [[Suzhou]].

{{See also|Religion in Tibet}}
The [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist schools that emerged in the cultural sphere of Tibet]] (藏传佛教 ''Zàngchuán Fójiào'' or 喇嘛教 ''Lǎmajiào'', "Lamaism") also have an influence throughout China that dates back to historical interactions of the [[Han Chinese]] with neighbouring populations. Tibetan Buddhism and its clergy, the [[lama]]s, were introduced in China proper since the 7th century; its emphasis on ritual action was a shared element with Taoism. It spread significantly much later, with [[Tibetans|Tibetan]] influence in the west, and with the [[Mongols]] and [[Manchu people|Manchus]] in the north, especially under the dynasties which they established in China, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and the [[Qing dynasty]].{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=148}}

Today, Tibetan Buddhism is the dominant religion in [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], among Tibetans in [[Qinghai]] and other provinces, and has a historical and significant presence in [[Inner Mongolia]] (where its traditional name is ''Burkhany Shashin'', "Buddha's religion", or ''Shira-in Shashin'', the "Yellow religion"—黄教 ''Huángjiào'' in Chinese{{refn|group=note|"Yellow religion", a [[synecdoche]] from the [[Gelug|Yellow Hat sect]], may also refer to [[yellow shamanism]], a type of Mongolian shamanism which uses a expressive style inspired to Buddhism.}}). However, there are many Tibetan Buddhist temples as far as [[northeast China]], the [[Yonghe Temple]] in [[Beijing]] being just one example.

There are controversies surrounding the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, specifically the succession of Tenzin Gyatso the [[14th Dalai Lama]]—the spiritual leader of the [[Gelug]] school, the major school of Tibetan Buddhism—, who before fleeing China during the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]] had full political power in [[Tibet]]. The [[Panchen Lama]], the Tibetan hierarch in charge of the designation of the future successor of the Dalai Lama, is the matter of controversy between the Chinese government and Tenzin Gyatso. The government of China asserts that the present (11th) incarnation of the Panchen Lama is [[Gyancain Norbu]], while the 14th Dalai Lama asserted in 1995 that it was [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]], who from that year has been detained by the Chinese government and never seen in public.

After the liberalisation of religions in China in the 1980s, there has been a growing movement of adoption of the [[Gelug]] sect, and other Tibetan-originated Buddhist schools, by the Han Chinese.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=369}} This movement has been favoured by the proselytism of Chinese-speaking Tibetan lamas throughout China.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=369}}

====Theravada Buddhism====

{{Main article|Theravada Buddhism}}
[[Theravada]] Buddhism is a major form of Buddhism, practised mostly in [[Southeast Asia]] but also among some minority ethnic groups in southwest China. Theravada Buddhism spread from Myanmar to present day [[Xishuangbanna]], Dehong, Simao, Lincang, and Baoshan, all in [[Yunnan]], during the 6th and 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haicheng Ling, Buddhism in China&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this school of Buddhism is popular among the [[Dai people]], and also the [[Palaung people|Palaung]], [[Blang people|Blang]], [[Achang people|Achang]], and [[Jingpo people|Jingpo]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=Davis-Theravada&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Davis|first=Edward L.|title=Theravada Buddhism among minority groups|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2009|isbn=041577716X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Buddhist temple in Yunnan province, the Wabajie Temple in Xishuangbanna, was erected in 615. After the 12th century, Theravada Buddhist influence into the region began to come from [[Thailand]]. Thais began to bring copies of the [[Pali canon]] to Yunnan, to translate the scriptures and to build new temples. The people living in Yunnan where Theravada Buddhism is widespread follow norms similar to those of Thai Buddhists, and their Buddhism is often blended with local folk beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Jian|first=Guan|title=The Indigenous Religion and Theravada Buddhism in Ban Da Tiu: A Dai Lue Village in Yunnan, China|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=53|number=2|date=October 1994}} pp. 363–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada Buddhism suffered from persecution in during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but after the 1980s it was revived.&lt;ref name=Davis-Theravada/&gt;

====Vajrayana Buddhism====

{{Further information|Tangmi|Azhaliism}}
Besides Tibetan Buddhism and the Vajrayana streams found within Chinese Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism is practised in China in some other forms. For instance, Azhaliism ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 阿吒力教 ''Āzhālìjiào'') is a Vajrayana Buddhist religion practised among the [[Bai people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Zhengliang|last2=Zhang|first2=Xilu|title=Research Review of Bai Esoteric Buddhist Azhali Religion Since the 20th Century|journal=Journal of Dali University|date=2013|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-DLSZ201307000.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vajrayana current of Chinese Buddhism is known as [[Tangmi]] (唐密 "Tang Mysteries"), as it flourished in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) just before the great suppression of Buddhism by imperial decision. Another name for this body of traditions is "Han Chinese Transmission of the Esoteric (or Mystery) Tradition" (汉传密宗 ''Hànchuán Mìzōng'', where ''Mizong'' is the Chinese for Vajrayana). Tangmi, together with the broader religious tradition of [[Tantrism]] (in Chinese: 怛特罗 ''Dátèluō'' or 怛特罗密教 ''Dátèluó mìjiào''; which may include [[Hinduism|Hindu]] forms of religion)&lt;ref name=Liang2016/&gt;{{rp|3}} has undergone a revitalisation since the 1980s together with the overall revival of Buddhism.

The [[Gateway of the Hidden Flower]] (华藏宗门 ''Huácáng Zōngmén'') and the [[True Awakening Tradition]] (真佛宗 ''Zhēnfó Zōng'') are two new Han Chinese movements within the Vajrayana, and are among the Buddhist sects which are officially proscribed as evil by the government.&lt;ref name=Duihua52&gt;{{cite article|title=The "Cult" of Buddha|journal=Dui Hua|issue=52|date=29 August 2013|url=http://duihua.org/wp/?p=8161|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105060455/http://duihua.org/wp/?p=8161|archive-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese Buddhism====

=====Shin Buddhism=====
{{Main article|Jōdo Shinshū}}
From the 1890s to the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1945, the ''Hompa [[Hongan-ji|Honganji]]-ha'' organisation of the ''Jōdo Shinshū'' (淨土真宗; Chinese reading: ''Jìngtǔ Zhēnzōng'', "True Tradition of the Pure Land"), or Shin Buddhism ("True Buddhism"), which is a Japanese variation of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], carried out missionary activity throughout [[East Asia]], including [[Manchuria]], [[Taiwan]] and China proper. With the unconditional surrender of [[Japan]] at the end of the war, the missions were shut down.&lt;ref name=Ong&gt;{{cite article|last=Ong|first=Clifton Dodatsu|title=The Propagation of Shin Buddhism in Chinese|journal=大学紀要|pages=28–50|issn=1343-3695}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

Starting in the 1990s there has been a revival of Shin Buddhism among the Chinese, which has taken a formal nature with the foundation of the [[Hong Kong]] Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (香港法雷念佛会) in 2000,&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|37}} followed by the [[Fuzhou]] Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (福州法雷念佛会) founded in 2006 and the [[Shaanxi]] Fǎléi Niànfóhuì (陕西法雷念佛会) founded in 2010.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|39–40}} There are Shin Buddhist groups also in [[Henan]], [[Zhejiang]], [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Yunnan]] and other provinces.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|39–40}}

The propagation of Shin Buddhism in China has faced some critiques for cultural, historical and doctrinal reasons.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|40}} Cultural critiques point to the fact that Shin Buddhist clerics may marry and eat meat; modern Chinese Shin Buddhist groups, however, tend to follow the norms of celibacy and vegetarianism of Chinese Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|40–41}} Historical critiques have to do with the links that Jodo Shinshu had with Japanese militarism and colonialism prior to 1945.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|41–42}} Doctrinal critiques are based on the attribution of "unfiliality" to Shin Buddhism, because it was not influenced by Chinese folk religion as Chinese Buddhism was, and therefore does not have firmly established practices for ancestor worship.&lt;ref name=Ong/&gt;{{rp|42}}

=====Nichiren Buddhism=====
{{Main article|Nichiren Buddhism}}
{{Further information|Soka Gakkai}}
Nichiren Buddhism, a denomination of the Buddhist religion that was founded in Japan in the 13th century, has been spreading in China in the 21st century in the form of the [[Soka Gakkai]] (in Chinese: 创价学会 ''Chuàngjià xuéhuì''). Nichiren Buddhism was founded by the monk Nichiren (1222–1282), who elaborated his teachings upon the "Lotus Sutra" aspiring to reform Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism promises both immediate relief from daily problems as well as this-worldly benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodhead|first1=Linda|last2=Partridge|first2=Christopher|last3=Kawanami|first3=Hiroko|year=2016|title=Religions in the Modern World|publisher=Apex CoVantage, LLC}} p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; This society has engaged in missionary efforts in China partially aided by the good relationship it has interlaced with the Chinese government. Delegations from the Japanese Soka Gakkai and the Chinese government and intellectual class have made visits to each other, so that the society has been called an "intimate friend of the Chinese government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metraux|first=Daniel Alfred|year=1994|title=The Soka Gakkai Revolution|publisher=University Press of America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WHYAAAAMAAJ|isbn=0819197335}} p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Soka Gakkai members in China are organised in the form of the [[house church (China)|house church]], as they "meet quietly in small groups in the homes of other members", with little interference from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Metraux|first=Daniel Alfred|year=2010|title=How Soka Gakkai Became a Global Buddhist Movement: The Internationalization of a Japanese Religion|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvhOAQAAIAAJ|isbn=0773437584}} pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic minorities' indigenous religions==
Various [[ethnic minorities in China|Chinese non-Han minority populations]] practise unique [[ethnic religion|indigenous religions]].

===Benzhuism (Bai)===
[[File:Benzhu Sanxing, Dali, Yunnan.jpg|thumb|200px|The pan-Chinese [[Sanxing (deities)|Sanxing]] (Three Star Gods) represented in Bai iconographic style at a Benzhu temple on Jinsuo Island, in [[Dali City|Dali]], [[Yunnan]].]]
{{Main article|Benzhuism}}
Benzhuism (本主教 ''Běnzhǔjiào'', "religion of the patrons") is the indigenous religion of the [[Bai people]], an ethnic group of [[Yunnan]]. It consists in the worship of the ''ngel zex'', [[Bai language|Bai]] word for "patrons" or "source lords", rendered as ''benzhu'' (本主) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. They are local gods and [[veneration of the dead|deified ancestors]] of the Bai nation. Benzhuism is very similar to Han Chinese religion.

===Bimoism (Yi)===
{{Main article|Bimoism}}
Bimoism (毕摩教 ''Bìmójiào'') is the indigenous religion of the [[Yi people]](s), the largest ethnic group in [[Yunnan]] after the [[Han Chinese]]. This faith is represented by three types of religious specialists: the ''bimo'' (毕摩, "ritual masters", "priests"), the ''sunyi'' (male shamans) and the ''monyi'' (female shamans).{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|pp=146–147}}

What distinguishes the ''bimo'' and the shamans is the way through which they acquire their authority.{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=148}} While both are regarded as the "mediators between humanity and the divine", the shamans are initiated through a "spiritual inspiration" (which involves illness or vision){{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=148}} whereas the ''bimo''—who are always males with few exceptions{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=149}}—are literates, who may read and write traditional [[Yi script]], have a tradition of theological and ritual scriptures, and are initiated through a tough edicational process.{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=150}}

Since the 1980s, Bimoism has undergone a comprehensive revitalisation,{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|pp=146–147}} both on the popular level and on the scholarly level,{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|pp=146–147}} with the ''bimo'' now celebrated as an "intellectual class"{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=158}} whose role is that of creators, preservers and transmitters of Yi [[high culture]].{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|pp=158–159}} Since the 1990s, Bimoism has undergone an institutionalisation, starting with the foundation of the Bimo Culture Research Center in [[Meigu County]] in 1996.{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=164}} The founding of the centre received substantial support from local authorities, especially those whose families were directly affiliated with one of the many ''bimo'' hereditary lineages.{{sfnb|Kraef|2014|p=164}} Since then, large temples and ceremonial complexes for Bimoist practices have been built.

===Bon (Tibetans)===

===Dongbaism (Nakhi)===
[[File:Dongba oracle calligraphiant.jpg|thumb|200px|Dongba priest writing oracles with calam in [[Dongba script]], at a Dongba temple near [[Lijiang]].]]
{{Main article|Dongbaism}}
Dongbaism (東巴教 ''Dōngbajiào'', "religion of the eastern ''Ba''") is the main religion of the [[Nakhi people]]. The "dongba" ("eastern ''ba''") are masters of the [[culture]], [[literature]] and the [[writing system|script]] of the Nakhi. They originated as masters of the Tibetan [[Bon]] religion ("Ba" in [[Nakhi language]]), many of whom, in times of persecution when Buddhism became the dominant religion in Tibet, were expelled and dispersed to the eastern marches settling among Nakhi and other eastern peoples.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Anthony|title=Na-khi Religion: An Analytical Appraisal of the Na-khi Ritual Texts|year=1979|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110804115}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}}

Dongbaism historically formed as beliefs brought by Bon masters commingled with older indigenous Nakhi beliefs. Dongba followers believe in a celestial shaman called ''Shi-lo-mi-wu'', with little doubt the same as the Tibetan ''Shenrab Miwo''.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|63}} They worship nature and generation, in the form of many heavenly gods and spirits, chthonic ''Shu'' (spirits of the earth represented in the form of chimera-dragon-serpent beings), and ancestors.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|86}}

===Manchu folk religion===
{{Main article|Manchu folk religion}}
Manchu folk religion is the ethnic religion practised by most of the [[Manchu people]], the major of the [[Tungusic peoples]], in China. It may also be called "Manchu Shamanism" (满族萨满教 ''Mǎnzú sàmǎnjiào'') by virtue of the word "shaman" being originally from [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] ''šamán'' ("man of knowledge"),&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|year=2001|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|series=Religious Studies in Contemporary China Collection|volume=1|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC|isbn=0804746842}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures.

It is a patheistic system, believing in a universal [[God]] called ''Apka Enduri'' ("[[Tian|God of Heaven]]") that is the omnipotent and omnipresent source of all life and creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirokogorov|first=Sergeĭ Mikhaĭlovich|year=1929|title=Social Organization of the Northern Tungus|publisher=Garland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7wmAQAAMAAJ|isbn=0824096207}} p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Deities (''enduri'') enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity.&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;{{rp|236}} Many of the deities are original Manchu kins' [[ancestor]]s, and people with the same surname are viewed as being generated by the same god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ma|first1=Xisha|last2=Meng|first2=Huiying|year=2011|title=Popular Religion and Shamanism|series=Religious Studies in Contemporary China Collection|volume=1|publisher=Brill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knui-SpO4GQC|isbn=9004174559}} p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miao folk religion===
{{Main article|Miao folk religion}}
Most of the [[Miao people]] (or Hmong) in China have retained their traditional folk religion. It is pantheistic and deeply influenced by Chinese religion, sharing the concept of [[yin and yang|''yeeb ceeb'' and ''yaj ceeb'']] representing, respectively, the realm of the gods in potentiality and the manifested or actual world of living things as a complementary duality.&lt;ref name=Tapp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tapp|first=Nicholas|title=Hmong Religion|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=48|pages=59–94|year=1989|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/1512}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}}

The Miao believe in a supreme universal God, ''Saub'', who may be defined a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' who created reality and left it to develop according to its ways, but nonetheless may be appealed in times of need. He entrusted a human, ''Siv Yis'', with healing powers so that he became the first shaman.&lt;ref name=Tapp/&gt;{{rp|60}} After his death, Siv Yis ascended to heaven, but he left behind his ritual tools that became the equipment of the shaman class. They (''txiv neeb'') regard Siv Yis as their archetype and identify as him when they are imbued by the gods.&lt;ref name=Tapp/&gt;{{rp|60–61}}

Various gods (''dab'' or ''neeb'', the latter defining those who work with shamans) enliven the world. Among them, the most revered are the water god Dragon King (''Zaj Laug''), the Thunder God (''Xob''), the gods of life and death (''Ntxwj Nyug'' and ''Nyuj Vaj Tuam Teem''), Lady Sun (''Nkauj Hnub'') and Lord Moon (''Nraug Hli''), and various deified human ancestors.&lt;ref name=Tapp/&gt;{{rp|60–62}}

Mongolian folk religion, that is Mongolian shamanism (蒙古族萨满教 ''Ménggǔzú sàmǎnjiào''), alternatively named Tengerism (腾格里教 ''Ténggélǐjiào''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stausberg|first=Michael|title=Religion and Tourism: Crossroads, Destinations and Encounters|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415549329}} p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; is the native and major religion among the [[Mongols in China|Mongols of China]], mostly residing in the region of [[Inner Mongolia]].

It is centred on the worship of the ''[[tngri]]'' (gods) and the highest ''[[Tengri|Tenger]]'' (Heaven, God of Heaven, [[God]]) or ''[[Qormusta Tengri]]''. In Mongolian folk religion, [[Genghis Khan]] is considered one of the embodiments, if not the most important embodiment, of the Tenger.&lt;ref name=Man&gt;{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=Bantam Press|location=London|isbn=9780553814989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|402–404}} In worship, communities of lay believers are led by shamans (called ''böge'' if males, ''iduγan'' if females), who are intermediaries of the divine.

The aobaoes for worship of ancestral gods may be private shrines of an extended family or kin (people sharing the same surname), otherwise they are common to villages (dedicated to the god of a village), [[banners of Inner Mongolia|banners]] or [[leagues of China|leagues]]. Sacrifices to the aobaoes are made offering slaughtered animals, [[joss sticks]], and [[libation]]s.&lt;ref name="Xing Li, 2006. pp. 58-59"/&gt;

The reason of such strong identification of Yao religion with Taoism is that in Yao society every male adult is initiated as a Taoist. Yao Taoism is therefore a communal religion, not identifying just a class of priests but the entire body of the society; this contrasts with Chinese Taoism, which mostly developed as a collection of sacerdotal orders. The shared sense of Yao identity is further based on tracing back Yao origins to a mythical ancestor, [[Panhu]].&lt;ref name=Litzinger/&gt;{{rp|48–49}}

===Zhuang folk religion===
{{Main article|Zhuang folk religion}}
Zhuang folk religion, sometimes called Moism (摩教 ''Mójiào'') or Shigongism (师公教 ''Shīgōngjiào'', "religion of the [Zhuang] ancestral father"), after two of its forms, is practised by most of the [[Zhuang people]], the largest ethnic minority of China, who inhabit the province of [[Guangxi]].{{sfnb|Kao|2014}} It is a [[polytheism|polytheistic]]-[[monism|monistic]] and [[shamanism|shamanic]] religion centered on the creator god usually expressed as ''Buluotuo'', the mythical primordial ancestor of the Zhuang. Its beliefs are codified into a [[mythology]] and a sacred scripture, the "Buluotuo Epic". A very similar religion, also called by the same name, is that of the [[Buyei people]], who are kindred to the Zhuang.

The Zhuang religion is intertwined with [[Taoism]].{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=108}} Indeed, Chinese scholars divide the Zhuang religion into several categories according to the type of ritual specialists who conduct the rites; these categories include Shigongism, Moism, Daogongism (道公教 ''Dàogōngjiào'') and shamanism  (巫教 ''wūjiào'').{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=116}}

"Shigongism" refers to the dimension led by the ''shīgōng'' (师公) ritual specialists, a term which may be translated variously as "ancestral father" or "teaching master", and which refers both to the principle of the universe (God) and to the men who are able to represent it. ''Shīgōng'' specialists practise masked dancing and worship the Three Primordials, the generals Tang, Ge and Zhou.{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=116}} "Moism" refers to the dimension led by ''mógōng'' (摩公), who are vernacular ritual specialists able to transcribe and read texts written in Zhuang characters and lead the worship of ''Buluotuo'' and of the goddess ''Muliujia''.{{sfnb|Kao|2014|pp=116–117}} "Daogongism" is Zhuang Taoism, that is the indigenous religion directed by Zhuang Taoists, known as ''dàogōng'' (道公 "lords of the Tao") in the Zhuang language, according to [[Taoist schools|Taoist doctrines and rites]].{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=117}} Zhuang shamanism entails the practices of mediums who provide direct communication between the material and the spiritual worlds; these shamans are known as ''momoed'' if female and ''gemoed'' if male.{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=117}}

Since the 1980s and the 1990s there has been a revival of Zhuang folk religion, which has followed two directions. The first is a grassroots revival of cults dedicated to local deities and ancestors, led by shamans; the second way is a promotion of the religion on the institutional level, through a standardisation of Moism elaborated by Zhuang government officials and intellectuals.{{sfnb|Kao|2014|p=107}}

[[Christianity]] (基督教 ''Jīdūjiào'', "religion of Christ") in China comprises [[Protestantism]] (基督教新教 ''Jīdūjiào xīnjiào'', "New-Christianity"), [[Roman Catholicism]] (天主教 ''Tiānzhǔjiào'', "religion of the Lord of Heaven"), and a small number of [[Orthodox Christians]] (正教 ''Zhèngjiào''). Also [[Mormonism]] (摩爾門教 ''Mó'ěrménjiào'') has a tiny presence.{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=349}} The Orthodox Church, which has believers among the [[Russians in China|Russian minority]] and some Chinese in the far northeast and far northwest, is officially recognised in [[Heilongjiang]].{{sfnb|Goossaert|Palmer|2011|p=348}} The category of "Protestantism" in China also comprehends a variety of [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] sects of Christian inspiration, including Zhushenism (主神教 ''Zhǔshénjiào'', "Church of Lord God"), Linglingism (灵灵教 ''Línglíngjiào'', "Numinous Church"), [[Fuhuodao]], the [[Mentuhui|Church of the Disciples]] (门徒会 ''Méntúhuì'') and [[Eastern Lightning]] or the Church of Almighty God (全能神教 ''Quánnéngshénjiào'').&lt;ref name="Kupfer"&gt;{{cite article|last=Kupfer|first=Kristin|title='Geheimgesellschaften' in der VR China: Christlich inspirierte, spirituell-religiöse Gruppierungen seit 1978|journal=China Analysis|number=8|date=October 2001|publisher=Trier University's Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies|url=http://www.chinapolitik.de/studien/china_analysis/china_geheimgesellschaften.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012024333/http://www.chinapolitik.de/studien/china_analysis/china_geheimgesellschaften.pdf|archive-date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity existed in China as early as the 7th century, living multiple cycles of significant presence for centuries, then disappearing for other centuries, and then being re-introduced by foreign missionaries. The arrival of the Persian missionary [[Alopen]] in 635, during the early period of the [[Tang dynasty]], is considered by some to be the first entry of Christianity in China. What Westerners referred to as [[Nestorianism]] flourished for centuries, until [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] of the Tang in 845 ordained that all foreign religions (Buddhism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism) had to be eradicated from the Chinese nation. Christianity was reintroduced in China in the 13th century, in the form of Nestorianism, during the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], which also established relations with the [[papacy]], especially through [[Franciscan]] missionaries in 1294. When the native Han Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] overthrew the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, Christianity was again expelled from China as a foreign influence.

At the end of the Ming dynasty in the 16th century, [[Jesuit]]s arrived in Beijing via [[Guangzhou]]. The most famous amongst them was [[Matteo Ricci]], an Italian mathematician who came to China in 1588 and lived in Beijing. Ricci was welcomed at the imperial court and introduced Western learning into China. The Jesuits followed a policy of adaptation of Catholicism to traditional Chinese religious practices, especially ancestor worship. However, such practices were eventually condemned as polytheistic idolatry by the popes [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII]] and [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]]. Roman Catholic missions struggled in obscurity for decades afterwards.

Christianity began to take root in a significant way in the late imperial period, during the [[Qing dynasty]], and although it has remained a minority religion in China, it influenced late imperial history. Waves of missionaries came to China in the Qing period as a result of contact with foreign powers. [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] was introduced in 1715, and [[Protestant missions in China|Protestant missions]] began entering China in 1807. The pace of missionary activity increased considerably after the [[First Opium War]] in 1842. Christian missionaries and their schools, under the protection of the Western powers, went on to play a major role in the [[Westernisation]] of China in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1871) was influenced to some degree by Christian teachings, and the [[Boxer Rebellion]] (1899–1901) was in part a reaction against Christianity in China. Christians in China established the [[list of Christian hospitals in China|first clinics and hospitals practising modern medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Gulick|first=Edward V.|title=Peter Parker and the Opening of China|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=3|number=95|year=1975|pages=561–562}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the first modern training for nurses. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants founded numerous [[list of Christian colleges in China|educational institutions in China]] from the primary to the university level. Some of the most prominent Chinese universities began as religious institutions. Missionaries worked to abolish practices such as [[foot binding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Burgess|title=The Small Woman|year=1957}} p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unjust treatment of maidservants, as well as launching charitable work and distributing food to the poor. They also opposed the [[opium]] trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=Alvyn|title=China's Millions: The China Inland Mission and Late Qing Society, 1832-1905|year=2007|publisher=Wm. B.

Some of the early leaders of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|early republic]] (1912–49), such as [[Sun Yat-sen]], were converts to Christianity and were influenced by its teachings. By 1921, Harbin, [[Manchuria]]'s largest city, had a [[Harbin Russians|Russian population]] of around 100,000, constituting a large part of Christianity in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wu|first=Yulin|title=Memories of Dr. Wu Lien-teh, Plague Fighter|year=1995|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=9810222874|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxFC5ynXN2YC}} p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity, especially in its Protestant form, gained momentum in China between the 1980s and the 1990s, but, in the following years, folk religion recovered more rapidly and in greater numbers than Christianity (or Buddhism).{{sfnb|Ruokanen|Huang|2011|p=171, ch. "The Impact of Contemporary Chinese Folk Religions on Christianity"}} The scholar Richard Madsen noted that "the Christian God then becomes one in a pantheon of local gods among whom the rural population divides its loyalties".{{sfnb|Madsen|2010|p=66}} Similarly, Gai Ronghua and Gao Junhui noted that "Christianity in China is no longer monotheism" and tends to blend with Chinese folk religion, as many Chinese Christians take part in regional activities for the worship of gods and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Gai|first1=Rong Hua|last2=Gao|first2=Jun Hui|title=Multiple-Perspective Analysis on the Geological Distribution of Christians in China|journal=PEOPLE: International Journal of Social Sciences|volume=2|issue=1|pages=809–817|date=22 December 2016|issn=2454-5899|doi=10.20319/pijss.2016.s21.809817}} p. 816.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants in the early 21st century, including both official and unofficial churches, had between 25 and 35 million adherents. Catholics were not more than 10 million.{{sfnb|Overmyer|2003|p=185}}&lt;ref name="Yip, 2006. p. 185"&gt;Francis Ching-Wah Yip in Miller, 2006, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s the scholarly estimate was of approximately 30 million Christians, of whom less than 4 million were Catholics. In the same years, about 40 million Chinese said they believed in Jesus Christ or had attended Christian meetings, but did not identify themselves with the Christian religion.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=145}} [[Religion in China#Demographics|Demographic analyses]] usually find an average 2–3% of the population of China declaring a Christian affiliation. Christians were unevenly distributed geographically, the only provinces in which they constituted a population significantly larger than 1 million persons being [[Henan]], [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]]. Protestants were characterised by a prevalence of people living in the countryside, women, illiterates and semi-literates, and elderly people.&lt;ref name="Yip, 2006. p. 186"/&gt; A 2017 study on the Christian community of [[Wuhan]] found the same socio-economic characteristics, with the addition that Christians were more likely than the general population to suffer from physical and mental illness.&lt;ref name=Han2017/&gt;

A significant number of members of churches unregistered with the government, and of their pastors, belong to the [[Koreans in China|Koreans of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Uncovering China's Korean Christians|journal=Dui Hua|issue=46|date=Winter 2012|url=https://duihua.org/wp/?p=5313|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226020611/https://duihua.org/wp/?p=5313|archive-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity has a strong presence in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]], in [[Jilin]].&lt;ref name=Carpenter-Dulk&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Carpenter|editor-first1=Joel|editor-last2=Den Dulk|editor-first2=Kevin R.|title=Christianity in Chinese Public Life: Religion, Society, and the Rule of Law|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Pivot|isbn=1137427876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8LDAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}} Yanbian Koreans' Christianity has a patriarchal character; Korean churches are usually led by men, in contrast to Chinese churches that most often have female leadership. For instance, of the twenty-eight registered churches of [[Yanji]], only three of which are Chinese congregations, all the Korean churches have a male pastor while all the Chinese churches have a female pastor.&lt;ref name=Carpenter-Dulk/&gt;{{rp|33}} Also, Korean church buildings are stylistically very similar to [[South Korea]]n churches, with big spires surmounted by red crosses.&lt;ref name=Carpenter-Dulk/&gt;{{rp|33}} Yanbian Korean churches have been a matter of controversy for the Chinese government because of their links to South Korean churches.&lt;ref name=Carpenter-Dulk/&gt;{{rp|37}}

In recent decades the Communist Party of China has become more tolerant of Christian churches outside party control, despite looking with distrust on organisations with international ties. The government and Chinese intellectuals tend to associate Christianity with subversive Western values, and many churches have been closed or destroyed. Since the 2010s policies against Christianity have been extended also to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernández|first1=Javier C.|last2=Tseaug|first2=Crystal|title=Hong Kong Christians Draw New Scrutiny From Mainland|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 August 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/world/asia/hong-kong-christian-groups-feel-new-scrutiny-from-mainland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Islam in China|History of Islam in China}}
The introduction of [[Islam]] (伊斯兰教 ''Yīsīlánjiào'' or 回教 ''Huíjiào'') in China is traditionally dated back to a diplomatic mission in 651, eighteen years after [[Muhammad]]'s death, led by [[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]]. [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]] is said to have shown esteem for Islam and to have founded the [[Huaisheng Mosque]] (Memorial Mosque) at Guangzhou, in memory of the Prophet himself.&lt;ref name="Lipman, Jonathan Newman page 25"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lipman|first=Jonathan Newman|title=Familiar Strangers, a History of Muslims in Northwest China|year=1997|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0295976446}} p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims, mainly Arabs, travelled to China to trade. In the year 760, the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)|Yangzhou massacre]] killed large numbers of these traders, and a century later, in the years 878–879, Chinese rebels fatally targeted the Arab community in the [[Guangzhou massacre]]. Yet, Muslims virtually came to dominate the import and export industry by the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279). The office of Director General of Shipping was consistently held by a Muslim. Immigration increased during the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), when hundreds of thousands of Muslims were relocated throughout China for their administrative skills. A Muslim, [[Yeheidie'erding]], led the construction project of the Yuan capital of [[Khanbaliq]], in present-day Beijing.&lt;ref name=Gernet&gt;{{cite book|last=Gernet|first=Jacques|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|volume=2|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521497124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), Muslims continued to have an influence among the high classes. Zhu Yuanzhang's most trusted generals were Muslim, including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]], who led a decisive victory over the Mongols, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China. The admiral [[Zheng He]] led [[treasure voyages|seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean]]. The [[Hongwu Emperor]] even composed ''[[The Hundred-word Eulogy]]'' in praise of Muhammad. Muslims who were descended from earlier immigrants began to assimilate by speaking [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]] and by adopting Chinese names and culture, mixing with the Han Chinese. They developed their own [[Chinese Islamic cuisine|cuisine]], [[Chinese mosques|architecture]], martial arts' styles and [[Sini (script)|calligraphy]] (''sini''). This era, sometimes considered a [[Golden Age]] of Islam in China, also saw [[Nanjing]] become an important center of Islamic study.

The rise of the [[Qing dynasty]] saw numerous Islamic rebellions, including the [[Panthay Rebellion]] which occurred in [[Yunnan]] from 1855 to 1873, and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]], which occurred mostly in [[Xinjiang]], [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]] from 1862 to 1877. The Manchu government ordered the execution of all rebels, killing a million Muslims after the Panthay Rebellion,&lt;ref name=Gernet/&gt; and several million after the Dungan Revolt.&lt;ref name=Gernet/&gt; However, many Muslims like [[Ma Zhan'ao]], [[Ma Anliang]], [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Qianling]] and [[Ma Rulong (Qing general)|Ma Julung]], defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang to exterminate the rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the ''[[Khufiyya]]'' sect, while rebels belonged to the ''Jahariyya'' sect. In 1895, another [[Dungan Revolt (1895–96)]] broke out, and loyalist Muslims like [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Anliang]], [[Ma Guoliang]], [[Ma Fulu]], and [[Ma Fuxiang]] massacred the rebel Muslims led by [[Ma Dahan]], [[Ma Yonglin]], and [[Ma Wanfu]]. A few years later, an Islamic army called the [[Kansu Braves]], led by the general Dong Fuxiang, fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].

After the fall of the Qing, [[Sun Yat-sen]] proclaimed that [[Five Races Under One Union|the country belonged equally]] to the [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Manchus|Manchu]], [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Tibetans|Tibetan]] and [[Hui people]]. In the 1920s, the provinces of [[Qinghai]], Gansu and [[Ningxia]] came under the control of Muslim warlords known as the "[[Ma clique]]", who served as generals in the [[National Revolutionary Army]]. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], mosques were often defaced, closed or demolished, and copies of the [[Quran]] were destroyed by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Goldman|first=Merle|title=Religion in Post-Mao China|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=1|number=486|year=1986|pages=145–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1980s Islam experienced a renewal in China, with an upsurge in Islamic expression and the establishment Islamic associations aimed to coordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims. Muslims are found in every province of China, but they constitute a majority only in Xinjiang, and a large amount of the population in Ningxia and Qinghai. Of China's recognised ethnic minorities, ten groups are traditionally Islamic. Accurate statistics on China's Muslim population are hard to find; [[religion in China#Demographics|various surveys]] found that they constitute 1–2% of the population of China, or between 20 and 30 million people. In the 2010s they were served by 35,000 to 45,000 mosques, 40,000 to 50,000 [[imam]]s (''ahong''), and 10 [[Quran]]ic institutions.&lt;ref name="CSLS2010"/&gt;

{{Main article|History of the Jews in China}}
Judaism (犹太教 ''Yóutàijiào'') was introduced during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907) or earlier, by small groups of [[Jewish people|Jews]] settled in China. The most prominent early community were the so-called [[Kaifeng Jews]], in [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]] province. In the 20th century many Jews arrived in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Harbin, during a period of great economic development of these cities. Many of them sought refuge from anti-Semitic [[pogrom]]s in the [[Russian Empire]] (early 1900s), the communist revolution and civil war in [[Russia]] (1917–1918), and anti-Semitic [[Nazi]] policy in central Europe, chiefly in Germany and [[Austria]] (1937–1940). The last wave of Jewish refugees came from [[Poland]] and other eastern European countries in the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Xu Xin|title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas. Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World|volume=I|chapter=Jewish Diaspora in China|editor-last1=Ember|editor-first1=Melvin|editor-last2=Ember|editor-first2=Carol R.|editor-last3=Skoggard|editor-first3=Ian|publisher=Springer|year=2004|pages=152–163|isbn=0306483211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QEjPVyd9YMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanghai was particularly notable for its numerous Jewish refugees, who gathered in the so-called [[Shanghai Ghetto]]. Most of them left China after the war, the rest relocating prior to, or immediately after, the establishment of the People's Republic. Today, the Kaifeng Jewish community is functionally extinct. Many descendants of the Kaifeng community still live among the Chinese population, mostly unaware of their Jewish ancestry, while some have moved to Israel. Meanwhile, remnants of the later arrivals maintain communities in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In recent years a community has also developed in Beijing through the work of the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement.

Since the late 20th century, along with the study of religion in general, the study of Judaism and Jews in China as an academic subject has blossomed with the establishment of institutions such as [[Diane and Guilford Glazer Institute of Jewish Studies]] and the China Judaic Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;Official website: {{cite web|url=http://www.chinajudaic.org/|title=China Judaic Studies Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Hinduism in China}}
[[Hinduism]] (印度教 ''Yìndùjiào'') entered China around the same time as Buddhism, generally imported by Indian merchants, from different routes. One of them was the "Silk Route by Sea" that started from the [[Coromandel Coast]] in southeast India and reached Southeast Asia and then southeastern Chinese cities; another route was that from the ancient kingdom of [[Kamrupa]], through upper Burma, reaching [[Yunnan]]; a third route is the well-known [[Silk Route]] reaching northwest China, which was the main route through which Buddhism spread into China.

The Tibetans contributed with the translation into Chinese of the ''Pāṇinisūtra'' and the ''[[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]]''.&lt;ref name=Huang86/&gt;{{rp|134}}

In the 7th century there was an intellectual exchange between Taoists and [[Shaktism|Shaktas]] in India, with the translation of the ''[[Daodejing]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]. Some breathing techniques practised in Shaktism are known as ''Cīnācāra'' ("Chinese Practice"), and the Shakta tantras that discuss them trace their origin to Taoism.

The effect of Hinduism in China is also evident in various gods, originally of Hindu origin, which have been absorbed into the [[Chinese folk religion]].

{{Main article|Chinese Manichaeism}}
Manichaeism (摩尼教 Móníjiào or 明教 Míngjiào, "bright transmission") was introduced in China together with Christianity in the 7th century, by land from Central Asia and by sea through south-eastern ports.&lt;ref name=RMW2ed2009/&gt;{{rp|127}} Based on [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] teachings and able to adapt to different cultural contexts, the Manichaean religion spread rapidly both westward to the [[Roman Empire]] and eastward to China. Historical sources speak of the religion being introduced in China in 694, though this may have happened much earlier.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|pp=172–174}} Manichaeans in China held that their religion was first brought to China by Mōzak under [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (650–83). Later, the Manichaean bishop Mihr-Ohrmazd, who was Mōzak's pupil, also came to China, where he was granted an audience by empress [[Wu Zetian]] (684–704), and according to later Buddhist sources he presented at the throne the ''Erzongjing'' ("Text of the Two Principles") that became the most popular Manichaean scripture in China.&lt;ref name=LieuEI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Lieu|first=Sammuel L.C.|title=Manicheism v. in China|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|year=2002|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manicheism-v-in-china-1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117082114/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manicheism-v-in-china-1|archive-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism had bad reputation among Tang dynasty authorities, who regarded it as an erroneous form of Buddhism. However, as a religion of the Western peoples ([[Bactria]]ns, [[Sogdia]]ns) it was not outlawed, provided that it remained confined to them not spreading among Chinese. In 731 a Manichaean priest was asked by the current Chinese emperor to make a summary of Manichaean religious doctrines, so that he wrote the ''Compendium of the Teachings of Mani, the Awakened One of Light'', rediscovered at [[Dunhuang]] by [[Aurel Stein]] (1862–1943); in this text Mani is interpreted as an incarnation of [[Laozi]].&lt;ref name=LieuEI/&gt; As time went on, Manichaeism conflicted with Buddhism but appears to have had good relations with the Taoists; an 8th-century version of the ''[[Huahujing]]'', a Taoist work polemical towards Buddhism, holds the same view of the Manichaean Compendium, presenting Mani as Laozi's reincarnation among the Western barbarians.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=173}}

In the early 8th century, Manichaeism became the official religion of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. As [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] were traditional allies of the Chinese, also supporting the Tang during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] at the half of the century, the Tangs' attitude towards the religion relaxed and under the Uyghur Khaganate's patronage Manichaean churches prospered in [[Nanjing]], [[Yangzhou]], [[Jingzhou]], [[Shaoxing]] and other places. When the Uyghur Khaganate was defeated by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] in 840, Manichaeism's fortune vanished as anti-foreign sentiment arose among the Chinese. Manichaean properties were confiscated, the temples were destroyed, the scriptures were burnt and the clergy was laicised, or killed, as was the case of seventy nuns who were executed at the Tang capital [[Chang'an]].{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=173}} In the same years all [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|foreign religions were suppressed]] under [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] (840–846).

The religion never recovered from the persecutions, but it persisted as a distinct underground movement at least until the 14th century, particularly among southeastern Chinese, resurfacing from time to time supporting [[peasant rebellion]]s.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=173}} The [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) continued to suppress Manichaeism as a subversive cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Lieu|first=Sammuel L.C.|title=Polemics Against Manichaeism as a Subversive Cult in Sung China (A.D.c.960-c.1200)|publisher=John Rylands University Library of Manchester|year=1980|isbn=090557849X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1120, a rebellion led by [[Fang La]] was believed to have been caused by Manichaeans, and widespread crackdown of unauthorised religious assemblies took place.&lt;ref name=LieuEI/&gt; During the subsequent Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), foreign religions were generally granted freedom,&lt;ref name=LieuEI/&gt; but the following [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) renewed discriminations against them.&lt;ref name=LieuEI/&gt; Small Manichaean communities are still active in modern China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Char Yar|title=Monijiao (Manichaeism) in China|conference=Worldwide Conference for Historical Research|year=2012|url=https://www.academia.edu/1963810/Monijiao_Manichaeism_in_China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manichaeism is thought to have exerted a strong influence on some of the currents of [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular sects]], such as that which gave rise to [[Xiantiandao]].

Zoroastrianism (琐罗亚斯德教 ''Suǒluōyàsīdéjiào'' or 祆教 ''Xiānjiào'', "Heaven worship teaching"; also named 波斯教 ''Bōsījiào'', "Persian teaching"; also 拜火教 ''Bàihuǒjiào'', "fire-worshippers' transmission"; also 白頭教 ''Báitóujiào'', "old age teaching"){{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=171}}&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stausberg|first1=Michael|last2=Vevaina|first2=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=1118786270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm_-CAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}} was first introduced in northern China in the 4th century, or even earlier, by the Sogdians, and it developed through three stages.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|148–149}} Some scholars provide evidences that would attest the existence of Zoroastrianism, or broader Iranian religion, in China, as early as the 2nd and 1st century BCE. Worship of [[Mithra]] was indeed performed at the court of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (187-87 BCE).&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|149}}

The first phase of Zoroastrianism in China started in the [[Northern Wei|Wei]] and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] dynasties of the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]]' period (220–589), when Sogdian Zoroastrians advanced into China. They did not proselytise among Chinese, and from this period there are only two known fragments of Zoroastrian literature, both in [[Sogdian language]]. One of them is a translation of the ''[[Ashem Vohu]]'' recovered by Aurel Stein in Dunhuang and now preserved at the [[British Museum]]. The Tang dynasty (618–907) prohibited Chinese people to profess Zoroastrianism, so it remained primarily a religion of foreign residents. Before the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (756–763), Sogdians and Chinese lived as segregated ethnic groups; however, after the rebellion intermarriage became common and the Sogdians were gradually assimilated by the Chinese.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|150}}

In addition to the Sogdian Zoroastrians, after the fall of the [[Sasanid dynasty]] (651), through the 7th and 8th centuries [[Iran]]ian Zoroastrians, including aristocrats and ''[[magi]]'',&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|151}} migrated to northern China.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|148}} Fleeing the [[Islamization of Iran|Islamisation of Iran]], they settled in the cities of [[Chang'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Kaifeng]], [[Yangzhou]], [[Taiyuan]] and elsewhere.{{sfnb|Ching|1993|p=171}} In the Tang period it is attested that there were at least twenty-nine Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]s in northern urban centres.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|150}} During the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|great purge of foreign religions]] under Emperor Wuzong of Tang also Zoroastrianism was target of suppression.

The second phase of Zoroastrianism in China was in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907–960), and saw the development of an indigenous Chinese Zoroastrianism that lasted until modern times. During this period, the gods of Sogdian Zoroastrianism were assimilated into the [[Chinese folk religion]]; Zoroastrian currents of the Chinese folk religion were increasingly practised by the Chinese and survived until the 1940s.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|149}} Chinese Zoroastrian temples were witnessed to be active in [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], [[Hubei]] until those years.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|153}}

The third phase started in the 18th century when [[Parsi]] merchants sailed from [[Mumbai]] to [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangzhou]]. Parsi cemeteries and fire temples were built in these coastal cities, in east China. The Parsis were expelled when the Communist Party of China rose to power in 1949.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|149}} A Parsi fire temple was built in [[Shanghai]] in 1866, and was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|154}} Starting in the 1980s there has been a new wave of Parsis settling in China.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|155}}

In [[Classical Chinese]], Zoroastrianism was first referred to as 胡天 ''Hútiān'', which in the Wei-Jin period became the appellation of all northern nomads. In the early Tang, a new character was invented specifically for Zoroastrianism, 祆 ''xiān'', meaning the "worship of Heaven". Curiously, in the Far East the Zoroastrians were regarded as "Heaven worshippers" rather than "fire worshippers" (in Japanese the name of the religion is ''Kenkyō'', the same as in Chinese). At the time it was rare for the Chinese to create a character for a foreign religion, and this is an evidence of the effect of Zoroastrians in Tang Chinese society.&lt;ref name=StausbergVevaina/&gt;{{rp|149}}

===Japanese Shinto===
[[File:Jilin Shrine.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Shinto shrine]] of [[Jilin City|Jilin]] city, [[Jilin]] province.]]
Between 1931 and 1945, with the establishment of the [[Japan]]ese-controlled ''[[Manchukuo]]'' ("Manchu Country") in northeast China ([[Manchuria]]), many [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] of [[State Shinto]] (神社, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''shénshè'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''jinja'') were established in the area.

They were part of the project of cultural assimilation of Manchuria into Japan, or [[Japanisation]], the same policy that was being applied [[Shinto in Taiwan|to Taiwan]]. With the end of the Second World War and of the Manchu Country (Manchukuo) in 1945, and the return of Manchuria and Taiwan to China under the [[Guomindang]], Shinto was abolished and the shrines were destroyed.

During Japanese rule also many [[Japanese new religions]], or independent [[Shinto sects and schools|Shinto sects]], proselytised in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the [[Omoto teaching]], the [[Tenri teaching]] and the [[Konko teaching]] of Shinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stalker|first=Nancy K.|title=Prophet Motive: Deguchi Onisaburō, Oomoto, and the Rise of New Religions in Imperial Japan|year=2008|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IcxT_DsxN4C|isbn=0824832264}} p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-metaphysical and anti-theistic thoughts==
{{Main|Irreligion in China}}
China has a history of schools of thought not relying upon conceptions of an absolute, or putting absolutes into question. [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] observes that [[Confucianism]] itself is primarily pragmatic and [[humanism|humanist]], in it the "thisworldliness" being the priority.&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer, 2005. p. 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Juergensmeyer|first=Mark|title=Religion in Global Civil Society|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195188357|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195188356.001.0001}} p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the differences between Western and Chinese concepts of "religion", [[Hu Shih]] stated in the 1920s what has been translated in Western terminology as "China is a country without religion and the Chinese are a people who are not bound by religious superstitions".{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=127}}

The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' contains several catechistic poems in the ''Decade of Dang'' questioning the authority or existence of the God of Heaven. Later philosophers such as [[Xun Zi]], [[Fan Zhen]], [[Han Fei]], [[Zhang Zai]], and [[Wang Fuzhi]] also criticised religious practices prevalent during their times. During the efflorescence of [[Buddhism]] in the [[Southern and Northern dynasties]], Fan Zhen wrote ''On the Extinction of the Soul'' (神灭论 ''Shénmièlùn'') to criticise ideas of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-soul dualism]], ''[[samsara]]'' and ''[[karma]]''. He wrote that the soul is merely an effect or function of the body, and that there is no soul without the body—after the death and destruction of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuckerman|first=Phil|title=Atheism and Secularity|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO}} p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he considered that cause-and-effect relationships claimed to be evidence of ''karma'' were merely the result of coincidence and bias. For this, he was exiled by [[Emperor Wu of Liang]] (502–549).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5098">There have been a number of '''religious controversies''' over the [[teaching of science]], certain [[religious practice]]s, and in the [[depiction of religion]] or [[depiction of religious figures (disambiguation)|religious figures]] in culture.

:''Main articles: [[Religion]] and [[Controversy]]''
==Science and religion==
{{main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
The greatest contemporary controversy involving religion and science is the teaching of [[evolution]] in schools{{Fact|date=March 2009}}. This debate is most prevalent in generally conservative regions of the United States and there is little serious debate on the subject outside the United States.

==Society==
The [[Chinese Rites controversy]] was a dispute within the Catholic Church from the 1630s to the early 18th century about whether Chinese folk religion rites and offerings to the emperor constituted idolatry or not.

[[Female genital cutting]] and [[circumcision]] attract controversy especially when practiced outside of the countries in which they are commonly performed. 

==Art, literature and popular culture==
===Visual arts===
*The controversial photographic exhibition [[Ecce Homo (exhibition)|Ecce Homo]]
*[[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]
*[[Piss Christ]], a photo taken by American photographer [[Andres Serrano]] of [[Jesus Christ]] in a glass of the photographer's urine
*[[Strelnikoff Mary of Help of Brezje controversy]]
*[[Chris Ofili]] and his [[The Holy Virgin Mary|Sacred Virgin Mary]] montage
*Tania Kovats' ''[[Virgin in a Condom]]'' attracted protests at the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].
*Stanislav Shmulevich was facing hate crime charges for dumping a possibly-stolen Qur'an into a public toilet and publishing a photo of it in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/news/article/2761/student-arrested-in-koran-in-toilet-incidents-at-pace-u Student Arrested in Koran-in-Toilet Incidents at Pace U. - Chronicle.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michellemalkin.com/2007/07/30/which-of-these-is-a-crime-in-america/ Michelle Malkin » Which of these is a crime in America?

===Books===
*''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' has had many complaints centered on the book's speculations and alleged misrepresentations of core aspects of Christianity and the history of the Roman Catholic Church. (see ''[[Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code]]'')

'''Saltigue''', sometimes spelt ''Saltigué'' or wrongly ''Saltigui'', are [[Serer people|Serer]] high priests and priestesses who preside over the religious ceremonies and affairs of the Serer people, such as the ''Xoy'' ceremony, the biggest event in the Serer religious calendar.  They usually come from ancient Serer paternal families.  Such a title is usually inherited by birthright.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Gravrand. La Civilisation Seereer. Pangool. Published by Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines du Senegal (1990). {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalis, Simone, "Medecine Traditionnele Religion et Divination Chez Les Seereer Siin du Senegal", L'Harmattan (1997),  pp 11–297, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''"Saltigi"'' is also adopted by the [[Fula people]]. They were the leaders of the Fulas in some Fula areas, belonging to the [[Denianke Dynasty]] of the [[Empire of Great Fulo]] founded by Koli Tengella Bâ in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. Houtsma. E. J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam 1913–1936. BRILL. {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}. p 663&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that the word "''Saltigi''", used in reference to the Fulas, comes from the [[Mandinka language]], in which it means ''"master of the road"'', used in reference to their neighbors who are Fulani herders and tenders of the flock, the traditional activity of Fulani leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]],  ''Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the [[Gambia]]:'' The Land, the People and the Culture. {{ISBN|9987-9322-2-3}}. p163&lt;/ref&gt; In Serer country, ''Saltigue'', not to be confused with ''Saltigi'', are always [[Divination|diviners]]. In [[Wolof people|Wolof]] areas, they were the assistant chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in [[Senegal]] [[Sine-Saloum]], 1847–1914'', Edinburgh University Press (1968) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of this article deals only with ''Saltigue'' or ''Saltigué''  – "diviners" (the high priests and priestesses) and termed by some scholars as "the ministers of the religious cult";&lt;ref&gt;University of Texas at Austin.

==Role of Saltigues==
The Saltigues were advisers to Serer governments, for example in the old Serer Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]] and [[Baol]]. Their principal role was and still is for the prosperity of the country. In this role, they were responsible for predicting the future of kings; the weather to come (for the purposes of agriculture); any natural disaster or political catastrophe that could befall the country; etc. As such, they were frequently consulted by the Serer kings ([[Maad a Sinig]] and [[Maad Saloum]])&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Serer language]], ''Maad'' and very rarely used ''Maat'' (though correct) means "king" i.e. [[Maad a Sinig]] (King of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]]), [[Maad Saloum]] (King of [[Saloum]]). The  [[Lamane]]s, – the ancient Serer kings and [[landed gentry]], should not be confused with the post-[[Guelowar]] Lamanes who were merely the landed gentry and provincial chiefs answerable to the king. There are two types of Lamanes in Serer chronology : Lamanes pre-Guelowar (the original Lamanes, kings and landowners) and Lamanes during and after the Guelowar period (1350–1969) (mere chiefs and landowners)&lt;/ref&gt; preferably at the beginning of the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alioune Sarr|Sarr, Alioune]], ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a king launches a war against another kingdom, or to repel an attack from another kingdom, the king consults the great assembly of Saltigues to predict the outcome of the battle, as was the case of Saltigué and ''Diaraf'' Wassaly Sene and Saltigué Laba Diene Ngom at the [[Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]] (18 July 1867), commonly known as the Battle of Somb, during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune . Histoire du [[Sine-Saloum]]. Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. pp 31–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Mahawa, ''L'information Historique: L'exemple du Siin.'' Ethiopiques n°54 revue semestrielle de culture négro-africaine. Nouvelle série volume 7 2e semestre 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye, ''Chronique du Royaume du Sine'', IFAN, commenté par Charles Becker &amp; Victor Martin (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal Sine-Saloum, 1847–1914.'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (1968), p 91&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly of Saltigues will predict the outcome, offer precautionary advice on when to launch the attack, the route to take to the battlefield and the animals to be sacrificed, etc. The role of Saltigue was not political. They are not government ministers or politicians, but spiritual advisors and elders. They are the Serer hereditary "Rain priests" – guardians of the [[Serer religion]] and customs, a birthright they inherited from their ancient [[Lamane|Lamanic]] ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune,, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[precolonialism|precolonial]] period, during the ''Raan Festival''&lt;ref&gt;See [[Serer religion]] for Raan Festival.&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in [[Tukar]] annually on the second Thursday after the onset of the [[new moon]] in April, the kings (during the [[Guelowar]] period&lt;ref&gt;In Serer history and chronology, the Guelowar period starts from 1350 during the reign of [[Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh]] – the first Guelowar king to reign in Serer country i.e. the [[Kingdom of Sine]] and ends in 1969 following the deaths of [[Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof]] and [[Maad Saloum]] Fode N'Goye Joof, king of Sine and [[Saloum]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;) will attend the Raan Festival of Tukar, making their way from the capital ([[Diakhao Arrondissement|Diakhao]]). However, the king was extremely careful never to arrive before the Lamane&lt;ref&gt;These should not be confused with pre-Guelowar Lamanes, who were the kings and landowners (the [[landed gentry]] among the old the Serer noble classes).&lt;/ref&gt; and always avoid direct encounters with the Lamane of Tukar. Whilst the Lamane was busy self-meditating, touring Tukar and making offerings to the [[pangool]] Jegan Joof, the Chief Saltigue and his associates drink ''sum-sum'' alcohol all morning before the Festival. It is reported that drinking ''sum-sum'' improves the Saltigue's vision of the future and the supernatural world.

Having prepared himself sufficiently, the Saltigue and his close associates leave the house and mount their horses, then start their own tour of some of the sacred places of the country. The Saltigué's tour is programmed to follow the king, but ultimately to cross his path at a location known as 'Nenem". In this location, the king, aware that the Saltigue is coming, stops the royal entourage. The king and the royal entourage must wait for the Saltigue and his companions to pass. After these high priests and priestesses have passed, the king then gives the signal to the royal entourage to pass as they proceed to their next destination. This is the kind of respect that is afforded to the Saltigue.&lt;ref&gt;Galvan, Dennis Charles, ''The State Must Be Our Master of Fire:'' How Peasants Craft Culturally Sustainable Development in Senegal. Berkeley, University of California Press ( 2004). pp 202–204&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars like [[Alioune Sarr]] note that Saltigues are famously celebrated and respected in Serer Kingdoms because of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sarr, Alioune, ''Histoire du Sine-Saloum'', Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n° 3–4, 1986–1987. p31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serer and Lebu healing methods==
The [[Lebu people]] share many cosmo-spiritual beliefs with the [[Serer people|Serers]]. Many Lebu ''rab'' ([[jinn]]) are actually Serer ''[[pangool]]'' ([[Reincarnation#Serer religion|ancestral spirits or saints]]). The sacred dwelling place of the Lebu ''rab'' is the same as the Serer ''pangool'' called ''Sangomar'', based on the ancient Serer and [[Diola people|Diola]] legend of ''[[The legend of Jambooñ and Agaire|Jambooñ and Agaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Many variations of spelling especially Agaire. Sometimes spelt Ageen, Ougeney, Eugene, etc. Jambooñ is sometimes spelt Jambon, Jambonge, etc. Fata Ndiaye in Ethiopiques {{fr}} [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?article1245 Le SIIN avant les Gelwaar]&lt;/ref&gt; – two young sisters whose boat split into half around [[the Point of Sangomar]]. One sails to the north, the other sails south. Those traveling south became the ancestors of the Diolas and the other became the ancestor of the Serers. The healing method of the Lebu is called ''ndepp'' while the Serer healing method is called ''Loup''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abibitumikasa.com/yabb/Attachments/coumbalambafinalreport.pdf The Cosaan Foundation]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ecole pratique des hautes études (France). 6. section: Sciences économiques et sociales.

'''Satyatma Tirtha''' (officially known as {{IAST|Śrī Śrī 1008 Śrī Satyātma-tīrtha Śrīpādaṅgaḷavaru}};  {{lang-kn|ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀ ೧೦೦೮ ಶ್ರೀ ಸತ್ಯಾತ್ಮತೀರ್ಥ ಶ್ರೀಪಾದಂಗಳವರು}}) is the present pontiff of [[Uttaradi Matha]], a [[matha|math]] (''also'' mutt) dedicated to [[Dvaita]] philosophy, which has a large following in southern [[India]].&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt;&lt;ref name=pune/&gt; He is the 42nd pontiff of [[Uttaradi Matha]] since [[Madhvacharya]], the chief proponent and the one who rejuvenated this [[Dvaita Vedanta|Dvaita philosophy]].

==Early life and education==
He was born to Shri Pandit Sudhavisharada Rangāchārya Guttal and K.S. Rukmābāi in Mumbai on 8 March 1973 and named Sarvajñāchārya.&lt;ref name=uttaradi/&gt; Pandit Rangacharya is the ''pūrvāshrama'' (previous to ''sannyāsa'' order) son of Shri Satyapramoda Tīrtha Swamiji.

==Sannyasa==
Sarvajñāchārya became a ''[[Sannyasa|sannyasi]]'' at the age of 23, directly from ''[[brahmacharya]]'' at Raghūttama Tīrtha Brundāvana, Tirukoilur (in Tamil Nadu) in the presence of Shri Satyapramoda Tīrtha Swamiji on 24 April 1996&lt;ref name=uttaradi&gt;{{cite web|last=Math|first=Shri Uttaradi|title=Shri Satyatma Tirta|url=http://www.uttaradimath.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=186|publisher=Shri Uttaradi Math. uttaradimath.org|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was renamed as Satyātma Tīrtha. He is also known as Abhinava Raghūttama Tīrtharu since he received ''sannyasa'' directly from ''[[brahmacharya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.udupitoday.com/udtoday/news_Udupi-Pontiff-of-Uttaradi-mutt-begins-Chaturmas-today-in-Udupi_422.html|title=Udupi: Pontiff of Uttaradi mutt begins Chaturmas today in Udupi|publisher=Udupi Today Media Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Satyātma Tīrtha Swamiji is the second peethadipati of Uttaradi Math who is a ''[[Brahmacharya|brahmachāri]]''.

==Social responsibility==
Shri Satyatma Tirtha, through Uttaradi Math, encouraged water harvesting and management expert, the ''waterman of India'' and  [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] winner [[Rajendra Singh]] to give lecture on water conservation and other topics.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite news|last=Express News Service|first=newindianexpress.com|title=Save Arkavathi, Kumudvathi basins, says Rajendra Singh|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/bangalore/article588331.ece?service=print|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The New Indian Express|date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Uttaradi Math and jointly with Vishwa Madhva Maha Parishat, he is instrumental in helping needy students every year to the tune of Rs.5.00 lakhs (About US$10,000).&lt;ref name=hindu3/&gt;

===Flood relief===
He has supplied relief materials to flood victims of [[Bellary]], [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], [[Raichur]] and [[Bagalkot]] districts during [[2009 India floods|2009 floods]] and also took measures to construct 100 low cost houses to those who lost houses in the flood.&lt;ref name=hindu3&gt;{{cite news|last=correspondent|first=Staff|title=Math to construct houses for flood affected|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/10/12/stories/2009101252250300.htm|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also adopted a rural village in [[Raichur]], [[Karnataka]]&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt; for integrated development of the village. He is reportedly trying to redefine the role of religious 'math' in modern day society, so that present day 'math' should try to get rid of evils of modern society.&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt;

==Spiritual discourses==
His spiritual discourses (''pravachana'') attract large gatherings, mainly from followers of Madhvacharya and he specialises in talks on Vedic subjects.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|last=staff reporter|first=thehindu.com|title=Protect Vedic Dharma, Youth told|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/article2856107.ece|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has given spiritual discourses at several places like [[Bangalore]],&lt;ref name=hindu2&gt;{{cite news|last=thehindu.com|title=Spiritual Discourse|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/article3736314.ece|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Hindu, Bangalore|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gulbarga]], [[Malkheda]], [[Udupi]], [[Rajahmundry]],&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt; [[Hyderabad (India)]],&lt;ref name=hindu4&gt;{{cite news|title=For Preservation of Dharma|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/03/05/stories/2003030500370200.htm|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The Hindu (Hyderabad)|date=5 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pune]],&lt;ref name=pune&gt;{{cite news|last=Times news network|title=City plays host to Uttaradi pontiff's religious rite|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-04/pune/27934919_1_chaturmasya-blood-donation-camps-sankalpa|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=The Times of India (Pune)|date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raichur]],&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt; [[Dharwad]]&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt; and [[Chennai]].&lt;ref name=hindu4/&gt; He has also conducted personality development programmes and has written several books on topics like personality development, religion and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylib.in/Index.php?search=jagadguru+sri+1008+sri+satyatma+tirtha+swamiji&amp;field=FAuthor MyLib.in: Online Book Library in Bangalore, Corporate Library solutions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Satyatma Tirtha, as the present head of Uttaradi Matha, has also encouraged other authors to write books on religious experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prasad |first1=PVRK (IAS) |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=When I saw Tirupati Balaji |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C26lbOuDIbYC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=satyatma+tirtha&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VeDatRh6Bd&amp;sig=ddqIfK48aNMgHbSeO6YQ4WjAEI0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=leRZUPLONcjQrQeCt4CYDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=humble%20offering&amp;f=false|format= |accessdate=19 September 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher= |location=  |isbn=9788121209335 |page= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sikhism sidebar}}

'''Sikhism in [[Poland]]''' dates back mostly to the 1990s or early 2000s, during the immigration of [[Indian people|Indians]] to Poland. There are about approximately 700 Sikhs in Poland, with the vast majority of them living in the capital of [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Gurdwaras ==
There is only one [[Gurdwara]] in Poland being stationed in Warsaw. The city's Sikh Gurdwara, called "Gurudwara Singh Sabha",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurudawara.pl/|title=GURUDWARA SINGH SABHA WARSAW POLAND|website=www.gurudawara.pl|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the only Sikh shrine in the whole of [[Eastern Europe]] and it is the place where both Sikhs and [[Sindhis]] come together to celebrate [[Baisakhi]].

== Controversy ==
Sikhs in Poland are generally treated unfavourably by the locals, especially in more rural areas,  due to often being mistaken for [[Muslim]]s for their usually darker skin, [[Dastar|turban]] and beard.

One incident in 2015 involved a Sikh man, Navjot Sawhney, who was attacked by a bouncer outside a nightclub in [[Kraków]] because he looked like a "terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/12029627/Polish-police-tell-British-Sikh-man-what-do-you-expect-after-Paris-attacks-after-nightclub-beating.html|title=Polish police tell British Sikh man 'what do you expect after Paris attacks' after nightclub beating|last=Day|first=Matthew|date=2015-12-02|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jewish Tribune''''' was a privately owned community-based Canadian weekly Jewish [[newspaper]] founded by and closely associated with [[B'nai Brith Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvWQgnl80XIC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%22Jewish+Tribune%22+Canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h30kT4u4PMPf0QGK7rCBCQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jewish%20Tribune%22%20Canada&amp;f=false |title=Transnational identities and practices in Canada |author=Lloyd Lee Wong, Vic Satzewich |publisher=UBC Press |year=2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1964 as ''The Covenant'', B'nai Brith's in-house newsletter and was later relaunched in the mid-1990s as an external publication under its current name.&lt;ref name=susp&gt;{{cite news|title=B'nai Brith's Jewish Tribune suspends print edition|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/israel?q=node/135653|accessdate=February 5, 2015|work=Canadian Jewish News|date=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tribune'' was initially a fortnightly newspaper but became a weekly after several years. At its peak it had a circulation of over 100,000.

As of May 2013, ''The Jewish Tribune'' had a circulation of 60,500 copies&lt;ref&gt;The masthead on their website, as of May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; a week which made it, for a time, the largest Jewish weekly publication in Canada. It was distributed in [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], both by regular mail and by the internet and is available for free from newspaper boxes, news stands, businesses, synagogues and various outlets, mostly in Jewish neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMgRAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Jewish+Tribune%22+Canada&amp;dq=%22Jewish+Tribune%22+Canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mX4kT5bTMumG0QGC5NzJCA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBTgU |title=From immigration to integration: the Canadian Jewish experience: the Canadian Jewish experience: a millennium edition
|author=Ruth Klein, Frank Dimant |publisher= |year=2001 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the newspaper was generally conservative both in Canadian and Israeli politics and may be considered an ideological successor to the ''Jewish Times'', a newspaper published by [[M.J. Nurenberger]] from 1974 to 1992 as a right-wing rival to the more centrist ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]''. Many of the news items it carries documented activities of B'nai Brith Canada and generally reflected the views of the organization while being critical of, first, the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] and then its successor, the [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]].

Notable contributors to the newspaper included Mike Cohen, city councilman for Cote Saint Luc and Daniel Smajovits, a well-known Montreal-area writer. M.J.Nurenberger's daughter, Atara Beck, worked as a journalist for the ''Jewish Tribune'' for several years before moving to Israel in 2011, after which she freelanced as the paper's Israel correspondent.

''The Jewish Tribune'''s main competition was the ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'' (which temporarily ceased publication in 2013). It now also competes with ''Shalom Life'', an English-Hebrew publication aimed at Israeli Canadians in Toronto, and other regional Jewish publications.

B'nai Brith Canada president [[Frank Dimant]] was the newspaper's publisher from its inception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pj1_-1a79kkC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Jewish+Tribune%22+Canada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h30kT4u4PMPf0QGK7rCBCQ&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jewish%20Tribune%22%20Canada&amp;f=false |title=No Holiday: 80 Places You Don't Want to Visit |author=Martin Cohen |publisher= |year=2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until September 2014 when incoming B'nai Brith Canada president Michael Mostyn was appointed publisher.

On January 29, 2015, B'nai Brith Canada announced that it was suspending publication of the periodical's print edition for 13 weeks, and possibly permanently. Though the organization claimed it would continue publishing the ''Tribune'' online, one of its columnists announced that staff had been laid off,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=mikecohencsl|author=Mike Cohen|number=561236630921437185|date=30 January 2015|title=The Jewish Tribune has ceased publication of its print edition and laid off staff until further notice. B'nai Brith will try &amp;amp; revive it,.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its website was not updated after the suspension was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B’nai Brith Canada’s weekly to suspend print edition|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/01/30/news-opinion/world/bnai-brith-canadas-daily-to-suspend-print-edition#.VMvDiY211Zp.twitter|accessdate=January 30, 2015|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it has been reported that the newspaper has folded as a cost-cutting move along with the sale of B'nai Brith Canada's headquarters and other facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B’nai Brith Canada puts headquarters up for sale|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/07/09/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/bnai-brith-canada-puts-headquarters-alzheimers-facility-up-for-sale-2|accessdate=July 10, 2015|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tula corresponds to the zodiacal sign of [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]], and overlaps with about the second half of October and about the first half of November in the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002p19"/&gt; In Vedic texts, the Tula month is called '''Issa''' (IAST: Issa), but in these ancient texts it has no zodiacal associations.&lt;ref name="Dershowitz2008p123"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nachum Dershowitz|author2=Edward M.

It is preceded by the solar month of [[Kanyā]], and followed by the solar month of [[Vṛścik‌‌‌a]].&lt;ref name=sewell5/&gt; The sun, according to the Hindu texts, begins it southward journey and days begin to get shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=Śaṅkara Bālakr̥shṇa Dīkshita|title=The Indian Calendar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MiAQAAMAAJ |year=1896|publisher=S.

For example, the ''Surya Siddhanta'', dated to c. 400 CE, calculates the duration of Tula to be 29 days, 21 hours, 26 minutes and 24 seconds.&lt;ref name=sewell10/&gt; In contrast, the ''Arya Siddhanta'' calculates the duration of the Tula month to be 29 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 48 seconds.&lt;ref name=sewell10&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Sewell|author2=Śaṅkara Bālakr̥shṇa Dīkshita|title=The Indian Calendar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MiAQAAMAAJ |year=1896|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; Company|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian solar month names are significant in epigraphical studies of South Asia. For example, ''Tula'' month, along with other solar months, are found inscribed in medieval era Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E Hultzsch|title=Epigraphia Indica|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MxE9AAAAYAAJ |year= 1906|publisher =Education Society Press|pages=6, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tula is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to [[Libra (astrology)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bangalore V.
