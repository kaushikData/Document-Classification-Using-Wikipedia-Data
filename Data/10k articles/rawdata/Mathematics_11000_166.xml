      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">In [[mathematics]], an [[abelian variety]] ''A'' defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is said to have '''CM-type''' if it has a large enough [[commutative ring|commutative]] [[subring]] in its [[endomorphism ring]] End(''A''). The terminology here is from [[complex multiplication]] theory, which was developed for [[elliptic curve]]s in the nineteenth century. One of the major achievements in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] of the twentieth century was to find the correct formulations of the corresponding theory for abelian varieties of [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] ''d'' &gt; 1. The problem is at a deeper level of abstraction, because it is much harder to manipulate [[analytic function]]s of [[several complex variable]]s.

The formal definition is that 

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{End}_\mathbb{Q}(A) &lt;/math&gt;

the [[tensor product]] of End(''A'') with the [[rational number]] field '''Q''', should contain a commutative subring of [[vector space dimension|dimension]] 2''d'' over '''Q'''. When ''d'' = 1 this can only be a [[quadratic field]], and one recovers the cases where End(''A'') is an [[order (ring theory)|order]] in an [[imaginary quadratic field]]. For ''d'' &gt; 1 there are comparable cases for [[CM-field]]s, the complex [[quadratic extension]]s of [[totally real field]]s. There are other cases that reflect that ''A'' may not be a [[simple abelian variety]] (it might be a [[cartesian product]] of elliptic curves, for example). Another name for abelian varieties of CM-type is abelian varieties with '''sufficiently many complex multiplications'''.

It is known that if ''K'' is the complex numbers, then any such ''A'' has a [[field of definition]] which is in fact a [[number field]]. The possible types of endomorphism ring have been classified, as rings with [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (the [[Rosati involution]]), leading to a classification of CM-type abelian varieties. To construct such varieties in the same style as for elliptic curves, starting with a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] Î in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, one must take into account the [[Riemann relations]] of abelian variety theory.

The '''CM-type''' is a description of the action of a (maximal) commutative subring ''L'' of End&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') on the holomorphic [[tangent space]] of ''A'' at the [[identity element]]. [[Spectral theory]] of a simple kind applies, to show that ''L'' acts via a basis of [[eigenvector]]s; in other words ''L'' has an action that is via [[diagonal matrices]] on the holomorphic vector fields on ''A''. In the simple case, where ''L'' is itself a number field rather than a product of some number of fields, the CM-type is then a list of [[complex embedding]]s of ''L''. There are 2''d'' of those, occurring in [[complex conjugate]] pairs; the CM-type is a choice of one out of each pair. It is known that all such possible CM-types can be realised.

Basic results of [[Goro Shimura]] and [[Yutaka Taniyama]] compute the [[HasseâWeil L-function]] of ''A'', in terms of the CM-type and a Hecke L-function with [[Hecke character]], having [[infinity-type]] derived from it. These generalise the results of [[Max Deuring]] for the elliptic curve case.

'''Adaptive simulated annealing''' ('''ASA''') is a variant of [[simulated annealing]] (SA) algorithm in which the algorithm parameters that control temperature schedule and random step selection are automatically adjusted according to algorithm progress. This makes the algorithm more efficient and less sensitive to user defined parameters than canonical SA. These are in the standard variant often selected on the basis of experience and experimentation (since optimal values are problem dependent), which represents a significant deficiency in practice.

The algorithm works by representing the parameters of the function to be optimized as continuous numbers, and as dimensions of a hypercube (N dimensional space). Some SA algorithms apply [[Gaussian]] moves to the state, while others have distributions permitting faster temperature schedules. Imagine the state as a point in a box and the moves as a rugby-ball shaped cloud around it.  The temperature and the step size are adjusted so that all of the search space is sampled to a coarse resolution in the early stages, whilst the state is directed to favorable areas in the late stages. Another ASA variant, thermodynamic simulated annealing, automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states, according to the laws of thermodynamics.

In [[sociology]], '''age stratification''' refers to the [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] ranking of people into [[age group]]s within a [[society]].&lt;ref name="AndersenTaylor2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=Margaret L.|last2=Taylor|first2=Howard Francis|title=Sociology: the essentials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7s9hvROWjoC&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=28 January 2011|date=2006-02-22|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-00683-1|pages=87â88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age stratification could also be defined as a system of inequalities linked to age. In Western societies, for example, both the old and the young are perceived and treated as relatively incompetent and excluded from much social life. Age stratification based on an [[ascribed status]] is a major source inequality, and thus may lead to [[ageism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/age-stratification|title=age stratification - Dictionary definition of age stratification {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is a social inequality resulting from age stratification. This is a sociological concept that comes with studying aging population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Sociology|last=Scott &amp; Marshall|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780191726842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Age stratification within a population can have major implications, affecting things such as workforce trends, social norms, family structures, government policies, and even health outcomes.

== Age structure ==

[[File:Argentina_population_pyramid_2009.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argentina_population_pyramid_2009.png|thumb|Argentina population pyramid 2009]]Age stratification is not a fixed phenomena, but rather varies with the passage of time and between cultures and populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population An Introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John|year=2014|isbn=9781305094505|location=United States|pages=298â340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting [[Population pyramid|age structure]] of a population changes the age stratification. As [[life expectancy]] has increased dramatically in the last two centuries, the age strata by which people are characterized has changed. With people living longer lives than ever before in more developed areas of the world, there is now a category of "old-old" people which refers to persons ages 85+.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter13-aging-and-the-elderly/|title=Chapter 13. Aging and the Elderly â Introduction to Sociology â 1st Canadian Edition|website=opentextbc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the [[Population pyramid|age structure]] of populations affects the way in which they distribute resources, along with a shift in expectations from different age strata. For example, as Japan's population has dramatically aged - with individuals aged 65+ accounting for approximately 25% of the population - the country has found itself with an unfavorable [[dependency ratio]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/graying-japan-tries-to-embrace-the-go|title=Graying Japan Tries to Embrace the Golden Years|last=Schlesinger &amp; Martin|date=2016-01-16|work=Wall Street Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to avoid economic downfall, the expectations of young-old and middle-old people have changed. Elderly citizens are encouraged to put off retirement, and the elderly tech market is booming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Age discrimination ==

Age is a major component of entry and exit for many parts of life - school, starting a family, retirement, etc.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke, et al.|first=|date=June 2011|title=The Social Structuring of Mental Health over the Adult Life Course: Advancing Theory in the Sociology of Aging|url=https://www.jstor.org.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/stable/41290130|journal=Social Forces|volume=89|pages=1287â1313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting social status with age can lead to [[ageism]]. [[Discrimination]] by a person's age can have profound impacts on the way a society operates - including behavioral expectations, the distribution of resources,  and even policies and laws.

=== Workplace ===

In the United States, discrimination on the basis of one's age is prohibited in the workplace by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Enforced by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], the act is meant to keep employers unbiased in regards to age when dealing with hiring, promotions, terms, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/discrimination/agedisc|title=Age Discrimination|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also makes it illegal for employees to be harassed due to their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/age.cfm|title=Age Discrimination|website=www.eeoc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergence of new occupations can lead to a polarization of age cohorts by workforce. As a result, a quick shift of the occupational distribution increases occupational age discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=Alair|title=Age stratification at work: Trends in occupational age segregation in the United States, 1950â2000|url=https://doi-org.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.rssm.2005.08.001|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=24|issue=3|pages=299â310|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2005.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health outcomes ===

The unequal distribution of resources and social support between age strata can lead to [[Health equity|health disparities]] in the population. In the U.S., evidence indicates older adults face higher risk of experiencing [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and other mental health issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''AndrÃ© Sainte-LaguÃ«''' ({{IPA-fr|ÉÌ.dÊe sÉÌt.la.É¡y}}, 20 April 1882 â 18 January 1950) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] who was a pioneer in the area of [[graph theory]].
His research on [[Party-list proportional representation|seat allocation methods]] (published in 1910) led to one being named after him, the [[Sainte-LaguÃ« method]]. Also named after him is the [[Sainte-LaguÃ« Index]] for measuring the proportionality of an electoral outcome.

He is also notable for his informal calculation that supposedly demonstrated that [[Bumblebee#Flight|a bumblebee could not fly]], referred to in the introduction of 'Le Vol des Insectes' (Hermann and Cle, Paris, 1934) by the entomologist [[Antoine Magnan]]. This casual calculation was based on a comparison between an aeroplane and a bee, making the wrong assumption that bees' wings were smooth and flat. He, and others, soon corrected this assumption, but the story of the scientist who demonstrated that bee flight was impossible persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/bees Known math: Bees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012143442/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/bees |date=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published several popular math texts, including "From the known to the unknown" (foreword by biologist [[Jean Rostand]]) which has been translated into several languages.

==Biography==

Born in [[Casteljaloux]] ([[Lot-et-Garonne]]) in 1882, Sainte-Lague was admitted at once, at the age of 20 years at the [[Ecole Polytechnique]] and [[Ecole Normale Superieure]]. He chose the latter and became a professor in the provinces, then in Paris. During [[World War I]], having been wounded three times, he was attached to the Department of Inventions of the Normal School from 1917 to 1919, studied long-range artillery shells, and thereafter, the [[flight]] of birds and matters relating to aviation (theory test fish).

After the First World War, as a professor in the schools of Paris, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers]]. Then he received in 1938, the Chair of Applied Mathematics. He trained generations of engineers and technicians. He was the organizer and host of the Mathematics Section of the Palace of Discovery, where his encyclopedic mind is still present.

Besides his academic career, he led a life of an activist, especially the [[:fr:ConfÃ©dÃ©ration des travailleurs intellectuels|Confederation of Intellectual Workers]], of which he was president in 1929. From the earliest days of the occupation, he took an important part in the resistance and was even imprisoned for a while. He resumed his duties at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers after the Liberation and had a growing number of students. At his death he was teaching three courses totaling two thousand five hundred students.

Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]], [[Croix de Guerre]] and [[Medal of the Resistance]], a professor at the School of Special Public Works, chairman of the International Confederation Intellectual of Workers, Vice-President of the Confederation of the Middle Class, former president of the Society of Fellows, former vice-president of National Economic Council, former member of the General Council of the Banque de France, former Deputy Provisional Consultative Assembly .(...)

His sudden death came at the very moment he had just accepted the chairmanship of the Committee of the League of Friends of the Psychic Institute, where he was vice president in 1949 and member since 1934. "(R. Warcollier, Vice- President of IMI, JanuaryâFebruaryâMarch 1950)

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=[[Classical electromagnetism|Electrodynamics]]}}

'''Bloch wave â MoM''' is a [[First principle|first principles]] technique for determining the photonic [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] of triply-periodic electromagnetic media such as [[photonic crystal]]s.  It is based on the 3-dimensional spectral domain method (Kastner [1987]), specialized to triply-periodic media.  This technique uses the [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM) in combination with a [[Bloch wave]] expansion of the electromagnetic field to yield a matrix eigenvalue equation for the propagation bands.  The eigenvalue is the frequency (for a given propagation constant) and the eigenvector is the set of current amplitudes on the surface of the scatterers.  Bloch wave - MoM is similar in principle to the [[Plane wave expansion method]], but since it additionally employs the method of moments to produce a surface integral equation,  it is significantly more efficient both in terms of the number of unknowns and the number of [[Plane wave|plane waves]] needed for good convergence.  

Bloch wave - MoM is the  extension to 3 dimensions of the [[Frequency selective surface#Spectral domain method (overview and mathematical introduction)|spectral domain MoM method]] commonly used for analyzing 2D periodic structures such as [[frequency selective surfaces]] (FSS).  In both cases, the field is expanded as a set of eigenfunction modes (either a Bloch wave in 3D or a discrete plane wave  - aka [[Floquet theory|Floquet mode]] - spectrum in 2D), and an integral equation is enforced on the surface of the scatterers in each unit cell.  In the FSS case, the unit cell is 2-dimensional and in the photonic crystal case, the unit cell is 3-dimensional.

== Field equations for 3D PEC photonic crystal structures ==


The Bloch wave - MoM approach will be illustrated here for the case of perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) structures admitting only electric current sources, '''J'''.  However, It can also be readily expanded to dielectric structures, using the well-known interior and exterior equivalent problems commonly employed in ordinary spatial domain method of moments formulations (Harrington [1961]).  In dielectric problems, there are twice as many unknowns - '''J''' &amp; '''M''' - and also twice as many equations to enforce - continuity of tangential '''E''' &amp; '''H''' - at the dielectric interfaces (Scott [1998]).


For PEC structures, the electric field '''E''' is related to the vector magnetic potential '''A''' via the well-known relation:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E ~ = ~ -j k \eta \left [ \mathbf A + \frac {1}{k^2} \nabla (\nabla \bullet \mathbf A) \right ]  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1.1) &lt;/math&gt;

and the vector magnetic potential is in turn related to the source currents via:

: &lt;math&gt;  \nabla^2 \mathbf A + k^2 \mathbf A ~ = ~ -\mathbf J ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1.2) &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;  k^2 ~ = ~ \omega^2 (\mu \epsilon) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1.3) &lt;/math&gt;

== Bloch wave expansion of the fields ==



To solve equations (1.1) and (1.2) within the infinite periodic volume, we may assume a [[Bloch wave]] expansion for all currents, fields and potentials:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf J(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mnp} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)} ~~~~~(2.1a)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mnp} ~ \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)} ~~~~(2.1b)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf A(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_{mnp} ~ \mathbf A(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)} ~~~(2.1c)  &lt;/math&gt;

where for simplicity, we assume an orthogonal lattice in which Î± only depends on ''m'',  Î² only depends on ''n'' and Î³ only depends on ''p''.  With this assumption,

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha_m ~ = ~ k_0 ~ \sin \theta_0 ~ \cos \phi_0 ~ + ~ \frac{2m\pi}{l_x} ~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2a) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \beta_n ~ = ~ k_0 ~ \sin \theta_0 ~ \sin \phi_0 ~ + ~ \frac{2n\pi}{l_y} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2b)  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_p ~ = ~ k_0 ~ \cos \theta_0 ~ + ~ \frac{2p\pi}{l_z}  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.2c) &lt;/math&gt;

and,

: &lt;math&gt; k_0 ~ = ~ 2\pi/\lambda  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(2.3) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are the unit cell dimensions in the ''x'',''y'',''z'' directions respectively, Î» is the effective wavelength in the crystal and Î¸&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, Ï&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the directions of propagation in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]].  


The quantity ''k'' in equations (1.1) and (1.2) comes originally from the time derivative in Maxwell's equations and is the ''free space'' propagation constant (actually, the propagation constant of whatever dielectric medium the metallic scatterers are embedded in), proportional to frequency as in equation (1.3).  On the other hand, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the equations above comes from the ''assumed Bloch wave solution'' given by equations (2.1) &amp; (2.2).  As a result, it represents the propagation constant inside the periodic medium, inversely proportional to wavelength.  These two  ''k's'', i.e. the free space propagation constant (proportional to frequency) and the propagation constant of the Bloch wave (inversely proportional to wavelength), are in general different thereby allowing for dispersion in the solution.  The band diagram is essentially a plot of ''k'' as a function of ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.


The Bloch wave expansions in equations (2.1) are nothing more than exponential [[Fourier series]] multiplied by the cell-to-cell propagation factor:  &lt;math&gt;  e^{j(\alpha_0 x + \beta_0 y + \gamma_0 z)}.   &lt;/math&gt;   The Bloch wave expansions are chosen since any field solution within an infinite periodic volume must have the same periodicity as the medium itself, or stated another way, the fields in neighboring cells must be identical up to a (real or complex) propagation factor.  In passbands the propagation factor is an exponential function with purely imaginary argument and in the stop bands (or band gaps) it is a decaying exponential function whose argument has a real component.


The wave numbers Î±&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  Î²&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and  Î³&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the relations:       &lt;math&gt; ~~  | \alpha_0  | ~  \le ~  \frac{\pi}{l_x}  ~ , ~~~~ | \beta_0  | ~  \le ~  \frac{\pi}{l_y}  ~ , ~~~~  | \gamma_0  | ~  \le ~  \frac{\pi}{l_z}    ~~~~     &lt;/math&gt;     and outside of these ranges, the bands are periodic.  

The Bloch waves are periodic functions of space, with periods ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''l''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; and the bands are periodic functions of wavenumber, with periods: &lt;math&gt;  \frac{2\pi}{l_x} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;  \frac{2\pi}{l_y} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  \frac{2\pi}{l_z} &lt;/math&gt;

== Integral equation for PEC media ==


Substituting equations (2.1) into (1.1) and (1.2) yields the spectral domain Greens function relating the radiated electric field to its source currents:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf E(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) ~ = ~ \frac {jk\eta}{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2-\gamma_p^2} ~ \mathbf G_{mnp} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.1)  &lt;/math&gt;
where,

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf G_{mnp} ~ = ~ \left ( \begin{matrix}

1-\frac{\alpha_m^2}{k^2} &amp; -\frac{\alpha_m \beta_n}{k^2} &amp; -\frac{\alpha_m \gamma_p}{k^2}  \\
 -\frac{\alpha_m \beta_n}{k^2} &amp; 1- \frac {\beta_n^2}{k^2} &amp; -\frac{\beta_n \gamma_p}{k^2} \\
 -\frac{\alpha_m \gamma_p}{k^2} &amp; - \frac {\beta_n \gamma_p}{k^2} &amp; 1- \frac {\gamma_p^2}{k^2}

\end{matrix}
\right )         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.2)  &lt;/math&gt;


is the tensor Green's function in the spectral domain.  Note that the spatial domain convolution has been transformed into a simple multiplication in the spectral domain, consistent with the convolution theorem for Fourier transforms.


With this equation for the electric field, the electric field boundary condition (requiring that the total tangential electric field be zero on the surface of PEC scatterer) becomes:

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \sum_{mnp} ~ \frac {1}{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2-\gamma_p^2} ~ \mathbf G_{mnp} ~ \mathbf J(\alpha_m,\beta_n,\gamma_p) ~ e^{j(\alpha_m x + \beta_n y + \gamma_p z)} ~ = ~ \mathbf 0  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(3.3)  &lt;/math&gt;


Since we are seeking characteristic modes (eigenmodes) of the structure, there is no impressed E-field on the RHS of this electric field integral equation (EFIE).  Equation (3.3) is not strictly correct however, since it is only the tangential components of electric field that are actually zero on the surface of the PEC scatterer.  This inexactness will be resolved presently, when we test this equation with the electric current basis functions - defined as residing on the surface of the scatterer.

== Method of moments (MoM) solution ==

As is usual in the method of moments, the source currents are now expanded in terms of a sum over some known set of basis functions with unknown weighting coefficients ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; :

: &lt;math&gt; ~ \mathbf J(x,y,z) ~ = ~ \sum_j ~ J_j ~ \mathbf J_j(x,y,z)   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.1)  &lt;/math&gt;

Different structures will have different sets of basis functions for representing the currents on the elements and as in the ordinary spatial domain method of moments, the solution (in this case, the band diagram) ''is a function of the set of basis functions used''.

Substituting (4.1) into (3.3) and then testing the resulting equation with the ''i''-th current basis function (i.e., dotting from the left and integrating over the domain of the ''i''-th current basis function, thereby completing the quadratic form) produces the ''i''-th row of the matrix eigenvalue equation for a 3-dimensional array of PEC scatterers as:


: &lt;math&gt; ~ \sum_j ~ J_j ~\left[~ \sum_{mnp} ~ \frac {\mathbf J_i(-\alpha_m,-\beta_n,-\gamma_p) ~ \mathbf G_{mnp} ~ \mathbf J_j(\alpha_m,\beta_n, \gamma_p)}{k^2-\alpha_m^2-\beta_n^2-\gamma_p^2} \right]~  = ~ \mathbf 0  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(4.2)  &lt;/math&gt;


As in all MoM formulations, the reaction concept in electromagnetics (Rumsey [1954], Harrington [1961]) was used in obtaining this equation.  The electric field boundary/continuity conditions are "tested" (or enforced) by being integrated against electric current basis functions (for dielectric structures, the magnetic field continuity conditions are additionally tested by being integrated against magnetic current basis functions), and this is how the electric (and magnetic) field boundary conditions are converted into a matrix equation via the method of moments.  This process is wholly analogous to that used to decompose a periodic function into its Fourier sine &amp; cosine components, the only difference being that in this case the basis functions are not necessarily orthogonal, merely linearly independent. 


This matrix equation is easy to implement and requires only that the 3D [[Fourier transform]] (FT) of the basis functions be computed, preferably in closed form (see Scott [1998], available on researchgate.net).  In fact, computing bands of a 3D photonic crystal with this method is no more difficult than computing reflection and transmission from a 2D [[Frequency selective surfaces|periodic surface]] using the [[Frequency selective surface#Spectral domain method (overview and mathematical introduction)|spectral domain method]] .  This is because equation (4.2) is identical to the basic EFIE for a freestanding PEC FSS (Scott [1989] or [[Frequency selective surface#Method of moments (MoM) solution|Frequency selective surface eq. (4.2)]]), the only difference being the stronger singularity in 3D which significantly accelerates convergence of the triple sums, and of course the fact that the vectors are now 3-dimensional.  As a result, an ordinary PC is sufficient to compute bands of many types of photonic crystals.


It's evident from (4.2) that the EFIE could become singular whenever the free space wavenumber is exactly equal to one of the wave numbers in any of the 3 periodic coordinate directions.  This can happen for example when the  free space wavelength exactly equals the lattice spacing.  This is a statistically rare occurrence in computational practice and corresponds to a propagation anomaly similar to a Wood's reflection anomaly for gratings.

== Computing bands ==

To compute bands of the crystal (i.e.  ''k''-''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; diagrams), successive values of frequency (''k'')  are tried - in conjunction with pre-selected values of propagation constant (''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and propagation direction (Î¸&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp; Ï&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) - until a combination is found which drives the determinant of the matrix to zero.  Equation (4.2) has been used to compute bands in various types of doped and undoped [[photonic crystal]]s (Scott [1998], Scott [2002], both available on researchgate.net).  Not surprisingly, doping photonic crystals with defects provides a means for designing photonic passbands, in just the same way that doping semiconductors with chemical impurities provides a means for designing electronic passbands.


For many subsectional basis functions, such as those having a half-sine or triangular shape along a round wire, the FT of the basis function for negative wave numbers -Î±, -Î², -Î³ is the complex conjugate of the basis function FT for positive wave numbers.  As a result, the matrix in eqn. (4.2) is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]].  And as a result of that, only half the matrix needs to be computed.  And a second result is that the determinant is a purely real function of the real-valued wavenumber ''k''.  Zeroes generally occur at zero-crossings (inflection points, where curvature is zero), so a simple root-finding algorithm such as [[Newton's method]] is usually sufficient to find the roots to a very high degree of accuracy.  If may still be useful however to plot the determinant as a function of ''k'', to observe its behavior near the zeros.


As a matter of computational convenience, whenever the matrix is larger than 2x2 it's vastly more efficient to compute the determinant either by reducing the matrix to [[Triangular matrix|upper triangular]] form using [[QR decomposition]] or to [[Gaussian elimination#Computing determinants|compute the determinant]] by reducing to [[Gaussian elimination#Echelon form|echelon form]] using [[Gaussian elimination]], rather than trying to actually compute the determinant of the matrix directly.

In [[graph theory]], a '''clique graph''' of an [[undirected graph]] ''G'' is another graph ''K''(''G'') that represents the structure of cliques in ''G''.

Clique graphs were discussed at least as early as 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Formal definition==

A [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]] of a graph ''G'' is a set ''X'' of vertices of ''G'' with the property that every pair of distinct vertices in ''X'' are adjacent in ''G''.
A maximal clique of a graph ''G'' is a clique ''X'' of vertices of ''G'', such that there is no clique ''Y'' of vertices of ''G'' that contains all of ''X'' and at least one other vertex.

Given a graph ''G'', its clique graph ''K''(''G'') is a graph such that
* every vertex of ''K''(''G'') represents a maximal clique of ''G''; and
* two vertices of ''K''(''G'') are adjacent when the underlying cliques in ''G'' share at least one vertex in common.

The clique graph ''K''(''G'') can also be characterized as the [[intersection graph]] of the maximal cliques of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
A graph ''H'' is the clique graph ''K''(''G'') of another graph if and only if there exists a collection ''C'' of cliques in ''H'' whose union covers all the edges of ''H'', such that ''C'' forms a [[Helly family]]. This means that, if ''S'' is a subset of ''C'' with the property that every two members of ''S'' have a non-empty intersection, then ''S'' itself should also have a non-empty intersection. However, the cliques in ''C'' do not necessarily have to be maximal cliques.&lt;ref name="characterization"/&gt;

When ''H''&amp;nbsp;=''K''(''G''), a family ''C'' of this type may be constructed in which each clique in ''C'' corresponds to a vertex ''v'' in ''G'', and consists of the cliques in ''G'' that contain ''v''. These cliques all have ''v'' in their intersection, so they form a clique in ''H''. The family ''C'' constructed in this way has the Helly property, because any subfamily of ''C'' with pairwise nonempty intersections must correspond to a clique in ''G'', which can be extended to a maximal clique that belongs to the intersection of the subfamily.&lt;ref name="characterization"/&gt;

Conversely, when ''H'' has a Helly family ''C'' of its cliques, covering all edges of ''H'', then it is the clique graph ''K''(''G'') for a graph ''G'' whose vertices are the [[disjoint union]] of the vertices of ''H'' and the elements of ''C''. This graph ''G'' has an edge for each pair of cliques in ''C'' with nonempty intersection, and for each pair of a vertex of ''H'' and a clique in ''C'' that contains it. However, it does not contain any edges connecting pairs of vertices in ''H''. The maximal cliques in this graph ''G'' each consist of one vertex of ''H'' together with all the cliques in ''C'' that contain it, and their intersection graph is isomorphic to&amp;nbsp;''H''.&lt;ref name="characterization"/&gt;

However, this characterization does not lead to efficient algorithms: the problem of recognizing whether a given graph is a clique graph is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The cop-win graphs can be recognized in [[polynomial time]] by a [[greedy algorithm]] that constructs a dismantling order. They include the [[chordal graph]]s, and the graphs that contain a [[universal vertex]].

==Definitions==
===Pursuit-evasion===
Cop-win graphs (and the complementary class of graphs, robber-win graphs) were introduced by {{harvtxt|Nowakowski|Winkler|1983}} in the context of the following pursuit-evasion game, whose invention they credit to G. Gabor and A. Quilliot. Two players, a cop and a robber, are positioned at different initial vertices of a given graph. They play in turns; on each player's turn, the player may either move to an adjacent vertex or stay put. The game ends, and the cop wins, if the cop can end his turn on the same vertex as the robber. The robber wins by indefinitely evading the cop. A cop-win graph is a graph with the property that, no matter where the two players start, the cop can always force a win.&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;{{citation

===Dismantling===
The [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|closed neighborhood]] {{math|''N''[''v'']}} of a vertex {{mvar|v}} in a given graph is the set of vertices consisting of {{mvar|v}} itself and all other vertices adjacent to {{mvar|v}}. The vertex {{mvar|v}} is said to be ''dominated'' by another vertex {{mvar|w}} when {{math|''N''[''v''] â ''N''[''w'']}}. That is, {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} are adjacent, and every other neighbor of {{mvar|v}} is also a neighbor of {{mvar|w}}.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{citation

A ''dismantling order'' or ''domination elimination ordering'' of a given graph is an ordering of the vertices such that, if the vertices are removed one-by-one in this order, each vertex (except the last) is dominated. A graph is dismantlable if and only if it has a dismantling order.&lt;ref name="nw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;

The family of cop-win graphs is closed under [[Strong product of graphs|strong products of graphs]]. The cop can win in a strong product of cop-win graphs by playing to win one of the factors of the product, and after doing so playing in the remaining factors in the same way while continuing to stay on the same vertex as the robber in the already-won factor.&lt;ref name="nw"/&gt; For instance, the [[king's graph]], a strong product of two [[path graph]]s, is cop-win.&lt;ref&gt;For the fact that a strong product of paths is cop-win, see {{harvtxt|Nowakowski|Winkler|1983}}.

It is not true that every [[induced subgraph]] of a cop-win graph is cop-win. However, certain special induced subgraphs do remain cop-win.
{{harvtxt|Nowakowski|Winkler|1983}} define a ''retraction'' of a graph {{mvar|G}} onto one of its [[induced subgraph]]s {{mvar|H}} to be a mapping from the vertices of {{mvar|G}} to the vertices of {{mvar|H}} that maps each vertex of {{mvar|H}} to itself, and that maps each two adjacent vertices of {{mvar|G}} either to the same vertex as each other or to a pair of adjacent vertices in {{mvar|H}}. Then, as they argue, the family of cop-win graphs is closed under retraction. For, a cop can win in {{mvar|H}} by simulating a game in {{mvar|G}}. Whenever the winning strategy in {{mvar|G}} would call for the cop to stay put, or to follow an edge whose endpoints are mapped to the same vertex of {{mvar|H}}, the cop stays put in {{mvar|H}}. And in all other cases, the cop follows the edge in {{mvar|H}} that is the image under the retraction of a winning edge in {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref name="nw"/&gt;

==Equivalence of cop-win and dismantlability==
Every dismantlable graph is cop-win. A winning strategy for the cop is to find a dominated vertex {{mvar|v}}, and to follow (by induction) an optimal strategy on the graph formed by removing {{mvar|v}}, pretending that the robber is on the vertex that dominates {{mvar|v}} whenever he is actually on {{mvar|v}}. This will result either in an actual win of the game, or in a position where the robber is on {{mvar|v}} and the cop is on the dominating vertex, from which the cop can win in one more move.&lt;ref name="nw"/&gt; This strategy can be used as the basis for a proof by induction of the fact that, in an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph, the cop can force a win in at most {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 4}} moves.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Conversely, every cop-win graph has a dominated vertex. For, if the robber plays optimally to make the game last as long as possible and the last position of the game before the cop wins has the cop at vertex ''c'' and the robber at ''r'', then ''r'' must be dominated by ''c'', else the robber could prolong the game for at least one move. The function that maps ''r'' onto ''c'' and leaves every other vertex in place is a retraction, so the graph formed by removing the dominated vertex must remain cop-win. By induction, it follows that every cop-win graph is dismantlable.&lt;ref name="nw"/&gt; The same argument shows that, in a graph with no dominated vertices, the robber can never lose: there is always a move to a vertex that is not adjacent to the cop. In an arbitrary graph that is not cop-win, the robber can win by removing all dominated vertices and playing within the remaining subgraph, which must be non-empty else the graph would be dismantlable.

==Recognition algorithms and the family of all dismantling orders==
If a vertex in a cop-win graph is dominated, then (as other dominated vertices are removed) it remains dominated until it is either removed itself or it becomes the final vertex of a dismantling order. Therefore, the collection of valid dismantling orders has the structure of an [[antimatroid]], and a dismantling order can be found by a simple [[greedy algorithm]] that repeatedly finds and removes any dominated vertex. The process succeeds if and only if the graph is cop-win, so as well as providing an algorithm for finding dismantling orders this method provides an algorithm for testing whether a given graph is cop-win.
One way to find each successive vertex to remove is to perform the following steps:
*Find all triangles in the graph, and count the number of triangles that each edge participates in.
*Repeatedly find a vertex {{mvar|v}} that is an endpoint of an edge participating in a number of triangles equal to the degree of {{mvar|v}}, delete {{mvar|v}}, and decrement the triangles per edge of each remaining edge that formed a triangle with {{mvar|v}}.
In a graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices, {{mvar|m}} edges, and [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] {{mvar|d}}, this process can be carried out in time

An alternative and more complicated algorithm by {{harvtxt|Spinrad|2004}} involves maintaining a number called the ''deficit'' for each adjacent pair of vertices {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}, which counts the number of neighbors of {{mvar|x}} that are not neighbors of {{mvar|y}}. It constructs and maintains the actual ''deficit set'' (neighbors of {{mvar|x}} that are not neighbors of {{mvar|y}}) only when the deficit is small. To speed up its computations, it uses [[decision tree]]s that classify vertices according to their adjacencies with small blocks of {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''}} vertices. It performs the following steps:
*Group the vertices into blocks, build a decision tree for each block, and classify all vertices by their sets of neighbors within each block.
*Use this classification to compute the deficits for all adjacent pairs of vertices, in time {{math|''O''(''n''/log ''n'')}} per pair.
*Repeat the following steps {{math|''n''/log ''n''}} times, until all vertices have been removed:
**Construct the deficit set for all adjacent pairs that have deficit at most {{math|log&amp;nbsp;''n''}} and that have not already had this set constructed, using the initial set of decision trees, in time {{math|''O''(''n''/log ''n'')}} per pair.
**Repeat the following steps {{math|log ''n''}} times:
***Find a pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} with constructed but empty deficit set.
***Delete vertex {{mvar|x}}
***Remove {{mvar|x}} from all constructed deficit sets that it belongs to.
**Build a decision tree for the {{math|log ''n''}} removed vertices and classify all vertices by their neighbors in this set.
**Use the decision tree to update the deficits for all edges in constant time per edge.
The time for this procedure is {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''mn''/log&amp;nbsp;''n'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Every finite [[chordal graph]] is a dismantlable graph, and every elimination ordering of a chordal graph (an ordering of the vertices in which the later neighbors of each vertex form a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]]) is a valid dismantling order.

Every graph that has a [[universal vertex]] is dismantlable, for every other vertex is dominated by the universal vertex, and any vertex ordering that places the universal vertex last is a valid dismantling order. Conversely, [[almost all]] dismantlable graphs have a universal vertex, in the sense that, among all {{mvar|n}}-vertex dismantlable graphs, the fraction of these graphs that have a universal vertex goes to one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The '''hereditarily cop-win graphs''' are the graphs in which every [[Isometry|isometric]] subgraph is cop-win. This is not true for all cop-win graphs; for instance, the five-vertex [[wheel graph]] is cop-win but contains an isometric 4-cycle, which is not cop-win, so this wheel graph is not hereditarily cop-win. The hereditarily cop-win graphs are the same as the bridged graphs, graphs in which every cycle of length four or more has a shortcut, a pair of vertices closer in the graph than they are in the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{short description|Theorem on graph coloring of an infinite graph}}

In [[graph theory]], the '''De BruijnâErdÅs theorem''' relates [[graph coloring]] of an [[infinite graph]] to the same problem on its finite [[Glossary of graph theory#subgraph|subgraphs]]. It states that, when all finite subgraphs can be colored with &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; colors, the same is true for the whole graph. The theorem was proved by {{harvs|first2=Paul|last2=ErdÅs|author2-link=Paul ErdÅs|first1=Nicolaas Govert|last1=de Bruijn|author1-link=Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|year=1951|txt}}, after whom it is named.

The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem has several different proofs, all depending in some way on the [[axiom of choice]]. Its applications include extending the [[four-color theorem]] and [[Dilworth's theorem]] from finite graphs and [[partially ordered set]]s to infinite ones, and reducing the [[HadwigerâNelson problem]] on the [[chromatic number]] of the plane to a problem about finite graphs. It may be generalized from finite numbers of colors to sets of colors whose [[cardinality]] is a [[strongly compact cardinal]].

==Definitions and statement==
An [[undirected graph]] is a mathematical object consisting of a set of [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], and another set of pairs of vertices, called [[edge (graph theory)|edges]]. The two vertices associated with each edge are called its endpoints. The graph is finite when its vertices and edges form [[finite set]]s, and infinite otherwise. A [[graph coloring]] associates each vertex with a color drawn from a set of colors, in such a way that every edge has two different colors at its endpoints. A frequent goal in graph coloring is to minimize the total number of colors that are used; the [[chromatic number]] of a graph is this minimum number of colors.&lt;ref&gt;For these basic definitions, see {{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}, pp. 1â2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[four-color theorem]] states that every finite graph that can be drawn without crossings in the [[Euclidean plane]] needs at most four colors, but some other graphs require more than four colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consequence of the [[axiom of choice]] that the chromatic number is [[well-defined]] for infinite graphs, but for these graphs the chromatic number might itself be infinite.{{sfnp|KomjÃ¡th|2011}}

A [[subgraph (graph theory)|subgraph]] of a graph is another graph obtained from a subset of its vertices and a subset of its edges. If the larger graph is colored, the same coloring can be used for the subgraph. Therefore, the chromatic number of a subgraph cannot be larger than the chromatic number of the whole graph. The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem concerns the chromatic numbers of infinite graphs, and shows that (again, assuming the axiom of choice) they can be calculated from the chromatic numbers of their finite subgraphs. It states that, if the chromatic numbers of the finite subgraphs of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have a finite maximum value &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then the chromatic number of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; itself is exactly &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, if there is no finite [[upper bound]] on the chromatic numbers of the finite subgraphs of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then the chromatic number of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; itself must be infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}, Theorem 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Hadwiger-Nelson.svg|thumb|A seven-coloring of the plane, and the four-chromatic [[Moser spindle]] drawn as a unit distance graph in the plane, providing upper and lower bounds for the [[HadwigerâNelson problem]].]]
One application of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem is to the [[HadwigerâNelson problem]], which asks how many colors are needed to color the points of the [[Euclidean plane]] so that every two points that are a unit distance apart have different colors. This is a [[graph coloring]] problem for an infinite graph that has a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] for every point of the plane and an edge for every two points whose [[Euclidean distance]] is exactly one. The subgraphs of this graph are called [[unit distance graph]]s. A seven-vertex unit distance graph, the [[Moser spindle]], requires four colors; in 2018, much larger unit distance graphs were found that require five colors.{{sfnp|Lamb|2018}} The whole infinite graph has a known coloring with seven colors based on a hexagonal tiling of the plane. Therefore, the chromatic number of the plane must belong to the set {5,6,7}, but it is not known which of these three numbers is the correct value. The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem shows that, for this problem, there exists a finite unit distance graph with the same chromatic number as the whole plane, so if the chromatic number is greater than five then this fact can be proved by a finite calculation.{{sfnp|Soifer|2008|page=39}}

The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem may also be used to extend [[Dilworth's theorem]] from finite to infinite [[partially ordered set]]s. Dilworth's theorem states that the width of a partial order (the maximum number of elements in a set of mutually incomparable elements) equals the minimum number of chains ([[total order|totally ordered]] subsets) into which the partial order may be partitioned. A partition into chains may be interpreted as a coloring of the [[comparability graph|incomparability graph]] of the partial order. This is a graph with a vertex for each element of the order and an edge for each pair of incomparable elements. Using this coloring interpretation, together with a separate proof of Dilworth's theorem for finite partially ordered sets, it is possible to prove that an infinite partially ordered set has finite width {{mvar|w}} if and only if it has a partition into {{mvar|w}} chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harzheim|2005}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;5.6, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem extends the [[four-color theorem]] from finite planar graphs to infinite planar graphs. Every finite planar graph can be colored with four colors, by the four-color theorem. The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem then shows that
every graph that can be drawn without crossings in the plane, finite or infinite, can be colored with four colors. More generally every infinite graph for which all finite subgraphs are planar can again be four-colored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Barnette|1983}}. {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1967}} states the same result for the five-color theorem for countable planar graphs, as the four-color theorem had not yet been proven when he published his survey and as the proof of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem that he gives only applies to countable graphs. For the generalization to graphs in which every finite subgraph is planar (proved directly via GÃ¶del's compactness theorem) see {{harvtxt|Rautenberg|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem may also be used to answer a question of [[Fred Galvin]] concerning an [[intermediate value theorem]] for graph chromatic numbers: for every two finite numbers {{math|''j'' &lt; ''k''}}, and every graph {{mvar|G}} with chromatic number {{mvar|k}}, there is a subgraph of {{mvar|G}} with chromatic number {{mvar|j}}. To see this, find a finite subgraph of {{mvar|G}} with the same chromatic number as {{mvar|G}} itself, and then delete vertices one by one until the target chromatic number {{mvar|j}} is reached. However, the situation for infinite chromatic numbers is more complicated: it is consistent with set theory that there exists a graph with {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} vertices,  and with chromatic number {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but with no subgraph of chromatic number {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Here, {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the first and second [[countable set|uncountable]] [[Aleph number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|KomjÃ¡th|1988}}; {{harvtxt|KomjÃ¡th|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proofs==
The original proof of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem, by De Bruijn, used [[transfinite induction]].{{sfnp|Soifer|2008|page=236}}

{{harvtxt|Gottschalk|1951}} provided the following very short proof, based on [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Tychonoff]]'s [[Tychonoff's theorem|compactness theorem]] in topology. Suppose that, for the given infinite graph {{mvar|G}}, every finite subgraph is {{mvar|k}}-colorable, and let {{mvar|X}} be the space of all assignments of the {{mvar|k}} colors to the vertices of {{mvar|G}} (regardless of whether they form a valid coloring). Then {{mvar|X}} may be given a topology as a [[product space]] {{math|''k''&lt;sup&gt;''V''(''G'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}. By Tychonoff's theorem this topological space is [[compact space|compact]]. For each finite subgraph {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|G}}, let {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the subset of {{mvar|X}} consisting of assignments of colors that validly color {{mvar|F}}. Then the system of sets {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a family of [[closed set]]s with the [[finite intersection property]], so by compactness it has a nonempty intersection. Every member of this intersection is a valid coloring of {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}. Gottschalk states his proof more generally as a proof of the theorem of {{harvtxt|Rado|1949}} that generalizes the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different proof using [[Zorn's lemma]] was given by [[Lajos PÃ³sa (mathematician)|Lajos PÃ³sa]], and also in the 1951 Ph.D. thesis of [[Gabriel Andrew Dirac]]. If {{math|G}} is an infinite graph in which every finite subgraph is {{mvar|k}}-colorable, then by Zorn's lemma it is a subgraph of a [[maximal element|maximal]] graph {{mvar|M}} with the same property (one to which no more edges may be added without causing some finite subgraph to require more than {{mvar|k}}&amp;nbsp;colors). The [[binary relation]] of nonadjacency in {{mvar|M}} is an [[equivalence relation]] and its equivalence classes provide a {{mvar|k}}-coloring of {{mvar|G}}. However, this proof is more difficult to generalize than the compactness proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Harzheim|2005}}. Jensen and Toft attribute to [[Gert Sabidussi]] the observation that Gottschalk's proof is easier to generalize. {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008|pages=238â239}} gives the same proof via Zorn's lemma, rediscovered in 2005 by undergraduate student Dmytro Karabash.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem can also be proved using  [[ultrafilter]]s{{sfnp||Luxemburg|1962}} or [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Hurd|Loeb|1985}} {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1967}} gives a proof for graphs with a countable number of vertices based on [[KÅnig's lemma|KÅnig's infinity lemma]].

==Dependence on choice==
All proofs of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem use some form of the [[axiom of choice]]. Some form of this assumption is necessary, as there exist [[model theory|models]] of mathematics in which both the axiom of choice and the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem are false. More precisely, {{harvtxt|Mycielski|1961}} showed that the theorem is a consequence of the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], a property that is implied by the axiom of choice but weaker than the full axiom of choice, and {{harvtxt|LÃ¤uchli|1971}} showed that the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem and the Boolean prime ideal theorem are equivalent in axiomatic power.&lt;ref&gt;For this history, see {{harvtxt|Cowen|Hechler|MihÃ³k|2002}}. For a simplified proof of LÃ¤uchli's theorem by Mycielski, see {{harvtxt|Cowen|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a counterexample to the theorem in models of set theory without choice, let {{mvar|G}} be an infinite graph in which the vertices represent all possible real numbers. In {{mvar|G}}, connect each two real numbers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} by an edge whenever the value {{math|({{pipe}}''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''{{pipe}} Â± {{radic|2}})}} is a [[rational number]]. Equivalently, in this graph, edges exist between all real numbers {{mvar|x}} and all real numbers of the form {{math|''x'' Â± ({{radic|2}} + ''q'')}}, where {{mvar|q}} is any rational number. Each path in this graph, starting from any real number {{mvar|x}},
alternates between numbers that differ from {{mvar|x}} by a rational number plus an even multiple of {{radic|2}}
and numbers that differ from {{mvar|x}} by a rational number plus an odd multiple of {{radic|2}}.
This alternation prevents {{mvar|G}} from containing any cycles of odd length, so each of its finite subgraphs
requires only two colors. However, in the [[Solovay model]] in which every set of real numbers is [[Lebesgue measurable]], {{mvar|G}} requires infinitely many colors, since in this case each color class must be a measurable set and it can be shown that every measurable set of real numbers with no edges in {{mvar|G}} must have measure zero. Therefore, in the Solovay model, the (infinite) chromatic number of all of {{mvar|G}} is much larger than the chromatic number of its finite subgraphs (at most two).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shelah|Soifer|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, pp. 541â542.&lt;/ref&gt;

The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem for countable graphs can be shown to be equivalent in axiomatic power, within a theory of [[second-order arithmetic]], to KÅnig's infinity lemma.{{sfnp|Schmerl|2000}}

==Generalizations==
{{harvtxt|Rado|1949}} proves the following theorem, which may be seen as a generalization of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem. Let {{mvar|V}} be an infinite set, for instance the set of vertices in an infinite graph. For each element {{mvar|v}} of {{mvar|V}}, let {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be a finite set of colors. Additionally, for every finite subset {{mvar|S}} of {{mvar|V}}, choose some particular coloring {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{mvar|S}}, in which the color of each element {{mvar|v}} of {{mvar|S}} belongs to {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Then there exists a global coloring {{math|&amp;chi;}} of all of {{mvar|V}} with the property that every finite set {{mvar|S}} has a finite superset {{mvar|T}} on which {{math|&amp;chi;}} and {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}} agree. In particular, if we choose a {{mvar|k}}-coloring for every finite subgraph of an infinite graph {{mvar|G}}, then there is a {{mvar|k}}-coloring of {{mvar|G}} in which each finite graph has a larger supergraph whose coloring agrees with the coloring of the whole graph.&lt;ref&gt;For this connection between Rado's lemma and the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem, see e.g. the discussion following Theorem A of {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a graph does not have finite chromatic number, then the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem implies that it must contain finite subgraphs of every possible chromatic number. Researchers have also investigated other conditions on the subgraphs that are forced to occur in this case; for instance, unboundedly chromatic graphs must also contain every possible finite [[bipartite graph]] as a subgraph. However, they may have arbitrarily large [[odd girth]], and therefore they may avoid any finite set of non-bipartite subgraphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|ErdÅs|Hajnal|1966}}; {{harvtxt|KomjÃ¡th|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The De BruijnâErdÅs theorem also applies directly to [[hypergraph]] coloring problems, where one requires that each hyperedge have vertices of more than one color. As for graphs, a hypergraph has a {{mvar|k}}-coloring if and only if each of its finite sub-hypergraphs has a {{mvar|k}}-coloring.{{sfnp|Soifer|2008|page=239}} It is a special case of the [[compactness theorem]] of [[Kurt GÃ¶del]] stating that a set of [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order]] sentences has a [[model theory|model]] if and only if every finite [[subset]] of it has a model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lake|1975}}, p. 171: "It is straightforward to prove [the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem] using the compactness theorem for first-order logic"&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem can be interpreted as the compactness of the first-order [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] whose non-logical values are any finite set of colors and whose only predicate on these values is inequality.{{sfnp|Rorabaugh|Tardif|Wehlau|2017}}

The theorem may also be generalized to situations in which the number of colors is an infinite [[cardinal number]]. If {{mvar|Îº}} is a [[strongly compact cardinal]], then for every graph {{mvar|G}} and cardinal number {{math|''Î¼'' &lt; ''Îº''}}, {{mvar|G}} has chromatic number at most {{mvar|Î¼}} if and only if each of its subgraphs of cardinality less than {{mvar|Îº}} has chromatic number at most {{mvar|Î¼}}.&lt;ref&gt;This follows immediately from the definition of a strongly compact cardinal {{mvar|Îº}} as being a cardinal such that every collection of formulae of [[infinitary logic]] each of length smaller than {{mvar|Îº}}, that is satisfiable for every subcollection of fewer than {{mvar|Îº}} formulae, is globally satisfiable. See e.g. {{harvtxt|Kanamori|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original De BruijnâErdÅs theorem is the case {{math|1=''Îº'' = âµ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} of this generalization, since a set is finite if and only if its cardinality is less than {{math|âµ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. However, some assumption such as the one of being a strongly compact cardinal is necessary: if the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] is true, then for every infinite cardinal {{math|''&amp;gamma;''}}, there exists a graph {{mvar|G}} of cardinality {{math|(2&lt;sup&gt;''Î³''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} such that the chromatic number of {{mvar|G}} is greater than {{math|''&amp;gamma;''}}, but such that every subgraph of {{mvar|G}} whose vertex set has smaller power than {{mvar|G}} has chromatic number at most {{math|''&amp;gamma;''}}.{{sfnp|ErdÅs|Hajnal|1968}} {{harvtxt|Lake|1975}} characterizes the infinite graphs that obey a generalization of the De BruijnâErdÅs theorem, in that their chromatic number is equal to the maximum chromatic number of their strictly smaller subgraphs.

In mathematics, '''differential inclusions''' are a generalization of the concept of [[ordinary differential equation]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\in F(t,x(t)), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is a [[multivalued function|multivalued map]], i.e. ''F''(''t'', ''x'') is a ''set'' rather than a single point in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\Bbb R}^d&lt;/math&gt;.  Differential inclusions arise in many situations including [[differential variational inequality|differential variational inequalities]], [[projected dynamical system]]s, dynamic [[Coulomb friction]] problems and [[fuzzy set]] arithmetic.

For example, the basic rule for Coulomb friction is that the friction force has magnitude ''Î¼N'' in the direction opposite to the direction of slip, where ''N'' is the normal force and ''Î¼'' is a constant (the friction coefficient). However, if the slip is zero, the friction force can be ''any'' force in the correct plane with magnitude smaller than or equal to ''Î¼N''  Thus, writing the friction force as a function of position and velocity leads to a set-valued function.

==Theory==

Existence theory usually assumes that ''F''(''t'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is an [[hemicontinuous|upper hemicontinuous]] function of ''x'', measurable in ''t'', and that ''F''(''t'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is a closed, convex set for all ''t'' and ''x''. 
Existence of solutions for the initial value problem

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\in F(t,x(t)), \quad x(t_0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;

for a sufficiently small time interval [''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''Îµ''), ''Îµ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 then follows.
Global existence can be shown provided ''F'' does not allow "blow-up" (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Vert x(t)\Vert\,\to\,\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t\,\to\, t^*&lt;/math&gt; for a finite &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t^*&lt;/math&gt;).

Existence theory for differential inclusions with non-convex ''F''(''t'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is an active area of research.

Uniqueness of solutions usually requires other conditions.  
For example, suppose &lt;math&gt;F(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies a [[Lipschitz continuity#One-sided Lipschitz|one-sided Lipschitz condition]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1-x_2)^T(F(t,x_1)-F(t,x_2))\leq C\Vert x_1-x_2\Vert^2&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''C'' for all ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then the initial value problem

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\in F(t,x(t)), \quad x(t_0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;

has a unique solution.

This is closely related to the theory of '''maximal monotone operators''', as developed by Minty and [[HaÃ¯m Brezis]].

[[Aleksei Fedorovich Filippov|Filippov]]'s theory only allows for discontinuities in the derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, but allows no discontinuities in the state, i.e. &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; need be continuous. [[Michelle Schatzman|Schatzman]] and later [[Jean-Jacques Moreau|Moreau]] (who gave it the currently accepted name) extended the notion to ''measure differential inclusion'' (MDI) in which the inclusion is evaluated by taking the [[limit from above]] for &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Stewart2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Stewart|title=Dynamics with Inequalities: Impacts and Hard Constraints|year=2011|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-1-61197-070-8|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Differential inclusions can be used to understand and suitably interpret discontinuous ordinary differential equations, such as arise for [[Coulomb friction]] in mechanical systems and ideal switches in power electronics. An important contribution has been made by A. F. Filippov, who studied regularizations of discontinuous equations. Further the technique of regularization was used by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]] in the theory of [[differential game]]s.

Differential inclusions are also found at the foundation of [[non-smooth dynamical systems]] (NSDS) analysis,&lt;ref name="Kunze2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Markus Kunze|title=Non-Smooth Dynamical Systems|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-67993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is used in the ''analog'' study of switching electrical circuits using idealized component equations (for example using idealized, straight vertical lines for the [[:File:Diode current wiki.png|sharply exponential forward and breakdown conduction regions of a diode characteristic]])&lt;ref name="AcaryBonnefon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vincent Acary|author2=Olivier Bonnefon|author3=Bernard Brogliato|title=Nonsmooth Modeling and Simulation for Switched Circuits|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-9681-4|pages=3â4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the study of certain [[non-smooth mechanics|non-smooth mechanical system]] such as [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip oscillation]]s in systems with [[dry friction]] or the dynamics of [[Impact (mechanics)|impact]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="LeineNijmeijer2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Remco I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1360">In [[mathematics]], a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is called '''elementary amenable''' if it can be built up from [[finite group]]s and [[abelian group]]s by a sequence of simple operations that result in [[amenable group]]s when applied to amenable groups.  Since finite groups and abelian groups are amenable, every elementary amenable group is amenable - however, the converse is not true.

Formally, the class of elementary amenable groups is the smallest subclass of the class of all groups that satisfies the following conditions:
*it contains all finite and all abelian groups
*if ''G'' is in the subclass and ''H'' is isomorphic to ''G'', then ''H'' is in the subclass
*it is closed under the operations of taking [[subgroup]]s, forming [[quotient group|quotients]], and forming [[group extension|extensions]]
*it is closed under [[directed union]]s.

The [[Tits alternative]] implies that any amenable linear group is locally virtually solvable; hence, for linear groups, amenability and elementary amenability coincide.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Euclidean algorithm''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Some widely used textbooks, such as [[I. N. Herstein]]'s ''Topics in Algebra'' and [[Serge Lang]]'s ''Algebra'', use the term "Euclidean algorithm" to refer to [[Euclidean division]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Euclid's algorithm''', is an efficient method for computing the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a [[remainder]]. It is named after the ancient Greek [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]], who first described it in [[Euclid's Elements|his ''Elements'']] (c. 300 BC).
It is an example of an ''[[algorithm]]'', a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to their [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]], and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.

The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.  For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;12 and 105&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and  252&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;105&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;147. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal.  When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.  By [[extended Euclidean algorithm|reversing the steps]], the GCD can be expressed as a [[linear combination|sum]] of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative [[integer]], e.g., {{nowrap begin}}21 = 5 Ã 105 + (â2) Ã 252.{{nowrap end}} The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as [[BÃ©zout's identity]].

The version of the Euclidean algorithm described above (and by Euclid) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other. A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer.  This was proven by [[Gabriel LamÃ©]] in 1844, and marks the beginning of [[computational complexity theory]].  Additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the 20th century.

The Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications.  It is used for reducing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to their [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]] and for performing [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in [[modular arithmetic]]. Computations using this algorithm form part of the [[cryptographic protocol]]s that are used to secure [[internet]] communications, and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by [[integer factorization|factoring large composite numbers]].  The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve [[Diophantine equation]]s, such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to construct [[continued fraction]]s, and to find accurate [[Diophantine approximation|rational approximations]] to real numbers.   Finally, it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in [[number theory]] such as [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|uniqueness of prime factorizations]].  The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths (real numbers), but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers, such as [[Gaussian integer]]s and [[polynomial]]s of one variable.  This led to modern [[abstract algebra]]ic notions such as [[Euclidean domain]]s.

==Background: greatest common divisor==
{{main|Greatest common divisor}}

The Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' is the largest natural number that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the ''greatest common factor'' (GCF), the ''highest common factor'' (HCF), the ''highest common divisor'' (HCD), and the ''greatest common measure'' (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') or, more simply, as (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the latter notation is ambiguous, also used for concepts such as an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in the [[ring of integers]], which is closely related to GCD.

If gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be [[Coprime integers|coprime]] (or relatively prime).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property does not imply that ''a'' or ''b'' are themselves [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3 and 35&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.

[[File:24x60.svg|thumb|upright|alt="Tall, slender rectangle divided into a grid of squares. The rectangle is two squares wide and five squares tall."|A 24-by-60 rectangle is covered with ten 12-by-12 square tiles, where 12 is the GCD of 24 and 60. More generally, an ''a''-by-''b'' rectangle can be covered with square tiles of side-length ''c'' only if ''c'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''.]]

Let ''g'' = gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''). Since ''a'' and ''b'' are both multiples of ''g'', they can be written ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mg'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ng'', and there is no larger number ''G''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''g'' for which this is true. The natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of ''m'' and ''n'' to make ''g'' greater. Thus, any other number ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' must also divide ''g''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' of ''a'' and ''b'' is the unique (positive) common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' that is divisible by any other common divisor ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GCD can be visualized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grossman|first= J. W. | year = 1990 | title = Discrete Mathematics | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | isbn = 0-02-348331-8 | page = 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider a rectangular area ''a'' by ''b'', and any common divisor ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' exactly. The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length ''c'', which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length ''c''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' is the largest value of ''c'' for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) and five squares along the other (60/12&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5).

The GCD of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used multiple times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_21" &gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=21â22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;11, and 3213 can be factored into 3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the [[empty product]]), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ogilvy | first1 = C. S. | author1-link = C. Stanley Ogilvy | last2 = Anderson | first2 = J. T. | year = 1966 | title = Excursions in number theory | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = New York | pages = 27â29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[integer factorization|Factorization]] of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used [[cryptographic protocol]]s is based upon its infeasibility.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_216" &gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=216â219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly [[ring theory]].&lt;ref name="Leveque_p33" /&gt; The greatest common divisor ''g''&amp;nbsp; of two nonzero numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ''ua''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vb'' where ''u'' and ''v'' are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of ''a'' and ''b'' is actually the same as the set of all multiples of ''g'' (''mg'', where ''m'' is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''a'' and ''b'' is the ideal generated by&amp;nbsp;''g'' alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a [[principal ideal]], and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ''ua''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vb''). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.

The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|pp=47â48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

: {{math|1=gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') = gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;gcd(''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'')) = gcd(gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''),&amp;nbsp;''c'') = gcd(gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''c''),&amp;nbsp;''b'').}}

Thus, Euclid's algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers, suffices to calculate the GCD of arbitrarily many integers.

==Description==

===Procedure===
The Euclidean algorithm proceeds in a series of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one. Let ''k'' be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm, starting with zero. Thus, the initial step corresponds to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the next step corresponds to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and so on.

Each step begins with two nonnegative remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the algorithm ensures that the remainders decrease steadily with every step, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; is less than its predecessor ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The goal of the ''k''th step is to find a [[quotient]] ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and [[remainder]] ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; that satisfy the equation

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k&lt;/math&gt;

and that have ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, multiples of the smaller number ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; are subtracted from the larger number ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sub&gt; until the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the initial step (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0), the remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;â2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;â1&lt;/sub&gt; equal ''a'' and ''b'', the numbers for which the GCD is sought. In the next step (''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), the remainders equal ''b'' and the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the initial step, and so on. Thus, the algorithm can be written as a sequence of equations

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a &amp;= q_0  b + r_0 \\
b &amp;= q_1 r_0 + r_1 \\
r_0 &amp;= q_2 r_1 + r_2 \\
r_1 &amp;=q_3 r_2 + r_3 \\
&amp;\,\,\,\vdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''a'' is smaller than ''b'', the first step of the algorithm swaps the numbers. For example, if ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'', the initial quotient ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; equals zero, and the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ''a''. Thus, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than its predecessor ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;0.

Since the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative, a remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; must eventually equal zero, at which point the algorithm stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final nonzero remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; is the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. The number ''N'' cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and zero.

===Proof of validity===
The validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|pp=16â20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step, the final nonzero remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; is shown to divide both ''a'' and ''b''. Since it is a common divisor, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor ''g''. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', including ''g'', must divide ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;; therefore, ''g'' must be less than or equal to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''.

To demonstrate that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; divides both ''a'' and ''b'' (the first step), ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; divides its predecessor ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt;

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;}}

since the final remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is zero. ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; also divides its next predecessor ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt;

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;}}

because it divides both terms on the right-hand side of the equation. Iterating the same argument, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; divides all the preceding remainders, including ''a'' and ''b''. None of the preceding remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. divide ''a'' and ''b'', since they leave a remainder. Since ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;''g''.

In the second step, any natural number ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' (in other words, any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'') divides the remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. By definition, ''a'' and ''b'' can be written as multiples of ''c'' : ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''nc'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are natural numbers. Therefore, ''c'' divides the initial remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, since ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''nc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''n'')''c''. An analogous argument shows that ''c'' also divides the subsequent remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. Therefore, the greatest common divisor ''g'' must divide ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;, which implies that ''g''&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the first part of the argument showed the reverse (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;''g''), it follows that ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, ''g'' is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovasz_2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = LovÃ¡sz |first1=L.|author1-link=LÃ¡szlÃ³ LovÃ¡sz|last2= PelikÃ¡n|first2=J.|last3=Vesztergombi|first3= K. |author3-link= Katalin Vesztergombi | year = 2003 | title = Discrete Mathematics: Elementary and Beyond | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-95584-4 | pages = 100â101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worked example===
[[File:Euclidean algorithm 1071 462.gif|upright|thumb|alt=Animation in which progressively smaller square tiles are added to cover a rectangle completely.|Subtraction-based animation of the Euclidean algorithm. The initial rectangle has dimensions ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1071 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;462. Squares of size 462&amp;times;462 are placed within it leaving a 462&amp;times;147 rectangle. This rectangle is tiled with 147&amp;times;147 squares until a 21&amp;times;147 rectangle is left, which in turn is tiled with 21&amp;times;21 squares, leaving no uncovered area. The smallest square size, 21, is the GCD of 1071 and 462.]]

For illustration, the Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1071 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;462. To begin, multiples of 462 are subtracted from 1071 until the remainder is less than 462. Two such multiples can be subtracted (''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2), leaving a remainder of 147:

: {{math|1=1071 = 2 Ã 462 + 147.}}

Then multiples of 147 are subtracted from 462 until the remainder is less than 147. Three multiples can be subtracted (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3), leaving a remainder of 21:

: {{math|1=462 = 3 Ã 147 + 21.}}

Then multiples of 21 are subtracted from 147 until the remainder is less than 21. Seven multiples can be subtracted (''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7), leaving no remainder:

: {{math|1=147 = 7 Ã 21 + 0.}}

Since the last remainder is zero, the algorithm ends with 21 as the greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462. This agrees with the gcd(1071, 462) found by prime factorization [[#Background|above]]. In tabular form, the steps are

===Visualization===
The Euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor.&lt;ref name="Kimberling_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kimberling|first= C.|authorlink=Clark Kimberling | year = 1983 | title = A Visual Euclidean Algorithm | journal = Mathematics Teacher | volume = 76 | pages = 108â109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assume that we wish to cover an ''a''-by-''b'' rectangle with square tiles exactly, where ''a'' is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using ''b''-by-''b'' square tiles; however, this leaves an ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-by-''b'' residual rectangle untiled, where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-by-''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-by-''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, which we attempt to tile using ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-by-''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).

===Euclidean division===
{{Main|Euclidean division}}

At every step ''k'', the Euclidean algorithm computes a quotient ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; from two numbers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}

where the [[absolute value|magnitude]] of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is strictly less than that of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. The theorem which underlies the definition of the [[Euclidean division]] ensures that such a quotient and remainder always exist and are unique.&lt;ref name="Cohn_1962"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohn|1962|pp=104â110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Euclid's original version of the algorithm, the quotient and remainder are found by repeated subtraction; that is, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; is subtracted from ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; repeatedly until the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is smaller than ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. After that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; are exchanged and the process is iterated. Euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step, which is thus more efficient. Moreover, the quotients are not needed, thus one may replace Euclidean division by the [[modulo operation]], which gives only the remainder. Thus the iteration of the Euclidean algorithm becomes simply

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; mod ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

===Implementations===
Implementations of the algorithm may be expressed in [[pseudocode]]. For example, the division-based version may be [[computer programming|programmed]] as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 319â320&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''function''' gcd(a, b)
     '''while''' b â  0
        t := b; 
        b := a '''mod''' b; 
        a := t; 
     '''return''' a;

At the beginning of the ''k''th iteration, the variable ''b'' holds the latest remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the variable ''a'' holds its predecessor, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;. The step ''b'' := ''a'' mod ''b'' is equivalent to the above recursion formula ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; â¡ ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; mod ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[temporary variable]] ''t'' holds the value of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; while the next remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable ''b'' holds the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas the variable ''a'' holds its predecessor, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In the subtraction-based version which was Euclid's original version, the remainder calculation (''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' mod ''b'') is replaced by repeated subtraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 318â319&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the division-based version, which works with arbitrary integers as input, the subtraction-based version supposes that the input consists of positive integers and stops when ''a'' = ''b'':

 '''function''' gcd(a, b)
     '''while''' a â  b 
         '''if''' a &gt; b
            a := a â b; 
         '''else'''
            b := b â a; 
     '''return''' a;

The variables ''a'' and ''b'' alternate holding the previous remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;. Assume that ''a'' is larger than ''b'' at the beginning of an iteration; then ''a'' equals ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;, since ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. During the loop iteration, ''a'' is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder ''b'' until ''a'' is smaller than ''b''. Then ''a'' is the next remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''b'' is reduced by multiples of ''a'' until it is again smaller than ''a'', giving the next remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on.

The recursive version&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the equality of the GCDs of successive remainders and the stopping condition gcd(''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;.

 '''function''' gcd(a, b)
     '''if''' b = 0
        '''return''' a; 
     '''else'''
        '''return''' gcd(b, a '''mod''' b);

For illustration, the gcd(1071,&amp;nbsp;462) is calculated from the equivalent gcd(462,&amp;nbsp;1071&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;462)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(462,&amp;nbsp;147). The latter GCD is calculated from the gcd(147,&amp;nbsp;462&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;147)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(147,&amp;nbsp;21), which in turn is calculated from the gcd(21,&amp;nbsp;147&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;21)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(21,&amp;nbsp;0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21.

===Method of least absolute remainders===
In another version of Euclid's algorithm, the quotient at each step is increased by one if the resulting negative remainder is smaller in magnitude than the typical positive remainder.&lt;ref name="Ore_least_abs_remainders" &gt;{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart_1964"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stewart|first= B. M. | year = 1964 | title = Theory of Numbers | edition = 2nd | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | pages = 43â44 | lccn = 64010964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the equation

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}

assumed that {{math|1={{!}}''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}}. However, an alternative negative remainder {{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be computed:

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + 1) ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
if {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}} or
: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; 1) ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}
if {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0}}.

If {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is replaced by {{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.}} when {{math|1={{!}}''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{!}}''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}}}, then one gets a variant of Euclidean algorithm such that
: {{math|1={{!}}''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;{{!}}''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;2 }}
at each step.

[[Leopold Kronecker]] has shown that this version requires the least number of steps of any version of Euclid's algorithm.&lt;ref name="Ore_least_abs_remainders" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart_1964" /&gt; More generally, it has been proven that, for every input numbers ''a'' and ''b'', the number of steps is minimal if and only if {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen in order that &lt;math&gt;\left |\frac{r_{k+1}}{r_k}\right |&lt;\frac{1}{\varphi}\sim 0.618,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazard|first=D.|year=1977|title=Le meilleur algorithme d'Euclide pour ''K''[''X''] et '''Z'''|journal=Comptes rendus de l'AcadÃ©mie des Sciences|volume=284|pages=1â4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
[[File:Euklid.jpg|thumb|alt="Depiction of Euclid as a bearded man holding a pair of dividers to a tablet."|The Euclidean algorithm was probably invented centuries before [[Euclid]], shown here holding a [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]].]]

The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use.&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 318"&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] (c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC), specifically in Book&amp;nbsp;7 (Propositions 1â2) and Book&amp;nbsp;10 (Propositions 2â3). In Book&amp;nbsp;7, the algorithm is formulated for integers, whereas in Book&amp;nbsp;10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for [[real number]]s. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths ''a'' and ''b'' corresponds to the greatest length ''g'' that measures ''a'' and ''b'' evenly; in other words, the lengths ''a'' and ''b'' are both integer multiples of the length&amp;nbsp;''g''.

The algorithm was probably not discovered by [[Euclid]], who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his ''Elements''.&lt;ref name="Weil_1983"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = AndrÃ© Weil|last=Weil|first=A. | year = 1983 | title = Number Theory | publisher = BirkhÃ¤user | location = Boston | isbn = 0-8176-3141-0 | pages = 4â6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones_1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jones|first= A. | year = 1994 | chapter = Greek mathematics to AD 300 | title = Companion encyclopedia of the history and philosophy of the mathematical sciences | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 0-415-09238-8 | pages = 46â48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematician and historian [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B.

Centuries later, Euclid's algorithm was discovered independently both in India and in China,&lt;ref name="Stillwell, p. 31"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily to solve [[Diophantine equation]]s that arose in astronomy and making accurate calendars. In the late 5th century, the Indian mathematician and astronomer [[Aryabhata]] described the algorithm as the "pulverizer",&lt;ref name="Tattersall, p. 70"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tattersall|2005|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving Diophantine equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=86â87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a special case of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] had already been described in the Chinese book ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|pp=247â248}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general solution was published by [[Qin Jiushao]] in his 1247 book ''Shushu Jiuzhang'' (æ¸æ¸ä¹ç«  ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tattersall|2005|pp=72, 184â185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Euclidean algorithm was first described in Europe in the second edition of [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de MÃ©ziriac|Bachet's]] ''ProblÃ¨mes plaisants et dÃ©lectables'' (''Pleasant and enjoyable problems'', 1624).&lt;ref name="Tattersall, p. 70"/&gt; In Europe, it was likewise used to solve Diophantine equations and in developing [[continued fraction]]s. The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] was published by the English mathematician [[Nicholas Saunderson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunderson|first1=Nicholas|title=The Elements of Algebra in Ten Books|date=1740|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|url=http://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/structure/2440626|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who attributed it to [[Roger Cotes]] as a method for computing continued fractions efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tattersall|2005|pp=72â76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems, such as [[Gaussian integer]]s and [[Eisenstein integer]]s. In 1815, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Carl Gauss]] used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of [[Gaussian integer]]s, although his work was first published in 1832.&lt;ref name="Gauss_1832" /&gt; Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (published 1801), but only as a method for [[continued fraction]]s.&lt;ref name="Stillwell, p. 31"/&gt; [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|1997|pp=31â32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such as unique factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lejeune Dirichlet|1894|pp=29â31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by [[Richard Dedekind]], who used Euclid's algorithm to study [[algebraic integer]]s, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|Fermat's two-square theorem]] using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dedekind]] in {{Harvnb|Lejeune Dirichlet|1894|loc=Supplement XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dedekind also defined the concept of a [[Euclidean domain]], a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described [[#Euclidean domains|below]]). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|2003|pp=41â42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other applications of Euclid's algorithm were developed in the 19th century. In 1829, [[Jacques Charles FranÃ§ois Sturm|Charles Sturm]] showed that the algorithm was useful in the [[Sturm's theorem|Sturm chain]] method for counting the real roots of polynomials in any given interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sturm |first = C. | authorlink = Jacques Charles FranÃ§ois Sturm | year = 1829 | title = MÃ©moire sur la rÃ©solution des Ã©quations numÃ©riques | journal = Bull. des sciences de FÃ©russac | volume = 11 | pages = 419â422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Euclidean algorithm was the first [[integer relation algorithm]], which is a method for finding integer relations between commensurate real numbers. Several novel [[integer relation algorithm]]s have been developed, such as the algorithm of [[Helaman Ferguson]] and R.W. Forcade (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=IntegerRelation|title=Integer Relation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[LenstraâLenstraâLovÃ¡sz lattice basis reduction algorithm|LLL algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson |first = I. | date = 12 August 2002 | title = Jazzing Up Euclid's Algorithm | journal = ScienceNews | url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/172/title/Math_Trek__Jazzing_Up_Euclids_Algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cipra | first = B.

In 1969, Cole and Davie developed a two-player game based on the Euclidean algorithm, called ''The Game of Euclid'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = A.

The players take turns removing ''m'' multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of ''x'' and ''y'' stones, where ''x'' is larger than ''y'', the next player can reduce the larger pile from ''x'' stones to ''x'' â ''my'' stones, as long as the latter is a nonnegative integer. The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = J. | year = 1977 | title = Elementary Number Theory: A Problem Oriented Approach | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-262-68028-9 | pages = 1â8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical applications==

===BÃ©zout's identity===
[[BÃ©zout's identity]] states that the greatest common divisor ''g'' of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jones |first1=G. A. | last2 = Jones | first2 = J. M. | year = 1998 | chapter = Bezout's Identity | title = Elementary Number Theory | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | pages = 7â11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is always possible to find integers ''s'' and ''t'' such that ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''sa''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''tb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohn|1962|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The integers ''s'' and ''t'' can be calculated from the quotients ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. by reversing the order of equations in Euclid's algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the next-to-last equation, ''g'' can be expressed in terms of the quotient ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; and the two preceding remainders, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt;:

: {{math|1=''g'' = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.}}

Those two remainders can be likewise expressed in terms of their quotients and preceding remainders,

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â4&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and
: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â5&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.}}

Substituting these formulae for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â3&lt;/sub&gt; into the first equation yields ''g'' as a linear sum of the remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â5&lt;/sub&gt;. The process of substituting remainders by formulae involving their predecessors can be continued until the original numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are reached:

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b'' â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''.}}

After all the remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. have been substituted, the final equation expresses ''g'' as a linear sum of ''a'' and ''b'': ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''sa''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''tb''. [[BÃ©zout's identity]], and therefore the previous algorithm, can both be generalized to the context of [[Euclidean domain]]s.

===Principal ideals and related problems===
BÃ©zout's identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor ''g'' of two numbers ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name="Leveque_p33" &gt;{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the set of all numbers ''ua''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vb'', where ''u'' and ''v'' are any two integers. Since ''a'' and ''b'' are both divisible by ''g'', every number in the set is divisible by ''g''. In other words, every number of the set is an integer multiple of ''g''. This is true for every common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. However, unlike other common divisors, the greatest common divisor is a member of the set; by BÃ©zout's identity, choosing ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s'' and ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'' gives ''g''. A smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set, since every member of the set must be divisible by ''g''. Conversely, any multiple ''m'' of ''g'' can be obtained by choosing ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ms'' and ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mt'', where ''s'' and ''t'' are the integers of BÃ©zout's identity. This may be seen by multiplying BÃ©zout's identity by ''m'',

: {{math|1=''mg'' = ''msa'' + ''mtb''.}}

Therefore, the set of all numbers ''ua''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vb'' is equivalent to the set of multiples ''m'' of ''g''. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (''a'' and ''b'') is equivalent to the set of multiples of gcd(''a'', ''b''). The GCD is said to be the generator of the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''a'' and ''b''. This GCD definition led to the modern [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts of a [[principal ideal]] (an ideal generated by a single element) and a [[principal ideal domain]] (a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] in which every ideal is a principal ideal).

Certain problems can be solved using this result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider two measuring cups of volume ''a'' and ''b''. By adding/subtracting ''u'' multiples of the first cup and ''v'' multiples of the second cup, any volume ''ua''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vb'' can be measured out. These volumes are all multiples of ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;gcd(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'').

===Extended Euclidean algorithm===
{{Main|Extended Euclidean algorithm}}

The integers ''s'' and ''t'' of BÃ©zout's identity can be computed efficiently using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. This extension adds two recursive equations to Euclid's algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=90â93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
: {{math|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;}}

with the starting values

: {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;â2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;â2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}
: {{math|1=''s''&lt;sub&gt;â1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;â1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.}}

Using this recursion, BÃ©zout's integers ''s'' and ''t'' are given by ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''N+1'' is the step on which the algorithm terminates with ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N+1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

The validity of this approach can be shown by induction. Assume that the recursion formula is correct up to step ''k''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1 of the algorithm; in other words, assume that

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''}}

for all ''j'' less than ''k''. The ''k''th step of the algorithm gives the equation

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

Since the recursion formula has been assumed to be correct for ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;, they may be expressed in terms of the corresponding ''s'' and ''t'' variables

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = (''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'') â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'').}}

Rearranging this equation yields the recursion formula for step ''k'', as required

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''b'' = (''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''a'' + (''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;) ''b''.}}

=== Matrix method ===

The integers ''s'' and ''t'' can also be found using an equivalent [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] method.&lt;ref name="Koshy_2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Koshy | first = T. | year = 2002 | title = Elementary Number Theory with Applications | publisher = Harcourt/Academic Press | location = Burlington, MA | isbn = 0-12-421171-2 | pages = 167â169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of equations of Euclid's algorithm

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a &amp; = q_0 b + r_0 \\
b &amp; = q_1 r_0 + r_1 \\
&amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
r_{N-2} &amp; = q_N r_{N-1} + 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

can be written as a product of 2-by-2 quotient matrices multiplying a two-dimensional remainder vector

&lt;!--  :&lt;math alt="A series of equations consisting of two-dimensional vectors multiplied by an ever-increasing number of 2-by-2 matrices. The vector a b equals the matrix q sub zero 1 1 0 times the vector b r sub zero. It also equals the matrix q sub zero 1 1 0 times the matrix q sub one 1 1 0 times the vector r sub zero r sub one. Continuing to the last step N of the algorithm, it equals the product of all 2-by-2 matrices of the form q sub i 1 1 0 times the vector r sub N minus one r sub N. The index i ranges from 0 to N and the last remainder r sub N is zero."&gt; --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} q_0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} b \\ r_0 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} q_0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} q_1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r_0 \\ r_1 \end{pmatrix} =
\cdots =
\prod_{i=0}^N \begin{pmatrix} q_i &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} r_{N-1} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

Let '''M''' represent the product of all the quotient matrices

&lt;!--:&lt;math alt="The 2-by-2 matrix M has four components, m sub 1 1, m sub 1 2, m sub 2 1, and m sub 2 2. It is defined as the product of all 2-by-2 matrices of the form q sub i 1 1 0, where the index i ranges from 0 to N."&gt;  --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} m_{11} &amp; m_{12} \\ m_{21} &amp; m_{22} \end{pmatrix} =
\prod_{i=0}^N \begin{pmatrix} q_i &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} q_0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} q_1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \cdots \begin{pmatrix} q_{N} &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies the Euclidean algorithm to the form

&lt;!-- alt="The two-dimensional vector a b equals the matrix M times the final vector, r sub N minus one zero. The final non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor g. Therefore, the vector a b equals the matrix M times the vector g zero."&gt; --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} =
\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} r_{N-1} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
\mathbf{M} \begin{pmatrix} g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

To express ''g'' as a linear sum of ''a'' and ''b'', both sides of this equation can be multiplied by the [[invertible matrix|inverse]] of the matrix '''M'''.&lt;ref name="Koshy_2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bach_1996"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bach | first1 = E. | author1-link = Eric Bach | last2= Shallit | first2 = J. | author2-link = Jeffrey Shallit | year = 1996 | title = Algorithmic number theory | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-262-02405-5 | pages = 70â73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[determinant]] of '''M''' equals (â1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, since it equals the product of the determinants of the quotient matrices, each of which is negative one. Since the determinant of '''M''' is never zero, the vector of the final remainders can be solved using the inverse of '''M'''

&lt;!--  :&lt;math alt="The two-dimensional vector g 0 equals the inverse of matrix M times the vector a b. This equals minus one to the Nth plus one power, times the matrix with components m sub 2 2, minus m sub 1 2, minus m sub 2 1, and m sub 1 1, times the vector a b."&gt;--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
\mathbf{M}^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} =
(-1)^{N+1} \begin{pmatrix} m_{22} &amp; -m_{12} \\ -m_{21} &amp; m_{11} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the top equation gives

: {{math|1=''g'' = (â1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ''m''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; ''a'' â ''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''),}}

the two integers of BÃ©zout's identity are ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(â1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(â1)&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. The matrix method is as efficient as the equivalent recursion, with two multiplications and two additions per step of the Euclidean algorithm.

===Euclid's lemma and unique factorization===
BÃ©zout's identity is essential to many applications of Euclid's algorithm, such as demonstrating the [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization]] of numbers into prime factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|pp=26â36}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this, suppose that a number ''L'' can be written as a product of two factors ''u'' and ''v'', that is, ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''uv''. If another number ''w'' also divides ''L'' but is coprime with ''u'', then ''w'' must divide ''v'', by the following argument: If the greatest common divisor of ''u'' and ''w'' is 1, then integers ''s'' and ''t'' can be found such that

: {{math|1=1 = ''su'' + ''tw''&amp;nbsp;.}}

by BÃ©zout's identity. Multiplying both sides by ''v'' gives the relation

: {{math|1=''v'' = ''suv'' + ''twv'' = ''sL'' + ''twv''&amp;nbsp;.}}

Since ''w'' divides both terms on the right-hand side, it must also divide the left-hand side, ''v''. This result is known as [[Euclid's lemma]].&lt;ref name="Ore, p. 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, if a prime number divides ''L'', then it must divide at least one factor of ''L''. Conversely, if a number ''w'' is coprime to each of a series of numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, â¦, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''w'' is also coprime to their product, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;â¦&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ore, p. 44"/&gt;

Euclid's lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|pp=281â292}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see this, assume the contrary, that there are two independent factorizations of ''L'' into ''m'' and ''n'' prime factors, respectively

: {{math|1=''L'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;â¦''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;â¦''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;.}}

Since each prime ''p'' divides ''L'' by assumption, it must also divide one of the ''q'' factors; since each ''q'' is prime as well, it must be that ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''. Iteratively dividing by the ''p'' factors shows that each ''p'' has an equal counterpart ''q''; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.

===Linear Diophantine equations===
[[File:Diophante Bezout.svg|thumb|alt="A diagonal line running from the upper left corner to the lower right. Fifteen circles are spaced at regular intervals along the line. Perpendicular x-y coordinate axes have their origin in the lower left corner; the line crossed the y-axis at the upper left and crosse the x-axis at the lower right."|Plot of a linear [[Diophantine equation]], 9''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;483. The solutions are shown as blue circles.]]

[[Diophantine equation]]s are equations in which the solutions are restricted to integers; they are named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician [[Diophantus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=119â125}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical ''linear'' Diophantine equation seeks integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=106â107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''ax'' + ''by'' = ''c''}}

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are given integers. This can be written as an equation for ''x'' in [[modular arithmetic]]:

: {{math|1=''ax'' &amp;equiv; ''c'' mod ''b''.}}

Let ''g'' be the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. Both terms in ''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''by'' are divisible by ''g''; therefore, ''c'' must also be divisible by ''g'', or the equation has no solutions. By dividing both sides by ''c''/''g'', the equation can be reduced to Bezout's identity

: {{math|1=''sa'' + ''tb'' = ''g''}}

where ''s'' and ''t'' can be found by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=108â109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides one solution to the Diophantine equation, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s'' (''c''/''g'') and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'' (''c''/''g'').

In general, a linear Diophantine equation has no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=120â121}}&lt;/ref&gt; To find the latter, consider two solutions, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), where

: {{math|1=''ax''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''by''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'' = ''ax''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''by''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

or equivalently

: {{math|1=''a''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; â ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''b''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).}}

Therefore, the smallest difference between two ''x'' solutions is ''b''/''g'', whereas the smallest difference between two ''y'' solutions is ''a''/''g''. Thus, the solutions may be expressed as

: {{math|1=''x'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; â ''bu''/''g''}}
: {{math|1=''y'' = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''au''/''g''}}.

By allowing ''u'' to vary over all possible integers, an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). If the solutions are required to be ''positive'' integers (''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), only a finite number of solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is impossible for a [[system of linear equations]] when the solutions can be any [[real number]] (see [[Underdetermined system]]).

===Multiplicative inverses and the RSA algorithm===
A [[finite field]] is a set of numbers with four generalized operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as [[commutativity]], [[associativity]] and [[distributivity]]. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;â¦,&amp;nbsp;12} using [[modular arithmetic]]. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced [[modulo operation|modulo]] 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0â12. For example, the result of 5&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;35&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime ''p''; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power ''m'' of a prime ''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. Finite fields are often called [[Ãvariste Galois|Galois]] fields, and are abbreviated as GF(''p'') or GF(''p''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;).

In such a field with ''m'' numbers, every nonzero element ''a'' has a unique [[modular multiplicative inverse]], ''a''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; such that {{nowrap|1=''aa''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&amp;nbsp;â¡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''m''.}} This inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation ''ax''&amp;nbsp;â¡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;''m'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=107â109}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the equivalent linear Diophantine equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|1997|pp=186â187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: {{math|1=''ax'' + ''my'' = 1.}}

This equation can be solved by the Euclidean algorithm, as described [[#Linear Diophantine equations|above]]. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the [[RSA algorithm]], which is widely used in [[electronic commerce]]; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that although the RSA algorithm uses [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in [[error-correcting code]]s; for example, it can be used as an alternative to the [[BerlekampâMassey algorithm]] for decoding [[BCH code|BCH]] and [[ReedâSolomon code]]s, which are based on Galois fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Error Correction Coding: Mathematical Methods and Algorithms|page=266|first=T. K.|last=Moon|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-64800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese remainder theorem===
Euclid's algorithm can also be used to solve multiple linear Diophantine equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=143â170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such equations arise in the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], which describes a novel method to represent an integer ''x''. Instead of representing an integer by its digits, it may be represented by its remainders ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; modulo a set of ''N'' coprime numbers ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=194â195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x_1 &amp; \equiv x \pmod {m_1} \\
x_2 &amp; \equiv x \pmod {m_2} \\
&amp; \,\,\,\vdots \\
x_N &amp; \equiv x \pmod {m_N} \,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The goal is to determine ''x'' from its ''N'' remainders ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus ''M'' that is the product of all the individual moduli ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; M_i = \frac M {m_i}. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, each ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of all the moduli ''except'' ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The solution depends on finding ''N'' new numbers ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; M_i h_i \equiv 1 \pmod {m_i} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

With these numbers ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, any integer ''x'' can be reconstructed from its remainders ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by the equation

: &lt;math&gt; x \equiv (x_1 M_1 h_1 + x_2 M_2 h_2 + \cdots + x_N M_N h_N) \pmod M \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since these numbers ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the multiplicative inverses of the ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, they may be found using Euclid's algorithm as described in the previous subsection.

===SternâBrocot tree===
{{main|SternâBrocot tree}}
The Euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive [[rational number]]s into an infinite [[binary search tree]], called the [[SternâBrocot tree]].
The number 1 (expressed as a fraction 1/1) is placed at the root of the tree, and the location of any other number ''a''/''b'' can be found by computing gcd(''a'',''b'') using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether ''a''/''b'' is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number ''a''/''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concrete mathematics|page=123|author1-link=Ronald Graham|last1=Graham|first1=R.|author2-link=Donald Knuth|last2=Knuth|first2=D. E.|author3-link=Oren Patashnik|last3=Patashnik|first3=O.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.

For example, 3/4 can be found by starting at the root, going to the left once, then to the right twice:

[[Image:SternBrocotTree.svg|thumb|400px|The SternâBrocot tree, and the SternâBrocot sequences of order ''i'' for ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, 4]]

:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
 &amp; \gcd(3,4) &amp; \leftarrow \\
= {} &amp; \gcd(3,1) &amp; \rightarrow \\
= {} &amp; \gcd(2,1) &amp; \rightarrow \\
= {} &amp; \gcd(1,1).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Euclidean algorithm has almost the same relationship to another binary tree on the rational numbers called the [[CalkinâWilf tree]].  The difference is that the path is reversed:  instead of producing a path from the root of the tree to a target,  it produces a path from the target to the root.

===Continued fractions===
The Euclidean algorithm has a close relationship with [[continued fraction]]s.&lt;ref name="Vinogradov_1954"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov | last=Vinogradov | first= I. M. | year = 1954 | title = Elements of Number Theory | publisher = Dover | location = New York | pages = 3â13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of equations can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac a b &amp;= q_0 + \frac{r_0} b \\
\frac b {r_0} &amp;= q_1 + \frac{r_1}{r_0} \\
\frac{r_0}{r_1} &amp;= q_2 + \frac{r_2}{r_1} \\
&amp; \,\,\, \vdots \\
\frac{r_{k-2}}{r_{k-1}} &amp;= q_k + \frac{r_k}{r_{k-1}} \\
&amp; \,\,\,  \vdots \\
\frac{r_{N-2}}{r_{N-1}} &amp;= q_N\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The last term on the right-hand side always equals the inverse of the left-hand side of the next equation. Thus, the first two equations may be combined to form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = q_0 + \cfrac 1 {q_1 + \cfrac{r_1}{r_0}} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The third equation may be used to substitute the denominator term ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, yielding

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = q_0 + \cfrac 1 {q_1 + \cfrac 1 {q_2 + \cfrac{r_2}{r_1}}}\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The final ratio of remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; can always be replaced using the next equation in the series, up to the final equation. The result is a continued fraction

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = q_0 + \cfrac 1 {q_1 + \cfrac 1 {q_2 + \cfrac{1}{\ddots + \cfrac 1 {q_N}}}} = [ q_0; q_1, q_2, \ldots , q_N ] \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the worked example [[#Worked example|above]], the gcd(1071, 462) was calculated, and the quotients ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; were 2, 3 and 7, respectively. Therefore, the fraction 1071/462 may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1071}{462} = 2 + \cfrac 1 {3 + \cfrac 1 7} = [2; 3, 7]&lt;/math&gt;

as can be confirmed by calculation.

===Factorization algorithms===
Calculating a greatest common divisor is an essential step in several [[integer factorization]] algorithms,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crandall|Pomerance|2001}}, pp.  225â349&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Pollard's rho algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 369â371&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shor's algorithm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Peter Shor|last=Shor |first=P.

[[Continued fraction factorization]] uses continued fractions, which are determined using Euclid's algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 380â384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithmic efficiency==
[[Image:Euclidean Algorithm Running Time.svg|thumb|alt="A set of colored lines radiating outwards from the origin of an ''x''-''y'' coordinate system. Each line corresponds to a set of number pairs requiring the same number of steps in the Euclidean algorithm."|Number of steps in the Euclidean algorithm for gcd(''x'',''y''). Lighter (red and yellow) points indicate relatively few steps, whereas darker (violet and blue) points indicate more steps. The largest dark area follows the line ''y'' = ''Î¦x'', where ''Î¦'' is the [[golden ratio]].]]

The computational efficiency of Euclid's algorithm has been studied thoroughly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 339â364&lt;/ref&gt; This efficiency can be described by the number of division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reynaud |first=A.-A.-L. | year = 1811 | title = TraitÃ© d'arithmÃ©tique Ã  l'usage des Ã©lÃ¨ves qui se destinent Ã  l'Ãcole Polytechnique | edition = 6th | publisher = Courcier | location = Paris | at = Note 60, p.&amp;nbsp;34 }} As cited by {{harvtxt|Shallit|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the number of division steps on input (''u'', ''v'') is bounded by ''v''; later he improved this to ''v''/2 &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2. Later, in 1841, [[Pierre Joseph Ãtienne Finck|P. J. E. Finck]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Finck | first = P.-J.-E. | title = TraitÃ© Ã©lÃ©mentaire d'arithmÃ©tique Ã  l'usage des candidats aux Ã©coles spÃ©ciales | publisher = Derivaux | year = 1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the number of division steps is at most 2&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''v''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input.&lt;ref name="Shallit"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Jeffrey Shallit|last=Shallit|first=J. | year = 1994 | title = Origins of the analysis of the Euclidean algorithm | journal = Historia Math. | volume = 21 | pages = 401â419 | doi=10.1006/hmat.1994.1031|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ãmile LÃ©ger]], in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive [[Fibonacci numbers]].&lt;ref name="Shallit" /&gt; Finck's analysis was refined by [[Gabriel LamÃ©]] in 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Gabriel LamÃ©|last=LamÃ©|first=G. | year = 1844 | title = Note sur la limite du nombre des divisions dans la recherche du plus grand commun diviseur entre deux nombres entiers | journal = Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. | volume = 19 | pages = 867â870}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number ''h'' of base-10 digits of the smaller number&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grossman | first = H. | year = 1924 | title = On the Number of Divisions in Finding a G.C.D | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 31 | page = 443 | doi = 10.2307/2298146 | jstor = 2298146 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Honsberger | first = R. | authorlink = Ross Honsberger | year = 1976 | title = Mathematical Gems II | publisher = The [[Mathematical Association of America]] | isbn = 0-88385-302-7 | pages = 54â57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[uniform cost model]] (suitable for analyzing the complexity of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), each step of the algorithm takes [[constant time]], and LamÃ©'s analysis implies that the total running time is also ''O''(''h''). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as ''O''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Knuth-257-261"/&gt; In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a [[telescoping series]], showing that it is also ''O''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the [[SchÃ¶nhageâStrassen algorithm]] for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to [[quasilinear time|quasilinear algorithms]] for the GCD.&lt;ref name="Crandall_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moller08"/&gt;

===Number of steps===
The number of steps to calculate the GCD of two natural numbers, ''a'' and ''b'', may be denoted by ''T''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'').&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 344"&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; If ''g'' is the GCD of ''a'' and ''b'', then ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mg'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ng'' for two coprime numbers ''m'' and ''n''. Then

: {{math|1=''T''(''a'', ''b'') = ''T''(''m'', ''n'')}}

as may be seen by dividing all the steps in the Euclidean algorithm by ''g''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same argument, the number of steps remains the same if ''a'' and ''b'' are multiplied by a common factor ''w'': ''T''(''a'', ''b'') = ''T''(''wa'', ''wb''). Therefore, the number of steps ''T'' may vary dramatically between neighboring pairs of numbers, such as T(''a'', ''b'') and T(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), depending on the size of the two GCDs.

The recursive nature of the Euclidean algorithm gives another equation

: {{math|1=''T''(''a'', ''b'') = 1 + ''T''(''b'', ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = 2 + ''T''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = â¦ = ''N'' + ''T''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''N'' + 1}}

where ''T''(''x'', 0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 by assumption.&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 344"/&gt;

====Worst-case====

If the Euclidean algorithm requires ''N'' steps for a pair of natural numbers ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, the smallest values of ''a'' and ''b'' for which this is true are the [[Fibonacci number]]s ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 343"&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, if the Euclidean algorithm requires ''N'' steps for the pair ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b'', then one has ''a''&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be shown by [[mathematical induction|induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mollin|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''b'' divides ''a'' with no remainder; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, which are ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Now assume that the result holds for all values of ''N'' up to ''M''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1. The first step of the ''M''-step algorithm is ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Euclidean algorithm requires ''M''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1 steps for the pair ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. By induction hypothesis, one has ''b''&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''M''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''M''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''M''+2&lt;/sub&gt;,
which is the desired inequality.
This proof, published by [[Gabriel LamÃ©]] in 1844, represents the beginning of [[computational complexity theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers.&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 343"/&gt;

This result suffices to show that the number of steps in Euclid's algorithm can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mollin|2008|pp=21â22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For if the algorithm requires ''N'' steps, then ''b'' is greater than or equal to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt; which in turn is greater than or equal to ''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''Ï'' is the [[golden ratio]]. Since ''b''&amp;nbsp;â¥&amp;nbsp;''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;''Ï''&lt;/sub&gt;''b''. Since log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''Ï''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1/5, (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)/5&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''Ï''&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;''Ï''&lt;/sub&gt;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''b''. Thus, ''N''&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''b''. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than [[Big O notation|''O''(''h'')]] divisions, where ''h'' is the number of digits in the smaller number ''b''.

====Average====
The average number of steps taken by the Euclidean algorithm has been defined in three different ways. The first definition is the average time ''T''(''a'') required to calculate the GCD of a given number ''a'' and a smaller natural number ''b'' chosen with equal probability from the integers 0 to ''a''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1&lt;ref name="Knuth, p. 344"/&gt;

&lt;!-- 
:&lt;math  alt="The function T of a equals one over a times the sum of the function T of a comma b over all nonnegative values of b less than a." &gt;
--&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;T(a) = \frac 1 a \sum_{0 \leq b&lt;a} T(a, b).
&lt;/math&gt;

However, since ''T''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') fluctuates dramatically with the GCD of the two numbers, the averaged function ''T''(''a'') is likewise "noisy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce this noise, a second average ''Ï''(''a'') is taken over all numbers coprime with ''a''
&lt;!--  
:&lt;math alt="The function tau of a equals one over the function phi of a times the sum of the function T of a comma b over all nonnegative values of b less than a, where b is coprime to a." &gt;
--&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\tau(a) = \frac 1 {\varphi(a)} \sum_{\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \leq b&lt;a \\  \gcd(a, b) = 1 \end{smallmatrix}} T(a, b).
&lt;/math&gt;

There are ''Ï''(''a'') coprime integers less than ''a'', where ''Ï'' is [[Euler's totient function]]. This tau average grows smoothly with ''a''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tonkov | first= T. | year = 1974 | title = On the average length of finite continued fractions | journal = Acta Arithmetica | volume = 26 | pages = 47â57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(a) = \frac{12}{\pi^2}\ln 2 \ln a + C + O(a^{-1/6-\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

with the residual error being of order ''a''&lt;sup&gt;â(1/6) + ''Îµ''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''Îµ'' is [[infinitesimal]]. The constant ''C'' (''Porter's Constant''&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|id=PortersConstant|title=Porter's Constant}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in this formula equals
:&lt;math&gt;C= -\frac 1 2 + \frac{6 \ln 2}{\pi^2}\left(4\gamma -\frac{24}{\pi^2}\zeta'(2) + 3\ln 2 - 2\right) \approx 1.467&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Î³'' is the [[EulerâMascheroni constant]] and Î¶' is the [[derivative]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Porter | first = J. W. | year = 1975 | title = On a Theorem of Heilbronn | journal = Mathematika | volume = 22 | pages = 20â28 | doi = 10.1112/S0025579300004459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Knuth|first = D.

Since the first average can be calculated from the tau average by summing over the divisors ''d'' of&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- :&lt;math alt="The function T of a equals one over a times the sum of an argument summed over all divisors d of a. The argument equals the function phi of d multiplied by the function tau of d."&gt;
 --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T(a) = \frac 1 a \sum_{d \mid a} \varphi(d) \tau(d)
&lt;/math&gt;

it can be approximated by the formula&lt;ref name="Norton_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Norton | first = G. H. | year = 1990 | title = On the Asymptotic Analysis of the Euclidean Algorithm | journal = Journal of Symbolic Computation | volume = 10 | pages = 53â58 | doi = 10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T(a) \approx C + \frac{12}{\pi^2} \ln 2 \left(\ln a - \sum_{d \mid a} \frac{\Lambda(d)} d\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where Î(''d'') is the [[von Mangoldt function|Mangoldt function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

A third average ''Y''(''n'') is defined as the mean number of steps required when both ''a'' and ''b'' are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) from 1 to ''n''&lt;ref name="Norton_1990" /&gt;

&lt;!--  :&lt;math alt="The function Y of n equals one over n squared times the double sum of the function T of a comma b for all values of a and b ranging from 1 to n. This equals one over n times the sum of the function T of a over all values of a ranging from 1 to n."&gt;
--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(n) = \frac 1 {n^2} \sum_{a=1}^n \sum_{b=1}^n T(a, b) = \frac 1 n \sum_{a=1}^n T(a).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the approximate formula for ''T''(''a'') into this equation yields an estimate for ''Y''(''n'')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y(n) \approx \frac{12}{\pi^2} \ln 2 \ln n + 0.06.&lt;/math&gt;

===Computational expense per step===
In each step ''k'' of the Euclidean algorithm, the quotient ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are computed for a given pair of integers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

The computational expense per step is associated chiefly with finding ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, since the remainder ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated quickly from ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;

: {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; â ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;.}}

The computational expense of dividing ''h''-bit numbers scales as ''O''(''h''(''â''+1)), where ''â'' is the length of the quotient.&lt;ref name="Knuth-257-261"&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 257â261&lt;/ref&gt;

For comparison, Euclid's original subtraction-based algorithm can be much slower. A single integer division is equivalent to the quotient ''q'' number of subtractions. If the ratio of ''a'' and ''b'' is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, it has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient ''q'' is approximately ln|''u''/(''u''&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;1)| where ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wagon | first = S. | authorlink = Stan Wagon | year = 1999 | title = Mathematica in Action | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-98252-3 | pages = 335â336}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|1993|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exploited in the [[binary GCD algorithm|binary version]] of Euclid's algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohen|1993|pp=14â15, 17â18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining the estimated number of steps with the estimated computational expense per step shows that the Euclid's algorithm grows quadratically (''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with the average number of digits ''h'' in the initial two numbers ''a'' and ''b''. Let ''h''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, â¦, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt; represent the number of digits in the successive remainders ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;â¦,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''N''â1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the number of steps ''N'' grows linearly with ''h'', the running time is bounded by

&lt;!-- :&lt;math alt="The order of the sum over all i less than N of h sub i times parenthesis h sub i minus h sub i plus one plus 2 close parenthesis is a subset of the order of h times the sum over all i less than N of h sub i minus h sub i plus one plus 2, which in turn is a subset of the order of h times h sub zero plus 2 N, which in turn is a subset of the order of h squared."&gt; --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
O\Big(\sum_{i&lt;N}h_i(h_i-h_{i+1}+2)\Big)\subseteq O\Big(h\sum_{i&lt;N}(h_i-h_{i+1}+2) \Big) \subseteq O(h(h_0+2N))\subseteq O(h^2).&lt;/math&gt;

===Alternative methods===
Euclid's algorithm is widely used in practice, especially for small numbers, due to its simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the efficiency of alternatives to Euclid's algorithm may be determined.

One inefficient approach to finding the GCD of two natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number ''b''. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with ''b'', or exponentially in the number of digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted [[#Greatest common divisor|above]], the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers ''a'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_21" /&gt; Present methods for [[integer factorization|prime factorization]] are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_216" /&gt;

The [[binary GCD algorithm]] is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the [[binary numeral system|binary]] representation used by computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, pp. 321â323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stein | first = J. | year = 1967 | title = Computational problems associated with Racah algebra | journal = Journal of Computational Physics | volume = 1 | pages = 397â405 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9991(67)90047-2 | issue = 3| bibcode = 1967JCoPh...1..397S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this alternative also scales like [[big-O notation|''O''(''h''Â²)]].

==Generalizations==
Although the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as [[polynomial]]s,&lt;ref name="Lang_1984"/&gt; [[quadratic integer]]s&lt;ref name="weinberger"/&gt; and [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s.&lt;ref name="stillwell151-152"/&gt; In the latter cases, the Euclidean algorithm is used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into [[irreducible element]]s, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.

===Rational and real numbers===
Euclid's algorithm can be applied to [[real number]]s, as described by Euclid in Book 10 of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. The goal of the algorithm is to identify a real number {{mvar|g}} such that two given real numbers, {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, are integer multiples of it: {{math|1=''a'' = ''mg''}} and {{math|1=''b'' = ''ng''}}, where {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are [[integer]]s.&lt;ref name="Weil_1983" /&gt; This identification is equivalent to finding an [[integer relation algorithm|integer relation]] among the real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}; that is, it determines integers {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|t}} such that {{math|1=''sa'' + ''tb'' = 0}}. Euclid uses this algorithm to treat the question of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable lengths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Boyer |first1=C. B.|last2= Merzbach|first2=U. C. |author2-link=Uta Merzbach| year = 1991 | title = A History of Mathematics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | isbn = 0-471-54397-7 | pages = 116â117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Florian Cajori|last=Cajori|first= F, | year = 1894 | title = A History of Mathematics | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | page = 70 | isbn = 0-486-43874-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real-number Euclidean algorithm differs from its integer counterpart in two respects. First, the remainders {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are real numbers, although the quotients {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are integers as before. Second, the algorithm is not guaranteed to end in a finite number {{mvar|N}} of steps. If it does, the fraction {{math|''a''/''b''}} is a rational number, i.e., the ratio of two integers

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{mg}{ng} = \frac{m}{n},&lt;/math&gt;

and can be written as a finite continued fraction {{math|1=[''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}. If the algorithm does not stop, the fraction {{math|''a''/''b''}} is an [[irrational number]] and can be described by an infinite continued fraction {{math|1=[''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, â¦]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algorithmic Cryptanalysis|first=Antoine|last=Joux|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=9781420070033|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buQajqt-_iUC&amp;pg=PA33|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of infinite continued fractions are the [[golden ratio]] {{math|1=''Ï'' = [1; 1, 1, ...]}} and the [[square root of 2|square root of two]], {{math|1={{sqrt|2}} = [1; 2, 2, ...]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics|first1=D.

An infinite continued fraction may be truncated at a step {{math|1=''k'' [''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} to yield an approximation to {{math|''a''/''b''}} that improves as {{mvar|k}} is increased. The approximation is described by [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergents]] {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}; the numerator and denominators are coprime and obey the [[recurrence relation]]

===Polynomials===
{{main|Polynomial greatest common divisor}}
Polynomials in a single variable ''x'' can be added, multiplied and factored into [[irreducible polynomial]]s, which are the analogs of the prime numbers for integers. The greatest common divisor polynomial {{math|''g''(''x'')}} of two polynomials {{math|''a''(''x'')}} and {{math|''b''(''x'')}} is defined as the product of their shared irreducible polynomials, which can be identified using the Euclidean algorithm.&lt;ref name="Lang_1984" &gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Serge Lang|last=Lang|first= S. | year = 1984 | title = Algebra | edition = 2nd | publisher = AddisonâWesley | location = Menlo Park, CA | isbn = 0-201-05487-6 | pages = 190â194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic procedure is similar to that for integers. At each step {{mvar|k}}, a quotient polynomial {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} and a remainder polynomial {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} are identified to satisfy the recursive equation

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k-2}(x) = q_k(x)r_{k-1}(x) + r_k(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;â2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''a''(''x'')}} and {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;â1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''b''(''x'')}}. The quotient polynomial is chosen so that the leading term of {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} equals the leading term of {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}; this ensures that the degree of each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor: {{math|deg[''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')] &amp;lt; deg[''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')]}}. Since the degree is a nonnegative integer, and since it decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials, {{math|''a''(''x'')}} and {{math|''b''(''x'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cox|Little|O'Shea|1997|pp=37â46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the following two quartic polynomials, which each factor into two quadratic polynomials

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   a(x) &amp;= x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 14 = (x^2 - 5x + 7)(x^2 + x + 2) \qquad \text{and}\\
   b(x) &amp;= x^4 + 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 17x + 6 = (x^2 + 7x + 3)(x^2 + x + 2).
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[polynomial long division|Dividing]] {{math|''a''(''x'')}} by {{math|''b''(''x'')}} yields a remainder {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + (2/3)''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (5/3)''x'' â (2/3)}}. In the next step, {{math|''b''(''x'')}} is divided by {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} yielding a remainder {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 2}}. Finally, dividing {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} by {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} yields a zero remainder, indicating that {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the greatest common divisor polynomial of {{math|''a''(''x'')}} and {{math|''b''(''x'')}}, consistent with their factorization.

Many of the applications described above for integers carry over to polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=254â259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined.

The polynomial Euclidean algorithm has other applications, such as [[Sturm chain]]s, a method for counting the [[zero of a function|zeros of a polynomial]] that lie inside a given [[Interval (mathematics)|real interval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800-1840: From the Calculus and Mechanics to Mathematical Analysis and Mathematical Physics.

Finally, the coefficients of the polynomials need not be drawn from integers, real numbers or even the complex numbers. For example, the coefficients may be drawn from a general field, such as the finite fields {{math|GF(''p'')}} described above. The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials.&lt;ref name="Lang_1984" /&gt;

===Gaussian integers===
[[File:Gaussian primes.png|thumb|alt="A set of dots lying within a circle. The pattern of dots has fourfold symmetry, i.e., rotations by 90 degrees leave the pattern unchanged. The pattern can also be mirrored about four lines passing through the center of the circle: the vertical and horizontal axes, and the two diagonal lines at Â±45 degrees."|Distribution of Gaussian primes {{math|''u'' + ''vi''}} in the complex plane, with norms {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} less than 500]]

The Gaussian integers are [[complex number]]s of the form {{math|1=''Î±'' = ''u'' + ''vi''}}, where {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are ordinary [[integer]]s&lt;ref group=note&gt;The phrase "ordinary integer" is commonly used for distinguishing usual integers from Gaussian integers, and more generally from [[algebraic integer]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit|square root of negative one]].&lt;ref name="Stillwell_2003" /&gt; By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely factorizable, by the argument [[#BÃ©zout's identity|above]].&lt;ref name="Gauss_1832"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss|last=Gauss|first=C.

The Euclidean algorithm developed for two Gaussian integers {{mvar|Î±}} and {{mvar|Î²}} is nearly the same as that for ordinary integers,&lt;ref name="hensley"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continued Fractions|first=Doug|last=Hensley|publisher=World Scientific|year=2006|isbn=9789812564771|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3PVXFkweKgC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but differs in two respects. As before, the task at each step {{mvar|k}} is to identify a quotient {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and a remainder {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;r_k = r_{k-2} - q_k r_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Î±''}}, where {{math|1=''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Î²''}}, and where every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor: {{math|{{mabs|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} &amp;lt; {{mabs|''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers, and thus are [[complex number]]s. The quotients {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio (such as the complex number {{math|''Î±''/''Î²''}}) to the nearest integers.&lt;ref name="hensley"/&gt; The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be "smaller" than another. To do this, a [[norm (mathematics)|norm function]] {{math|1=''f''(''u'' + ''vi'') = ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is defined, which converts every Gaussian integer {{math|''u'' + ''vi''}} into a ordinary integer. After each step {{mvar|k}} of the Euclidean algorithm, the norm of the remainder {{math|''f''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder, {{math|''f''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''â1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Algebraic Integers|series=Cambridge Mathematical Library|first=Richard|last=Dedekind|authorlink=Richard Dedekind|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=9780521565189|pages=22â24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZRBabJY4ewC&amp;pg=PA222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final nonzero remainder is {{math|gcd(''Î±'', ''Î²'')}}, the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both {{mvar|Î±}} and {{mvar|Î²}}; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit, {{math|Â±1}} or {{math|Â±''i''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Numbers and Symmetry: An Introduction to Algebra|first1=Bernard L.|last1=Johnston|first2=Fred|last2=Richman|publisher=CRC Press|year=1997|isbn=9780849303012|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=koUfrlgsmUcC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers. For example, it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Number Theory|first1=William W.|last1=Adams|first2=Larry Joel|last2=Goldstein|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1976|isbn=9780134912820|at=Exercise 24, p.&amp;nbsp;205|quote=State and prove an analogue of the Chinese remainder theorem for the Gaussian integers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined.&lt;ref name="hensley"/&gt;

===Euclidean domains===
A set of elements under two [[binary operation]]s, denoted as addition and multiplication, is called a [[Euclidean domain]] if it forms a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}} and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cohn|1962|pp=104â105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]] or [[monoid]]. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as [[commutative property|commutativity]], [[associative property|associativity]] and [[distributive property|distributivity]].

The generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a ''Euclidean function'', i.e., a mapping {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|R}} into the set of nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|R}}, there exist {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|r}} in {{mvar|R}} such that {{math|1=''a'' = ''qb'' + ''r''}} and {{math|''f''(''r'') &amp;lt; ''f''(''b'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concrete Abstract Algebra: From Numbers to GrÃ¶bner Bases|first=Niels|last=Lauritzen|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521534109|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdAbcje-TZUC&amp;pg=PA130|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers [[#Gaussian integers|above]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;/ref&gt; The function {{mvar|f}} can be the magnitude of the number or the [[degree of a polynomial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&amp;nbsp;161&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces ''f'' inexorably; hence, if {{mvar|f}} can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies on the natural [[well-order]]ing of the non-negative integers;&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rings and Factorization|first=David|last=Sharpe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780521337182|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nmg4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA55|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.

The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] applies to any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into [[irreducible element]]s. Any Euclidean domain is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), although the converse is not true.&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt; The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the [[GCD domain]]s, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987}}, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a [[principal ideal domain]] (PID), an [[integral domain]] in which every [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is a [[principal ideal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&amp;nbsp;131&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.

The unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all [[Pythagorean triple]]s and in proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]].&lt;ref name="Stillwell_2003" /&gt; Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] published in 1847 by Gabriel LamÃ©, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on a suggestion of [[Joseph Liouville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = LamÃ© |first=G. |authorlink=Gabriel LamÃ©| year = 1847 | title = MÃ©moire sur la rÃ©solution, en nombres complexes, de l'Ã©quation A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + B&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 | journal = J. Math. Pures Appl. | volume = 12 | pages = 172â184}}&lt;/ref&gt; LamÃ©'s approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''Ïy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, and {{math|1=''Ï'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''iÏ''/''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an {{mvar|n}}th root of 1, that is, {{math|1=''Ï''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. Although this approach succeeds for some values of {{mvar|n}} (such as {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s), in general such numbers do {{em|not}} factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some [[cyclotomic field]]s led [[Ernst Kummer]] to the concept of [[ideal number]]s and, later, [[Richard Dedekind]] to [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician) | last=Edwards|first=H.|title=Fermat's last theorem: a genetic introduction to algebraic number theory|year=2000|publisher=Springer|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unique factorization of quadratic integers====

[[File:Eisenstein primes.svg|thumb|alt="A set of dots lying within a circle. The pattern of dots has sixfold symmetry, i.e., rotations by 60 degrees leave the pattern unchanged. The pattern can also be mirrored about six lines passing through the center of the circle: the vertical and horizontal axes, and the four diagonal lines at Â±30 and Â±60 degrees."|Distribution of Eisenstein primes {{math|''u'' + ''vÏ''}} in the complex plane, with norms less than 500. The number {{mvar|Ï}} is a [[root of unity|cube root of 1]].]]

The [[quadratic integer]] rings are helpful to illustrate Euclidean domains. Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'' is replaced by a number {{mvar|Ï}}. Thus, they have the form {{math|''u'' + ''vÏ''}}, where {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are integers and {{mvar|Ï}} has one of two forms, depending on a parameter {{mvar|D}}. If {{mvar|D}} does not equal a multiple of four plus one, then

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt D .&lt;/math&gt;

If, however, ''D'' does equal a multiple of four plus one, then

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1 + \sqrt{D}}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;

If the function {{mvar|f}} corresponds to a [[field norm|norm]] function, such as that used to order the Gaussian integers [[#Gaussian integers|above]], then the domain is known as ''[[Norm-Euclidean field|norm-Euclidean]]''. The norm-Euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where {{mvar|D}} is one of the values â11, â7, â3, â2, â1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, or 73.&lt;ref name="Cohn_1962" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = LeVeque | first = W.

===Noncommutative rings===
The Euclidean algorithm may be applied to noncommutative rings such as the set of [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s.&lt;ref name="stillwell151-152"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stillwell|2003|pp=151â152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{mvar|Î±}} and {{mvar|Î²}} represent two elements from such a ring. They have a common right divisor {{mvar|Î´}} if {{math|1=''Î±'' = ''Î¾Î´''}} and {{math|1=''Î²'' = ''Î·Î´''}} for some choice of {{mvar|Î¾}} and {{mvar|Î·}} in the ring. Similarly, they have a common left divisor if {{math|1=''Î±'' = ''Î´Î¾''}} and {{math|1=''Î²'' = ''Î´Î·''}} for some choice of {{mvar|Î¾}} and {{mvar|Î·}} in the ring. Since multiplication is not commutative, there are two versions of the Euclidean algorithm, one for right divisors and one for left divisors.&lt;ref name="stillwell151-152"/&gt; Choosing the right divisors, the first step in finding the {{math|gcd(''Î±'', ''Î²'')}} by the Euclidean algorithm can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 = \alpha - \psi_0\beta = (\xi - \psi_0\eta)\delta,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the quotient and {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} the remainder. This equation shows that any common right divisor of {{mvar|Î±}} and {{mvar|Î²}} is likewise a common divisor of the remainder {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The analogous equation for the left divisors would be

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 = \alpha - \beta\psi_0 = \delta(\xi - \eta\psi_0).&lt;/math&gt;

With either choice, the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified. As in the Euclidean domain, the "size" of the remainder {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be strictly smaller than {{mvar|Î²}}, and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for {{math|''Ï''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.&lt;ref name="entgtrg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory and Ramanujan Graphs|volume=55|series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts|first1=Giuliana|last1=Davidoff|first2=Peter|last2=Sarnak|first3=Alain|last3=Valette|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521531436|contribution=2.6 The Arithmetic of Integer Quaternions|pages=59â70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlvfFDJOGZ8C&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the results for the GCD carry over to noncommutative numbers. For example, [[BÃ©zout's identity]] states that the right {{math|gcd(''Î±'', ''Î²'')}} can be expressed as a linear combination of {{mvar|Î±}} and {{mvar|Î²}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Theory of Algebraic Numbers|series=Universitext|publisher=Springer-Verlag|first=Paulo|last=Ribenboim|year=2001|isbn=9780387950709|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5443xdaNZcC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, there are numbers {{mvar|Ï}} and {{mvar|Ï}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\text{right} = \sigma\alpha + \tau\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

The analogous identity for the left GCD is nearly the same:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_\text{left} = \alpha\sigma + \beta\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

BÃ©zout's identity can be used to solve Diophantine equations. For instance, one of the standard proofs of [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]], that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares, is based on quaternion GCDs in this way.&lt;ref name="entgtrg"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2117">In [[mathematics]], a '''FrÃ©chet surface''' is an [[equivalence class]] of [[parametrized surface]]s in a [[metric space]]. In other words, a FrÃ©chet surface is a way of thinking about surfaces independently of how they are "written down" (parametrized). The concept is named after the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Maurice FrÃ©chet]].

==Definitions==

Let ''M'' be a [[compact space|compact]] 2-[[dimension]]al [[manifold]], either [[closed set|closed]] or with [[boundary (topology)|boundary]], and let (''X'', ''d'') be a metric space. A '''parametrized surface''' in ''X'' is a map

:&lt;math&gt;f : M \to X&lt;/math&gt;

that is [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the [[topology]] on ''M'' and the metric topology on ''X''. Let

:&lt;math&gt;\rho (f, g) = \inf_{\sigma} \max_{x \in M} d \left( f(x), g(\sigma(x)) \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[infimum]] is taken over all [[homeomorphism]]s ''Ï'' of ''M'' to itself. Call two parametrized surfaces ''f'' and ''g'' in ''X'' '''equivalent''' [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt;\rho (f, g) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

An equivalence class [''f''] of parametrized surfaces under this notion of equivalence is called a '''FrÃ©chet surface'''; each of the parametrized surfaces in this equivalence class is called a '''parametrization''' of the FrÃ©chet surface [''f''].

==Properties==

Many properties of parametrized surfaces are actually properties of the FrÃ©chet surface, i.e. of the whole equivalence class, and not of any particular parametrization.

For example, given two FrÃ©chet surfaces, the value of ''Ï''(''f'', ''g'') is independent of the choice of the parametrizations ''f'' and ''g'', and is called the '''FrÃ©chet distance''' between the FrÃ©chet surfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41161">In [[mathematics]], a '''fundamental polygon''' can be defined for every [[compact Riemann surface]] of genus greater than 0. It encodes not only the topology of the surface through its [[fundamental group]] but also determines the Riemann surface up to conformal equivalence. By the [[uniformization theorem]], every compact Riemann surface has simply connected universal covering surface given by exactly one of the following:

*the [[Riemann sphere]], 
*the [[complex plane]],
*the unit disk ''D'' equivalently the upper half-plane ''H''.

In the first case of genus zero, the surface is conformally equivalent to the Riemann sphere.

In the second case of genus one, the surface is conformally equivalent to a torus '''C'''/Î for some lattice Î in '''C'''. The fundamental polygon of Î is either a period parallelogram or a centrally symmetric polygon, a result first proved by [[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] in 1891.

In the last case of genus ''g'' &gt; 1, the Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to ''H''/Î where Î is a [[Fuchsian group]] of [[MÃ¶bius transformation]]s. A fundamental domain for Î is given by a convex polygon for the hyperbolic metric on ''H''. These can be defined by Dirichlet polygons and have an even number of sides. The structure of the fundamental group Î can be read off from such a polygon. Using the theory of [[quasiconformal mapping]]s and the [[Beltrami equation]], it can be shown there is a canonical convex Dirichlet polygon with 4''g'' sides, first defined by [[Robert Fricke|Fricke]], which corresponds to the standard presentation of Î  as the group with 2''g'' generators ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; and the single relation [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;][''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] âââ [''a''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;] = 1, where [''a'',''b''] = ''a'' ''b'' ''a''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Any Riemannian metric on an oriented closed 2-manifold  ''M'' defines a complex structure on ''M'', making ''M'' a compact Riemann surface. Through the use of fundamental polygons, it follows that two oriented closed 2-manifolds are classified by their genus, that is half the rank of the Abelian group Î/[Î,Î], where Î = {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''M''). Moreover, it also follows from the theory of quasiconformal mappings that two compact Riemann surfaces are diffeomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic. Consequently, two closed oriented 2-manifolds are 
homeomorphic if and only if they are diffeomorphic. Such a result can also be proved using the methods of [[differential topology]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Parallelograms and centrally symmetric hexagons===
In the case of genus one, a fundamental convex polygon is sought for the action by translation of Î = '''Z''' '''a''' â '''Z''' '''b''' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''C''' where '''a''' and '''b''' are linearly independent over '''R'''. (After performing a real linear transformation on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it can be assumed if necessary that Î = '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''Z''' +  '''Z''' ''i''; for a genus one Riemann surface it can be taken to have the form  Î = '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''Z''' +  '''Z''' Ï, with Im Ï &gt; 0.) A [[fundamental domain]] is given by the parallelogram {{math|''s'' '''x''' + ''t'' '''y'''}} for {{math|1=0 &lt; ''s'' , ''t'' &lt; 1}} where {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} are generators of Î.

If ''C'' is the interior of a fundamental convex polygon, then the translates {{overline|''C''}} + '''x''' cover '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as '''x''' runs over Î. It follows that the boundary points of ''C'' are formed of intersections {{overline|''C''}} â© ({{overline|''C''}} + '''x'''). These are compact convex sets in â''C'' and thus either vertices of ''C'' or sides of ''C''. It follows that every closed side of ''C'' can be written this way. Translating by â'''x''' it follows that {{overline|''C''}} â© ({{overline|''C''}} â '''x''') is also a side of '''C'''. Thus sides of ''C'' occur in parallel pairs of equal length. The end points of two such parallel segments of equal length can be joined so that they intersect and the intersection occurs at the midpoints of the line segments joining the endpoints. It follows that the intersections of al such segments occur at the same point. Translating that point to the origin, it follows that the polygon is centrally symmetric; that is, if a point ''z'' is in the polygon, so too is â''z''.

It is easy to see translates of a centrally symmetric convex hexagon tessellate the plane. If ''A'' is a point of the hexagon, then the lattice is generated by the displacement vectors ''AB'' and ''AC'' where ''B'' and ''C'' are the two vertices which are not neighbours of ''A'' and not opposite ''A''. Indeed, the second picture shows how the hexagon is equivalent to the parallelogram obtained by displacing the two triangles chopped off by the segments ''AB'' and ''AC''. Equally well the first picture shows another way of matching a tiling by parallelograms with the hexagonal tiling. If the centre of the hexagon is 0 and the vertices in order are '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', â'''a''',  â'''b''' and â'''c''', then Î is the Abelian group with generators {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}} and {{math|'''b''' + '''c'''}}.

===Fedorov's theorem===
'''Fedorov's theorem''', established by the Russian crystallographer [[Evgraf Fedorov]] in 1891, asserts that parallelograms and centrally symmetric hexagons are the only convex polygons that are fundamental domains.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fedorov (1891) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951t00080576a;view=1up;seq=357 "Ð¡Ð¸Ð¼Ð¼ÐµÑÑÑÑ Ð½Ð° Ð¿Ð»Ð¾ÑÐºÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸"] (''Simmetriya na ploskosti'', Symmetry in the plane), ''ÐÐ°Ð¿Ð¸ÑÐºÐ¸ ÐÐ¼Ð¿ÐµÑÐ°ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¡.-ÐÐµÑÐµÑÐ±ÑÑÐ³ÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¼Ð¸Ð½ÐµÑÐ°Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¾Ð±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð°'' (''Zapiski Imperatorskova Sankt-Petersburgskova Mineralogicheskova Obshchestva'', Proceedings of the Imperial St. Petersburg Mineralogical Society), 2nd series, '''28''' : 345â390 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; There are several proofs of this, some of the more recent ones related to results in [[Convexity (mathematics)|convexity theory]], the [[geometry of numbers]] and [[circle packing]], such as the [[BrunnâMinkowski inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

Coxeter]] and [[Georgy Voronoi|Voronoi]] will be presented here.&lt;ref&gt;Voronoi's proof has the advantage of generalising to ''n'' dimensions: it shows that if translates of a centrally symmetric convex polyhedron tessallate '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the polyhedron has at most 2(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; â 1) faces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvtxt|Bambah|Davenport|1952}}
*{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1962}}
*{{harvtxt|Lyusternik|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coxeter's proof proceeds by assuming that there is a centrally symmetric convex polygon ''C'' with 2''m'' sides. Then a large closed parallelogram formed from ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; fundamental parallelograms is tiled by translations of ''C'' which go beyond the edges of the large parallelogram. This induces a tiling on the torus '''C'''/''N''Î. Let ''v'', ''e'' and ''f'' be the number of vertices, edges and faces in this tiling (taking into account identifications in the quotient space). Then, because the [[EulerâPoincarÃ© characteristic]] of a torus is zero,

:&lt;math&gt; v - e + f =0.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, since each vertex is on at least 3 different edges and every edge is between two vertices,

:&lt;math&gt;3v\le 2e.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, since every edge is on exactly two faces,

:&lt;math&gt; 2e = 2mf.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;mf= e \le 3(e-v)=3f.&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;m\le 3,&lt;/math&gt;

as required.

Voronoi's proof starts with the observation that every edge of ''C'' corresponds to an element '''x''' of Î. In fact the edge is the orthogonal bisector of the radius from 0 to '''x'''. Hence the foot of the perpendicular from 0 to each edge lies in the interior of each edge. If '''y''' is any lattice point, then 1/2 '''y''' cannot lie in ''C''; for if so, â1/2 '''y''' would also lie in ''C'', contradicting ''C'' being a fundamental domain for Î. Let Â±'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., Â±'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; be the 2''m'' distinct points of Î corresponding to sides of ''C''. Fix generators '''a''' and '''b''' of Î. Thus '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = Î±&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; '''a''' + Î²&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''', where Î±&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and  Î²&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are integers. It is not possible for both Î±&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and  Î²&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be even, since otherwise Â± 1/2 '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; would be a point of Î on a side, which contradicts ''C'' being a fundamental domain. So there are three possibilities for the pair of integers (Î±&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, Î²&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) modulo 2: (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Consequently, if ''m'' &gt; 3, there would be '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''i'' â  ''j'' with both coordinates of '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; â '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; even, i.e. 1/2 ('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in Î. But this is the midpoint of the line segment joining two interior points of edges and hence lies in ''C'', the interior of the polygon. This again contradicts the fact that ''C'' is a fundamental domain. So ''reductio ad absurdum'' ''m'' â¤ 3, as claimed.

===DirichletâVoronoi domains===
For a lattice Î in '''C''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a fundamental domain can be defined canonically using the conformal structure of '''C'''. Note that the group of conformal transformations of '''C''' is given by complex affine transformations {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') = ''az'' + ''b''}} with {{nowrap|''a'' â  0}}. These transformations preserve Euclidean metric {{nowrap|1=''d''(''z'', ''w'') = {{abs|''z'' â ''w''}}}} up to a factor, as well as preserving the orientation. It is the subgroup of the MÃ¶bius group fixing the point at â. The metric structure can be used to define a canonical fundamental domain by {{nowrap|1=''C'' = {''z'': ''d''(''z'', 0) &lt; ''d''(''z'', ''Î»'') for all ''Î»'' â  0 in Î}.}} (It is obvious from the definition that it is a fundamental domain.) This is an example of a [[Dirichlet domain]] or [[Voronoi diagram]]: since complex translations form an Abelian group, so commute with the action of Î, these concepts coincide. The canonical fundamental domain for {{nowrap|1=Î = '''Z''' + '''Z'''''Ï''}} with {{nowrap|Im ''Ï'' &gt; 0}} is either a symmetric convex parallelogram or hexagon with centre 0. By conformal equivalence, the period ''Ï'' can be further restricted to satisfy {{nowrap|{{abs|Re ''Ï''}} â¤ 1/2}} and {{nowrap|{{abs|''Ï''}} â¥ 1}}. As [[Dirichlet]] showed ("Dirichlet's hexagon theorem", 1850), for almost all ''Ï'' the fundamental domain is a hexagon. For {{nowrap|Re ''Ï'' &gt; 0}}, the midpoints of sides are given by Â±1/2, Â±''Ï''/2 and {{nowrap|Â±(''Ï'' â 1)/2}}; the sides bisect the corresponding radii from 0 orthogonally, which determines the vertices completely. In fact the first vertex must have the form {{nowrap|(1 + ''ix'')/2 }} and {{nowrap|''Ï''(1 + ''iy'')/2}} with ''x'' and ''y'' real; so if {{nowrap|1=''Ï'' = ''a'' + ''ib''}}, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' â ''by'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''b'' + ''ay''}}. Hence {{nowrap|1=''y'' = (''a'' â 1)/''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''x'' =  (''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; â ''a'')/''b''}}. The six vertices are therefore {{nowrap|Â±''Ï''(1 â ''iy'')/2}} and {{nowrap|Â±(1 Â± ''ix'')/2}}.&lt;ref&gt;See:

==Fundamental polygons in higher genus==
===Overview===
Every compact Riemann surface ''X'' has a [[universal covering space|universal covering surface]] which is a simply connected Riemann surface {{overline|''X''}}. The [[fundamental group]] of ''X'' acts as [[deck transformations]] of {{overline|''X''}} and can be identified with a subgroup Î of the group of [[biholomorphism]]s of {{overline|''X''}}. The group Î thus acts freely on {{overline|''X''}} with compact quotient space {{overline|''X''}}/Î, which can be identified with ''X''. Thus the classification of compact Riemann surfaces can be reduced to the study of possible groups Î. By the [[uniformization theorem]] {{overline|''X''}} is either the Riemann sphere, the complex plane or the unit disk/upper halfplane. The first important invariant of a compact Riemann surface is its ''genus'', a topological invariant given by half the rank of the Abelian group {{nowrap|Î/[Î, Î]}} (which can be identified with the [[singular homology|homology group]] {{nowrap|''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', '''Z''')}}). The genus is zero if the covering space is the Riemann sphere; one if it is the complex plane; and greater than one if it is the unit disk or upper halfplane.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;

Bihomolomorphisms of the Riemann sphere are just complex MÃ¶bius transformations and every non-identity transformation has at least one fixed point, since the corresponding complex matrix always has at least one non-zero eigenvector. Thus if {{overline|''X''}} is the Riemann sphere, then ''X'' must be simply connected and biholomorphic to the Riemann sphere, the ''genus zero'' Riemann surface. When {{overline|''X''}} is the complex plane, the group of biholomorphisms is the affine group, the complex MÃ¶bius transformations fixing â, so the transformations {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') = ''az'' + ''b''}} with {{nowrap|''a'' â  0}}. The non-identity transformations without fixed points are just those with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}} and {{nowrap|''b'' â  0}}, i.e. the non-zero translations. The group Î can thus be identified with a lattice Î in '''C''' and ''X'' with a quotient '''C'''/Î, as described in the section on fundamental polygons in genus one. In the third case when {{overline|''X''}} is the unit disk or upper half plane, the group of biholomorphisms consists of the complex MÃ¶bius transformations fixing the unit circle or the real axis. In the former case, the transformations correspond to elements of the group {{nowrap|SU(1, 1)/{Â±''I''};}} in the latter case they correspond to real MÃ¶bius transformations, so elements of {{Nowrap|SL(2, '''R''')/{Â±''I''}.}}&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;

The study and classification of possible groups Î that act freely on the unit disk or upper halfplane with compact quotientâthe [[Fuchsian group]]s of the first kindâcan be accomplished by studying their fundamental polygons, as described below. As [[Henri PoincarÃ©|PoincarÃ©]] observed, each such polygon has special properties, namely it is convex and has a natural pairing between its sides. These not only allow the group to be recovered but provide an explicit presentation of the group by generators and relations. Conversely PoincarÃ© proved that any such polygon gives rise to a compact Riemann surface; in fact, PoincarÃ©'s polygon theorem applied to more general polygons, where the polygon was allowed to have ideal vertices, but his proof was complete only in the compact case, without such vertices. Without assumptions on the convexity of the polygon, complete proofs have been given by [[Bernard Maskit|Maskit]] and [[Georges de Rham|de Rham]], based on an idea of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]], and can be found in {{harvtxt|Beardon|1983}}, {{harvtxt|Iversen|1992}} and {{harvtxt|Stillwell|1992}}. [[Constantin CarathÃ©odory|CarathÃ©odory]] gave an elementary treatment of the existence of [[Schwarz triangle function#Tessellation by Schwarz triangles|tessellations by Schwarz triangles]], i.e. tilings by  geodesic triangles with angles {{pi}}/''a'', {{pi}}/''b'', {{pi}}/''c'' with sum less than {{pi}} where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are integers. When all the angles equal {{pi}}/2''g'', this establishes the tiling by regular ''4g''-sided hyperbolic polygons and hence the existence of a particular compact Riemann surface of genus ''g'' as a quotient space. This special example, which has a cyclic group '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2''g''&lt;/sub&gt; of bihomolomorphic symmetries, is used in the development below.&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt;{{harvnb|Beardon|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification up to homeomorphism and diffeomorphism of compact Riemann surfaces implies the classification of closed orientable 2-manifolds up to homeomorphism and diffeomorphism: any two 2-manifolds with the same genus are diffeomorphic. In fact using a partition of unity, every closed orientable 2-manifold admits a [[Riemannian metric]]. For a compact Riemann surface a conformal metric can also be introduced with is conformal, so that in holomorphic coordinates the metric takes the form ''Ï''(''z'') {{abs|''dz''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Once this metric has been chosen, locally biholomorphic mappings are precisely orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms that are conformal, i.e. scale the metric by a smooth function. The existence of [[isothermal coordinates]]âwhich can be proved using either [[Isothermal coordinates#Hodge star operator|local existence theorems for the Laplacian]] or the [[Isothermal coordinates#Beltrami equation|Beltrami equation]]âshows that every closed oriented Riemannian 2-manifold can be given a complex structure compatible with its metric, and hence has the structure of a compact Riemann surface. This construction shows that the classification of closed orientable 2-manifolds up to diffeomorphism or homeomorphism can be reduced to the case of compact Riemann surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Imayoshi|Tanaguchi|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification up to homeomorphism and diffeomorphism of compact Riemann surfaces can be accomplished using the fundamental polygon. Indeed as PoincarÃ© observed convex fundamental polygons for compact Riemann surfaces ''H''/Î can be constructed by adapting the method Dirichlet from the Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Then following Nevanlinna and Jost, the fundamental domain can be modified in steps to yield a non-convex polygon with vertices lying in a single orbit of Î and piecewise geodesic sides. The pairing relation on the sides is also modified in each of these steps. Each step involves cutting the polygon by a diagonal geodesic segment in the interior of the polygon and reassembling the polygon using one of the MÃ¶bius transformations involved in the pairing. No two paired sides can have a common vertex in the final pairing relation, which satisfies similar properties to the original relation. This polygon can in turn be successively modified by reassembling the polygon after cutting it by a diagonal piecewise geodesic segment in its interior. The final polygon has 4''g'' equivalent vertices, with sides that are piecewise geodesic. The sides are labelled by the group elements which give the MÃ¶bius transformation to the paired side. In order the labelling is

:&lt;math&gt;a_1, b_1, a_1^{-1}, b_1^{-1}, \dots, a_g, b_g, a_g^{-1}, b_g^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

so that Î is generated by the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; subject to the single relation

:&lt;math&gt;a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1} \cdots a_g b_g a_g^{-1} b_g^{-1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

File:Triple_torus_illustration.png|Genus three surface
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Using the theory of [[Differential forms on a Riemann surface#Intersection number of closed curves|intersection numbers]], it follows that the shape obtained by joining vertices by geodesics is also a proper polygon, not necessarily convex, and is also a fundamental domain with the same group elements giving the pairing. This yields a fundamental polygon with edges given by geodesic segments and with the standard labelling. The abelianisation of Î, the quotient group {{nowrap|Î/[Î, Î]}}, is a free Abelian group with 2''g'' generators. Thus the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' is a topological invariant. It is easy to see that two Riemann surfaces with the same genus are homeomorphic since as topological space since they are obtained by identifying sides of a 4''g''-sided polygonâa Euclidean polygon in the [[Klein model]]âby diffeomorphisms between paired sides.&lt;ref&gt;Note that a simple polygon in the plane with ''n'' â¥ 4 vertices is homeomorphic to one, and hence any, convex ''n''-gon by a piecewise linear homeomorphism, linear on the edges: this follows by induction on ''n'' from the observation of [[Max Dehn]] that any simple polygon possesses a diagonal, i.e. an interior chord between vertices, so can be broken up into smaller polygons; see {{harvtxt|Guggenheimer|1977}}. For a regular 4''g''-gon, the pairing between sides can be made linear, by reparametrising triangles made up of the centre and one side from each pair of sides.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying this construction to the regular 4''g''-sided polygon allows the Riemann surface to be viewed topologically as a doughnut with ''g'' holes, the standard description of oriented surfaces in introductory texts on topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|2002|pages=47â57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shastri|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several further results:

*Two homeomorphic Riemann surfaces are diffeomorphic.
*Any convex fundamental polygon in genus ''g'' has ''N'' vertices where 4''g'' â¤ ''N'' â¤ 12''g'' â 6.
*A Dirichlet polygon in genus ''g'' has exactly {{nowrap|12''g'' â 6}} vertices for a dense open set of centres.
*Every genus ''g'' Riemann surface has a Fricke fundamental polygon, i.e. a convex polygon with canonical pairing between sides. (The polygon need not necessarily be a Dirichlet polygon.)
*After a suitable normalisation and labelling of the generators of the fundamental group, the Fricke polygon is uniquely determined and the {{nowrap|6''g'' â 6}} real parameters describing it can be used as global real analytic parameters for [[TeichmÃ¼ller space]] in genus ''g''.

These results are tied up with the interrelation between homeomorphisms and the fundamental group: this reflects the fact that the [[Mapping class group of a surface|mapping class group]] of a Riemann surfaceâthe group of quasiconformal self-homomorphisms of a Riemann surface ''H''/Î modulo those homotopic to the identityâcan be identified with the [[outer automorphism group]] of Î (the [[Mapping class group of a surface#The DehnâNielsenâBaer theorem|DehnâNielsenâBaer theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farb|Margalit|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see this connection, note that if ''f'' is a quasiconformal homeomorphism of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''/Î&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''/Î&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''f'' lifts to a quasiconformal homeomorphism {{overline|''f''}} of ''H'' onto itself. This lift is unique up to pre-composition with elements of Î&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and post-composition with elements of Î&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the projection of ''H'' onto ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then {{nowrap|1=''f'' â {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; â {{overline|''f''}}}} and Î&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is just the group of homeomorphisms ''g'' of ''H'' such that {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; â ''g'' = {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. If follows that {{nowrap|1={{overline|''f''}} ''g'' = ''Î¸''(''g'') {{overline|''f''}} }} for ''g'' in Î&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; where ''Î¸'' is a group isomorphism of Î&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto Î&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A different choice of {{overline|''f''}} changes ''Î¸'' by composition with an inner automorphism: such isomorphisms are said to be ''equivalent''.&lt;ref name="Ahlfors"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahlfors|2006|pages=67â68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two isomorphisms ''Î¸'' and ''Î¸''â² are equivalent if and only if the corresponding homeomorphisms ''f'' and ''f''{{'}} are homotopic. In fact it suffices to show that a quasiconformal self-homeomorphism ''f'' of a surface induces an inner automorphism of the fundamental group if and only if it is homotopic to the identity map: in other words the homomorphism of the quasiconformal self-homeomorphism group of ''H''/Î into Out Î passes to the mapping class group on which it is injective. Indeed suppose first that ''F''(''t'') is a continuous path of self-homeomorphisms with ''F''(0) = id and {{nowrap|1=''F''(1) = ''f''}}. Then there is a continuous lift {{overline|''F''}}(''t'') with {{overline|''F''}}(0) = id. Moreover for each ''g'' in  Î, {{nowrap|1= {{overline|''F''}}(''t'') â ''g'' â {{overline|''F''}}(''t'')&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a continuously varying element of Î equal to ''g'' for {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}; so discreteness of Î forces this element to be constant and hence equal to ''g'' so that {{overline|''F''}}(''t'') commutes with Î, so ''F''(1) induces the trivial automorphism. If on the other hand ''F'' is a quasiconformal lift of ''f'' inducing an inner automorphism of Î, after composition with an element Î if necessary it can be assumed that ''F'' commutes with Î. Since ''F'' is quasiconformal, it extends to a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the circle which also commutes with Î. Each {{nowrap|''g'' â  id}} in Î is hyperbolic so has two fixed points on the circle ''a''&lt;sub&gt;Â±&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all other points ''z'', ''g''&lt;sup&gt;Â±''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'') tends to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;Â±&lt;/sub&gt; as ''n'' tends to infinity. Hence ''F'' must fix these points; since these points are dense in the circle as ''g'' varies, it follows that ''F'' fixes the unit circle. Let ''Î¼'' = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;{{overline|z}}&lt;/sub&gt; / ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ''Î¼'' is a Î-invariant Beltrami differential. Let ''F''(''t'') be the solution of the Beltrami equation ''tÎ¼'' normalised to fix three points on the unit circle. Then ''F''(''t'') commutes with Î and so, as for {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''F''(1)}}, is the identity on the unit circle. By construction ''F''(''t'') is an isotopy between the identity and ''F''. This proves injectivity.&lt;ref name="Ahlfors"/&gt;

The proof of surjectivity relies on comparing the hyperbolic metric on ''D'' with a word-length metric on Î.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farb|Margalit|2012|pages=230â236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming with out loss of generality that 0 lies in the interior of a convex fundamental polygon ''C'' and ''g'' is an element of Î, the ray from 0 to ''g''(0)âthe hyperbolic geodesicâpasses through a succession of translates of ''C''. Each of these is obtained from the previous one by applying a generator of Î or a fixed product of generators (if successive translates meet in a vertex). It follows that the hyperbolic distance between 0 and ''g''(0) is less than 4''g'' times the word length of ''g'' plus twice diameter of the fundamental polygon. Thus the metric on Î {{nowrap|1=''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'', ''h'') = ''L''(''h''&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;''g'')}} defined by the word length ''L''(''g'') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;d(g(0),h(0)) \le a\, d_1(g,h) + b&lt;/math&gt;

for positive constants ''a'' and ''b''. Conversely there are positive constants ''c'' and ''d'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1(g,h) \le c \,d(g(0),h(0)) + d.&lt;/math&gt;

===Dirichlet polygons===
Given a point &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; in the [[upper half-plane]] '''H''', and a discrete [[subgroup]] Î of {{nowrap|PSL(2, '''R''')}} that acts [[free regular set|freely discontinuously]] on the upper half-plane, then one can define the '''Dirichlet polygon''' as the set of points

:&lt;math&gt;F=\{z \in \mathbf{H} : d(z,z_0) &lt; d(z,gz_0) \;\; \forall g\in \Gamma, g\ne 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''d'' is a hyperbolic [[metric space|metric]] on the upper half-plane. The metric fundamental polygon is more usually called the '''Dirichlet polygon'''.
* This fundamental polygon is a [[fundamental domain]].
* This fundamental polygon is [[Convex set|convex]] in that the [[geodesic]] joining any two points of the polygon is contained entirely inside the polygon.
* The [[diameter]] of ''F'' is less than or equal to the diameter of '''H'''/Î. In particular, the closure of ''F'' is compact.
* If Î has no fixed points in '''H''' and '''H'''/Î is compact, then ''F'' will have finitely many sides.
* Each side of the polygon is a [[geodesic]] arc.
* For every side ''s'' of the polygon, there is precisely one other side ''s''â² such that {{nowrap|1=''gs'' = ''s''â²}} for some ''g'' in Î. Thus, this polygon will have an even number of sides.
* The set of group elements ''g'' that join sides to each other are [[generating set of a group|generators]] of Î, and there is no smaller set that will generate Î.
* The upper half-plane is tiled by the closure of ''F'' under the action of Î. That is, &lt;math&gt;H=\cup_{g\in\Gamma}\, g\overline{F}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\overline{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the closure of ''F''.

===Normalised polygon===
In this section, starting from an arbitrary Dirichlet polygon, a description will be given of the method of {{harvtxt|Nevanlinna|1955}}, elaborated in {{harvtxt|Jost|2002}}, for modifying the polygon to a non-convex polygon with 4'''g''' equivalent vertices and a canonical pairing on the sides. This treatment is an analytic counterpart of the classical topological classification of orientable 2-dimensional polyhedra presented in {{harvtxt|Seifert|Threlfall|1934}}.

===Fricke canonical polygon===
Given a Riemann surface of genus ''g'' greater than one, [[Robert Fricke|Fricke]] described another fundamental polygon, the '''Fricke canonical polygon''', which is a very special example of a Dirichlet polygon. The polygon is related to the standard presentation of the fundamental group of the surface. Fricke's original construction is complicated and described in {{harvtxt|Fricke|Klein|1897}}. Using the theory of [[quasiconformal mapping]]s of [[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors]] and [[Lipman Bers|Bers]], {{harvtxt|Keen|1965}} gave a new, shorter and more precise version of Fricke's construction. The Fricke canonical polygon has the following properties:

* The vertices of the Fricke polygon has 4''g'' vertices which all lie in an orbit of Î. By ''vertex'' is meant the point where two sides meet. 
* The sides are matched in distinct pairs, so that there is a unique element of Î carrying a side to the paired side, reversing the orientation. Since the action of Î is orientation-preserving, if one side is called &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then the other of the pair can be marked with the opposite orientation &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The edges of the standard polygon can be arranged so that the list of adjacent sides takes the form &lt;math&gt;A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1}A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1}\cdots A_g B_g A_g^{-1} B_g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, pairs of sides can be arranged so that they interleave in this way.
* The sides are geodesic arcs.
* Each of the interior angles of the Fricke polygon is strictly less than {{pi}}, so that the polygon is strictly convex, and the sum of these interior angles is 2{{pi}}.

The above construction is sufficient to guarantee that each side of the polygon is a closed (non-trivial) loop in the Riemann surface '''H'''/Î. As such, each side can thus an element of the [[fundamental group]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 (\mathbb{H}/\Gamma) \equiv \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the fundamental group &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 (\mathbb{H}/\Gamma)&lt;/math&gt; has 2''g'' generators &lt;math&gt;A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, \cdots A_g, B_g&lt;/math&gt;, with exactly one defining constraint,

:&lt;math&gt;A_1 B_1 A_1^{-1} B_1^{-1}A_2 B_2 A_2^{-1} B_2^{-1}\cdots A_g B_g A_g^{-1} B_g^{-1}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

The genus of the Riemann surface '''H'''/Î is ''g''.

===Area===
The area of the standard fundamental polygon is &lt;math&gt;4\pi(g-1)&lt;/math&gt; where ''g'' is the genus of the Riemann surface (equivalently, where 4''g'' is the number of the sides of the polygon). Since the standard polygon is a representative of '''H'''/Î, the total area of the Riemann surface is equal to the area of the standard polygon. The area formula follows from the [[GaussâBonnet theorem]] and is in a certain sense generalized through the [[RiemannâHurwitz formula]].

==Explicit form for standard polygons==
Explicit expressions can be given for the regular standard 4''g''-sided polygon, with rotational symmetry. In this case, that of a genus &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; Riemann surface with ''g''-fold rotational symmetry, the group may be given by &lt;math&gt;2g&lt;/math&gt; generators &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;. These generators are given by the following [[fractional linear transform]]s acting on the [[upper half-plane]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=
\left( \begin{matrix}
 \cos k\alpha &amp; -\sin k\alpha \\ \sin k\alpha &amp; \cos k\alpha
\end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix} e^p &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; e^{-p} \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix}
 \cos k\alpha &amp; \sin k\alpha \\ -\sin k\alpha &amp; \cos k\alpha
\end{matrix} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;0\le k &lt; 2g&lt;/math&gt;. The parameters are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha= \frac{\pi}{4g}\left(2g-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\beta= \frac{\pi}{4g}&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;p=\ln \frac{\cos \beta + \sqrt{\cos 2\beta}}{\sin \beta} &lt;/math&gt;

It may be verified that these generators obey the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;a_0a_1\cdots a_{2g-1} a^{-1}_0a^{-1}_1\cdots a^{-1}_{2g-1}=1&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the totality of the [[group presentation]].

This theory denies the existence of [[matter|material substance]] and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only [[idea]]s in the [[mind]]s of [[perception|perceivers]] and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of [[abstraction]], an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.

Berkeley was the namesake of the city of [[Berkeley, California]], which is perhaps most famous as the home of the [[University of California, Berkeley|prestigious university]].

[[File:Berkeley College (South) at Yale.jpg|thumb|[[Berkeley College (Yale University)|Berkeley College]], one of Yale University's 14 residential colleges, is named after George Berkeley.]]

In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Berkeley |first=George |year=1709 |contribution= |title= An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision |edition= 2 |publisher=Jeremy Pepyat  |publication-date=1709 |publication-place=Dublin  |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o85AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AdyOzLl2K0NEC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=12 July 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'', in 1710, which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'' in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Turbayne| first=C.

* "Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind"
* C. Turbayne's reply to S.A. Grave "A Note on Berkeley's Conception of the Mind" (''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'', 1962, vol. 22, No. 4, {{JSTOR|2105263}}, {{doi|10.2307/2105263}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Berkeley's views were represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"), while Hylas (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular [[John Locke]].
Berkeley argued against [[Isaac Newton]]'s doctrine of [[absoluteness|absolute]] [[space]], time and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''&lt;ref name="Berkeley's Philosophical Writings 1974"&gt;''Berkeley's Philosophical Writings'', New York: Collier, 1974, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 64-22680&lt;/ref&gt; (On Motion), published 1721.

His last major philosophical work, ''Siris'' (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of [[tar water]] and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics, including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War&amp;nbsp;II because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century, such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Colin |editor1-last=Turbayne|title=Berkeley: critical and interpretive essays|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RExF10reT9wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Turbayne#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=1982 |publisher= University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN |accessdate=30 May 2011|isbn=978-0-8166-1065-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Ireland ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
Berkeley was born at his family home, [[Dysart Castle]], near [[Thomastown]], [[County Kilkenny]], Ireland, the eldest son of William Berkeley, a [[Cadet (genealogy)|cadet]] of the noble family of [[Berkeley family|Berkeley]]. Little is known of his mother.  He was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]] in 1702, earning a bachelor's degree in 1704 and completing a master's degree in 1707. He remained at Trinity College after completion of his degree as a tutor and Greek lecturer.

His earliest publication was on mathematics, but the first that brought him notice was his ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', first published in 1709. In the essay, Berkeley examines visual distance, magnitude, position and problems of sight and touch. While this work raised much controversy at the time, its conclusions are now accepted as an established part of the theory of optics.

The next publication to appear was the ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' in 1710, which had great success and gave him a lasting reputation, though few accepted his theory that nothing exists outside the mind. This was followed in 1713 by ''[[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous]]'', in which he propounded his system of philosophy, the leading principle of which is that the world, as represented by our senses, depends for its existence on being perceived.

For this theory, the ''Principles'' gives the exposition and the ''Dialogues'' the defence. One of his main objectives was to combat the prevailing [[materialism]] of his time. The theory was largely received with ridicule, while even those such as [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]], who did acknowledge his "extraordinary genius," were nevertheless convinced that his first principles were false.

=== England and Europe ===
Shortly afterwards, Berkeley visited England and was received into the circle of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and [[Richard Steele|Steele]]. In the period between 1714 and 1720, he interspersed his academic endeavours with periods of extensive travel in Europe, including one of the most extensive Grand Tours of the length and breadth of Italy ever undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], 'George Berkeley's Grand Tours: The Immaterialist as Connoisseur of Art and Architecture', in E. Chaney, ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance,'' 2nd ed. London, Routledge. 2000 {{ISBN|0714644749}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, he took [[Holy Orders]] in the [[Church of Ireland]], earning his doctorate in [[divinity]], and once again chose to remain at Trinity College Dublin, lecturing this time in Divinity and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In 1721/2 he was made [[Dean of Dromore]] and, in 1724, [[Dean of Derry]].

In 1723, following her violent quarrel with [[Jonathan Swift]], who had been her intimate friend for many years, [[Esther Vanhomrigh]]  (for whom Swift had created the nickname "Vanessa") named Berkeley her co-heir along with the barrister [[Robert Marshall (Irish judge)|Robert Marshall]]; her choice of legatees caused a good deal of surprise since she did not know either of them well, although Berkeley as a very young man had known her father. Swift said generously that he did not grudge Berkeley his inheritance, much of which vanished in a lawsuit in any event. A story that Berkeley and Marshall disregarded a condition of the inheritance that they must publish the correspondence between Swift and Vanessa is probably untrue.

In 1725, he began the project of founding a college in [[Bermuda]] for training ministers and missionaries in the colony, in pursuit of which he gave up his deanery with its income of Â£1100.

=== Marriage and America ===
In 1728, he married Anne Forster, daughter of [[John Forster (Chief Justice)|John Forster]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]], and his first wife Rebecca Monck. He then went to America on a salary of Â£100 per annum. He landed near [[Newport, Rhode Island]], where he bought a plantation at [[Middletown, Rhode Island|Middletown]]{{spaced ndash}}the famous "[[Whitehall Museum House|Whitehall]]". It has been claimed that "he introduced [[Palladianism]] into America by borrowing a design from [William] Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' for the door-case of his house in Rhode Island, Whitehall."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He also brought to New England [[John Smybert|John Smibert]], the British artist he "discovered" in Italy, who is generally regarded as the founding father of American portrait painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Smibert|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Smibert|website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he drew up plans for the ideal city he planned to build on Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;E. Chaney, "George Berkeley's Grand Tours",''Evolution of the Grand Tour'', p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at the plantation while he waited for funds for his college to arrive. The funds, however, were not forthcoming, and in 1732 he left America and returned to London. He and Anne had four children who survived infancy: Henry, George, William and Julia, and at least two other children who died in infancy. William's death in 1751 was a great cause of grief to his father.

=== Humanitarian work ===
While living in London's Saville Street, he took part in efforts to create a home for the city's abandoned children. The [[Foundling Hospital]] was founded by [[Royal Charter]] in 1739, and Berkeley is listed as one of its original governors. In 1734, he was appointed [[Bishop of Cloyne]] in Ireland, a position he was to hold until his death. Soon afterwards, he published ''[[Alciphron, or The Minute Philosopher]]'', directed against both [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Bernard de Mandeville]]; and in 1735â37 ''The Querist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first= |year=1750 |title=The Querist, Containing, Several Queries, Proposed to the Consideration of the Public by the Bishop of Cloyne |publisher= George Faulkner |place=Dublin|edition= Third with Additions |page=2 |url=https://archive.org/stream/ldpd_9168945_000#page/n1/mode/2up|accessdate=13 June 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last works ===
His last two publications were ''Siris: A Chain of Philosophical Reflexions and Inquiries Concerning the Virtues of Tarwater, And divers other Subjects connected together and arising one from another'' (1744) and ''Further Thoughts on Tar-water'' (1752). [[Pine tar]] is an effective antiseptic and disinfectant when applied to cuts on the skin, but Berkeley argued for the use of pine tar as a broad panacea for diseases. His 1744 work on tar-water sold more copies than any of his other books during Berkeley's lifetime.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

He remained at Cloyne until 1752, when he retired. With his wife and daughter Julia he went to Oxford to live with his son George and supervise his education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/berkeley/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Downing|first=Lisa|year=2013|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died soon afterward and was buried in [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford]]. His affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much loved and held in warm regard by many of his contemporaries. Anne outlived her husband by many years, and died in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, in his ''Satires, Epistles, and Odes of Horace'' (Epilogue to the Satires, Dialogue ii, line 73) refers to God granting "To Berkeley every Virtue under Heaven".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to philosophy ==
{{Main|Subjective idealism}}

{{Quotation|According to Berkeley there are only two kinds of things: spirits and ideas. Spirits are simple, active beings which produce and perceive ideas; ideas are passive beings which are produced and perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Bettcher T.M. ''Berkeley: A Guide for the Perplexed''. [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum Publishing]], 2008. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The use of the concepts of "spirit" and "idea" is central in Berkeley's philosophy. As used by him, these concepts are difficult to translate into modern terminology. His concept of "spirit" is close to the concept of "conscious subject" or of "mind", and the concept of "idea" is close to the concept of "sensation" or "state of mind" or "conscious experience".

Thus Berkeley denied the existence of matter as a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] substance, but did not deny the existence of physical objects such as apples or mountains. ("''I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance. And in doing of this, there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it.''", ''Principles ''#35) This basic claim of Berkeley's thought, his "idealism", is sometimes and somewhat derisively called "immaterialism" or, occasionally, [[subjective idealism]]. In ''Principles #3,'' he wrote, using a combination of Latin and English, ''esse is percipi'' (to be is to be perceived), most often if slightly inaccurately attributed to Berkeley as the pure Latin phrase ''esse est percipi.''&lt;ref&gt;Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase appears associated with him in authoritative philosophical sources, e.g., "Berkeley holds that there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous phrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) â to be is to be perceived (or to perceive)."&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;Downing, Lisa, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/berkeley/ George Berkeley]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.). Retrieved 21 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, human knowledge is reduced to two elements: that of spirits and of ideas (''Principles'' #86). In contrast to ideas, a spirit cannot be perceived. A person's spirit, which perceives ideas, is to be comprehended intuitively by inward feeling or reflection (''Principles'' #89). For Berkeley, we have no direct 'idea' of spirits, albeit we have good reason to believe in the existence of other spirits, for their existence explains the purposeful regularities we find in experience.&lt;ref&gt;Fogelin, Robert ''Berkeley and the Principles of Human Knowledge''. [[Routledge]], 2001. pp. 74â75.&lt;/ref&gt; ("''It is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations, or the ideas by them excited in us''", Dialogues #145). This is the solution that Berkeley offers to the [[problem of other minds]]. Finally, the order and purposefulness of the whole of our experience of the world and especially of nature overwhelms us into believing in the existence of an extremely powerful and intelligent spirit that causes that order. According to Berkeley, reflection on the attributes of that external spirit leads us to identify it with God. Thus a material thing such as an apple consists of a collection of ideas (shape, color, taste, physical properties, etc.) which are caused in the spirits of humans by the spirit of God.

=== Theology ===
A convinced adherent of Christianity, Berkeley believed God to be present as an immediate [[causality|cause]] of all our experiences.

{{quote|He did not evade the question of the external source of the diversity of the [[sense data]] at the disposal of the human individual. He strove simply to show that the causes of sensations could not be things, because what we called things, and considered without grounds to be something different from our sensations, were built up wholly from sensations. There must consequently be some other external source of the inexhaustible diversity of sensations. The source of our sensations, Berkeley concluded, could only be God; He gave them to man, who had to see in them signs and symbols that carried God's word.&lt;ref name="The Main Trends in Philosophy"&gt;[[Teodor Oizerman|Oizerman T.I.]] [https://archive.org/details/TheMainTrendsInPhilosophy The Main Trends in Philosophy]. A Theoretical Analysis of the History of Philosophy. Moscow, 1988, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here is Berkeley's proof of the existence of God:

{{quote|Whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like dependence on my [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. When in broad daylight I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or no, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view; and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will. There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that produces them. (Berkeley. ''Principles'' #29)}}

As T.I. Oizerman explained:

{{quote|Berkeley's [[Subjective idealism|mystic idealism]] (as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] aptly christened it) claimed that nothing separated man and God (except [[materialism|materialist]] misconceptions, of course), since nature or matter did not exist as a reality independent of consciousness. The revelation of God was directly accessible to man, according to this doctrine; it was the sense-perceived world, the world of man's sensations, which came to him from on high for him to decipher and so grasp the divine purpose.&lt;ref name="The Main Trends in Philosophy"/&gt;}}

Berkeley believed that God is not the distant engineer of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] machinery that in the fullness of time led to the growth of a tree in the university quadrangle. Rather, the perception of the tree is an idea that God's mind has produced in the mind, and the tree continues to exist in the quadrangle when "nobody" is there, simply because God is an infinite [[mind]] that perceives all.

The philosophy of [[David Hume]] concerning causality and objectivity is an elaboration of another aspect of Berkeley's philosophy. [[A.A. Luce]], the most eminent Berkeley scholar of the 20th century, constantly stressed the continuity of Berkeley's philosophy. The fact that Berkeley returned to his major works throughout his life, issuing revised editions with only minor changes, also counts against any theory that attributes to him a significant [[volte-face]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Relativity arguments ===
{{See also|Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous}}
[[John Locke]] (Berkeley's predecessor) states that we define an object by its [[Primary/secondary quality distinction|primary and secondary qualities]]. He takes heat as an example of a secondary quality. If you put one hand in a bucket of cold water, and the other hand in a bucket of warm water, then put both hands in a bucket of lukewarm water, one of your hands is going to tell you that the water is cold and the other that the water is hot. Locke says that since two different objects (both your hands) perceive the water to be hot ''and'' cold, then the heat is not a quality of the water.

While Locke used this argument to distinguish primary from secondary qualities, Berkeley extends it to cover primary qualities in the same way. For example, he says that size is not a quality of an object because the size of the object depends on the distance between the observer and the object, or the size of the observer. Since an object is a different size to different observers, then size is not a quality of the object. Berkeley rejects shape with a similar argument and then asks: if neither primary qualities nor secondary qualities are of the object, then how can we say that there is anything more than the qualities we observe?{{clarify|reason=are size and shape the only qualities in this context?|date=October 2016|}}

=== New theory of vision ===
In his ''Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision'', Berkeley frequently criticised the views of the Optic Writers, a title that seems to include [[William Molyneux|Molyneux]], Wallis, [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] and [[RenÃ© Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, R, 1994. Vision: Variations on some Berkeleian themes. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In sections 1â51, Berkeley argued against the classical scholars of optics by holding that: ''spatial depth, as the distance that separates the perceiver from the perceived object is itself invisible''.  That is, we do not see space directly or deduce its form logically using the laws of optics.  Space for Berkeley is no more than a contingent expectation that visual and tactile sensations will follow one another in regular sequences that we come to expect through habit.

Berkeley goes on to argue that visual cues, such as the perceived extension or 'confusion' of an object, can only be used to indirectly judge distance, because the viewer learns to associate visual cues with tactile sensations. Berkeley gives the following analogy regarding indirect distance perception: one perceives distance indirectly just as one perceives a person's embarrassment indirectly. When looking at an embarrassed person, we infer indirectly that the person is embarrassed by observing the red color on the person's face. We know through experience that a red face tends to signal embarrassment, as we've learned to associate the two.

The question concerning the visibility of space was central to the Renaissance [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] tradition and its reliance on classical optics in the development of pictorial representations of spatial depth. This matter was debated by scholars since the 11th-century Arab polymath and mathematician [[Alhazen]] (al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham) affirmed in experimental contexts the visibility of space. This issue, which was raised in Berkeley's theory of vision, was treated at length in the ''Phenomenology of Perception'' of Maurice [[Merleau-Ponty]], in the context of confirming the visual perception of spatial depth (''la profondeur''), and by way of refuting Berkeley's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;For recent studies on this topic refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'La perception de la profondeur: [[Alhazen]], Berkeley et Merleau-Ponty', ''Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et mÃ©diÃ©vales'', [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] Vol. 5 (2004), pp. 171â184.  See also: [[Nader El-Bizri]], "A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol.15 (2005), pp. 189â218 ([[Cambridge University Press]] journal), {{doi|10.1017/S0957423905000172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkeley wrote about the perception of size in addition to that of distance. He is frequently misquoted as believing in sizeâdistance invariance â a view held by the Optic Writers. This idea is that we scale the image size according to distance in a geometrical manner. The error may have become commonplace because the eminent historian and psychologist [[Edwin Boring|E. G. Boring]] perpetuated it.&lt;ref&gt;Boring E. G., 1942. Sensation and perception in the history of experimental psychology. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, pp.&amp;nbsp;223 and 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Berkeley argued that the same cues that evoke distance also evoke size, and that we do not first see size and then calculate distance.&lt;ref&gt;Ross H. E., Plug, C., 1998. "The history of size constancy and size illusions." In Walsh, V. &amp; Kulikowski, J. (Eds) ''Perceptual constancy: Why things look as they do''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 499â528.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth quoting Berkeley's words on this issue (Section 53):
&lt;blockquote&gt;What inclines men to this mistake (beside the humour of making one see by geometry) is, that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance, do also suggest magnitude... I say they do not first suggest distance, and then leave it to the judgement to use that as a medium, whereby to collect the magnitude; but they have as close and immediate a connexion with the magnitude as with the distance; and suggest magnitude as independently of distance, as they do distance independently of magnitude.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Philosophy of physics ===
{{See also|De Motu (Berkeley's essay)}}
"Berkeley's works display his keen interest in natural philosophy [...] from his earliest writings (''Arithmetica'', 1707) to his latest (''Siris'', 1744). Moreover, much of his philosophy is shaped fundamentally by his engagement with the science of his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Lisa Downing| editor= Kenneth P. Winkler|title= The Cambridge Companion to Berkeley |chapter= Berkeley's natural philosophy and philosophy of science |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |page= 230 |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-0-521-45033-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ER3vQcE1v9AC&amp;pg=PA230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profundity of this interest can be judged from numerous entries in Berkeley's ''Philosophical Commentaries'' (1707â1708), e.g. "Mem. to Examine &amp; accurately discuss the scholium of the 8th Definition of Mr Newton's Principia." (#316)

Berkeley argued that forces and gravity, as defined by Newton, constituted "occult qualities" that "expressed nothing distinctly". He held that those who posited "something unknown in a body of which they have no idea and which they call the principle of motion, are in fact simply stating that the principle of motion is unknown." Therefore, those who "affirm that active force, action, and the principle of motion are really in bodies are adopting an opinion not based on experience."&lt;ref&gt;De Motu, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E. The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. London: Thomas Nelson and Son Ltd., 1948â1957, 4:36â37&lt;/ref&gt; Forces and gravity existed nowhere in the phenomenal world. On the other hand, if they resided in the category of "soul" or "incorporeal thing", they "do not properly belong to physics" as a matter. Berkeley thus concluded that forces lay beyond any kind of empirical observation and could not be a part of proper science.&lt;ref&gt;Downing, Lisa. Berkeley's Case Against Realism About Dynamics. In Robert G. Muehlmann (ed.), Berkeley's Metaphysics: Structural, Interpretive, and Critical Essays. The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed his theory of signs as a means to explain motion and matter without reference to the "occult qualities" of force and gravity.

=== Berkeley's razor ===

'''Berkeley's razor''' is a rule of reasoning proposed by the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] in his study of Berkeley's key scientific work ''De Motu''.&lt;ref name="Berkeley's Philosophical Writings 1974"/&gt; Berkeley's razor is considered by Popper to be similar to [[Ockham's razor]] but "more powerful". It represents an extreme, [[empiricist]] view of scientific observation that states that the scientific method provides us with no true insight into the nature of the world. Rather, the scientific method gives us a variety of partial explanations about regularities that hold in the world and that are gained through experiment. The nature of the world, according to Berkeley, is only approached through properly [[metaphysical]] speculation and reasoning. Popper summarises Berkeley's razor as such:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A general practical result â which I propose to call "Berkeley's razor" â of [Berkeley's] analysis of physics allows us ''a priori'' to eliminate from physical science all [[Essentialism|essentialist]] explanations. If they have a mathematical and predictive content they may be admitted ''qua'' mathematical hypotheses (while their essentialist interpretation is eliminated). If not they may be ruled out altogether. This razor is sharper than Ockham's: ALL entities are ruled out except those which are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', New York: Routledge, 2002, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Philosophy of mathematics ===
In addition to his contributions to philosophy, Berkeley was also very influential in the development of [[mathematics]], although in a rather indirect sense. "Berkeley was concerned with mathematics and its philosophical interpretation from the earliest stages of his intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Douglas M. Jesseph| editor= Kenneth P. Winkler |title= The Cambridge Companion to Berkeley |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |chapter= Berkeley's philosophy of mathematics|page= 266 |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-0-521-45033-1 |url= https://www.google.com/books?id=ER3vQcE1v9AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_slider_thumb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berkeley's "Philosophical Commentaries" (1707â1708) witness to his interest in mathematics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Axiom. No reasoning about things whereof we have no idea. Therefore no reasoning about Infinitesimals. (#354)

Take away the signs from Arithmetic &amp; Algebra, &amp; pray what remains? (#767)
These are sciences purely Verbal, &amp; entirely useless but for Practise in Societys of Men. No speculative knowledge, no comparison of Ideas in them. (#768)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1707, Berkeley published two treatises on mathematics. In 1734, he published ''[[The Analyst]]'', subtitled ''A DISCOURSE Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician'', a critique of [[calculus]]. [[Florian Cajori]] called this treatise "the most spectacular event of the century in the history of British mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= [[Florian Cajori]] |title= A History of the Conceptions of Limits and Fluxions in Great Britain, from Newton to Woodhouse  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3YAVRAAACAAJ&amp;dq=cajori+%22history+of+the+conceptions+of+limits%22 |publisher= BiblioBazaar |location= |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-1-143-05698-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent study suggests that Berkeley misunderstood Leibnizian calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

''The Analyst'' represented a direct attack on the foundations and principles of [[calculus]] and, in particular, the notion of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxion]] or [[infinitesimal]] change, which Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] used to develop the calculus. In his critique, Berkeley coined the phrase "[[ghosts of departed quantities]]", familiar to students of calculus. [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]]'s book [[From Here to Infinity (book)|''From Here to Infinity'']] captures the gist of his criticism.

Berkeley regarded his criticism of calculus as part of his broader campaign against the religious implications of Newtonian mechanics{{spaced ndash}}as a defence of traditional Christianity against [[deism]], which tends to distance God from His worshipers. Specifically, he observed that both Newtonian and Leibnizian calculus employed infinitesimals sometimes as positive, nonzero quantities and other times as a number explicitly equal to zero. Berkeley's key point in "The Analyst" was that Newton's calculus (and the laws of motion based in calculus) lacked rigorous theoretical foundations. He claimed that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In every other Science Men prove their Conclusions by their Principles, and not their Principles by the Conclusions. But if in yours you should allow your selves this unnatural way of proceeding, the Consequence would be that you must take up with Induction, and bid adieu to Demonstration. And if you submit to this, your Authority will no longer lead the way in Points of Reason and Science.&lt;ref&gt;The Analyst, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E. The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. London: Thomas Nelson and Son Ltd., 1948â1957, 4:76&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berkeley did not doubt that calculus produced real world truth; simple physics experiments could verify that Newton's method did what it claimed to do. "The cause of Fluxions cannot be defended by reason",&lt;ref&gt;Defence of Free-Thinking in Mathematics, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E. The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. London: Thomas Nelson and Son Ltd., 1948â1957, 4:113&lt;/ref&gt; but the results could be defended by empirical observation, Berkeley's preferred method of acquiring knowledge at any rate. Berkeley, however, found it paradoxical that "Mathematicians should deduce true Propositions from false Principles, be right in Conclusion, and yet err in the Premises." In ''The Analyst'' he endeavoured to show "how Error may bring forth Truth, though it cannot bring forth Science".&lt;ref&gt;The Analyst, in Berkeley, George, and Jessop, T.E. The Works of George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne. London: Thomas Nelson and Son Ltd., 1948â1957, 4:77&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's science, therefore, could not on purely scientific grounds justify its conclusions, and the mechanical, deistic model of the universe could not be rationally justified.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Geoffrey. "Berkeley's The Analyst Revisited". ''Isis'', Vol. 75, No. 4 (Dec. 1984), pp. 668â683. {{JSTOR|232412}}. {{doi|10.1086/353648}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties raised by Berkeley were still present in the work of [[Cauchy]] whose approach to calculus was a combination of infinitesimals and a notion of limit, and were eventually sidestepped by [[Weierstrass]] by means of his [[(Îµ, Î´)-definition of limit|(Îµ, Î´)]] approach, which eliminated infinitesimals altogether.  More recently, [[Abraham Robinson]] restored infinitesimal methods in his 1966 book ''[[Non-standard analysis]]'' by showing that they can be used rigorously.

=== Moral philosophy ===
{{See also|Passive obedience}}

The tract ''A Discourse on Passive Obedience'' (1712) is considered Berkeley's major contribution to moral and political philosophy.

In ''A Discourse on Passive Obedience'', Berkeley defends the thesis that people have "a moral duty to observe the negative precepts (prohibitions) of the law, including the duty not to resist the execution of punishment."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;HÃ¤yry, Matti. "[http://berkeleystudies.philosophy.fsu.edu/content/download/95864/978821/file/BS_023 ''Passive Obedience'' and Berkeley's Moral Philosophy]." Berkeley Studies 23 (2012): 3â13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Berkeley does make exceptions to this sweeping moral statement, stating that we need not observe precepts of "usurpers or even madmen"&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, George. Passive Obedience: Or, the Christian Doctrine of Not Resisting the Supreme Power, Proved and Vindicated ... In a Discourse Deliver'd at the College-chapel. By George Berkeley, M.A. Fellow of Trinity-College, Dublin. London: Printed for H. Clements, 1712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority.

Berkeley defends this thesis with a deductive proof stemming from the laws of nature. First, he establishes that because God is perfectly good, the end to which he commands humans must also be good, and that end must not benefit just one person, but the entire human race. Because these commandsâor lawsâif practiced, would lead to the general fitness of humankind, it follows that they can be discovered by the right reasonâfor example, the law to never resist supreme power can be derived from reason because this law is "the only thing that stands between us and total disorder".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, these laws can be called the [[Natural law|laws of nature]], because they are derived from Godâthe creator of nature himself. "These laws of nature include duties never to resist the supreme power, lie under oath...or do evil so that good may come of it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One may view Berkeleyâs doctrine on Passive Obedience as a kind of 'Theological Utilitarianism', insofar as it states that we have a duty to uphold a moral code which presumably is working towards the ends of promoting the good of humankind. However, the concept of 'ordinary' Utilitarianism is fundamentally different in that it "makes utility the one and only ''ground'' of obligation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/broad/berkeley.html|title=Berkeley's Theory of Morals|website=www.ditext.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;âthat is, Utilitarianism is concerned with whether particular actions are morally permissible in specific situations, while Berkeleyâs doctrine is concerned with whether or not we should follow moral rules in any and all circumstances. Whereas Utilitarianism might, for example, justify a morally impermissible act in light of the specific situation, Berkeleyâs doctrine of Passive Obedience holds that it is never morally permissible to not follow a moral rule, even when it seems like breaking that moral rule might achieve the happiest ends. Berkeley holds that even though sometimes, the consequences of an action in a specific situation might be bad, the general tendencies of that action benefits humanity.

Other important sources for Berkeley's views on morality are ''[[Alciphron (book)|Alciphron]]'' (1732), especially dialogues IâIII, and the ''Discourse to Magistrates'' (1738)."&lt;ref&gt;Jakapi, Roomet. "Was Berkeley a [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]]?" // Lemetti, Juhana and PiirimÃ¤e, Eva, eds. Human Nature as the Basis of Morality and Society in Early Modern Philosophy. [[Acta Philosophica Fennica]] 83. Helsinki: Philosophical Society of Finland, 2007. â P. 53. (The article contains extensive cover of literature on the topic from [[Alexander Campbell Fraser]] to up-to-date investigations including [[Matti HÃ¤yry]]'s article on Berkeley's ethics.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passive Obedience'' is notable partly for containing one of the earliest statements of [[rule utilitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Brad Hooker|Hooker, Brad]].

=== Immaterialism ===
George Berkeleyâs theory that matter does not exist comes from the belief that "sensible things are those only which are immediately perceived by sense."&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, George, and Howard Robinson. Principles of Human Knowledge and Three Dialogues. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley says in his book called The Principles of Human Knowledge that âthe ideas of sense are stronger, livelier, and clearer than those of the imagination; and they are also steady, orderly and coherentâ (Berkeley 18). From this we can tell that the things that we are perceiving are truly real rather than it just being a dream.

All knowledge comes from perception; what we perceive are ideas, not things in themselves; a thing in itself must be outside experience; so the world only consists of ideas and minds that perceive those ideas; a thing only exists so far as it perceives or is perceived.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Buckingham, Will.âTo Be Is To Be Perceived.â The Philosophy Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained, DK Publishing, New York, NY, 2011, pp. 138â141.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this we can see that consciousness is considered something that exists to Berkeley due to its ability to perceive. "'To be,' said of the object, means to be perceived; 'to be,' said of the subject, means to perceive or "esse est percipi." "&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. âGeorge Berkeley.â EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc., 6 Feb. 2012, http://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Berkeley. Accessed 15 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Berkeleyâs ideas were somewhat controversial due to his argument's refuting [[RenÃ© Descartes|Descartes]]' worldview, which was expanded upon by Locke, and the rejection of Berkeleyâs form of empiricism by several philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In Lockeâs worldview, "the world causes the perceptual ideas we have of it by the way it interacts with our senses."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This contradicts with Berkeley's worldview because not only does it suggest the existence of physical causes in the world, but in fact there is no physical world beyond our ideas. The only causes that exist in Berkeleyâs worldview are those that are a result of the use of the will.

Berkeleyâs theory relies heavily on his form of [[empiricism]], which in turn relies heavily on the senses. His empiricism can be defined by five propositions: all significant words stand for ideas; all knowledge about our ideas; all ideas come from without or from within; if from without it must be by the senses, and they are called sensations, if from within they are the operations of the mind, and are called thoughts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Urmson, J. O., et al. âThe Attack on Matter.â British Empiricists, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992, pp. 106â124.&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley clarifies his distinction between ideas by saying they "are imprinted on the senses," "perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind," or "are formed by help of memory and imagination."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One refutation of his idea was: if someone leaves a room and stops perceiving that room does that room no longer exist? Berkeley answers this by claiming that it is still being perceived and the consciousness that is doing the perceiving is [[God]]. This claim is the only thing holding up his argument which is "depending for our knowledge of the world, and of the existence of other minds, upon a God that would never deceive us."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Berkeleyâs argument hinges upon an [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]] deity.

Berkeley's ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' was published three years before the publication of [[Arthur Collier]]'s ''[[Clavis Universalis]]'', which made assertions similar to those of Berkeley's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year= 1852  |author= Reid T.  |authorlink=  Thomas Reid |author2= Ed. by William Hamilton |title= The Works of Thomas Reid, now fully collected  |place= [[Edinburgh]] |publisher= Maclachlan and Stewart |isbn= |url= https://archive.org/details/worksofthomasrei00reiduoft |accessdate= 1 December 2010 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;see: "Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man" II:X }}, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seemed to have been no influence or communication between the two writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] once wrote of him: "Berkeley was, therefore, the first to treat the subjective starting-point really seriously and to demonstrate irrefutably its absolute necessity. He is the father of [[idealism]]...".&lt;ref name = "Schopenhauer"&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," Â§ 12&lt;/ref&gt;

George Berkeley has gone down in the handbooks as a great spokesman of British [[empiricism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mind.ucsd.edu/ Rick Grush] syllabus [http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/99_00/Empiricism/!syllabus.html Empiricism (J. Locke, G. Berkeley, D. Hume)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115110100/http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/99_00/Empiricism/!syllabus.html |date=15 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, every student of the history of philosophy is familiar with the view that there was a sort of linear development involving three great "British Empiricists", leading from Locke through Berkeley to Hume.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Charles J. and Tipton, Ian, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=TFa7nRdaMIYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Berkeley's Principles and Dialogues: Background Source Materials].

Berkeley influenced many [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]], especially [[David Hume]]. [[Thomas Reid]] admitted that he put forward a drastic criticism of Berkeleianism after he had been an admirer of Berkeley's philosophical system for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Reid T.

When Berkeley visited America, the American educator [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] visited him, and the two later corresponded. Johnson convinced Berkeley to establish a scholarship program at Yale, and to donate a large number of books as well as his plantation to the college when the philosopher returned to England. It was one of Yale's largest and most important donations; it doubled its library holdings, improved the college's financial position and brought Anglican religious ideas and English culture into New England.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, J. David, ''Creating the American Mind: Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0742548398}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson also took Berkeley's philosophy and used parts of it as a framework for his own American Practical Idealism school of philosophy.  As Johnson's philosophy was taught to about half the graduates of American colleges between 1743 and 1776,&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress, Nonagram Publications, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}}, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; and over half of the contributors to the ''Declaration of Independence ''were connected to it,&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress,'' Nonagram Publications, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}}, p.299&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's ideas were indirectly a foundation of the American Mind.

Outside of America, during Berkeley's lifetime his philosophical ideas were comparatively uninfluential.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The proportion of Berkeley scholarship, in literature on the history of philosophy, is increasing. This can be judged from the most comprehensive bibliographies on George Berkeley. During the period of 1709â1932, about 300 writings on Berkeley were published. That amounted to 1.5 publication per annum. During the course of 1932â79, over one thousand works were brought out, i.e., 20 works per annum. Since then, the number of publications has reached 30 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;See:

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 publication began in Ireland of a special journal on Berkeley's life and thought (''[[Berkeley Studies]]'').

Other than philosophy, Berkeley also influenced modern psychology with his work on John Locke's theory of association and how it could be used to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world. He also used the theory to explain perception, stating that all qualities where, as Locke would call them, ''secondary qualities'' therefore perception laid entirely in the perceiver and not in the object. These are both topics today studied in modern psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Modern Psychology (ninth edition)|last=Schultz|first=Duane P.|publisher=Thomas Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-09799-0|location=Belmont, CA 94002-3098|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemoration ==
The [[University of California, Berkeley]], was named after him, although the pronunciation has evolved to suit [[American English]]: ({{IPAc-en|Ë|b|ÉËr|k|l|i}} {{respell|BURK|lee}}). The naming was suggested in 1866 by Frederick Billings, a trustee of the then [[College of California]]. Billings was inspired by Berkeley's ''Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America'', particularly the final stanza: "Westward the course of empire takes its way; The first four Acts already past, A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Is Berkeley Called Berkeley?|url=http://www.berkeleyhistoricalsociety.org/history-notes/bishop-george-berkeley.html|website=Berkeley Historical Society|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 April 1735, The Town of [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]], currently the least populated town in [[Bristol County, Massachusetts]], was founded and named after the renowned philosopher. Located 40 miles south of Boston and 25 miles north of Middletown (Rhode Island), where Berkeley lived at his farmhouse, [[Whitehall Museum House]] remains today to commemorate the farmhouse modified by Dean George Berkeley when he lived in the northern section of [[Newport, Rhode Island]] (that comprises present-day [[Middletown, Rhode Island]]) in 1729â31, while working to open his planned St Paul's College on the island of Bermuda. It is also known as Berkeley House (or Bishop George Berkeley House), and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.[1]

A [[Berkeley College (Yale)|residential college]] and an [[Berkeley Divinity School|Episcopal seminary]] at [[Yale University]] also bear Berkeley's name, as does the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Berkeley Library]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

Also named for him is Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida.  This leading private school is affiliated with the Episcopal Church, has almost 1300 students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade, and was founded in 1960.

An Ulster History Circle blue plaque commemorating him is located in Bishop Street Within, city of Derry.

"Bishop Berkeley's Gold Medals" are two awards given annually at [[Trinity College Dublin]], "provided outstanding merit is shown", to candidates answering a special examination in Greek. The awards were founded in 1752 by Berkeley who was a Fellow in 1707â24.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tcd.ie/calendar/undergraduate-studies/prizes-and-other-awards.pdf Prizes and Other Awards], ''Trinity College Dublin â Calendar 2016â17'', p. 369. Retrieved 16 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veneration ===
Berkeley is honoured together with [[Joseph Butler]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on 16 June.

'''Harry Nyquist''' (born '''Harry Theodor Nyqvist''' {{IPAc-en|Ë|n|aÉª|k|w|Éª|s|t}}, {{IPA-sv|Â²nyËkvÉªst|lang}}; February 7, 1889 â April 4, 1976) was a Swedish-born American [[electronic engineer]] who made important contributions to [[communication theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Harry Nyquist|journal=Physics Today|date=June 1976|volume=29|issue=6|pages=64|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v29/i6/p64_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.3023534}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nyquist was born in the village Nilsby of the parish [[Stora Kil]] 
, [[VÃ¤rmland]], [[Sweden]]. He was the son of Lars Jonsson Nyqvist (b. 1847) and  Katrina Eriksdotter (b. 1857). His parents had eight children: Elin Teresia, Astrid, Selma, Harry Theodor, Amelie, Olga Maria, Axel Martin and Herta Alfrida.&lt;ref&gt;"Sveriges befolkning 1900" [CD-ROM]: Nyqvist, Harry&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the [[United States|USA]] in 1907.

==Education==

He entered the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1912 and received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1914 and 1915, respectively. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics at [[Yale University]] in 1917.

==Career==
He worked at [[AT&amp;T Corp.|AT&amp;T]]'s Department of Development and Research from 1917 to 1934, and continued when it became [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] that year, until his retirement in 1954.

Nyquist received the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|IRE Medal of Honor]] in 1960 for "fundamental contributions to a quantitative understanding of thermal noise, data transmission and negative feedback."  
In October 1960 he was awarded the [[Stuart Ballantine Medal]] of the [[Franklin Institute]] "for his theoretical analyses and practical inventions in the field of communications systems during the past forty years including, particularly, his original work in the theories of telegraph transmission, thermal noise in electric conductors, and in the history of feedback systems." 
In 1969 he was awarded the [[National Academy of Engineering]]'s fourth Founder's Medal "in recognition of his many fundamental contributions to engineering."
In 1975 Nyquist received together with [[Hendrik Bode]] the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]] from the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyquist lived in [[Pharr, Texas]] after his retirement, and died in [[Harlingen, Texas]] on April 4, 1976.

== Technical contributions==
[[File:UND Nyquist Memorial.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Harry Nyquist at the University of North Dakota's College of Engineering and Mines]]As an engineer at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise ("[[JohnsonâNyquist noise]]"),&lt;ref&gt;H. Nyquist, "Thermal Agitation of Electric Charge in Conductors", Phys. Rev., Vol. 32, pp. 110â113, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; the stability of [[feedback]] [[amplifier]]s, telegraphy, [[fax|facsimile]], television, and other important communications problems.  With [[Herbert E. Ives]], he helped to develop AT&amp;T's first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classic paper on stability of feedback amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nyquist, "Regeneration theory", Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 11, pp. 126â147, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nyquist stability criterion]] can now be found in all textbooks on feedback control theory.

His early theoretical work on determining the bandwidth requirements for transmitting information laid the foundations for later advances by [[Claude Shannon]], which led to the development of [[information theory]].  In particular, Nyquist determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through a telegraph channel per unit time is limited to twice the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the channel, and published his results in the papers ''Certain factors affecting telegraph speed'' (1924)&lt;ref&gt;Nyquist, Harry. "Certain factors affecting telegraph speed". ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'', 3, 324â346, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Certain topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;Nyquist, Harry. "Certain topics in telegraph transmission theory", Trans. AIEE, vol. 47, pp.&amp;nbsp;617â644, Apr. 1928 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060706192816/http://www.loe.ee.upatras.gr/Comes/Notes/Nyquist.pdf Reprint as classic paper in: ''Proc. IEEE, Vol. 90, No. 2, Feb 2002''].&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule is essentially a [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of what is now known as the [[NyquistâShannon sampling theorem]].

==Terms named for Harry Nyquist==
* [[Nyquist rate]]: sampling rate twice the bandwidth of the signal's waveform being sampled; sampling faster than this rate assures that the waveform can be reconstructed accurately.
* [[Nyquist frequency]]: half the sample rate of a system; signal frequencies below this value are unambiguously represented.
* [[Nyquist filter]]
* [[Nyquist plot]]
* [[Nyquist ISI criterion]]
* [[Nyquist (programming language)]]
* [[Nyquist stability criterion]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10230">The '''HeathâJarrowâMorton (HJM) framework''' is a general framework to model the evolution of [[interest rate]] curves&amp;nbsp;â instantaneous [[forward curve|forward rate curves]] in particular (as opposed to simple [[forward rate]]s). When the volatility and drift of the instantaneous forward rate are assumed to be [[deterministic]], this is known as the '''Gaussian HeathâJarrowâMorton (HJM) model''' of forward rates.&lt;ref&gt;M. Musiela, M. Rutkowski: Martingale Methods in Financial Modelling. 2nd ed. New York : Springer-Verlag, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|394}}  For direct modeling of simple forward rates the [[LIBOR market model|BraceâGatarekâMusiela model]] represents an example.

The HJM framework originates from the work of [[David Heath (probabilist)|David Heath]], [[Robert A. Jarrow]], and [[Andrew Morton (economist)|Andrew Morton]] in the late 1980s, especially ''Bond pricing and the term structure of interest rates: a new methodology'' (1987)&amp;nbsp;â working paper, [[Cornell University]], and ''Bond pricing and the term structure of interest rates: a new methodology'' (1989)&amp;nbsp;â working paper (revised ed.), Cornell University. It has its critics, however, with [[Paul Wilmott]] describing it as "...actually just a big rug for [mistakes] to be swept under".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/one-math-geeks-plan-reform-wall-street-80135 One math geek's plan to reform Wall Street, Newsweek, May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/28/revenge-of-the-nerd.html ''Newsweek'' 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework==
The key to these techniques is the recognition that the drifts of the [[rational pricing|no-arbitrage]] evolution of certain variables can be expressed as functions of their volatilities and the correlations among themselves.  In other words, no drift estimation is needed.

Models developed according to the HJM framework are different from the so-called [[short-rate model]]s in the sense that HJM-type models capture the full dynamics of the entire [[forward curve|forward rate curve]], while the short-rate models only capture the dynamics of a point on the curve (the short rate).

However, models developed according to the general HJM framework are often non-[[Markov property|Markovian]] and can even have infinite dimensions.  A number of researchers have made great contributions to tackle this problem.  They show that if the volatility structure of the forward rates satisfy certain conditions, then an HJM model can be expressed entirely by a finite state Markovian system, making it computationally feasible. Examples include a one-factor, two state model (O. Cheyette, "Term Structure Dynamics and Mortgage Valuation", ''Journal of Fixed Income,'' 1, 1992; P. Ritchken and L. Sankarasubramanian in "Volatility Structures of Forward Rates and the Dynamics of Term Structure", ''Mathematical Finance'', 5, No. 1, Jan 1995), and later multi-factor versions.

==Mathematical formulation==

The class of models developed by Heath, Jarrow and Morton (1992) is based on modelling the forward rates, yet it does not capture all of the complexities of an evolving term structure.

The model begins by introducing the instantaneous forward rate &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(t,T)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t \leq T&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined as the continuous compounding rate available at time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; as seen from time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t&lt;/math&gt;. The relation between bond prices and the forward rate is also provided in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t,T) = e^{-\int_t^T f(t,s) ds}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(t,T)&lt;/math&gt; is the price at time &lt;math&gt;\textstyle t&lt;/math&gt; of a zero-coupon bond paying $1 at maturity &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T\geq t&lt;/math&gt;. The risk-free money market account is also defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\beta(t) = e^{\int_0^t f(u,u)du}&lt;/math&gt;

This last equation lets us define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(t,t) \triangleq r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the risk free short rate. The HJM framework assumes that the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; under a risk-neutral pricing measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;df(t,s) = \mu(t,s)dt + \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s) dW_t&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle W_t&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\textstyle d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Wiener process]] and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mu(u,s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \boldsymbol \sigma(u,s)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathcal F_u&lt;/math&gt; [[adapted process]]es. Now based on these dynamics for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt;, we'll attempt to find the dynamics for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(t,s)&lt;/math&gt; and find the conditions that need to be satisfied under risk-neutral pricing rules. Let's define the following process:

:&lt;math&gt;Y_t \triangleq \log P(t,s) = -\int_t^s f(t,u) du&lt;/math&gt;

The dynamics of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Y_t&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained through [[Leibniz integral rule|Leibniz's rule]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} dY_t &amp;= f(t,t) dt - \int_t^s df(t,u) du \\ &amp;= r_t dt - \int_t^s \mu(t,u) dt du - \int_t^s \boldsymbol \sigma(t,u) dW_t du \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If we define &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mu(t,s)^* = \int_t^s \mu(t,u) du&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^* = \int_t^s \boldsymbol \sigma(t,u) du&lt;/math&gt; and assume that the conditions for [[Fubini's Theorem]] are satisfied in the formula for the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Y_t&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

:&lt;math&gt; dY_t = \left(  r_t - \mu(t,s)^* \right)dt - \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^* dW_t &lt;/math&gt;

By [[ItÅ's lemma]], the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P(t,T)&lt;/math&gt; are then:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP(t,s)}{P(t,s)} = \left( r_t - \mu(t,s)^* + \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^* \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^{*T} \right)dt - \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^* dW_t&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{P(t,s)}{\beta(t)}&lt;/math&gt; must be a martingale under the pricing measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt;, so we require that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle  \mu(t,s)^* = \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^* \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^{*T} &lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this with respect to &lt;math&gt;\textstyle s&lt;/math&gt;. we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu(t,u) = \boldsymbol \sigma(t,u) \int_t^u \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^{T} ds&lt;/math&gt;

Which finally tells us that the dynamics of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt; must be of the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;df(t,u) =  \left( \boldsymbol \sigma(t,u) \int_t^u \boldsymbol \sigma(t,s)^{T} ds \right) dt + \boldsymbol \sigma(t,u) dW_t&lt;/math&gt;

Which allows us to price bonds and interest rate derivatives based on our choice of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \boldsymbol \sigma &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">In [[Boolean logic]], the term '''implicant''' has either a generic or a particular meaning.  In the generic use, it refers to the hypothesis of an implication ([[wiktionary:implicant]]).  In the particular use, it refers to specific instance of this generic meaning, which occurs relative to a formula that is either a sum of products or a product of sums, as explained further bolow..

It its particular use, an '''implicant''' is a "covering" (sum term or product term) of one or more [[minterm]]s in a [[sum of products]] (or maxterms in product of sums) of a Boolean function. Formally, a [[product term]] ''P'' in a [[sum of products]] is an '''implicant''' of the [[Boolean function]] ''F'' if ''P'' [[Logical implication|implies]] ''F''. More precisely:

: ''P'' implies ''F'' (and thus is an implicant of ''F'') if ''F'' also takes the value 1 whenever ''P'' equals 1.
where
* ''F'' is a [[Boolean function]] of ''n'' variables.
* ''P'' is a [[product term]].

This means that ''P'' &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; ''F'' with respect to the natural ordering of the Boolean space. For instance, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z,w)=xy+yz+w&lt;/math&gt;

is implied by &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;xyz&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;xyzw&lt;/math&gt;, by &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and many others; these are the implicants of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== {{anchor|Essential prime implicant}}Prime implicant ==&lt;!-- Section header "Prime implicant" used by redirects --&gt;
A '''prime implicant''' of a function is an implicant that cannot be covered by a more general, (more reduced - meaning with fewer [[literal (computer programming)|literal]]s) implicant. [[W.&amp;nbsp;V. Quine]] defined a ''prime implicant'' of ''F'' to be an implicant that is minimal - that is, the removal of any literal from ''P'' results in a non-implicant for ''F''.  '''Essential prime implicants''' (aka '''core prime implicants''') are prime implicants that cover an output of the function that no combination of other prime implicants is able to cover.

Using the example above, one can easily see that while &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; (and others) is a prime implicant, &lt;math&gt;xyz&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;xyzw&lt;/math&gt; are not. From the latter, multiple literals can be removed to make it prime:

*&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; can be removed, yielding &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.
*Alternatively, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; can be removed, yielding &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;.
*Finally, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; can be removed, yielding &lt;math&gt;yz&lt;/math&gt;.

The process of removing literals from a Boolean term is called '''expanding''' the term. Expanding by one literal doubles the number of input combinations for which the term is true (in binary Boolean algebra). Using the example function above, we may expand &lt;math&gt;xyz&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; or to &lt;math&gt;yz&lt;/math&gt; without changing the cover of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;De Micheli, Giovanni. ''Synthesis and Optimization of Digital Circuits''. McGraw-Hill, Inc.,  1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of all prime implicants of a Boolean function is called its '''complete sum''', '''minimal covering sum''', or  [[Blake canonical form]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">An '''indeterminate system''' is a system of [[simultaneous equations]] (especially [[linear equation]]s) which has more than one solution. The system may be said to be '''underspecified'''. If the system is linear, then the presence of more than one solution implies that there are an infinite number of solutions, but that property does not extend to [[nonlinear systems]].

An indeterminate system is [[consistent and inconsistent equations|consistent]], the latter implying that there exists at least one solution. For a system of linear equations, the number of equations in an indeterminate system could be the same as the number of unknowns, less than the number of unknowns (an [[underdetermined system]]), or greater than the number of unknowns (an [[overdetermined system]]). Conversely, any of those three cases may or may not be indeterminate.

==Examples==

The following examples of indeterminate systems have respectively fewer, the same, and more equations than unknowns:

:&lt;math&gt;x+y=2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+y=2, \,\,\,\,\, 2x+2y=4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+y=2, \,\,\,\,\, 2x+2y=4, \,\,\,\,\, 3x+3y=6&lt;/math&gt;

==Conditions giving rise to indeterminacy==

In linear systems, indeterminacy occurs [[if and only if]] the number of [[independent equation]]s (the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the [[augmented matrix]] of the system) is less than the number of unknowns and is the same as the rank of the [[coefficient matrix]]. For if there are at least as many independent equations as unknowns that will eliminate any stretches of overlap of the equations' surfaces in the geometric space of the unknowns (aside from possibly a single point), so there cannot be more than one solution; and if the rank of the augmented matrix exceeds (necessarily by one if at all) the rank of the coefficient matrix then the equations jointly contradict each other, so there are no solutions.

==Finding the solution set of an indeterminate linear system==

Let the system of equations be written in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form as 

:&lt;math&gt;Ax=b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the ''m''Ã''n'' coefficient matrix, ''x'' is the ''n''Ã1 [[Vector space|vector]] of unknowns, and ''b'' is an ''m''Ã1 vector of constants. Then if the system is indeterminate, the infinite solution set is the set of all ''x'' vectors generated by&lt;ref name=James&gt;James, M., "The generalised inverse", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 62, June 1978, 109â114.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x=A^+b + [I_n-A^+A]w&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^+&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]] of ''A'' and ''w'' is any ''n''Ã1 vector.

In [[mathematical analysis]], '''initialization of the differintegrals''' is a topic in [[fractional calculus]].

==Composition rule of differintegral==

A certain counterintuitive property of the [[differintegral]] operator should be pointed out, namely the [[Differintegral#Basic formal properties|composition law]]. Although

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q\mathbb{D}^{-q} = \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;

wherein ''D''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is the left [[Inverse function|inverse]] of ''D&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'', the converse is not necessarily true:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^{-q}\mathbb{D}^q \neq \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===

It is instructive to consider elementary integer-order [[calculus]] to see what's happening. First, integrate then differentiate, using the example function 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}\left[\int (3x^2+1)dx\right] = \frac{d}{dx}[x^3+x+c] = 3x^2+1\,,&lt;/math&gt;

on exchanging the order of composition:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left[\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2+1)\right] = \int 6x \,dx = 3x^2+c\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which the [[constant of integration]] is ''c''. Even if it wasn't obvious, the [[initialization terms]]&lt;!---WHAT ARE "INITIALIZED TERMS"?? THE SAME AS INITIAL CONDITIONS??? FOR CRYING OUT LOUD...---&gt; ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', ''Æ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''d'', etc. could be used. If we neglected those initialization terms, the last equation would show the composition of integration then differentiation (and vice versa) would not hold.

==Description of initialization==

This is the problem that with the differintegral.  If the differintegral is initialized properly, then the hoped-for composition law holds.  The problem is that in differentiation, we lose information, as we lost the ''c'' in the first equation.

In fractional calculus, however, since the operator has been fractionalized and is thus continuous, an entire '''complementary function''' is needed, not just a constant or set of constants.  We call this complementary function &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^q_t f(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(n-q)}\frac{d^n}{dt^n}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{n-q-1}f(\tau)\,d\tau + \Psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Working with a properly initialized differintegral is the subject of initialized fractional calculus.

'''MFCS''', the '''International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science''' is an [[academic conference]] organized annually since 1972. The topics of the conference cover the entire field of [[theoretical computer science]]. Up to 2012, the conference was held in different locations in [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], but since MFCS 2013, it travels around [[Europe]]. All contributions are strongly peer-reviewed. In 1974â2015, the articles appeared in proceedings published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] in the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] series. Beginning in 2016, the proceedings are instead published by the [[Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics]].




== Recent history of the symposium ==

Since 2012, the Steering Committee of the MFCS symposia series is chaired by [[AntonÃ­n KuÄera]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3401">'''Killing [[spinor]]''' is a term used in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].  By the more narrow definition, commonly used in mathematics, the term Killing spinor indicates those [[Twistor theory|twistor]]
spinors which are also [[eigenspinor]]s of the [[Dirac operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Der erste Eigenwert des Dirac Operators einer kompakten, Riemannschen Mannigfaltigkeit nichtnegativer SkalarkrÃ¼mmung|author=Th.

Another equivalent definition is that Killing spinors are the solutions to the [[Killing equation]] for a so-called Killing number.

:A '''Killing spinor''' on a  [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] [[Spin structure|spin]] [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[spinor field]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X\psi=\lambda X\cdot\psi&lt;/math&gt;

:for all [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] ''X'', where &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the spinor [[covariant derivative]], &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is [[Clifford multiplication]] and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, called the '''Killing number''' of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda=0&lt;/math&gt; then the spinor is called a parallel spinor.

In physics, Killing spinors are used in [[supergravity]] and [[superstring theory]], in particular for finding solutions which preserve some [[supersymmetry]].  They are a special kind of spinor field related to [[Killing vector field]]s and [[Killing tensor]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">[[Image:Skein (HOMFLY).svg|thumb|Many knot polynomials are computed using [[skein relations]], which allow one to change the different crossings of a knot to get simpler knots.]]

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[knot theory]], a '''knot polynomial''' is a [[knot invariant]] in the form of a [[polynomial]] whose coefficients encode some of the properties of a given [[knot (mathematics)|knot]].

==History==
The first knot polynomial, the [[Alexander polynomial]], was introduced by [[James Waddell Alexander II]] in 1923, but other knot polynomials were not found until almost 60 years later.

In the 1960s, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] came up with a [[skein relation]] for a version of the Alexander polynomial, usually referred to as the [[AlexanderâConway polynomial]].  The significance of this skein relation was not realized until the early 1980s, when [[Vaughan Jones]] discovered the [[Jones polynomial]].  This led to the discovery of more knot polynomials, such as the so-called [[HOMFLY polynomial]].

Soon after Jones' discovery, [[Louis Kauffman]] noticed the Jones polynomial could be computed by means of a [[state-sum model]], which involved the [[bracket polynomial]], an invariant of [[framing (knot)|framed]] knots.  This opened up avenues of research linking knot theory and [[statistical mechanics]].

In the late 1980s, two related breakthroughs were made.  [[Edward Witten]] demonstrated that the Jones polynomial, and similar Jones-type invariants, had an interpretation in [[ChernâSimons theory]].  [[Victor Anatolyevich Vasilyev|Viktor Vassiliev]] and [[Mikhail Goussarov]] started the theory of [[finite type invariant]]s of knots.  The coefficients of the previously named polynomials are known to be of finite type (after perhaps a suitable "change of variables").

In recent years, the Alexander polynomial has been shown to be related to [[Floer homology]].  The graded Euler characteristic of the [[Heegaard Floer homology|knot Floer homology]] of OzsvÃ¡th and SzabÃ³ is the Alexander polynomial.

[[Knot theory#Alexander.E2.80.93Briggs notation|AlexanderâBriggs notation]] is a notation that simply organizes knots by their crossing number.
The order of AlexanderâBriggs notation of [[prime knot]] is usually sured. (See [[List of prime knots]].)

Notice that [[Alexander polynomial]] and [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] can ''not'' recognize the difference of left-trefoil knot and right-trefoil knot.

In [[theoretical computer science]], the '''Krivine machine''' is an ''[[abstract machine]]'' (sometimes called ''[[virtual machine]]'').  As an abstract machine, it shares features with [[Turing machine]]s and the [[SECD machine]]. The Krivine machine explains how to compute a recursive function.  More specifically it aims to define rigorously [[head normal form]] reduction of a [[Lambda calculus|lambda term]] using [[call-by-name]] reduction.  Thanks to its formalism, it tells in details how a kind of reduction works and sets the theoretical foundation of the [[operational semantics]] of [[functional programming language]]s.  On the other hand, Krivine machine implements call-by-name because it evaluates the body of a Î²-[[reducible expression|redex]] before it evaluates its parameter. In other words, in an expression (''Î»'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u'' it evaluates first ''Î»'' ''x''. ''t'' before evaluating ''u''. In [[functional programming]], this would mean that in order to evaluate a function applied to a parameter, it evaluates first the function before evaluating the parameter.

The Krivine machine has been designed by the French logician [[:fr:Jean-Louis Krivine|Jean-Louis Krivine]] at the beginning of the 1980s.

== Call by name and head normal form reduction ==
{{more|lambda-calculus}}

The Krivine machine is based on two concepts related to [[lambda calculus]], namely head reduction and call by name.

&lt;/ref&gt; (one says also Î²-redex) is a term of the lambda calculus of the form (''Î»'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''.   If a term has the shape (''Î»'' ''x''. ''t'') ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; it is said to be a ''head redex''.  A ''[[Beta normal form|head normal form]]''  is a term of the lambda calculus which is not a  head redex{{efn|If one deals only with closed terms, that terms has the form ''Î»'' ''x''. ''t''.}}  A ''head reduction'' is a (non empty) sequence of contractions of a term which contracts head redexes.  A head reduction of a term ''t'' (which is supposed not to be in head normal form) is a head reduction which starts from  a term ''t'' and ends on a head normal form.  From an abstract point of view, head reduction is the way a program computes when it evaluates a recursive sub-program. To understand how such a reduction can be implemented is important.  One of the aims of the Krivine machine is to propose a process to reduct a term in head normal form and to describe formally this process.  Like [[Alan Turing|Turing]] used an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of algorithm, [[:fr: Jean-Louis Krivine|Krivine]] used  an abstract machine to describe formally the notion of head normal form reduction.

==== An example ====
The term ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0) (which corresponds, if one uses explicit variables, to the term (''Î»x''.''x'') (''Î»y''.''y'') (''Î»z''.''z''))  is not in head normal form because (''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0) contracts in (''Î»'' 0) yielding the head redex (''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0) which contracts in (''Î»'' 0) and which is therefore the head normal form of ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0). Said otherwise the head normal form contraction is:
: ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0) â (''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0) â ''Î»'' 0,
which corresponds to :
: (''Î»x''.''x'') (''Î»y''.''y'') (''Î»z''.''z'') â (''Î»y''.''y'') (''Î»z''.''z'') â ''Î»z''.''z''.
We will see further how the Krivine machine reduces the term ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0).

=== [[Call-by-name|Call by name]] ===
To implement the head reduction of a term ''u v'' which is an application, but which is not a redex, one must reduce the body ''u'' to exhibit an abstraction and therefore create a redex with ''v''. When a redex appears, one reduces it.  To reduce always the body of an application first is called ''[[Call-by-name|call by name]]''.{{efn|This ancient terminology refers to concepts of the 60's and hardly justified in 2017.}} The Krivine machine implements ''call by name''.

== Description ==

The presentation of the Krivine machine given here is based on notations of lambda terms that use [[de Bruijn indices]] and assumes that the terms of which it computes the head normal forms are [[Lambda calculus definition#Free and bound variables|closed]].&lt;ref name="Curien"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Pierre-Louis 
| last1 = Curien
| title = Categorical Combinators, Sequential Algorithms and Functional
| publisher = BirkhaÃ¼ser
| year = 1993
| edition =  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; It modifies the current '''state''' until it cannot do it anymore, in which case it  obtains a head normal form.   This head normal form represents the result of the computation or yields an error, meaning that the term it started from is not correct.  However, it can enter an infinite sequence of transitions, which means that the term it attempts reducing has no head normal form and corresponds to a non terminating computation.

It has been proved that the Krivine machine implements correctly the call by name head normal form reduction in the lambda-calculus.  Moreover, the Krivine machine is [[Deterministic compilation|deterministic]], since each pattern of the state corresponds to at most one machine transition.

=== The state  ===
The state has three components&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt;
:# a '''term''',
:# a '''stack''', 
:# an '''environment'''.

The term is a  Î»-term with de Bruijn indices.  The stack and the environment belong to the same recursive data structure. More precisely, the environment and the  stack are lists of pairs ''&lt;term,&amp;nbsp;environment&gt;'', that are called ''closures''.  In what follows, the insertion as the head of a list â (stack or environment) of an element ''a'' is written ''a:â'', whereas the empty list is written â¡. The stack is the location where the machine stores the closures that must be evaluated furthermore, whereas the environment is the association between the indices and the closures at a given time during the evaluation. The first element of the environment is the closure associated with the index ''0'', the second element corresponds to the closure associated with index ''1'' etc. If the machine has to evaluate an index, it fetches there the pair ''&lt;term, environment&gt;'' the closure that yields the term to be evaluated and the environment in which this term must be evaluated.{{efn|Using the concept of closure, one may replace the triple ''&lt;term,stack, environment&gt;, which defines the state, by a couple ''&lt;closure,stack&gt;'', but this change is cosmetic.}} This intuitive explanations allow understanding the operating rules of the machine.  If one writes ''t'' for term, p for stack,{{efn|p is for ''pile'', the French word for stack, which we do not want to mix up with ''s'', for state.}} and e for environment, the states associated with these three entities will be written ''t'', p, e.  The rules explain how the machine transforms a state into another state, after identifying the patterns among the states.

The ''initial state'' aims to evaluate a term ''t'', it is the state  ''t'',â¡,â¡,  in which the term is ''t'' and the stack and the environment are empty. The ''final state'' (in absence of error) is of the form ''Î»&amp;nbsp;t'',&amp;nbsp;â¡,&amp;nbsp;e, in other words, the resulting terms is an abstraction together with its environment and an empty stack.

=== The transitions ===
The Krivine machine&lt;ref name="Curien" /&gt; has four transitions : '''''App''''', '''''Abs''''', '''''Zero''''', '''''Succ'''''.
{| class="wikitable center" style = "width:50%"
|+ Transitions of the Krivine machine
|-
! scope=col | Name
! scope=col | Before
! scope=col | After
|-
| width="20%" |
'''''App''''' 
| width="40%" |
''t u'', p, e
| width="40%" |
''t'', &lt;''u'',e&gt;:p, e
|-
|
'''''Abs'''''
|
''Î» t'', &lt;''u'',e'&gt;:p, e
| 
''t'', p, &lt;''u'',e'&gt;:e
|-
|
'''''Zero'''''
|
''0'', p, &lt;''t'', e'&gt;:e
|
''t'', p, e'
|-
|
'''''Succ'''''
|
''n+1'', p, &lt;''t,e'&gt;:e
|
n, p, e
|}

The transition '''''App''''' removes the parameter of an application and put it on the stack for  further evaluation.  The transition '''''Abs''''' removes the Î» of the term and pop up the closure from the top of the stack and put it on the top of the environment.  This closure corresponds to the de Bruijn index ''0'' in the new environment.  The transition '''''Zero''''' takes the first closure of the environment. The term of this closure becomes the current term and the environment of this closure becomes the current environment. The transition '''''Succ''''' removes the first closure of the environment list and decreases the value of the index.

=== Two examples ===
Let us evaluate the term (''Î»'' 0 0) (''Î»'' 0) which corresponds to the term (''Î»'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''Î»'' ''x''. ''x''). Let us start with the state (''Î»'' 0 0) (''Î»'' 0), â¡, â¡.

{|class="wikitable center" style= "width:30%"
|+ Evaluation of the  term ''(Î» 0 0) (Î» 0)''
|-
|
(''Î»'' 0 0) (''Î»'' 0), â¡, â¡
|-
|
''Î»'' 0 0, [&lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;], â¡
|-
|
0 0, â¡, [&lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;]
|-
|
0, [&lt;0, &lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;&gt;], [&lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;]
|-
|
''Î»'' 0, [&lt;0, &lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;&gt;], â¡
|-
|
0, â¡, [&lt;0, &lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;&gt;]
|-
|
0, â¡, [&lt;''Î»'' 0, â¡&gt;]
|-
|
''Î»'' 0'', â¡, â¡
|-
|}

The conclusion is that the head normal form of the term  (''Î»'' 0 0) (''Î»'' 0) is ''Î»'' 0. This translates with variables in: the head normal form of the term (''Î»'' ''x''. ''x'' ''x'') (''Î»'' ''x''. ''x'') is ''Î»'' ''x''. ''x''.

Let us evaluate the term ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0)

{|class="wikitable center" style="width:35%"
|+ Evaluation of ((Î» 0) (Î» 0)) (Î» 0)
|-
| ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0), â¡, â¡
|-
| (''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0), [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;], â¡
|-
| (''Î»'' 0), [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;,&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;], â¡
|-
| 0, [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;], [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;]
|-
| ''Î»'' 0, [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;],  â¡
|-
| 0, â¡, [&lt;(''Î»'' 0), â¡&gt;]
|-
| (''Î»'' 0), â¡, â¡
|-
|}
This confirms the above fact that the normal form of the term ((''Î»'' 0) (''Î»'' 0)) (''Î»'' 0) is (''Î»'' 0).

In [[geometric topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''lantern relation''' is a [[relation (group theory)|relation]] that appears between certain [[Dehn twist]]s in the [[mapping class group]] of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]].  The most general version of the relation involves seven Dehn twists. The relation was discovered by Dennis Johnson in 1979.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson|first= Dennis L. |year=1979 |title=Homeomorphisms of a surface which act trivially on homology |journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |publisher=American Mathematical Society |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=119&amp;ndash;125|jstor=2042686 |doi=10.2307/2042686|url=http://www.ams.org/proc/1979-075-01/S0002-9939-1979-0529227-4/S0002-9939-1979-0529227-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==General form==
The general form of the lantern relation involves seven Dehn twists in the mapping class group of a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] with three holes,&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stipsicz|first1= AndrÃ¡s |last2=ÃzbaÄci|first2= Burak |title=Surgery on contact 3-manifolds and Stein surfaces |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=3-540-22944-2 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the figure on the right.  According to the relation,
:{{bigmath|''D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;''}},
where {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the right-handed Dehn twists around the blue curves {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|''C''}}, and {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the right-handed Dehn twists around the four red curves.

Note that the Dehn twists {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on the right-hand side all [[Commutativity|commute]] (since the curves are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], so the order in which they appear does not matter.  However, the [[cyclic order]] of the three Dehn twists on the left does matter:
:{{bigmath|''D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.
Also, note that the equalities written above are actually equality up to [[homotopy]] or [[homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], as is usual in the mapping class group.

==General surfaces==
Though we have stated the lantern relation for a disk with three holes, the relation appears in the mapping class group of any surface in which such a disk can be [[embedding|embedded]] in a nontrivial way.  Depending on the setting, some of the Dehn twists appearing in the lantern relation may be homotopic to the [[identity function]], in which case the relation involves fewer than seven Dehn twists.

The lantern relation is used in several different presentations for the mapping class groups of surfaces.

'''Lateral computing''' is a [[lateral thinking]] approach to solving [[computing problem]]s.
Lateral thinking has been made popular by [[Edward de Bono]].&lt;ref name="DeBono90"&gt;{{cite book|first = E.|last = de Bono|year = 1990|title = Lateral Thinking for Management: A Handbook|publisher = Penguin Books|isbn = 0-07-094233-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This thinking technique is applied to generate creative ideas and solve problems. Similarly, by applying lateral-computing techniques to a problem, it can become much easier to arrive at a computationally inexpensive, easy to implement, efficient, innovative or unconventional solution.

The traditional or conventional approach to solving computing problems is to either build mathematical models or have an [[Conditional (computer programming)|IF- THEN -ELSE]] structure. For example, a [[brute-force search]] is used in many [[chess engine]]s,&lt;ref name="Hsu02"&gt;{{cite book|first =F. H.|last = Hsu|year=2002|title = Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer That Defeated the World Chess Champion|publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn =0-691-09065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes may arrive at poor solutions. It is for problems like this that lateral computing can be useful to form a better solution.

A simple problem of truck backup can be used for illustrating lateral-computing{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This is one of the difficult tasks for traditional computing techniques, and has been efficiently solved by the use of [[fuzzy logic]] (which is a lateral computing technique).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Lateral-computing sometimes arrives at a novel solution for particular computing problem by using the model of how living beings, such as how humans, ants, and honeybees, solve a problem; how pure crystals are formed by annealing, or evolution of living beings or quantum mechanics etc.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}

==Logical thinking and artificial intelligence==
[[Chess]] position analysis can be used to illustrate the logical thinking. The following board position describes a chess problem which has to be solved with two moves.
{{chess diagram

The white has several options to make a move and [[checkmate]] the black. The move Rd5 Ã Rd7 or Rf7 Ã Rd7 will immediately provide material advantage to white. There are similar moves which capture pieces and provide immediate material advantages to the white. But a knight move Nc6 which does not provide any material advantage, provides a solution for checkmate for black in two moves.
{|
|-
| ||..||Nc6|| ||
|-
|1||...||Kxf7||2||g8Q++

|-
|1||...||Rfxd5||2||Rf6++
|-
|1||...||Rdxf7||2||Rd6++
|-
|1||...||Rfxf7||2||Re5++
|}

This is an example which illustrates the use of logical thinking. The logical thinking in chess progresses by evaluating the immediate material gain in each move. This will result in a solution which will require more number of moves or failure to checkmate. However, the not so obvious move of knight results in a very powerful checkmate. Even though this move does not look logical, it is the solution to two-move checkmate problem. A [[chess computer|computer programmed to play chess]] might miss out some good opportunities if it does a material-based search to find moves. Several attempts have been made to build the powerful chess computers in history.&lt;ref name="Hsu02" /&gt; But these chess computers have been defeated by [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[List of chess grandmasters|human chess players]].

===Logic programming===
The attempts to use [[logic programming]] such as prolog{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} to represent knowledge and build artificial intelligent systems has not provided the anticipated thrust to solving interesting problems.&lt;ref name="Boden90"&gt;{{cite book|first=M. A.|last = Boden|year =1990|title= The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-824855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RusselNovig03"&gt;{{cite book|first1=S.|last1=Russell|first2=P.|last2=Norvig|year=2003|title= Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|publisher= Prentice Hall Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of generalization and learning capability of these systems and exponential growth of the [[Conditional (programming)|IF-THEN ELSE]] rules has made this approach unpopular. An example to illustrate{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} the failure of the rule-based system is the following flawed proof:
{| style="margin:auto;"
|-
|Start with 81/4 = 81/4
|-
|Adding -20 to LHS and RHS gives:&lt;br&gt;-20 + 81/4 = -20 + 81/4
|-
|Splitting â20 as ( -36 + 16 ) on the LHS and ( -45 + 25 ) on the RHS:&lt;br&gt;16 + 81/4 -36 = -45 + 81/4 +25
|-
|Now expressing the terms 16, 25 and 81/4 as squares of 4, 5 and 9/2 respectively:&lt;br&gt;4Â² + (9/2)Â² - 2 * (9/2) * 4 = 5Â² + (9/2)Â² â 2 * (9/2) * 5
|-
|Expressing this as aÂ² + bÂ² â 2*a*b = (a-b)Â² gives:&lt;br&gt;(4 - 9/2)Â² = (5 - 9/2)Â²
|-
|Taking the [[square root]]s,&lt;br&gt;4 - 9/2 = 5 â 9/2
|}
This would imply that 4 = 5, which a wrong result. While taking the [[square root]]s, the step of considering the signs has been missed. This has resulted in an absurd outcome. A rule-based system, even if it missed a simple rule in its database may yield such an unacceptable output.

Another interesting mathematical proof gone wrong is as follows:

:Let a = b
:''Multiply both sides by b''
:ab = bÂ²
:''Subtract aÂ² from both sides''
:ab - aÂ² = bÂ² - aÂ²
:''Factor each side''
:a(b - a) = (b+a)( b - a )
:''cancelling (b-a) from both sides''
:a = b+a

If a = 1, then we get an absurd result of 1 = 2

==From lateral-thinking to lateral-computing==
[[Lateral thinking]] is technique for creative thinking for solving problems.&lt;ref name="DeBono90" /&gt; The brain as center of thinking has a self-organizing information system. It tends to create patterns and traditional thinking process uses them to solve problems. The lateral thinking technique proposes to escape from this patterning to arrive at better solutions through new ideas. Provocative use of information processing is the basic underlying principle of lateral thinking,

The [[provocative operator]] (PO) is something which characterizes lateral thinking. Its function is to generate new ideas by provocation and providing escape route from old ideas. It creates a provisional arrangement of information.

[[Water logic]] is contrast to traditional or [[rock logic]].&lt;ref name="DeBono91"&gt;{{cite book|first =E.|last =de Bono|year=1991|title= Water Logic|publisher= Penguin Books|isbn =0-670-84231-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water logic has boundaries which depends on circumstances and conditions while rock logic has hard boundaries. Water logic, in someways, resembles [[fuzzy logic]].

===Transition to lateral-computing===
Lateral computing does a provocative use of [[information processing]] similar to lateral-thinking. This is explained with the use of evolutionary computing which is a very useful lateral-computing technique. The evolution proceeds by change and selection. While [[random mutation]] provides change, the selection is through [[survival of the fittest]]. The random mutation works as a provocative information processing and provides a new avenue for generating better solutions for the computing problem.

Lateral computing takes the analogies from real-world examples such as:

* How slow cooling of the hot gaseous state results in pure crystals ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]])
* How the [[neural network]]s in the brain solve such problems as face and [[speech recognition]]
* How simple insects such as ants and honeybees solve some sophisticated problems
* How [[evolution]] of human beings from molecular life forms are mimicked by evolutionary computing
* How living organisms defend themselves against diseases and heal their wounds
* How electricity is distributed by grids

Differentiating factors of "lateral computing":

* Does not directly approach the problem through mathematical means.
* Uses indirect models or looks for analogies to solve the problem.
* Radically different from what is in vogue, such as using "photons" for computing in optical computing. This is rare as most conventional computers use electrons to carry signals.
* Sometimes the Lateral Computing techniques are surprisingly simple and deliver high performance solutions to very complex problems.
* Some of the techniques in lateral computing use "unexplained jumps". These jumps may not look logical. The example is the use of "Mutation" operator in genetic algorithms.

===Convention â lateral===
It is very hard to draw a clear boundary between conventional and lateral computing. Over a period of time, some unconventional computing techniques become integral part of mainstream computing. So there will always be an overlap between conventional and lateral computing. It will be tough task classifying a computing technique as a conventional or lateral computing technique as shown in the figure. The boundaries are fuzzy and one may approach with fuzzy sets.

==Formal definition==
Lateral computing is a [[fuzzy set]] of all computing techniques which use unconventional computing approach. Hence Lateral computing includes those techniques which use semi-conventional or hybrid computing. The degree of membership for lateral computing techniques is greater than 0 in the fuzzy set of unconventional computing techniques.

The following brings out some important differentiators for lateral computing.

;Conventional computing:
* The problem and technique are directly [[correlation|correlated]].
* Treats the problem with rigorous mathematical analysis.
* Creates mathematical models.
* The computing technique can be analyzed mathematically.

;Lateral computing:
* The problem may hardly have any relation to the computing technique used
* Approaches problems by analogies such as human information processing model, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], etc.
* Sometimes the computing technique cannot be mathematically analyzed.

===Lateral computing and parallel computing===
[[Parallel computing]] focuses on improving the performance of the computers/algorithms through the use of several computing elements (such as processing elements).&lt;ref name="Hwang93"&gt;{{cite book|first=K.|last = Hwang|year =1993|title = Advanced Computer Architecture: Parallelism, Scalability, Programmability|publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York|isbn=0-07-031622-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computing speed is improved by using several computing elements. Parallel computing is an extension of conventional [[sequential computing]]. However, in lateral computing, the problem is solved using unconventional information processing whether using a sequential or parallel computing.

==A review of lateral-computing techniques==
There are several computing techniques which fit the Lateral computing paradigm. Here is a brief description of some of the Lateral Computing techniques:

===Swarm intelligence===
[[Swarm intelligence]] (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective behaviors of (unsophisticated) agents, interacting locally with their environment, cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Bonabeau99"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvTDhzqMr7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Swarm Intelligence: From Natural to Artificial Systems|last1=Bonabeau|first1=E.|last2=Dorigo|first2=M.|last3=THERAULUZ|first3=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-513158-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SI provides a basis with which it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model.

One interesting swarm intelligent technique is the [[Ant colony optimization|Ant Colony algorithm]]:&lt;ref name="Dorigo99"&gt;{{cite book|first1=M.|last1=Dorigo|first2=G.|last2=DI CARO|first3= L. M.|last3 =Gamberella|year=1999|title = Ant Algorithms for Discrete Optimization, Artificial Life|publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ants are behaviorally unsophisticated; collectively they perform complex tasks. Ants have highly developed sophisticated sign-based communication.
* Ants communicate using pheromones; trails are laid that can be followed by other ants.
* Routing Problem Ants drop different pheromones used to compute the "shortest" path from source to destination(s).

===Agent-based systems===
Agents are encapsulated computer systems that are situated in some environment and are capable of flexible, autonomous action in that environment in order to meet their design objectives.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Bradshaw97"&gt;{{cite book|first=J. M.|last = Bradshaw|year = 1997|title= Software Agents|publisher= AAAI Press/The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-52234-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents are considered to be [[autonomous]] (independent, not-controllable), reactive (responding to events), pro-active (initiating actions of their own volition), and social (communicative). Agents vary in their abilities: they can be static or mobile, or may or may not be intelligent. Each agent may have its own task and/or role. Agents, and multi-agent systems, are used as a [[metaphor]] to model complex distributed processes. Such agents invariably need to interact with one another in order to manage their [[interdependency|inter-dependencies]]. These interactions involve agents cooperating, negotiating and coordinating with one another.

Agent-based systems are computer programs that try to simulate various complex phenomena via virtual "agents" that represent the components of a business system. The behaviors of these agents are programmed with rules that realistically depict how business is conducted. As widely varied individual agents interact in the model, the [[simulation]] shows how their collective behaviors govern the performance of the entire system - for instance, the emergence of a successful product or an optimal schedule. These simulations are powerful strategic tools for "what-if" scenario analysis: as managers change agent characteristics or "rules," the impact of the change can be easily seen in the model output

===Grid computing===
By [[analogy]], a computational grid is a [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational capabilities.&lt;ref name="Foster99"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ian|last = Foster|year = 1999|chapter= Computational Grids, Chapter 2|title= The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, Technical Report|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications of [[grid computing]] are in:
* Chip design, [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] problems, medical instrumentation, and [[supercomputing]].
* Distributed supercomputing applications use grids to aggregate substantial computational resources in order to tackle problems that cannot be solved on a single system.

===Autonomic computing===
{{Main|Autonomic computing}}
The [[autonomic nervous system]] governs our heart rate and body temperature, thus freeing our conscious brain from the burden of dealing with these and many other low-level, yet vital, functions. The essence of [[autonomic computing]] is self-management, the intent of which is to free system administrators from the details of system operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Murch04"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.|last=Murch|year=2004|title= Autonomic Computing|publisher=Pearson Publishers|isbn=0-13-144025-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four aspects of autonomic computing are:
* Self-configuration
* Self-optimization
* Self-healing
* Self-protection

This is a grand challenge promoted by [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="IBM04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/|title=Autonomic|year = 2004|publisher = IBM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical computing===
[[Optical computing]] is to use photons rather than conventional electrons for computing.&lt;ref name="KarimAwwal92"&gt;{{cite book|first1=M. A.|last1 = Karim|first2 =A. A. S.|last2 = Awwal|year = 1992|title= Optical Computing: An Introduction|publisher = Wiley Publishers|isbn=0-471-52886-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are quite a few instances of optical computers and successful use of them.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The conventional logic gates use [[semiconductor]]s, which use electrons for transporting the signals. In case of optical computers, the photons in a light beam are used to do computation.

There are numerous advantages of using optical devices for computing such as immunity to [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] interference, large bandwidth, etc.

===DNA computing===
[[DNA computing]] uses strands of DNA to encode the instance of the problem and to manipulate them using techniques commonly available in any molecular biology laboratory in order to simulate operations that select the solution of the problem if it exists.

Since the DNA molecule is also a code, but is instead made up of a sequence of four bases that pair up in a predictable manner, many scientists have thought about the possibility of creating a molecular computer.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} These computers rely on the much faster reactions of DNA nucleotides binding with their complements, a [[Brute-force search|brute force]] method that holds enormous potential for creating a new generation of computers that would be 100 billion times faster than today's fastest PC. DNA computing has been heralded as the "first example of true [[nanotechnology]]",{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and even the "start of a new era",{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} which forges an unprecedented link between computer science and life science.

Example applications of DNA computing are in solution for the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] which is a known NP{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} complete one. The number of required lab operations using DNA grows linearly with the number of vertices of the graph.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}}&lt;ref name="Pisanti97"&gt;{{cite techreport|first=N.|last=Pisanti|year =1997|title = A Survey of DNA Computing|number= TR-97-07|institution = University of Pisa, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular algorithms have been reported that solves the cryptographic problem in a [[polynomial]] number of steps. As known, factoring large numbers is a relevant problem in many cryptographic applications.

===Quantum computing===
In a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]], the fundamental unit of information (called a quantum bit or [[qubit]]), is not binary but rather more [[quaternary]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Braunstein99"&gt;{{cite book|first=S.|last =Braunstein|year=1999|title= Quantum Computing|publisher= Wiley Publishers|isbn=3-527-40284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last =Fortnow|date=July 2003|title= Introduction of Quantum Computing from the computer science perspective and reviewing activities|journal = Special issue on Quantum Information Technology, NEC Res and Dev Journal|volume = 44|issue = 3|pages= 268â272}}&lt;/ref&gt; This qubit property arises as a direct consequence of its adherence to the laws of quantum mechanics, which differ radically from the laws of classical physics. A qubit can exist not only in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states corresponding to a blend or [[quantum superposition]] of these classical states. In other words, a qubit can exist as a zero, a one, or simultaneously as both 0 and 1, with a numerical coefficient representing the probability for each state. A quantum computer manipulates qubits by executing a series of [[quantum gate]]s, each a unitary transformation acting on a single qubit or pair of qubits. In applying these gates in succession, a quantum computer can perform a complicated unitary transformation to a set of qubits in some initial state.

===Reconfigurable computing===
[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) are making it possible to build truly [[reconfigurable computing|reconfigurable computers]].&lt;ref name="Suthikshn96"&gt;{{cite techreport|last=Suthikshn|first=Kumaryear=1996|number = PhD Thesis|title=Reconfigurable Neurocomputers: Rapid Prototyping and Design Synthesis of Artificial Neural Networks for Field Programmable Gate Arrays|institution = University of Melbourne, Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer architecture is transformed by on the fly reconfiguration of the FPGA circuitry. The optimal matching between architecture and algorithm improves the performance of the reconfigurable computer. The key feature is hardware performance and software flexibility.

For several applications such as fingerprint matching, DNA sequence comparison, etc., reconfigurable computers have been shown to perform several orders of magnitude better than conventional computers.&lt;ref&gt;Compton and Hauck, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulated annealing===
The [[Simulated annealing]] algorithm is designed by looking at how the pure crystals form from a heated [[gaseous state]] while the system is cooled slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Arts and Krost, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The computing problem is redesigned as a simulated annealing exercise and the solutions are arrived at. The working principle of simulated annealing is borrowed from metallurgy: a piece of metal is heated (the atoms are given thermal agitation), and then the metal is left to cool slowly. The slow and regular cooling of the metal allows the atoms to slide progressively their most stable ("minimal energy") positions. (Rapid cooling would have "frozen" them in whatever position they happened to be at that time.) The resulting structure of the metal is stronger and more stable. By simulating the process of annealing inside a computer program, it is possible to find answers to difficult and very complex problems. Instead of minimizing the energy of a block of metal or maximizing its strength, the program minimizes or maximizes some objective relevant to the problem at hand.

===Soft computing===
One of the main components of "Lateral-computing" is [[soft computing]] which approaches problems with human information processing model.&lt;ref&gt;Proc IEEE, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Soft Computing technique comprises Fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary-computing, machine learning and probabilistic-chaotic computing.

===Neuro computing===
Instead of solving a problem by creating a non-linear equation model of it, the biological neural network analogy is used for solving the problem.&lt;ref name="Masters95"&gt;{{cite book|first = T.|last = Masters|year = 1995|title = Neural, Novel and Hybrid Algorithm for Time Series Prediction|publisher = John Wiley and Sons Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural network is trained like a human brain to solve a given problem. This approach has become highly successful in solving some of the [[pattern recognition]] problems.

===Evolutionary computing===
The [[genetic algorithm]] (GA) resembles the natural evolution to provide a universal optimization.&lt;ref name="Goldberg00"&gt;{{cite book|first = D. E.|last = Goldberg|year = 2000|title = Genetic Algorithms in search, optimization and Machine Learning|publisher = Addison Wesley Publishers|isbn = 0-201-15767-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic algorithms start with a population of chromosomes which represent the various solutions. The solutions are evaluated using a [[fitness function]] and a selection process determines which solutions are to be used for competition process. These algorithms are highly successful in solving search and optimization problems. The new solutions are created using evolutionary principles such as mutation and crossover.

===Fuzzy logic===
[[Fuzzy logic]] is based on the fuzzy sets concepts proposed by [[Lotfi Zadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of membership concept is central to fuzzy sets. The fuzzy sets differ from crisp sets since they allow an element to belong to a set to a degree (degree of membership). This approach finds good applications for control problems.&lt;ref name="Kosko97"&gt;{{cite book|first=B.|last=Kosko|year=1997|title = Neural Networks and Fuzzy Systems: A Dynamical Systems Approach to Machine Intelligence|publisher = Prentice Hall Publishers|isbn=0-13-611435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fuzzy logic has found enormous applications and has already found a big market presence in consumer electronics such as washing machines, microwaves, mobile phones, Televisions, Camcoders etc.

===Probabilistic/chaotic computing===
Probabilistic computing engines, e.g. use of probabilistic graphical model such as [[Bayesian network]]. Such computational techniques are referred to as randomization, yielding probabilistic algorithms. When interpreted as a physical phenomenon through classical statistical thermodynamics, such techniques lead to energy savings that are proportional to the probability p with which each primitive computational step is guaranteed to be correct (or equivalently to the probability of error, (1âp).&lt;ref&gt;Palem, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic Computing is based on the chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractals===
[[Fractals|Fractal Computing]] are objects displaying [[self-similarity]] at different scales.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals generation involves small iterative algorithms. The fractals have dimensions greater than their topological dimensions. The length of the fractal is infinite and size of it cannot be measured. It is described by an iterative algorithm unlike a Euclidean shape which is given by a simple formula. There are several types of fractals and [[Mandelbrot set]]s are very popular.

Fractals have found applications in image processing, image compression music generation, computer games etc. Mandelbrot set is a fractal named after its creator. Unlike the other fractals, even though the Mandelbrot set is self-similar at magnified scales, the small scale details are not identical to the whole. I.e., the Mandelbrot set is infinitely complex. But the process of generating it is based on an extremely simple equation. The Mandelbrot set ''M'' is a collection of complex numbers. The numbers ''Z'' which belong to ''M'' are computed by iteratively testing the Mandelbrot equation. ''C'' is a constant. If the equation converges for chosen ''Z'', then ''Z'' belongs to ''M''.
Mandelbrot equation:

===Randomized algorithm===
A [[Randomized algorithms|Randomized algorithm]] makes arbitrary choices during its execution. This allows a savings in execution time at the beginning of a program. The disadvantage of this method is the possibility that an incorrect solution will occur. A well-designed randomized algorithm will have a very high probability of returning a correct answer.&lt;ref&gt;Motwani and Raghavan, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The two categories of randomized algorithms are:
* [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]
* [[Las Vegas algorithm]]

Consider an algorithm to find the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of an array. A deterministic approach would be to choose a pivot element near the median of the list and partition the list around that element. The randomized approach to this problem would be to choose a pivot at random, thus saving time at the beginning of the process. Like approximation algorithms, they can be used to more quickly solve tough NP-complete problems. An advantage over the approximation algorithms, however, is that a randomized algorithm will eventually yield an exact answer if executed enough times

===Machine learning===
Human beings/animals learn new skills, languages/concepts. Similarly, [[machine learning]] algorithms provide capability to generalize from training data.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; There are two classes of Machine Learning (ML):

* Supervised ML
* Unsupervised ML

One of the well known machine learning technique is Back Propagation Algorithm.&lt;ref name="Masters95" /&gt; This mimics how humans learn from examples. The training patterns are repeatedly presented to the network. The error is back propagated and the network weights are adjusted using gradient descent. The network converges through several hundreds of iterative computations.

===Support vector machines&lt;ref&gt;Joachims, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is another class of highly successful machine learning techniques successfully applied to tasks such as text classification, speaker recognition, image recognition etc.

==Example applications==
There are several successful applications of lateral-computing techniques. Here is a small set of applications that illustrates lateral computing:

* [[Bubble sort]]ing: Here the computing problem of sorting is approached with an analogy of bubbles rising in water. This is by treating the numbers as bubbles and floating them to their natural position.
* Truck backup problem: This is an interesting problem of reversing a truck and parking it at a particular location. The traditional computing techniques have found it difficult to solve this problem. This has been successfully solved by Fuzzy system.&lt;ref name="Kosko97" /&gt;
* Balancing an inverted pendulum: This problem involves balancing and inverted pendulum. This problem has been efficiently solved by neural networks and fuzzy systems.&lt;ref name="Kosko97" /&gt;
* Smart volume control for mobile phones: The volume control in mobile phones depend on the background noise levels, noise classes, hearing profile of the user and other parameters. The measurement on noise level and loudness level involve imprecision and subjective measures. The authors have demonstrated the successful use of fuzzy logic system for volume control in mobile handsets.&lt;ref name="Suthikshn03"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1109/MWC.2004.1308949|last = SUTHIKSHN|first=KUMAR|date=June 2003|title= Smart Volume Tuner for Cellular Phones|journal = IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine|volume= 11|issue= 4|pages= 44â49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Optimization using [[genetic algorithm]]s and [[simulated annealing]]: The problems such as [[traveling salesman problem]] have been shown to be [[NP complete]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Garey and Johnson, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems are solved using algorithms which benefit by heuristics. Some of the applications are in VLSI routing, partitioning etc. Genetic algorithms and Simulated annealing have been successful in solving such optimization problems.&lt;ref name="Goldberg00" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aarts and Krost, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Programming The Unprogrammable]] (PTU) involving the automatic creation of computer programs for unconventional computing devices such as [[cellular automata]], [[multi-agent system]]s, [[parallel system]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s, field-programmable analog arrays, ant colonies, [[swarm intelligence]], distributed systems, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Koza et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{Essay-like|section|an academic essay|date=July 2009}}
Above is a review of lateral-computing techniques. Lateral-computing is based on the lateral-thinking approach and applies unconventional techniques to solve computing problems. While, most of the problems are solved in conventional techniques, there are problems which require lateral-computing. Lateral-computing provides advantage of computational efficiency, low cost of implementation, better solutions when compared to conventional computing for several problems. The lateral-computing successfully tackles a class of problems by exploiting tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth to achieve tractability, robustness and low solution cost. Lateral-computing techniques which use the human like information processing models have been classified as "Soft Computing" in literature.

Lateral-computing is valuable while solving numerous computing problems whose mathematical models are unavailable.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} They provide a way of developing innovative solutions resulting in smart systems with Very High Machine IQ (VHMIQ). This article has traced the transition from lateral-thinking to lateral-computing. Then several lateral-computing techniques have been described followed by their applications. Lateral-computing is for building new generation artificial intelligence based on unconventional processing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[probability theory]], '''Lindeberg's condition''' is a [[Necessary and sufficient condition|sufficient condition]] (and under certain conditions also a necessary condition) for the [[central limit theorem]] (CLT) to hold for a sequence of independent [[random variables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Billingsley |title=Probability and Measure |publisher=Wiley |year=1986 |edition=2nd |page=369 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2IPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

I. |last=Resnick | title=A probability Path |year=1999 |page=314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the classical CLT, which requires that the random variables in question have finite [[variance]] and be both [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]], [[Central limit theorem#Lindeberg CLT|Lindeberg's CLT]] only requires that they have finite variance, satisfy Lindeberg's condition, and be [[Statistical independence|independent]]. It is named after the Finnish mathematician [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. W. |last=Lindeberg | title=Eine neue Herleitung des Exponentialgesetzes in der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung | year=1922 | pages=211â225 | journal = [[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] |volume = 15 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1007/BF01494395 | url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN266833020_0015&amp;DMDID=dmdlog21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==

Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]], and &lt;math&gt;X_k : \Omega \to \mathbb{R},\,\, k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, be ''independent'' random variables defined on that space. Assume the expected values &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\,[X_k] = \mu_k&lt;/math&gt; and variances &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Var}\,[X_k] = \sigma_k^2&lt;/math&gt; exist and are finite. Also let &lt;math&gt;s_n^2 := \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma_k^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

If this sequence of independent random variables &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies '''Lindeberg's condition''':

:&lt;math&gt;  \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{s_n^2}\sum_{k = 1}^n \mathbb{E} \left[(X_k - \mu_k)^2 \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{ | X_k - \mu_k | &gt; \varepsilon s_n \}} \right] = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where '''1'''&lt;sub&gt;{â¦}&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[indicator function]], then the [[central limit theorem]] holds, i.e. the random variables

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n := \frac{\sum_{k = 1}^n (X_k - \mu_k)}{s_n}&lt;/math&gt;

[[convergence in distribution|converge in distribution]] to a [[normal distribution|standard normal random variable]] as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Lindeberg's condition is sufficient, but not in general necessary (i.e. the inverse implication does not hold in general).
However, if the sequence of independent random variables in question satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{k=1,\ldots,n} \frac{\sigma_k^2}{s_n^2} \to 0, \quad \text{ as } n \to \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

then Lindeberg's condition is both sufficient and necessary, i.e. it holds if and only if the result of central limit theorem holds.

==Interpretation==

Because the Lindeberg condition implies &lt;math&gt;\max_{k=1,\ldots,n}\frac{\sigma^2_k}{s_n^2} \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, it guarantees that the contribution of any individual random variable &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;1\leq k\leq n&lt;/math&gt;) to the variance &lt;math&gt;s_n^2&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrarily small, for sufficiently large values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

* {{cite journal|last=Feistel|first=Horst|authorlink=Horst Feistel|date=18 March 1970|title=Cryptographic Coding for Data-Bank Privacy|journal=[[IBM]] Research Report 2827}}

Description: [[Feistel cipher]]s are a form of cipher of which [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] is the most important. It would be hard to overestimate the importance of either Feistel or DES. Feistel pushed a transition from stream ciphers to block ciphers.  Although most ciphers operate on streams, most of the important ciphers today are block ciphers at their core.

===''[[Data Encryption Standard]]''===
* NBS Federal Standard  FIPS PUB 46, 15 Jan 1977.

Description: [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] is not only one of the most widely deployed ciphers in the world but has had a profound impact on the development of cryptography. Roughly a generation of cryptographers devoted much of their time to attacking and improving DES.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8917">In [[convex analysis]], a [[non-negative]] function {{math|''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; â '''R'''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}} is '''logarithmically concave''' (or '''log-concave''' for short) if its [[domain of a function|domain]] is a [[convex set]], and if it satisfies the inequality
: &lt;math&gt;
    f(\theta x + (1 - \theta) y) \geq f(x)^{\theta} f(y)^{1 - \theta}
  &lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''x'',''y'' â dom ''f''}} and {{math|0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1}}. If {{math|''f''}} is strictly positive, this is equivalent to saying that the [[logarithm]] of the function, {{math|log â ''f''}}, is [[concave function|concave]]; that is,
: &lt;math&gt;
   \log  f(\theta x + (1 - \theta) y) \geq \theta \log f(x) + (1-\theta) \log f(y)
  &lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''x'',''y'' â dom ''f''}} and {{math|0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1}}.

Examples of log-concave functions are the 0-1 [[indicator function]]s of convex sets (which requires the more flexible definition), and the [[Gaussian function]].

Similarly, a function is '''[[log-convex]]''' if it satisfies the reverse inequality
: &lt;math&gt;
    f(\theta x + (1 - \theta) y) \leq f(x)^{\theta} f(y)^{1 - \theta}
  &lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''x'',''y'' â dom ''f''}} and {{math|0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;theta;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1}}.

==Properties==
* A log-concave function is also [[Quasi-concave function|quasi-concave]]. This follows from the fact that the logarithm is monotone implying that the superlevel sets of this function are convex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Every concave function that is nonnegative on its domain is log-concave. However, the reverse does not necessarily hold. An example is the [[Gaussian function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|exp(&amp;minus;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2)}} which is log-concave since {{math|log ''f''(''x'')}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|&amp;minus;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2}} is a concave function of {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|''f''}} is not concave since the second derivative is positive for |{{math|''x''}}|&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1:

::&lt;math&gt;f''(x)=e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} (x^2-1) \nleq 0&lt;/math&gt;
* From above two points, [[Concave function|concavity]] &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; log-concavity &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [[Quasiconcave function|quasiconcavity]].
* A twice differentiable, nonnegative function with a convex domain is log-concave if and only if for all {{math|''x''}} satisfying {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0}},

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)\nabla^2f(x) \preceq \nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe, [http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ Convex Optimization]  (PDF) Section 3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

:i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)\nabla^2f(x) - \nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T&lt;/math&gt; is

:[[positive-definite matrix|negative semi-definite]]. For functions of one variable, this condition simplifies to

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)f''(x) \leq (f'(x))^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Operations preserving log-concavity==

* Products: The product of log-concave functions is also log-concave. Indeed, if {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are log-concave functions, then {{math|log&amp;nbsp;''f''}} and {{math|log&amp;nbsp;''g''}} are concave by definition. Therefore

::&lt;math&gt;\log\,f(x) + \log\,g(x) = \log(f(x)g(x))&lt;/math&gt;

:is concave, and hence also {{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;''g''}} is log-concave.

* [[marginal distribution|Marginals]]: if {{math|''f''(''x'',''y'')}}&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''}} is log-concave, then

::&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\int f(x,y) dy&lt;/math&gt;

:is log-concave (see [[PrÃ©kopaâLeindler inequality]]).

* This implies that [[convolution]] preserves log-concavity, since {{math|''h''(''x'',''y'')}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{math|''f''(''x''-''y'')&amp;nbsp;''g''(''y'')}} is log-concave if {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} are log-concave, and therefore

::&lt;math&gt;(f*g)(x)=\int f(x-y)g(y) dy = \int h(x,y) dy&lt;/math&gt;

:is log-concave.

==Log-concave distributions==
Log-concave distributions are necessary for a number of algorithms, e.g. [[adaptive rejection sampling]]. Every distribution with  log-concave density is a [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] with specified mean ''Î¼'' and [[Deviation risk measure]] ''D''.&lt;ref name="Grechuk1"&gt;Grechuk, B., Molyboha, A., Zabarankin, M. (2009) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220442393_Maximum_Entropy_Principle_with_General_Deviation_Measures Maximum Entropy Principle with General Deviation Measures], Mathematics of Operations Research 34(2), 445--467, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As it happens, many common [[probability distribution]]s are log-concave.  Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Bagnoli and Ted Bergstrom (1989), "Log-Concave Probability and Its Applications", University of Michigan.[http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/Theory/delta.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[normal distribution]] and [[multivariate normal distribution]]s.
*The [[exponential distribution]].
*The [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] over any [[convex set]].
*The [[logistic distribution]].
*The [[extreme value distribution]].
*The [[Laplace distribution]].
*The [[chi distribution]].
*The [[Wishart distribution]], where ''n'' &gt;= ''p'' + 1.&lt;ref name="prekopa"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = PrÃ©kopa | first1 = AndrÃ¡s | year = 1971 | title = Logarithmic concave measures with application to stochastic programming | url = | journal = Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 301â316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Dirichlet distribution]], where all parameters are &gt;= 1.&lt;ref name="prekopa"/&gt;
*The [[gamma distribution]] if the shape parameter is &gt;= 1.
*The [[chi-square distribution]] if the number of degrees of freedom is &gt;= 2.
*The [[beta distribution]] if both shape parameters are &gt;= 1.
*The [[Weibull distribution]] if the shape parameter is &gt;= 1.

Note that all of the parameter restrictions have the same basic source: The exponent of non-negative quantity must be non-negative in order for the function to be log-concave.

The following distributions are non-log-concave for all parameters:
*The [[Student's t-distribution]].
*The [[Cauchy distribution]].
*The [[Pareto distribution]].
*The [[log-normal distribution]].
*The [[F-distribution]].

Note that the [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF) of all log-concave distributions is also log-concave.  However, some non-log-concave distributions also have log-concave CDF's:
*The [[log-normal distribution]].
*The [[Pareto distribution]].
*The [[Weibull distribution]] when the shape parameter &lt; 1.
*The [[gamma distribution]] when the shape parameter &lt; 1.

The following are among the properties of log-concave distributions:
*If a density is log-concave, so is its [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF).
*If a multivariate density is log-concave, so is the [[marginal density]] over any subset of variables.
*The sum of two independent log-concave [[random variable]]s is log-concave.  This follows from the fact that the convolution of two log-concave functions is log-concave.
*The product of two log-concave functions is log-concave.  This means that [[joint distribution|joint]] densities formed by multiplying two probability densities (e.g. the [[normal-gamma distribution]], which always has a shape parameter &gt;= 1) will be log-concave.  This property is heavily used in general-purpose [[Gibbs sampling]] programs such as BUGS and JAGS, which are thereby able to use [[adaptive rejection sampling]] over a wide variety of [[conditional distribution]]s derived from the product of other distributions.

The '''International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR)''' is an academic conference aiming at discussing cutting-edge results in the fields of automated reasoning, computational logic, programming languages and their applications.

It grew out of the Russian Conferences on Logic Programming 1990 and 1991; the idea to organize the conference was largely due to [[Robert Kowalski]] who proposed to create the Russian Association for Logic Programming. The conference was renamed in 1992 to "Logic Programming ''and Automated Reasoning''" (LPAR) to reflect its extended scope, due to considerable interest in automated reasoning in the Former Soviet Union. After a break from 1995 to 1998, LPAR continued in 1999 under the name "Logic ''for'' Programming and Automated Reasoning", to indicate an extension of its logic part beyond logic programming. In 2001, the name changed to "Logic for Programming, Artificial ''Intelligence and'' Reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;History section at [http://lpar.net LPAR Home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPAR steering committee consists of Matthias Baaz, Chris FermÃ¼ller, [[Geoff Sutcliffe]], and [[Andrei Voronkov]] (chair).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lpar.net LPAR Home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Byster''' (born March 5, 1959) is an American mathematician, [[mental calculator]], and math educator. He worked as a [[commodities market|commodity trader]] until he quit his job to devote himself to teaching children his methods. He has spoken at over 10,000 schools for free and continues to mentor kids. Mike is able to do many arithmetic problems in his head at very fast speeds.&lt;ref name="Mikes Math" /&gt; During a study done years ago, Byster was claimed to have one of the fastest mathematical minds in the world.&lt;ref name="Mikes Math" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WGN Interview"&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Byster was raised along with his older sister in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Skokie, Illinois]]. His parents Gloria and Dave encouraged his math shortcuts at a young age.&lt;ref name="Mikes Math"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2690724&amp;page=1 | title=Mikes Math | publisher=ABC News | date=September 7, 2007 | accessdate=March 27, 2007 | author=Pisarcik, Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to [[Niles North High School]] and then attended [[University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign]], graduating with a bachelor's degree in [[finance]] in 1981.

===Career===
Byster used to work at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|mercantile]] exchange, but after his cousin, a math teacher in a Chicago area high school, invited him to show the class his shortcuts for doing [[Numeral system|base 10]] arithmetic, Byster quit his job to devote himself to teaching children his methods.&lt;ref name="Who is Mike Byster"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ledlightsdesign.info/articles/who-is-mike-byster-the-brainetics-279.htm | title=Who Is Mike Byster, The Brainetics Pioneer | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218025853/http://ledlightsdesign.info/articles/who-is-mike-byster-the-brainetics-279.htm | archivedate=February 18, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he continued to do shows for free to schools across the United States. In December 2003, he released the website Mike's Math, but this was discontinued in 2007.&lt;ref name="Mikes Math Wayback Archive"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401000000*/http://mikesmath.com | title=Wayback Machine | publisher=Internet Archive | accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Byster produced the Brainetics math and memory system. Byster claims that Brainetics uses both sides of the [[brain]] to process and store information, allowing anyone to recall the information at a fast pace.

===Media appearances===
Mike appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s 20/20 in 2007. From 2007 to 2010, he appeared on television shows multiple times. On January 21, 2010, Mike appeared on Oprah Radio's ''Gayle King'' show.&lt;ref name="Gayle King Show Audio"&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Math-Whiz-Mike-Byster-Audio | title=Math Whiz Mike Byster | publisher=Harpo, Inc. | date=January 21, 2010 | people=[[Gayle King]], Mike Byster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike has appeared on [[The Shopping Channel]] in [[Canada]] and [[QVC]] in the United States multiple times. He appeared on [[Fox News]] June 8, 2011.

Byster won that week's competition and with that received $50,000 and the title of Superhuman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chicagoinc/ct-superhuman-mike-byster-20170609-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/local-brainiac-mike-byster-competes-on-superhuman/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hiddenremote.com/2017/06/27/superhuman-predictable-spoils-ending-episode/&lt;/ref&gt; He is a monthly guest on Maryland radio talk show [[The Rude Awakening Show]].

===Personal life===
Byster got married in the early 1990s and has a son, Josh, to whom he has taught his methods. He currently resides in the northern suburbs of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Mikes Math" /&gt; Byster is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.c-j-c.org/news/obit.aspx?id=72674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jrc-evanston.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_documents/jrc-spring-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[graph theory]], the '''Petersen family''' is a set of seven [[undirected graph]]s that includes the [[Petersen graph]] and the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The Petersen family is named after Danish mathematician [[Julius Petersen]], the namesake of the Petersen graph.

Any of the graphs in the Petersen family can be transformed into any other graph in the family by [[Y-Î transform|Î-Y or Y-Î transforms]], operations in which a triangle is replaced by a degree-three vertex or vice versa. These seven graphs form the [[forbidden minor]]s for [[linkless embedding|linklessly embeddable graphs]], graphs that can be embedded into three-dimensional space in such a way that no two cycles in the graph are [[Link (knot theory)|linked]].&lt;ref name="rst93"/&gt; They are also among the forbidden minors for the [[Apex graph#YÎY-reducibility|YÎY-reducible graphs]].&lt;ref name="t92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="y06"/&gt;

==Definition==
The form of [[Y-Î transform|Î-Y and Y-Î transforms]] used to define the Petersen family is as follows:
*If a graph ''G'' contains a vertex ''v'' with exactly three neighbors, then the Y-Î transform of ''G'' at ''v'' is the graph formed by removing ''v'' from ''G'' and adding edges between each pair of its three neighbors.
*If a graph ''H'' contains a triangle ''uvw'', then the Î-Y transform of ''H'' at ''uvw'' is the graph formed by removing edges ''uv'', ''vw'', and ''uw'' from ''H'' and adding a new vertex connected to all three of ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''.
These transformations are so called because of the Î shape of a triangle in a graph and the Y shape of a degree-three vertex. Although these operations can in principle lead to [[multigraph]]s, that does not happen within the Petersen family. Because these operations preserve the number of edges in a graph, there are only finitely many graphs or multigraphs that can be formed from a single starting graph ''G'' by combinations of Î-Y and Y-Î transforms.

The Petersen family then consists of every graph that can be reached from the [[Petersen graph]] by a combination of Î-Y and Y-Î transforms. There are seven graphs in the family, including the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; on six vertices, the eight-vertex graph formed by removing a single edge from the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4,4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the seven-vertex complete tripartite graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3,1&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Forbidden minors==
[[File:Apex rhombic dodecahedron.svg|thumb|Robertson's irreducible apex graph, showing that the YÎY-reducible graphs have additional forbidden minors beyond those in the Petersen family.]]
A [[minor (graph theory)|minor]] of a graph ''G'' is another graph formed from ''G'' by contracting and removing edges. As the [[RobertsonâSeymour theorem]] shows, many important families of graphs can be characterized by a finite set of [[forbidden minor]]s: for instance, according to [[Wagner's theorem]], the [[planar graph]]s are exactly the graphs that have neither the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nor the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; as minors.

[[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Neil Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]], and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Robin Thomas]] used the Petersen family as part of a similar characterization of [[linkless embedding]]s of graphs, embeddings of a given graph into [[Euclidean space]] in such a way that every [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] in the graph is the boundary of a disk that is not crossed by any other part of the graph.&lt;ref name="rst93"&gt;{{citation

The Petersen family also form some of the forbidden minors for another family of graphs, the YÎY-reducible graphs. A connected graph is YÎY-reducible if it can be reduced to a single vertex by a sequence of steps, each of which is a Î-Y or Y-Î transform, the removal of a self-loop or multiple adjacency, the removal of a vertex with one neighbor, and the replacement of a vertex of degree two and its two neighboring edges by a single edge. For instance, the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be reduced to a single vertex by a  Y-Î transform that turns it into a triangle with doubled edges, removal of the three doubled edges, a Î-Y transform that turns it into the [[star (graph theory)|claw]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;, and removal of the three degree-one vertices of the claw.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3181">'''Q-analysis''' is a mathematical framework to describe and analyze [[set system]]s, or equivalently [[simplicial complex]]es. This idea was first introduced by Ronald Atkin in the early 1970s. Atkin was a British mathematician teaching at the University of Essex. Crediting the inspiration of his idea to Clifford Dowkerâs paper (Homology Groups of Relations, Annals of Mathematics, 1952), he became interested in the algebra of relations in social structures. He tried to explain his idea in both mathematical and also accessible forms to both technical and general audience. His main ideas are reflected in ''The Mathematical Structure of Human Affairs'' (1974). That book covers the key ideas in q-analysis and its application to a wide range of examples, like analyzing game of chess, urban structures, politics at university, people and complexes, works of abstract art, and to physics. He contended that q-analysis can be considered as a powerful generalized method wherever we are dealing with relationships among sets.&lt;ref&gt;Jacky Legrand. [http://www.afscet.asso.fr/resSystemica/Crete02/Legrand.pdf How far can Q-analysis go into social systems understanding?]. Fifth European Systems Science Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Q-analysis

== Description ==
A [[simplex]] of {{mvar|n}} vertices can be represented as a polyhedron in {{math|''n'' â 1}} dimensions, so that for example a triangle of three vertices can be drawn on a plane of two dimensions and is accordingly called a 2-simplex. When simplices share vertices, the intersections of their vertex sets are themselves simplices of equal or lower dimension. For example, two triangles with two vertices in common share not only the two 0-simplex vertices but the 1-simplex line between them. The triangles are said to be both 1- and 0-connected because they share 1- and 0-dimensional faces.

Q-analysis of a simplicial complex consists in stepping through all {{mvar|q}} up to the dimension of the largest simplex and constructing for each {{mvar|q}} a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the simplices that are {{mvar|q}}-connected at each level, and in particular, determining how many [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] are present for each {{mvar|q}}.&lt;ref&gt;* Atkin, R. (1974). Mathematical Structure in Human Affairs. London, Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

Q-analysis can thus provide a rich summary of (literally) multi-faceted relationships between entities.

(For comparison, a terabyte of digital information is only 2&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; bits.)--&gt; On the other hand, quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems which are not ''practically'' feasible on classical computers.

==Basics==
A classical computer has a [[Computer memory|memory]] made up of [[bit]]s, where each bit is represented by either a one or a zero. A quantum computer, on the other hand, maintains a sequence of [[qubit]]s, which can represent a one, a zero, or any [[quantum superposition]] of those two [[Qubit#Qubit states|qubit states]];&lt;ref name=nielchuan&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|last1=Nielsen|first1=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|last3=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-107-00217-3|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|author-link=Michael A. Nielsen|author-link2=Isaac Chuang|title-link=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13â16}} a pair of qubits can be in any quantum superposition of 4 states,&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|16}} and three qubits in any superposition of 8 states. In general, a quantum computer with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; qubits can be in an arbitrary superposition of up to &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; different states simultaneously.&lt;ref name=nielchuan /&gt;{{rp|17}} (This compares to a normal computer that can only be in ''one'' of these &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; states at any one time).

A quantum computer operates on its qubits using [[quantum gate]]s and [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] (which also alters the observed state). An [[quantum algorithm|algorithm]] is composed of a fixed sequence of [[quantum gate|quantum logic gates]] and a problem is encoded by setting the initial values of the qubits, similar to how a classical computer works. The calculation usually ends with a measurement, collapsing the system of qubits into one of the &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; eigenstates, where each qubit is zero or one, decomposing into a classical state. The outcome can, therefore, be at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; classical bits of information (or, if the algorithm did not end with a measurement, the result is an unobserved quantum state).

Quantum algorithms are often probabilistic, in that they provide the correct solution only with a certain known probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/chap5_15.pdf|title=Lecture Notes for Ph219/CS219: Quantum Information Chapter 5|last=Preskill|first=John|date=2015|website=|publisher=|page=12|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the term non-deterministic computing must not be used in that case to mean probabilistic (computing) because the term [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] has a different meaning in computer science.

An example of an implementation of qubits of a quantum computer could start with the use of particles with two [[spin (physics)|spin]] states: "down" and "up" (typically written &lt;math&gt;|{\downarrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;|0{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1{\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;). This is true because any such system can be mapped onto an effective [[Spin-Â½|spin-1/2]] system.

== Principles of operation ==
{{more footnotes|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- It is unclear how much of the section's content is covered by the source it cites --&gt;
A quantum computer with a given number of qubits is fundamentally different from a classical computer composed of the same number of classical bits. For example, representing the state of an ''n''-qubit system on a classical computer requires the storage of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Complex number|complex]] coefficients, while to characterize the state of a classical ''n''-bit system it is sufficient to provide the values of the ''n'' bits, that is, only ''n'' numbers. Although this fact may seem to indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical counterparts, care must be taken not to overlook the fact that the qubits are only in a probabilistic superposition of all of their states.  This means that when the final state of the qubits is measured, they will only be found in one of the possible configurations they were in before the measurement.  It is generally incorrect to think of a system of qubits as being in one particular state before the measurement. Since the fact that they were in a superposition of states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes of the computation.

[[File:Quantum computer.svg|thumb|200px|Qubits are made up of controlled particles and the means of control (e.g. devices that trap particles and switch them from one state to another).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Waldner |first = Jean-Baptiste |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[International Society for Technology in Education|ISTE]] |place = London |year = 2007 |page = 157 |isbn = 978-2-7462-1516-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]

To better understand this point, consider a classical computer that operates on a three-bit [[Processor register|register]]. If the exact state of the register at a given time is not known, it can be described as a probability distribution over the &lt;math&gt;2^3=8&lt;/math&gt; different three-bit strings &lt;tt&gt;000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;. If there is no uncertainty over its state, then it is in exactly one of these states with probability 1. However, if it is a [[Probabilistic Turing machine|probabilistic computer]], then there is a possibility of it being in any ''one'' of a number of different states.

The state of a three-qubit quantum computer is similarly described by an [[Eight-dimensional space|eight-dimensional vector]] &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; (or a one dimensional vector with
each vector node holding the amplitude and the state as the bit string of qubits). Here, however, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[complex number]]s, and it is the sum of the ''squares'' of the coefficients' [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute values]], &lt;math&gt;\sum_i |a_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;, that must equal 1. For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the absolute value squared &lt;math&gt;\left|a_i \right|^2&lt;/math&gt; gives the probability of the system being found in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th state after a measurement. However, because a complex number encodes not just a magnitude but also a direction in the [[complex plane]], the phase difference between any two coefficients (states) represents a meaningful parameter. This is a fundamental difference between quantum computing and probabilistic classical computing.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255â261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you measure the three qubits, you will observe a three-bit string. The probability of measuring a given string is the squared magnitude of that string's coefficient (i.e., the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_0|^2&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of measuring &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;math&gt;|a_1|^2&lt;/math&gt;, etc.). Thus, measuring a quantum state described by complex coefficients &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; gives the classical probability distribution &lt;math&gt;(|a_0|^2,|a_1|^2,|a_2|^2,|a_3|^2,|a_4|^2,|a_5|^2,|a_6|^2,|a_7|^2)&lt;/math&gt; and we say that the quantum state "collapses" to a classical state as a result of making the measurement.

An eight-dimensional vector can be specified in many different ways depending on what [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] is chosen for the space. The basis of bit strings (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;000&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;001&lt;/tt&gt;, â¦, &lt;tt&gt;111&lt;/tt&gt;) is known as the computational basis. Other possible bases are [[unit vector|unit-length]], [[orthogonal]] vectors and the eigenvectors of the [[Pauli matrices|Pauli-x operator]]. [[Bra-ket notation|Ket notation]] is often used to make the choice of basis explicit. For example, the state &lt;math&gt;(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)&lt;/math&gt; in the computational basis can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;a_0\,|000\rangle + a_1\,|001\rangle + a_2\,|010\rangle + a_3\,|011\rangle + a_4\,|100\rangle + a_5\,|101\rangle + a_6\,|110\rangle + a_7\,|111\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:where, e.g., &lt;math&gt;| 010\rangle = \left(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The computational basis for a single qubit (two dimensions) is &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle = \left(1,0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle = \left(0,1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the eigenvectors of the Pauli-x operator, a single qubit is &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|-\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(1,-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Unsolved|physics|Is a [[universal quantum computer]] sufficient to [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficiently]] [[Dynamical simulation|simulate]] an arbitrary physical system?}}
While a classical 3-bit state and a quantum 3-qubit state are each eight-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vectors]], they are manipulated quite differently for classical or quantum computation. For computing in either case, the system must be initialized, for example into the all-zeros string, &lt;math&gt;|000\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the vector (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). In classical randomized computation, the system evolves according to the application of [[Stochastic matrix|stochastic matrices]], which preserve that the probabilities add up to one (i.e., preserve the [[Taxicab geometry|L1 norm]]). In quantum computation, on the other hand, allowed operations are [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]], which are effectively rotations (they preserve that the sum of the squares add up to one, the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean or L2 norm]]). (Exactly what unitaries can be applied depend on the physics of the quantum device.) Consequently, since rotations can be undone by rotating backward, quantum computations are [[Reversible computing|reversible]]. (Technically, quantum operations can be probabilistic combinations of unitaries, so quantum computation really does generalize classical computation. See [[quantum circuit]] for a more precise formulation.)

Finally, upon termination of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In the case of a classical computer, we ''sample'' from the [[probability distribution]] on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one ''[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|measures]]'' the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, [[counterfactual quantum computation]] allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.

For more details on the sequences of operations used for various [[quantum algorithm]]s, see [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[DeutschâJozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].

=== Cryptography ===
[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101â128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[DiffieâHellman]], and [[elliptic curve DiffieâHellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

However, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.&lt;ref name="pqcrypto_survey"&gt;Daniel J.

[[Quantum cryptography]] could potentially fulfill some of the functions of public key cryptography. Quantum-based cryptographic systems could ,therefore, be more secure than traditional systems against quantum hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/quantum-computing-explained|title=What are quantum computers and how do they work?

=== Quantum search ===

Besides factorization and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms offering a more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ Quantum Algorithm Zoo] â Stephen Jordan's Homepage&lt;/ref&gt; including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of [[Jones polynomial]]s, and solving [[Pell's equation]]. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jon Schiller, Phd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l217ma2sWkoC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathematical%20proof&amp;f=false 
|title=Quantum Computers|isbn=9781439243497 
|date=2009-06-19 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup. The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.

Problems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:
#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer

For problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1804.00200|doi=10.14569/IJACSA.2018.090354 |title=The Impact of Quantum Computing on Present Cryptography |journal=International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=March 2018 |last1=Mavroeidis |first1=Vasileios |last2=Vishi |first2=Kamer |last3=d |first3=Mateusz |last4=JÃ¸sang |first4=Audun }}&lt;/ref&gt; This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum simulation ===
Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimisation ===
[[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly evolved to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process.

=== Solving linear equations ===
The [[Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations]] or "HHL Algorithm", named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is expected to provide speedup over classical counterparts.&lt;ref name="Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations by Harrow et al."&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0811.3171|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|last2 = Hassidim|first2 = Avinatan|last3 = Lloyd|first3 = Seth|title = Quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 103|issue = 15|pages = 150502|year = 2008|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.150502|pmid = 19905613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer, and thus far quantum computers have yet to solve a problem faster than a classical computer. [[David P. DiVincenzo|David DiVincenzo]], of IBM, listed the following [[DiVincenzo's criteria|requirements]] for a practical quantum computer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=quant-ph/0002077|title=The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation|last=DiVincenzo |first=David P.|date=2000-04-13|doi=10.1002/1521-3978(200009)48:9/11&lt;771::AID-PROP771&gt;3.0.CO;2-E|volume=48|issue=9â11|journal=Fortschritte der Physik|pages=771â783|bibcode=2000ForPh..48..771D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*scalable physically to increase the number of qubits;
*qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values;
*quantum gates that are faster than [[decoherence]] time;
*universal gate set;
*qubits that can be read easily.

=== Quantum decoherence ===
{{Main|Quantum decoherence}}

One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing [[quantum decoherence]]. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.&lt;ref name="DiVincenzo 1995" /&gt; Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286â288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10&lt;sup&gt;â3&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; bits without error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

Zaslavsky | arxiv=quant-ph/0610117|bibcode=2006quant.ph.10117D }}&lt;/ref&gt; With error correction, the figure would rise to about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bits. Computation time is about ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; steps and at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz, about 10 seconds.

A very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with [[anyon]]s, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable logic gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[quantum Turing machine]] is theoretically important but the direct implementation of this model is not pursued. All four models of computation have been shown to be equivalent; each can simulate the other with no more than polynomial overhead.

=== Physical realizations ===
For physically implementing a quantum computer, many different candidates are being pursued, among them (distinguished by the physical system used to realize the qubits):

A large number of candidates demonstrates that the topic, in spite of rapid progress, is still in its infancy. There is also a vast amount of flexibility.

=== Timeline ===
{{Main|Timeline of quantum computing}}

In 1959 [[Richard Feynman]] in his lecture "[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]" states the possibility of using quantum effects for computation.

In 1980 [[Paul Benioff]] described quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of computers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benioff | first1=Paul | title = The computer as a physical system: A microscopic quantum mechanical Hamiltonian model of computers as represented by Turing machines | journal =  Journal of Statistical Physics |volume= 22 |  issue = 5 | pages =563â591 | year = 1980 | doi=10.1007/bf01011339|bibcode = 1980JSP....22..563B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Russian mathematician [[Yuri Manin]] motivated the development of quantum computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Manin |first=Yu I |year=1980 |title=Vychislimoe i nevychislimoe |trans-title=Computable and Noncomputable |language=ru |work=Sov.Radio |pp=13â15 |url= http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.(1980).%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510173823/http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/M/MANIN_Yuriy_Ivanovich/Manin_Yu.I._Vychislimoe_i_nevychislimoe.%281980%29.%5Bdjv%5D.zip |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, at a conference co-organized by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and IBM, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] urged the world to build a quantum computer. He said, "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gil|first1=Dario|title=The Dawn of Quantum Computing is Upon Us|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2016/05/the-quantum-age-of-computing-is-here/|accessdate=May 4, 2016|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, [[BB84]] is published, the world's first [[quantum cryptography protocol]] by IBM scientists [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]] and [[Gilles Brassard]].

In 1993, an international group of six scientists, including Charles Bennett, showed that perfect [[quantum teleportation]] is possible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett,|first1=C. H.|title=Teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and EinsteinâPodolskyâRosen channels|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=29 March 1993|volume=70|issue=13|pages=1895â1899|url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bennetc/BBCJPW.pdf|bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.1895B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895|pmid=10053414}}&lt;/ref&gt; in principle, but only if the original is destroyed.

In 1994 [[Peter Shor]], at AT&amp;amp;T's [[Bell Labs]] discovered an important quantum algorithm, which allows a quantum computer to factor large integers exponentially much faster than the best known classical algorithm. [[Shor's algorithm]] can theoretically break many of the [[Public-key cryptography|public-key cryptosystem]]s in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ekert |first=Artur |last2=Josza |first2=Richard |title=Quantum computation and Shor's factoring algorithm |journal=Rev. Mod. Phys. |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=733â753 |year=1996 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.68.733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its invention sparked a tremendous interest in quantum computers.

In 1996, The [[DiVincenzo's criteria]] are published which is a list of conditions that are necessary for constructing a quantum computer proposed by the theoretical physicist [[David P. DiVincenzo]] in his 2000 paper "The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation".

In 2001, researchers demonstrated [[Shor's algorithm]] to factor 15 using a 7-qubit NMR computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/414883a|title=Experimental realization of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance|year=2001|last1=Vandersypen|first1=Lieven M.

In 2005, researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] built a [[semiconductor chip]] [[ion trap]]. Such devices from standard [[photolithography|lithography]] may point the way to scalable quantum computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.umich.edu/news/index.html?Releases/2005/Dec05/r121205b |title= U-M develops scalable and mass-producible quantum computer chip |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=2006-11-17 |date=2005-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, researchers at [[Yale University]] created the first solid-state quantum processor. The two-[[qubit]] superconducting chip had artificial atom qubits made of a billion [[aluminum]] [[atom]]s that acted like a single atom that could occupy two states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nature08121.pdf |title= Demonstration of two-qubit algorithms with a superconducting quantum processor |accessdate=2009-07-02 |last=DiCarlo |first=L. |last2=Chow |first2=J.

A team at the [[University of Bristol]] also created a [[silicon]] chip based on [[quantum optics]], able to run [[Shor's algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17736-codebreaking-quantum-algorithm-run-on-a-silicon-chip.html |title= Code-breaking quantum algorithm runs on a silicon chip |accessdate=2009-10-14 |work=New Scientist |date=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further developments were made in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= New Trends in Quantum Computation | url=http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/itp/conf/simons-qcomputation2/program.html |work=Simons Conference on New Trends in Quantum Computation 2010: Program |publisher=C.N.

In April 2011, a team of scientists from Australia and Japan made a breakthrough in [[quantum teleportation]]. They successfully transferred a complex set of quantum data with full transmission integrity, without affecting the qubits' superpositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2011/apr/Quantum_teleport_paper.html |title=Quantum teleporter breakthrough |publisher=University of New South Wales |date=2011-04-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418200747/http://www.unsw.edu.au/news/pad/articles/2011/apr/Quantum_teleport_paper.html |archivedate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lai |first=Richard | url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/04/18/first-light-wave-quantum-teleportation-achieved-opens-door-to-u/ |title=First light wave quantum teleportation achieved, opens door to ultra fast data transmission |publisher=Engadget |date=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[D-Wave Systems]] announced the first commercial quantum annealer, the D-Wave One, claiming a 128 qubit processor. On May 25, 2011, [[Lockheed Martin]] agreed to purchase a D-Wave One system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dwavesys.com/en/pressreleases.html#lm_2011 |title= D-Wave Systems sells its first Quantum Computing System to Lockheed Martin Corporation |accessdate=2011-05-30 |date=2011-05-25 |publisher=D-Wave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed and the University of Southern California (USC) will house the D-Wave One at the newly formed USC Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viterbi.usc.edu/news/news/2011/operational-quantum-computing334119.htm |title= Operational Quantum Computing Center Established at USC |accessdate=2011-12-06 |date=2011-10-29 |publisher=University of Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Wave's engineers designed the chips with an empirical approach, focusing on solving particular problems.  Investors liked this more than academics, who said D-Wave had not demonstrated they really had a quantum computer. Criticism softened after a D-Wave paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that proved the chips have some quantum properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/full/nature10012.html |title=Quantum annealing with manufactured spins |journal=Nature |volume=473 |pages=194â198 |date=12 May 2011 |issue=7346 |doi=10.1038/nature10012|pmid=21562559 |last1=Johnson |first1=M.

== Relation to computational complexity theory ==
{{Main|Quantum complexity theory}}

[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to other problem spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called [[BQP]], for "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run [[probabilistic algorithm]]s, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It is defined as the set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A quantum computer is said to "solve" a problem if, for every instance, its answer will be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP.

BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P&lt;sup&gt;#P&lt;/sup&gt;''),&lt;ref name=BernVazi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411â1473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].

BQP is suspected to be disjoint from [[NP-complete]] and a strict superset of [[P (complexity)|P]], but that is not known. Both [[integer factorization]] and [[discrete logarithm problem|discrete log]] are in BQP. Both of these problems are NP problems suspected to be outside BPP, and hence outside P. Both are suspected to not be NP-complete. There is a common misconception that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. That is not known to be true, and is generally suspected to be false.&lt;ref name=BernVazi /&gt;

The capacity of a quantum computer to accelerate classical algorithms has rigid limitsâupper bounds of quantum computation's complexity. The overwhelming part of classical calculations cannot be accelerated on a quantum computer.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Quantum Computers Speed Up Classical with Probability Zero |year=1999 |pages=1707â1714 |volume=10 |journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals |arxiv=quant-ph/9803064 |bibcode = 1998quant.ph..3064O |doi=10.1016/S0960-0779(98)00226-4 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar fact takes place for particular computational tasks, like the search problem, for which [[Grover's algorithm]] is optimal.&lt;ref name=Ozhigov2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ozhigov |first1=Yuri |title=Lower Bounds of Quantum Search for Extreme Point |year=1999 |pages=2165â2172 |volume=A455 |journal=Proceedings of the London Royal Society |arxiv=quant-ph/9806001 |bibcode = 1999RSPSA.455.2165O |doi = 10.1098/rspa.1999.0397 |issue=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[De BroglieâBohm theory|Bohmian Mechanics]] is a non-local hidden variable interpretation of quantum mechanics. It has been shown that a non-local hidden variable quantum computer could implement a search of an N-item database at most in &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt[3]{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps. This is slightly faster than the &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{N})&lt;/math&gt; steps taken by [[Grover's algorithm]]. Neither search method will allow quantum computers to solve [[NP-completeness|NP-Complete]] problems in polynomial time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qchvpra.pdf|title=Quantum Computing and Hidden Variables|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although quantum computers may be faster than classical computers for some problem types, those described above cannot solve any problem that classical computers cannot already solve. A [[Turing machine]] can simulate &lt;!-- add mention about [[Quantum Virtual Machines]] which can simulate quantum computer on classical one --&gt;these quantum computers, so such a quantum computer could never solve an [[undecidable problem]] like the [[halting problem]]. The existence of "standard" quantum computers does not disprove the [[ChurchâTuring thesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[M-theory]] or [[loop quantum gravity]], may allow even faster computers to be built. Currently, ''defining'' computation in such theories is an open problem due to the ''[[problem of time]]'', i.e., there currently exists no obvious way to describe what it means for an observer to submit input to a computer and later receive output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Scott Aaronson]]|title=NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality|journal=ACM SIGACT News, March|volume=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0502072|year=2005|bibcode=2005quant.ph..2072A}} See section 7 "Quantum Gravity": "[â¦] to anyone who wants
a test or benchmark for a favorite quantum gravity theory,[author's footnote: That is, one without all the bother of making numerical predictions and comparing them to observation] let me humbly propose the following: ''can you define Quantum Gravity Polynomial-Time?'' [â¦] until we can say what it means for a 'user' to specify an 'input' and
âlater' receive an 'output'â''there is no such thing as computation, not even theoretically.''" (emphasis in original)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The term '''''sauwastika'''''  (or ''sauvastika''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika - Hindu Symbols |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576371/swastika |title=swastika (symbol) - EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1935-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (as a character: å) is sometimes used to distinguish the left-facing from the right-facing [[swastika]] symbol, a meaning which developed in 19th century scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;In use from the 1850s, certainly so used by D'Alviella (1894) "[[sauvastika]]" is used to classify the geometrical form  of symbols in Liungman, Carl G., ''Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms'', HME Publishing (2004) {{ISBN|91-972705-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-facing variant is favoured in [[BÃ¶n]] and [[Gurung Dharma]]; it is called ''yungdrung'' in Bon and ''Gurung Yantra'' in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; however, the ''left-facing'' is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanskrit.org/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-swastika/ |title=What is the meaning of a Swastika? |publisher=Sanskrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika is imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika Symbol in Buddhism - Buddhist Swastika |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swastikaphobia.com/buddhist.html |title=Buddhist - The Swastikaphobia Project |publisher=Swastikaphobia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/~bmori/syll/315syll/Swastika.html |title=Swastika |publisher=Cla.calpoly.edu |date=1935-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhas-online.com/swastika.html |title=The Swastika or WAN Symbol in Asian Art - The Heart of Buddha |publisher=Buddhas-online.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Sanskrit]] ''sauvastika'' is the adjective derived from ''svastika'' through the standard process of [[vá¹ddhi]] of the vowel ''u'' in the initial syllable.   (''Svastika'' is the transformation of "su asti" + "ka" through [[sandhi]].  Vrddhi applies to the original form before sandhi.)  It is attested as an adjective meaning "benedictive, salutatory".&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Horace Hayman Wilson|Wilson]] (1819), cited by [[Monier-Williams]].&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to a "reversed" ''svastika'' is probably first made by  [[EugÃ¨ne Burnouf]] in 1852, and taken up by [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]] in ''Ilios'' (1880), based on a letter from [[Max MÃ¼ller]], who is in turn quoting Burnouf. The term ''sauwastika'' is used in the sense of "backwards swastika" by [[EugÃ¨ne Goblet d'Alviella]] (1894): "In India it [the ''[[gammadion]]''] bears the name of ''swastika'', when its arms are bent towards the right, and ''sauwastika'' when they are turned in the other direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/sym/mosy/mosy06.htm#page_40 ''The Migration of Symbols''], by [[EugÃ¨ne Goblet d'Alviella]], (1894), p.40 at [[sacred-texts.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been misspelled as ''suavastika'', a term attributed to Max MÃ¼ller by Wilson (1896).
Wilson  finds that "The 'suavastika' which Max MÃ¼ller names and believes was applied to the swastika sign, with the ends bent to the left ... seems not to be reported with that meaning by any other author except Burnouf."&lt;ref&gt;On Oriental Carpets. Article III.âThe Svastika, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs (1903) also uses the term with reference to MÃ¼ller.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of a distinction in Indian religions==

[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|frame|Left-facing swastika from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'']]
[[Eugene Burnouf]], the first Western expert on Buddhism, stated in his book ''Lotus de la bonne loi'' (1852) that the ''sauvastika'' was a Buddhist variant of the ''svastika''.

When [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered swastika motifs in [[Troy]], he wrote to the Indologist [[Max MÃ¼ller]], who, quoting Burnouf, confirmed this distinction, adding that "the ''svastika'' was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the ''sauvastika'', and, therefore, a natural symbol of light, life, health, peace and wealth." The letter was published in Schliemann's book ''Ilios'' (1880):
{{quote|"In the footprints of Buddha the Buddhists recognize no less than sixty-five auspicious signs, the first of them being the Svastika ..." (Eugene Burnouf, ''Lotus de la bonne loi'', p. 625); âthe fourth is the sauvastika {{sic}}, or that with the arms turned to the left.â}}

The term ''sauvastika'' thus cannot be confirmed as authentic and is probably due to Burnouf (1852).  Notions that sauwastikas are considered "evil" or inauspicious versions of the auspicious swastika in [[Indian religions]] have even less substance, since even Burnouf counts the svastika and the sauvastika equally among the "sixty-five auspicious signs".

D'Alviella (1894) voices doubts about the distinction:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Would it not be simpler to admit that the direction of the branches is of secondary importance in the symbolism of the gammadion?  When it is desired to symbolize the progress of the sun, namely, its faculty of translation through space, rather than the direction in which it turns, little attention will have been paid to the direction given to the rays. (p. 68)}}

Although the more common form is the right-facing swastika, the symbol is used in both orientations for the sake of balance in [[Hinduism]]. Buddhists almost always use the left-facing swastika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Use==
The sauwastika was a favorite symbol of the last Russian Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. She put this sign everywhere for good luck. In particular, she drew it with a pencil on the wall, at the window opening, and on the wallpaper above the bed of her son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]] in [[Ipatiev House]], where the murdered Emperor's family spent the last days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Gilliard]]. Thirteen Years at the Russian Court&lt;/ref&gt;
