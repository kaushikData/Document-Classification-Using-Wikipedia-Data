      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1645">The '''AN/MPN-14K Mobile Ground Approach System''' can be configured as a complete [[Radar Approach Control]] (RAPCON) or [[Ground Controlled Approach]] (GCA) facility.

The radar unit is used by [[air traffic controllers]] to identify, sequence, and separate participating [[aircraft]], provide final approach guidance through [[air defense]] corridors and zones, and coordinate [[Aircraft identification|ID]] and intent with local air defense units at assigned airports and air bases. These services can be provided in all types of [[weather]].

The radar unit is capable of identifying aircraft using secondary radar up to a {{convert|200|nmi|km|-1|sing=on}} radius and primary radar coverage to {{convert|60|nmi|km|-1}}. The PAR provides both [[azimuth]] and [[elevation]] information from 15 NM to touchdown. Both the PAR and ASR can be used as final approach aids. The unit has three ASR display indicators and one PAR indicator located in the operations shelter, and one each ASR and PAR indicator located in the maintenance shelter. Complete operations are conducted from the operations trailer. The system is limited to a single runway but has the capability of providing opposite direction runway operations with the aid of a transportable [[turntable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4125">'''AV.link''', also known under the trade names '''nexTViewLink''', '''SmartLink''', '''Q-Link''', '''EasyLink''', etc., is  a protocol to carry control information between audio-visual devices connected via the [[SCART]] (EIA Multiport) connector.

It is standardised as [[CENELEC]] EN 50157-1.

The [[Consumer Electronics Control]] (CEC) communication channel in [[HDMI]] and [[PDMI]] is based on AV.link.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

==Electrical characteristics==
AV.Link uses a single wire in an [[open collector]] configuration. It is [[Pull-up resistor|passively pulled up]] to 3 or 3.3&amp;nbsp;V, and may be pulled down by any device on the bus. Total bus capacitance is a maximum of 7300&amp;nbsp;[[picofarad|pF]] (ten devices at 100&amp;nbsp;pF each, plus nine cables at 700&amp;nbsp;pF), and signal transitions are correspondingly slow: 333 bit/s&lt;!-- 8 effective bits per 24 ms makes 3 ms/bit--&gt;, with 50&amp;nbsp;[[microsecond|μs]] fall time and 250&amp;nbsp;μs rise time.

Each bit transferred begins with a falling edge. The duration of the low period determines the value.

Data bits are 2.4±0.35&amp;nbsp;ms long, with 1 bits having a low period of 0.6±0.2&amp;nbsp;ms, and 0 bits having a low period of 1.5±0.2&amp;nbsp;ms. Receivers observe the data line at 1.05±0.2&amp;nbsp;ms after the falling edge to determine the bit's value.

Every message begins with a special start bit, 4.5±0.2&amp;nbsp;ms long, with a low period of 3.7±0.2&amp;nbsp;ms.

A transmitter must listen to the bus as it transmits; the receiver may hold it low, turning a transmitted 1 bit into a 0 bit.  This is done, for example, to acknowledge a transmission.

If a receiver detects an error in the received data, it holds the bus low for 3.6±0.24&amp;nbsp;ms; this causes the transmitter to abort the message and retry from the beginning.

A message consists of a start bit, followed by a series of data bytes.  Each byte is actually transmitted as 10 bits:
* 8 data bits, most significant bit first,
* An end-of-message bit is 0 to indicate that more bytes are being transmitted, or 1 to indicate not, and
* An acknowledge bit is transmitted as 1, but overwritten to a 0 bit by the receiver to acknowledge receipt.
** For broadcast messages, the acknowledge bit is inverted: it is overwritten to 0 if any receiver ''rejects'' the message.

Each message begins with an address byte specifying the 4-bit initiator and recipient addresses.  If two initiators begin transmitting at the same time, one of them will transmit a 0 bit while the other transmits a 1 bit, and the latter will observe the conflict and cease transmitting until the bus is idle again. (Note that it must be prepared for the case that the incoming message is addressed to it.)

An address byte sent with EOM=1 is a simple "[[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]" to check if the addressed device exists and is powered on. Otherwise, it is followed by an opcode byte, and parameters as required by the opcode.

When a device is powered on, it chooses an address and sends a ping to see if that address is claimed by another device.  If no acknowledge is received, the address is free and may be kept. Otherwise, the device tries another address.

'''Anna Helene Boyksen''' is known as the first female undergraduate engineering student at [[Technical University of Munich|Technical University of Munich (TUM)]] (German: Technische Universität München). Anna Boyksen was born on August 11, 1881, in Havendorfersand, in the Grand Duchy of Oldenberg, to Dietrich Anton Boyksen, a merchant, and his wife Mathilde, née Lubben. In her curriculum vitae, Boyksen claimed her nationality as Bavarian and religion as Evangelical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/diedeutschenbrse00koch#page/n63/mode/2up|title=The Internet Archive. Lebenslauf.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1906, Anna Boyksen was the first woman to enroll in TUM (at the time called THM) in electrical engineering, completing her intermediate exams in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chancengleichheit.tum.de/fileadmin/w00blt/www/Download/Publikationen/TUM/TUM_Broschure_Women_at_TUM.pdf|title="Women in the Technical University of Munich" (German: "Frauen an der Technischen Universität München")|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then went on to pursue studies in economics and law: in 1911, she defended her dissertation, titled "The German Stock Exchange Regulations. A Comparative Representation" (German: "Die deutschen Börsenordnungen. Eine vergleichende Darstellung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/diedeutschenbrse00koch|title=The Internet Archive: "Die deutschen Börsenordnungen. Eine vergleichende Darstellung."|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"),  at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]], under her married name, Anna Helene Koch.

== Legacy ==
'''The Anna Boyksen Diversity Research Center''' at TUM "explores human diversity and the opportunities of diversity for society. Its work focuses on a question often overlooked in Germany: How can the natural, engineering and life sciences benefit from a more diverse community culture?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portal.mytum.de/pressestelle/pressemitteilungen/NewsArticle_20120614_154531/exinien|title=TUM Press Release.

The prestigious '''Anna Boyksen Fellowship'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tum-ias.de/how-to-apply/anna-boyksen-fellowship.html|title=TUM-IAS: Anna Boyksen Fellowship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been offered by the [[TUM Institute for Advanced Study|Technical University of Munich - Institute for Advanced Study (TUM-IAS)]] since 2014.The Fellowship is granted to outstanding international scholars and researchers who wish to probe gender / diversity-related problems in the Natural and Engineering Sciences, in collaboration with TUM researchers.  The two-year Fellowship was created to help advance TUM's goal to become "Germany's most attractive university for women"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to foster a productive and durable exchange of ideas and solutions on an international level.

Released in December 2011, it resembles the latest model of the [[BlackBerry Bold|Bold 9900]], even sharing most of its hardware components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_porsche_design_p'9981-4288.php | work=GSMArena | title=P'9981 specifications on GSMArena | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phonearena.com/phones/RIM-BlackBerry-Porsche-Design-P9981_id6514/fullspecs | work=PhoneArena | title=P'9981 specifications on PhoneArena | date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both share the same [[Qualcomm Snapdragon|Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8655]] CPU clocked at 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz, 768&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM, a {{convert|2.8|in|sing=on}} [[Thin film transistor|TFT]] capacitive touchscreen (built on 88µm pixel) capable of multi-touch with a resolution of 640 x 480&amp;nbsp;pixels and the same 5.0-megapixel EDOF rear camera capable of [[720p]] HD video recording with and an LED flash. The major visual differences, are with the styling which include a unibody full stainless steel frame and authentic leather rear door. [[Porsche Design]] changed the aesthetics of the device by adding a uniquely styled metal QWERTY keyboard laid across four straight rows that are set into the steel frame, each row of keys divided by a space, along with custom menu buttons.

It runs the [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry OS 7 upgradeable to 7.1]] and features a custom user interface, modified by [[Porsche Design]]. Aside from this, the software contained within the device itself is parallel to that of the Bold 9900.

A '''building energy rating''' (BER) is similar to the energy rating label for a household [[electrical appliance]] (examples of which include the U.S. [[EnergyGuide]], the [[European Union energy label]], and the Australia/New Zealand [[energy rating label]]). The label has a scale of A-G, with A-rated buildings the most [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] and G the least. In relation to dwellings, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland states that "''A BER is an indication of the energy performance of a home. It covers energy use for space heating, water heating, ventilation and lighting calculated on the basis of standard occupancy.''"&lt;ref&gt;Extract from the website of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland [http://www.seai.ie/Your_Building/BER/BER_FAQ/FAQ_BER/General/What-is-a-BER-.html "BER what is it?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A BER assessment and certificate may be compulsory to sell a building or shortly after its construction. Methods of calculations and legislations related to BER may be different from one country to another. BER was created as a tool to help monitoring and improving the overall building energy efficiency.

==Building Energy Rating in Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], each new dwelling built from January 1, 2007 required a BER, unless [[planning application]] was lodged prior to December 31, 2006. From January 1, 2009, it became illegal to offer a dwelling for sale without BER.

From July 1, 2008 a BER is necessary for new non-residential buildings where [[planning permission]] is required. From January 1, 2009 a BER is required for existing non-residential buildings, when offered for sale or to let.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seai.ie www.seai.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statutory Instrument]] regulating the requirements for BER is "''S.I. 666 of 2006''". It is Ireland's implementation of the [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings]]

A '''CD player''' is an electronic device that plays audio [[compact disc]]s, which are a [[digital audio|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|data storage]] format. CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music. CD players are often a part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, and [[personal computer]]s. With the exception of CD [[boombox]]es, most CD players do not produce sound by themselves. Most CD players only produce an output signal via a headphone jack or RCA jacks. To listen to music using a CD player with a [[headphone]] output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable to the [[RCA jack]]s or other outputs and connects it to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music. They are also manufactured as [[Portable CD player|portable devices]], which are battery powered and typically used with headphones.

Modern units can play other formats in addition to [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding used in CDs, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive equipped computers as well as on [[DVD player]]s and most optical disc-based [[game console]]s.

[[File:JVC CD player.JPG|thumb|right|A [[JVC]] FS-SD5R CD player from the 1990s with a transparent plastic cover]]
American inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T. Russell]] has been credited with inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[foil (metal)|foil]] that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,501,586}} Analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system, March 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3,795,902}} Method and apparatus for synchronizing photographic records of digital information, March 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell's patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell's patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Seattle Times |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002103322_cdman29.html |author=Brier Dudley |title=Scientist's invention was let go for a song |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2000 |publisher=Reed College public affairs office |title=Inventor and physicist James Russell '53 will receive Vollum Award at Reed's convocation |accessdate=24 July 2014 |url=http://reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2000-2001/288.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/russell.html |title=Inventor of the Week - James T.

The Compact Disc is an evolution of [[LaserDisc]] technology, where a focused [[laser]] beam
is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals.
Prototypes were developed by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] independently in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the CD|url=http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/|publisher=Philips Research|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the ''[[Rainbow Books|Red Book]]'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/1985/05/compact-discs-sound-of-the-future/|title=Compact Discs: Sound of the Future|first=Edward|last=Rasen|work=Spin|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tx6TYnPat8|title=Introducing the amazing Compact Disc (1982)|date=10 June 2015|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 January 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital audio laser-disc prototypes===
In 1974, L. Ottens, director of the audio division of [[Philips]], started a small group with the aim to develop an analog&lt;ref name="Immink"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~immink/pdf/cdstory.htm |title=The CD Story |author=Kees A.

Chris Kornelis, 27 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974.&lt;ref name="Immink"/&gt; In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5&amp;nbsp;cm, the diagonal of an audio cassette.&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="peek"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |work=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10–17 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5394021 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi= 10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heitaro Nakajima]], who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan's national public broadcasting organization [[NHK]] in 1970, became general manager of [[Sony]]'s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital [[PCM adaptor]] audio tape recorder using a [[Betamax]] video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 | title=Heitaro Nakajima | work=Billboard | date=8 January 2000 | accessdate=4 November 2014 | author=McClure, Steve | pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony]] first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30&amp;nbsp;cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100&amp;nbsp;Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using [[Run-length limited|MFM]] modulation.&lt;ref name="SonyHistorical"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | author =  | publisher = AES | accessdate = 14 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056&amp;nbsp;Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|cross-interleaved]] [[error correction]] code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard Compact Disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="SonyHistorical" /&gt; Sony's AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called "Philips Introduce Compact Disc"&lt;ref name="BBC6950933"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | author =  | publisher=BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | accessdate = 17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Eindhoven]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="PhilipsHistorical"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | author =  | publisher = Philips | accessdate = 14 February 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration and standardization===

First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],&lt;ref name=peek /&gt; and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints, while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]]. The ''Compact Disc Story'',&lt;ref name="Immink" /&gt; told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter.

===First ''Red Book'' CDs and players===
“Red Book” was the first standard in the [[Rainbow Books]] series of standards.

Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in [[Langenhagen]] near [[Hannover]], [[Germany]], and quickly passed a series of milestones.

* The first ''test pressing'' was of a recording of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[An Alpine Symphony|Eine Alpensinfonie]]'' (''An Alpine Symphony'') played by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and conducted by [[Herbert von Karajan]], who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-3"&gt;{{ cite press release |url = http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/dossier/optrec/firstcds.html | title = Optical Recording | publisher = Royal Philips Electronics }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first ''public demonstration'' was on the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 1981, when the [[Bee Gees]]' album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'' (1981) was played.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-4"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bilyeu|first = Melinda|author2=Hector Cook |author3=Andrew Môn Hughes  |publisher = Omnibus Press| location = |year = 2004| isbn = 978-1-84449-057-8| title = The Bee Gees:tales of the brothers Gibb| page = 519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first ''commercial'' compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of [[Claudio Arrau]] performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau was invited to the Langenhagen plant to press the start button.
* The first ''popular music'' CD produced at the new factory was ''[[The Visitors (ABBA album)|The Visitors]]'' (1981) by [[ABBA]].&lt;ref name="AutoMR-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=7304|title=And 25 Years Ago Philips Introduced the CD|work=GeekZone|accessdate=11 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first 50 titles were ''released'' in Japan on 1 October 1982, with the first-cataloged CD in this wave being a reissue of [[Billy Joel]]'s ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]''.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802133849/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html|archivedate=2 August 2008|title=Sony History: A Great Invention 100 Years On|publisher=[[Sony]]|accessdate=28 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/about/news/press/20070816_25th_anniversary_cd.wpd "Philips celebrates 25th anniversay of the Compact Disc"], Philips Media Release, 16 August 2007. Retrieved 6 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and North America (where CBS Records released sixteen titles).&lt;ref name="G&amp;M 1983-03-05"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event is often seen as the "Big Bang" of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting [[European classical music|classical music]] and [[audiophile]] communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable [[Walkman]], the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was [[Dire Straits]], with their 1985 album ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]''.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-7"&gt;''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to CD was [[David Bowie]], whose 15 studio albums were made available by [[RCA Records]] in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-8"&gt;The New Schwann Record &amp; Tape Guide Volume 37 No. 2 February 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-9"&gt;MAC Audio News.

===Further development and decline===
The CD was planned to be the successor of the [[gramophone record]] for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium; but from its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, [[Kees Schouhamer Immink|Immink]] and [[Joseph Braat|Braat]] presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd [[Audio Engineering Society|AES]] Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiments Toward an Erasable Compact Disc|url= http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4492|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1985, the computer-readable [[CD-ROM]] (read-only memory) and, in 1990, [[CD-R]]ecordable were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips.&lt;ref name="AutoMR-10"&gt;The world's first CD-R was made by the Japanese firm [[Taiyo Yuden]] Co., Ltd. in 1988 as part of the joint Philips-Sony development effort.&lt;/ref&gt; Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.&lt;ref name=nyt20120718&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of [[Digital distribution|Internet-based distribution]] of files in [[Lossy compression|lossily-compressed]] [[audio format]]s such as [[MP3]], sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s.

==Inner workings==
The process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC Standard 60908&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]
To read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.

When the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.

Different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.&lt;ref&gt;Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Another servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.

Two optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.

The other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.

The sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic "fish-eye" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.

===Digital signal processing===
The first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.
The EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.

After demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.

The Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.

===Player control===
The Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.

==Tray design types==

===Tray loading===
[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]

[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD. As it was easy to manufacture and to use, most CD player manufacturers stayed with the tray style ever since. However, there have been some notable exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.niji.or.jp/home/k-nisi/pd-t09-mecha2.jpg | title = Pioneer "Stable Platter Mechanism" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.audioscope.net/images/pioneerpd97002.jpg | title = Pioneer "Stable Platter Mechanism" | language = | accessdate = | year = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical loading===
During the launch of the first prototype "Goronta" CD player&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |title=Sony History |language= |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130231112/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-20/h5.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sony]] at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the vertical loading design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including [[Luxman|Alpine/Luxman]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] under the [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] brand, [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba/Aurex]]. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thevintageknob.org/DAD/DX104/DX104.html | title = Luxman DX-104 CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-17 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their "Sigma Drive" outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://panasonic.net/history/corporate/products/inp1982.html | title = Panasonic History - Innovative Products - 1982 - CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical loading is similar the one common in [[cassette deck]]s, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.

===Top loading===
[[File:Philips CD 100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Philips CD100 Player]]

In 1983 [[Philips]], at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marantzphilips.nl/philips_cd100_first_cdplayer/ Philips CD100 Player"] - Marantz-Philips Nederlands website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/introduction.html "The history of the CD - The introduction"], Philips Research.&lt;/ref&gt; (Philips audio products were sold as [[Magnavox]] in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD "high end" CD player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |language= |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.

Top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include [[Luxman]]'s D-500 and D-500X series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | title = Luxman D-500X (in Japanese) | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; players and [[Denon]]'s DP-S1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html
 | title = Denon Museum - Model History - 1993 - DP-S1 (in Japanese) | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; both launched in 1993.
Top-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound "DJ" use, such as Technics' SL-P50 (1984–1985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986–1992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.

===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
The Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism.

===Slot loading===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Slot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).
[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism.

==Pickup mechanisms==
[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]
[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]
[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]
Two types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:
* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.
* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s – the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.
[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]
The swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not "skip" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.
This mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.&lt;ref&gt;Philips CD100 Service Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]
The linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more "helper" [[photodiode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sony CDP-101 Service Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical components==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]
A CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''', and a '''tracking mechanism'''.
The drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) – equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).

A TOC or Table of Contents is located after the "lead-in" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The "lead out" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.

==CD player features==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
CD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:

*''Oversampling'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.
*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.
*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.
*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a RAM chip installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM memory buffer for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use less capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Most players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.

==Portable CD players==

===Small portable players===
[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]
A [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s. Portable CD players are powered by batteries and they have a 1/8" headphone jack into which the user plugs a pair of [[headphone]]s. The first portable CD player released was the [[Discman|D-50]] by [[Sony]].&lt;ref name="aye"&gt;Lungu, R. [http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html "History of the Portable Audio Player."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502104636/http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html |date=May 2, 2012 }} 2008-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The D-50 was made available on the market in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/199907/99-059/ | title = Sony Celebrates Walkman 20th Anniversary | publisher = Sony Press Release | accessdate = 2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted for Sony's entire portable [[Compact Disc|CD]] player line.

A 2005 book stated that after [[Apple Computers]] entered the music industry, within ten years it became the dominant seller of portable [[digital audio]] music players (its [[iPod]] line), "...while former giant [[Sony]] (maker of the [portable] [[Walkman]] and [CD] [[Discman]] [was] struggling." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyer |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Godfrey |first2=Paul|last3=Jensen |first3= Robert|last4=Bryce |first4= David|date=2005 |title= Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases|url= |location= |publisher=Wiley Global Edition |page= 5|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This market change was initiated in 1998, when the first portable digital audio player, the Rio personal digital music player, was introduced. Portable MP3 players like the Rio competed with portable CD players. The 64 MB version of the Rio [[MP3]] player enabled users to store about 20 songs on the player.&lt;ref name="Fries 2005 112–113"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fries |first=Bruce |last2=Fries |first2= Marty |date= 2005|title= Digital Audio Essentials|url= |location= |publisher=O'Reilly Media Inc. |pages=112–113 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the benefits of the Rio over portable CD players was that since the Rio had no moving parts, it offered skip-free playback.&lt;ref name="Fries 2005 112–113"/&gt; Since 1998, the price of portable digital audio players has dropped and the storage capacity has increased significantly. In the 2000s, users can "carry [their] entire music collection in a [digital audio] player the size of a cigarette package."&lt;ref name="Fries 2005 112–113"/&gt; The 4 GB [[iPod]], for example, holds over 1,000 songs.&lt;ref name="Fries 2005 112–113"/&gt;

===Boomboxes===
[[File:Sony Boombox circa 2005.JPG|thumb|right|A Sony CD boombox from 2005]]
A [[boombox]] is a common term for a portable [[cassette player|cassette]] and AM/FM radio that consists of an amplifier, two or more [[loudspeaker]]s and a carrying handle. Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. Another modern variant is a DVD player/boombox with a top-loading CD/[[DVD]] drive and an [[LCD]] video screen in the position once occupied by a cassette deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =

==DJ equipment==
[[File:Behringer VMX-200 DJ mixer + Denon DN-2500F dual CD player + RC-44 remote controller.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This example of a CD player used by DJs is the Denon DN-2500 dual CD player, on the right side of the picture. A Behringer VMX-200 [[DJ mixer]] is also shown in the left side, in the foreground.]]
[[Disc jockey]]s (DJs) who are playing a mix of [[song]]s at a [[dance club]], [[rave]], or [[nightclub]] create their dance mixes by having songs playing on two or more sound sources and using a [[DJ mixer]] to transition seamlessly between songs. In the 1970s [[disco]] era, DJs typically used two [[phonograph|record players]].&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Mark. ''Capturing Sound: How Technology Has Changed Music''. University of California Press, 2010. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1980s to the 1990s, two [[compact cassette]] players became a popular sound source for DJs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playlistresearch.com/djmixing.htm|title=Art and History of DJ Mixing by Alex Cosper|website=www.playlistresearch.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, DJs shifted to CDs and then to [[digital audio player]]s. DJs who use CDs and CD players typically use specialized DJ CD players that have features not available on regular CD players.

DJs who are performing "[[scratching]]"–the creation of rhythmic sounds and sound effects from sound recordings–traditionally used [[vinyl record]]s and [[phonograph|turntables]]. In the 2010s, some specialized DJ CD players can be used to create the same "scratching" effects using songs on CDs.

[[File:Coilgun animation.gif|thumb|Simplified diagram of a multistage coilgun with three coils, a barrel, and a [[ferromagnetic]] [[projectile]]]]

A '''coilgun''' or '''Gauss rifle''' is a type of [[projectile]] accelerator consisting of one or more coils used as [[electromagnet]]s in the configuration of a [[linear motor]] that accelerate a [[ferromagnetic]] or conducting projectile to high velocity.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-1"/&gt; In almost all coilgun configurations, the coils and the [[gun barrel]] are arranged on a common axis. It is not a rifle as the barrel is not [[rifling|rifled]]. The name "Gauss" is in reference to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who formulated mathematical descriptions of the [[magnetic]] effect used by magnetic accelerator cannons.

Coilguns generally consist of one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils. The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces. Coilguns are distinct from [[railgun]]s, as the direction of acceleration in a railgun is at right angles to the central axis of the current loop formed by the conducting rails. In addition, railguns usually require the use of sliding contacts to pass a large current through the projectile or [[sabot]] but coilguns do not necessarily require sliding contacts.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-2"/&gt; While some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile. Another form of Gauss Rifle is one which consists of a strong magnet on a rail. There are two metal balls on one end of the magnet. Another ball is placed next to the magnet, but not attracted to it. When the ball is pushed toward the magnet, it accelerates until it hits the magnet with some force and velocity. The [[momentum]] is transferred through the magnet to the last ball, which flies off the end with nearly as much force as it started with.

== History ==

The first operational coilgun was developed and patented by [[Norway|Norwegian]] scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;archive.org: [https://archive.org/stream/PopularMechanics1933/Popular_Mechanics_06_1933#page/n31/mode/2up Popular Mechanics 06 1933 page 819]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US754637?dq=US+754637+A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=raKxVPn1BNP8yQSk-4G4Aw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Texan inventor Virgil Rigsby developed a stationary coilgun that was designed to be used like a [[machine gun]]. It was powered by a large electrical motor and generator.&lt;ref name="googlepatents"/&gt; It appeared in many contemporary science publications, but never piqued the interest of any armed forces.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-3"/&gt;

== Construction ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

There are two main types or setups of a coilgun: single-stage and multistage. A single-stage coilgun uses one electromagnet to propel a projectile. A multistage coilgun uses several electromagnets in succession to progressively increase the speed of the projectile.

=== Ferromagnetic projectiles ===
[[File:EM15-2.jpg|thumb|A single stage coilgun]]

For ferromagnetic projectiles, a single stage coilgun can be formed by a coil of wire, an [[electromagnet]], with a [[ferromagnetic]] projectile placed at one of its ends. This type of coilgun is formed like the [[solenoid]] used in an electromechanical relay, i.e. a current-carrying coil which will draw a ferromagnetic object through its center. A large [[electrical current|current]] is pulsed through the coil of wire and a strong [[magnetic field]] forms, pulling the projectile to the center of the coil. When the projectile nears this point the electromagnet must be switched off, to prevent the projectile from becoming arrested at the center of the electromagnet.

In a multistage design, further electromagnets are then used to repeat this process, progressively accelerating the projectile. In common coilgun designs, the "barrel" of the gun is made up of a track that the projectile rides on, with the driver into the magnetic coils around the track. Power is supplied to the electromagnet from some sort of fast discharge storage device, typically a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], or [[high-capacity high voltage capacitor]]s (one per electromagnet), designed for fast energy discharge. A [[diode]] is used to protect polarity sensitive components (such as semiconductors or electrolytic capacitors) from damage due to inverse polarity of the voltage after turning off the coil.

Many hobbyists use low-cost rudimentary designs to experiment with coilguns, for example using [[photoflash capacitor]]s from a [[disposable camera]], or a capacitor from a standard [[cathode-ray tube]] television as the energy source, and a low [[inductance]] coil to propel the projectile forward.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoAU-5"/&gt;

=== Non-ferromagnetic projectiles ===

Some designs have non-ferromagnetic projectiles, of materials such as [[aluminium]] or [[copper]], with the armature of the projectile acting as an electromagnet with internal current induced by pulses of the acceleration coils.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoAU-7"/&gt;  A [[superconducting]] coilgun called a ''quench gun'' could be created by successively [[Superconducting magnet#Magnet quench|quench]]ing a line of adjacent coaxial superconducting coils forming a gun barrel, generating a wave of magnetic field gradient traveling at any desired speed. A traveling superconducting coil might be made to ride this wave like a [[surfboard]]. The device would be a mass driver or linear synchronous motor with the propulsion energy stored directly in the drive coils.&lt;ref name="Practical Coilgun Design"/&gt; Another method would have non-superconducting acceleration coils and propulsion energy stored outside them but a projectile with superconducting magnets.&lt;ref name="StarTram"/&gt;

Though the cost of power switching and other factors can limit projectile energy, a notable benefit of some coilgun designs over simpler [[railgun]]s is avoiding an intrinsic velocity limit from hypervelocity physical contact and erosion. By having the projectile pulled towards or levitated within the center of the coils as it is accelerated, no physical friction with the walls of the bore occurs. If the bore is a total vacuum (such as a tube with a [[plasma window]]), there is no friction at all, which helps prolong the period of reusability.&lt;ref name = StarTram/&gt;&lt;ref name="airforcereport"/&gt;

=== Switching ===
[[File:Multistage coilgun.jpg|thumb|A multistage coilgun]]

One main obstacle in coilgun design is switching the power through the coils. There are several common solutions—the simplest (and probably least effective) is the [[spark gap]], which releases the stored energy through the coil when the voltage reaches a certain threshold. A better option is to use solid-state switches; these include [[IGBT]]s or power [[MOSFET]]s (which can be switched off mid-pulse) and [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCRs]] (which release all stored energy before turning off).&lt;ref name="Phil's Technology Blog"/&gt;

A quick-and-dirty method for switching, especially for those using a flash camera for the main components, is to use the flash tube itself as a switch. By wiring it in series with the coil, it can silently and non-destructively (assuming that the energy in the capacitor is kept below the tube's safe operating limits) allow a large amount of current to pass through to the coil. Like any flash tube, ionizing the gas in the tube with a high voltage triggers it. However, a large amount of the energy will be dissipated as heat and light, and, due to the tube being a spark gap, the tube will stop conducting once the voltage across it drops sufficiently, leaving some charge remaining on the capacitor.

=== Resistance ===

The [[electrical resistance]] of the coils and the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) of the current source dissipate considerable power.

At low speeds the heating of the coils dominates the percentage efficiency of the coilgun, giving exceptionally low efficiency. However, as speeds climb, mechanical power grows proportional to the speed, but, correctly switched, the resistive losses are largely unaffected, and thus these resistive losses become much smaller in percentage terms.

=== Magnetic circuit ===

Ideally, 100% of the magnetic flux generated by the coil would be delivered to and act on the projectile; in reality this is impossible due to energy losses always present in a real system, which cannot be eliminated entirely

With a simple air-cored solenoid, the majority of the magnetic flux is not coupled into the projectile because of the magnetic circuit's high [[reluctance]]. The uncoupled flux generates a magnetic field that stores energy in the surrounding air. The energy that is stored in this field does not simply disappear from the magnetic circuit once the [[capacitor]] finishes discharging, instead returning to the coilgun's electric circuit. Because the coilgun's electric circuit is inherently analogous to an LC oscillator, the unused energy returns in the reverse direction ('ringing'), which can seriously damage polarized capacitors such as [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.

Reverse charging can be prevented by a [[diode]] connected in reverse-parallel across the capacitor terminals; as a result, the current keeps flowing until the diode and the coil's resistance dissipate the field energy as heat. While this is a simple and frequently utilized solution, it requires an additional expensive high-power diode and a well-designed coil with enough thermal mass and heat dissipation capability in order to prevent component failure.

Some designs attempt to recover the energy stored in the magnetic field by using a pair of diodes. These diodes, instead of being forced to dissipate the remaining energy, recharge the capacitors with the right polarity for the next discharge cycle. This will also avoid the need to fully recharge the capacitors, thus significantly reducing charge times. However, the practicality of this solution is limited by the resulting high recharge current through the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) of the capacitors; the ESR will dissipate some of the recharge current, generating heat within the capacitors and potentially shortening their lifetime.

To reduce component size, weight, durability requirements, and most importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more energy to the projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent by the use of back iron and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from magnetic steel (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses.

=== Ferromagnetic projectile saturation ===

Another significant limitation of the coilgun is the occurrence of [[magnetic saturation]] in the ferromagnetic projectile. When the flux in the projectile lies in the linear portion of its material's B(H) curve, the force applied to the core is proportional to the square of coil current (I)—the field (H) is linearly dependent on I, B is linearly dependent on H and force is linearly dependent on the product BI. This relationship continues until the core is saturated; once this happens B will only increase marginally with H (and thus with I), so force gain is linear. Since losses are proportional to I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing current beyond this point eventually decreases efficiency although it may increase the force. This puts an absolute limit on how much a given projectile can be accelerated with a single stage at acceptable efficiency.

=== Projectile magnetization and reaction time ===

Apart from saturation, the B(H) dependency often contains a [[hysteresis loop]] and the reaction time of the projectile material may be significant. The hysteresis means that the projectile becomes permanently magnetized and some energy will be lost as a permanent magnetic field of the projectile. The projectile reaction time, on the other hand, makes the projectile reluctant to respond to abrupt B changes; the flux will not rise as fast as desired while current is applied and a B tail will occur after the coil field has disappeared. This delay decreases the force, which would be maximized if the H and B were in phase.

== Induction coilguns ==

Most of the work to develop coilguns as hyper-velocity launchers has used "air-cored" systems to get around the limitations associated with ferromagnetic projectiles. In these systems, the projectile is accelerated by a moving coil "armature". If the armature is configured as one or more "shorted turns" then induced currents will result as a consequence of the time variation of the current in the static launcher coil (or coils).

In principle, coilguns can also be constructed in which the moving coils are fed with current via sliding contacts. However, the practical construction of such arrangements requires the provision of reliable high speed sliding contacts. Although feeding current to a multi-turn coil armature might not require currents as large as those required in a [[railgun]], the elimination of the need for high speed sliding contacts is an obvious potential advantage of the induction coilgun relative to the [[railgun]].

Air cored systems also introduce the penalty that much higher currents may be needed than in an "iron cored" system. Ultimately though, subject to the provision of appropriately rated power supplies, air cored systems can operate with much greater magnetic field strengths than "iron cored" systems, so that, ultimately, much higher accelerations and forces should be possible.

== Potential uses ==
[[File:EMmortar.jpg|thumb|upright|A M934 mortar round is adapted for experimental coilgun launch with a conformal armature tail kit, to be fired through a barrel composed of short solenoidal electromagnets stacked end to end]]

Small coilguns are recreationally made by hobbyists, typically up to several [[joule]]s to tens of joules projectile energy (the latter comparable to a typical [[air gun]] and an order of magnitude less than a firearm) while ranging from under one percent to several percent efficiency.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-8"/&gt;

In 2018, a Los Angeles-based company Arcflash Labs offered the first coilgun for sale to the general public.  It fired 6-gram steel slugs at 45 m/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 5 joules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hackaday.com/2018/07/12/you-can-now-buy-a-practical-gauss-gun/|title=You Can Now Buy a Practical Gauss Gun|date=2018-07-12|work=Hackaday|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much higher efficiency and energy can be obtained with designs of greater expense and sophistication. In 1978, Bondaletov in the USSR achieved record acceleration with a single stage by sending a 2-gram ring to 5000&amp;nbsp;m/s in 1&amp;nbsp;cm of length, but the most efficient modern designs tend to involve many stages.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-9"/&gt; Above 90% efficiency is estimated for some vastly larger superconducting concepts for space launch.&lt;ref name = airforcereport/&gt; An experimental 45-stage [[DARPA]] coilgun [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] design is 22% efficient, with 1.6 [[megajoule]]s [[Kinetic Energy|KE]] delivered to a round.&lt;ref name="EMmortar"/&gt;

[[File:Electromagneticgunlaunch.jpg|thumb|left|A large coilgun concept, a coaxial electromagnetic launcher firing projectiles [[Space gun#Getting to orbit|to orbit]]]]

Though facing the challenge of competitiveness versus conventional guns (and sometimes [[railgun]] alternatives), coilguns are being researched for weaponry.&lt;ref name = EMmortar/&gt;

The [[DARPA]] Electromagnetic Mortar program is an example of potential benefits, if practical challenges like sufficiently low weight can be managed. The coilgun would be relatively silent with no smoke giving away its position, though a coilgun projectile would still create a [[sonic boom]] if supersonic. Adjustable yet smooth acceleration of the projectile throughout the barrel can allow somewhat higher velocity, with a predicted range increase of 30% for a 120mm EM mortar over the conventional version of similar length. With no separate propellant charges to load, the researchers envision the firing rate to approximately double.&lt;ref name = EMmortar/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmyTimes"/&gt;

In 2006, a 120mm prototype was under construction for evaluation, though time before reaching field deployment, if such occurs, was estimated then as 5 to 10+ years by [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref name = EMmortar/&gt;&lt;ref name = ArmyTimes/&gt; In 2011, development was proposed of an 81mm coilgun mortar to operate with a hybrid-electric version of the future [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]].&lt;ref name="AutoAU-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoAU-11"/&gt;

[[Electromagnetic_Aircraft_Launch_System|Electromagnetic aircraft catapults]] are planned, including on board future U.S. [[Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier]]s. An experimental induction coilgun version of an Electromagnetic Missile Launcher (EMML) has been tested for launching [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]] missiles.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-12"/&gt; A coilgun-based [[Active protection system#Hardkill measures|active defense]] system for tanks is under development at [[Harbin Institute of Technology|HIT]] in China.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-13"/&gt;

Coilgun potential has been perceived as extending beyond military applications. Challenging and corresponding to a magnitude of capital investment that few entities could readily fund, gigantic coilguns with projectile mass and velocity on the scale of [[gigajoule]]s of [[kinetic energy]] (as opposed to [[megajoule]]s or less) have not been developed so far, but such have been proposed as launchers from the Moon or from Earth:

* An ambitious lunar-base proposal considered within a 1975 [[NASA]] study would have involved a 4000-ton coilgun sending 10 million tons of lunar material to [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L5]] in support of massive [[space colonization]] (cumulatively over years, utilizing a large 9900-ton power plant).&lt;ref name="AutoAU-14"/&gt;
* A 1992 NASA study calculated that a 330-ton lunar superconducting quenchgun could launch annually 4400 projectiles, each 1.5 tons and mostly [[liquid oxygen]] payload, using a relatively small amount of power, 350 [[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] average.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-15"/&gt;
* After [[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]] estimated how to meet aerothermal requirements for heat shields with terrestrial surface launch, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] investigated electromagnetic launchers to [[low earth orbit|orbit]], in addition to researching other EML applications, both railguns and coilguns. In 1990, a kilometer-long coilgun was proposed for launch of small satellites.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoAU-17"/&gt;
* Later investigations at [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]] included a 2005 study of the [[StarTram]] concept for an extremely long coilgun, one version conceived as launching passengers to orbit with survivable acceleration.&lt;ref name="AutoAU-18"/&gt;
* A [[mass driver]] is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable holder containing a payload. Once the payload has been accelerated, the two separate, and the holder is slowed and recycled for another payload.

'''Coring''' happens when a heated alloy, such as a [[Cupronickel|Cu-Ni]] system, cools in non-equilibrium conditions. This causes the exterior of the material to solidify before the interior. Coring causes the centers of the grains to retain more of the higher melting temperature element. In this case, the [[dendrite (crystal)|dendrite]] arms formed from the exterior have a different composition than the alloy in the inner regions, resulting in a local compositional difference. Coring results in poor mechanical performance of the overall product.{{Explain|date=August 2018}}

Coring is predominantly observed in alloys having a marked difference between [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures. It is often being removed by subsequent [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] and/or [[hot-working]]. It is exploited in [[zone refining]] techniques to produce high purity metals.

'''CYPRES''' is an acronym for '''Cy'''bernetic '''P'''arachute '''Re'''lease '''S'''ystem. It refers to a specific make and model of an [[automatic activation device]] (AAD), a device that automatically activate a [[parachute]] (typically as a reserve system for a skydiver) under certain circumstances. A CYPRES is designed to activate the reserve parachute at a preset altitude if the rate of descent is over a certain threshold. The manufacturer of the CYPRES is Airtec.

The CYPRES works by using a cutter to cut the reserve container closing loop. A spring-loaded [[pilot chute]] then leaves the container and breaks through the skydiver's slipstream to begin reserve deployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspa.org "United States Parachute Association"] by [http://www.uspa.org USPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CYPRES comes in five different models: Expert, Student, Tandem, Speed and Wingsuit. The basic operation of the units is the same; only the activation parameters are different, having been optimized for different types of skydiving.

[[File:Disintermediation graphic.PNG|thumb|The disintermediation process]]
[[File:Arrow diagram transitive.png|thumb|Intermediary B may be bypassed by A to connect with c directly]]
[[Image:Safewaydeliverytruck.jpg|thumb|Although [[Webvan]] failed in its goal of disintermediating the [[North America]]n [[supermarket]] industry, several supermarket chains (like [[Safeway Inc.]]) have launched their own delivery services to target the niche market to which Webvan catered.]]
'''Disintermediation''' is the removal of [[intermediary|intermediaries]] in [[economics]] from a [[supply chain]], or '''cutting out the middlemen''' in connection with a transaction or a series of transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Wake Forest. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2711379 Infinite Financial Intermediation]. page 50. Law Review 643 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of going through traditional [[distribution channels]], which had some type of [[intermediary]] (such as a [[distributor]], [[wholesaler]], [[broker]], or [[agency (law)|agent]]), companies may now deal with customers directly, for example via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=chircu1999/&gt; Hence, the use of '''factory direct''' and '''direct from the factory''' to mean the same thing.

Disintermediation may decrease the total cost of servicing customers and may allow the manufacturer to increase [[profit margins]] and/or reduce [[price]]s.  Disintermediation initiated by consumers is often the result of high [[market transparency]], in that buyers are aware of supply prices direct from the manufacturer. Buyers may choose to bypass the middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) to buy directly from the manufacturer, and pay less. Buyers can alternatively elect to purchase from wholesalers. Often, a [[business-to-consumer]] electronic commerce (B2C) company functions as the bridge between buyer and manufacturer.

However manufacturers will still incur distribution costs, such as the physical transport of goods, packaging in small units, advertising, and customer helplines, some or all of which would previously have been borne by the intermediary.  To illustrate, a typical B2C supply chain is composed of four or five entities. These are the [[Distributor (business)|supplier]],  [[manufacturer]], [[wholesaler]], [[retailer]] and [[buyer]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==History==

The term was originally applied to the [[bank]]ing industry in 1967; disintermediation occurred when consumers avoided the  [[intermediation]] of banks by investing directly in [[Security (finance)|securities]] (government and private bonds, [[insurance companies]], [[hedge fund]]s, [[mutual fund]]s and [[stock]]s) rather than leaving their money in [[savings account]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, R. (1996). Disintermediation and the Internet. Government information quarterly, 13(1), 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Monetary Economics in Globalised Financial Markets |last=Belke |first=Ansgar |author2=Thorsten Polleit |year=2011 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=3540710027 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1brgD-N04X8C |accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cause was a U.S.&amp;nbsp;government regulation ([[Regulation&amp;nbsp;Q]]) which limited the [[interest rate]] paid on interest bearing accounts that were insured by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]].

It was later applied more generally to "[[cutting out the middleman]]" in commerce, though the financial meaning remained predominant. Only in the late&amp;nbsp;1990s did it become widely popularized.

==Impact of Internet-related disintermediation upon various industries==
It has been argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market [[Transparency (market)|transparency]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  Disintermediation has acquired a new meaning with the advent of the virtual marketplace.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  The virtual marketplace sellers like [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] are edging out the middlemen. Direct sellers and buyers connect with each other because of the platform created by the virtual marketplace vendor. There is [[quid pro quo]] for the vendor for the use of the platform, else it would make no business sense to create such a platform.  If the buyer, having connected with the seller, circumvents the platform and talks to the seller and does her deal directly with the seller, then the platform owner is unlikely to get her revenue share.  This may be considered a new form of disintermediation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Discussion===
In the non-Internet world, disintermediation has been an important strategy for many [[big box retailer]]s like [[Walmart]], which attempt to reduce prices by reducing the number of intermediaries between the supplier and the buyer. Disintermediation is also closely associated with the idea of [[Just In Time (business)|just in time manufacturing]], as the removal of the need for [[inventory]] removes one function of an intermediary.  The existence of laws which discourage disintermediation has been cited as a reason for the poor economic performance of [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

However, Internet-related disintermediation occurred less frequently than many expected during the [[dot com boom]]. Retailers and wholesalers provide essential functions such as the extension of credit, aggregation of products from different suppliers, and processing of returns. In addition, shipping goods to and from the manufacturer can in many cases be far less efficient than [[shipping]] them to a store where the consumer can pick them up (if the consumer's trip to the store is ignored). In response to the threat of disintermediation, some retailers have attempted to integrate a virtual presence and a physical presence in a strategy known as [[bricks and clicks]].

==Reintermediation==
{{main |Re-intermediation}}
Reintermediation can be defined as the reintroduction of an intermediary between end users (consumers) and a producer. This term applies especially to instances in which disintermediation has occurred first.&lt;ref name=chircu1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chircu|first=Alina M.|author2=Robert J. Kauffman|title=Strategies for Internet Middlemen in the Intermediation/Disintermediation/Reintermediation Cycle|journal=Electronic Markets|year=1999|volume=9|issue=1-2|doi=10.1080/101967899359337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the Internet revolution, [[electronic commerce]] was seen as a tool of disintermediation for cutting operating costs. The concept was that by allowing consumers to purchase products directly from producers via the Internet, the product delivery chain would be drastically shortened, thereby "disintermediating" the standard supply model middlemen. However, what largely happened was that new intermediaries appeared in the digital landscape (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]]).&lt;ref&gt; Sarkar, Butler and Steinfield. [http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol1/issue3/sarkar.html Intermediaries and Cybermediaries: A Continuing Role for Mediating Players in the Electronic Marketplace]. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reintermediation occurred due to many new problems associated with the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product's availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete with the rest of the Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded.

===Examples of companies===
Notable examples of disintermediation include [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]] and Apple, which sell many of their systems direct to the consumer&amp;mdash;thus bypassing traditional retail chains, having succeeded in creating brands well recognized by customers, profitable and with continuous growth.

An '''Eidophor''' was a [[television]] projector used to create theater-sized images. The name Eidophor is derived from the Greek word-roots ‘eido’ and ‘phor’ meaning 'image' and 'bearer' (carrier). Its basic technology was the use of [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] charges to deform an [[oil]] surface.

==Origins and use==
The idea for the original Eidophor was conceived in 1939 in [[Zurich]] by Dr. [[Fritz Fischer (physicist)|Fritz Fischer]] and the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]], with the first prototype being unveiled in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Winston, Brian, ''Media Technology and Society'', 1998 Routledge, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was granted by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (patent no. 2,391,451) to Friederich Ernst Fischer for the "Process and appliance for projecting television pictures" on 25 December 1945. 

Following the Second World War, [[Paramount Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_071048&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/cinema-television/cinema_television_chronology.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[20th Century Fox]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~ichriss/ Ilias Chrissochoidis] (ed.), ''[http://www.stanford.edu/~ichriss/Skouras.htm Spyros P. Skouras], [https://www.academia.edu/2542182/Spyros_P._Skouras_Memoirs_1893-1953_ Memoirs (1893–1953)]'' (Stanford, 2013), pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; experimented with the concept of "theatre television", where television images would be broadcast onto cinema screens.&lt;ref&gt;Gomery, Douglas, ''Shared Pleasures: A History of Movie Presentation in the United States'', 1992 University of Wisconsin Press, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 cinemas were set up for the project, which failed because of financial losses and the refusal of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to grant theatre owners their own [[UHF]] bands for presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Winston, Brian, ''Misunderstanding Media'', 1986 Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

An original August 1952 magazine article in the Radio and Television News&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/eidophor.html]&lt;/ref&gt; credits the development of the Eidophor to Dr. [[Edgar Gretener]]. It was not until around the time of this article that Gretener took a lead in commercialising the Eidophor, following Fischer’s death in 1947. 

Eidophors used an optical system somewhat similar to a conventional [[movie projector]], but substituted a slowly rotating mirrored disk or dish for the film. The disk was covered with a thin film of transparent high-viscosity oil, and through the use of a scanned [[electron]] beam, electrostatic charges could be deposited onto the oil, causing its surface to deform. Light was shone on the disc by a striped mirror consisting of strips of reflective material alternating with transparent non-reflective areas. Areas of the oil unaffected by the electron beam would allow the light to be reflected directly back to the mirror and towards the light source, whereas light passing through deformed areas would be displaced and would pass through the adjacent transparent areas and onwards through the projection system. &lt;!-- More details needed on the mirrors, etc.--&gt; As the disk rotated, a [[doctor blade]] discharged and smoothed the ripples in the oil, readying it for re-use on another television frame.

The Eidophor was a large and cumbersome device and not commonly used until there was a need for good-quality large-screen projection. This opportunity arose as part of the [[NASA]] space program, where the technology was deployed in mission control.

Eidophors were also used in stadiums by touring music groups for [[live event visual amplification]].

Simple Eidophors produced black-and-white images. Later units used a [[color wheel (optics)|color wheel]] (equivalent to the [[color television]] standard [[CBS]] tried to bring to the market against [[RCA]]/[[NBC]]'s FCC-approved [[NTSC]] system, and today's [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projection system) to produce red, green, and blue fields. The last models produced used separate red, green, and blue units in a single case. The Eidophor was 80 times brighter than CRT projectors of the time. The last Eidophors were able to project colour images of up to 18 metres in width. Advances in [[Comparison of display technology|projection television technology]] in the 1990s brought about the end of the Eidophor. The new devices were smaller and cheaper and produced comparable results. [[Large-screen television technology|Current technologies]] include the liquid-crystal display (LCD) and digital light processing (DLP) projectors, both of which produce superior results from easily portable devices.

Founded in 1948, the '''Electronic Industries Association of Japan''' (EIAJ) was one of two Japanese electronics trade organizations that were merged into the [[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association]] (JEITA).

Prior to the merger, EIAJ created a number of electronics industry standards that have had some use outside Japan, including:

*The [[EIAJ connector]]s used for DC power (EIAJ RC-5320A, EIAJ RC-5321, and EIAJ RC-5322
*The [[D-Terminal]] connector (RC-5237), used instead of three RCA plugs for component video connections.
*The [[TOSLINK]] (EIAJ Optical, RC-5720C) optical S/PDIF audio connector.
*The [[EIAJ-1]] [[videotape]] format, the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast video tape recording, released in 1969.

Another standard is the multi-channel TV sound system used with the NTSC-J analog TV system. It is often referred to simply as [[EIAJ MTS|EIAJ]], or sometimes as FM-FM audio.

== Transistor nomenclature==
The Japanese [[technical standard]] JIS-C-7102 provides a method of developing part numbers for transistor devices.&lt;ref&gt; Larry D. Wolfgang and Charles L. Hutchinson (ed) ''The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs 1991 Sixty-Eighth edition''ARRL, 1990 {{ISBN|0-87259-168-9}},  page 35-15 &lt;/ref&gt; The part number has up to five fields, for example in the number 2SC82DA:
* The first digit "2" indicates this is a 3 lead device ( a [[diode]] would have a prefix numeral 1)
* The letters "S" is common for all EIAJ registered semiconductors
* The following letter designates polarity and general application of the device. For transistors:
** A PNP high frequency
** B PNP low frequency
** C NPN high frequency
** D NPN low frequency
** E P-gate [[thyristor]]
** F N-base [[unijunction transistor]]
** J P-channel [[field effect transistor]]
** K N-channel field effect transistor
** M bidrectional triode thyristor
*The numerals following indicate the order in which the application was received, starting at 11
* A suffix letter indicates improved characteristics

'''Exar Corporation''' is an [[United States|American]] semiconductor manufacturer which was acquired by [[MaxLinear Inc.|MaxLinear]] in May 2017 and maintained as a wholly owned subsidiary. It was established in 1971 as a subsidiary of the Japanese firm [[Rohm]].

==History==
The Japanese [[semiconductor company]] [[Rohm]] established Exar as a California-based American subsidiary in 1971.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/exar-corp-history/|title=International Directory of Company Histories|last=|first=|publisher=St. James Press|year=1996|isbn=|volume=Vol. 14|location=|pages=|via=FundingUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuit boards]] [[Integrated circuit design|designed]] and manufactured by Rohm were [[Integrated circuit development|developed]] in the United States, and establishing an American subsidiary provided closer ties to the design process and provided a marketing foothold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early 1980s, when Exar was running sales figures of around {{US$|25 million}} annually, only about ⅓ of sales were through its parent, Rohm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Part of the success of Exar and Rohm in the early 1980s stemmed from proprietary technologies developed between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of pressure from the U.S. Government for Japan to reduce its involvement in American industry, in particular in the semiconductor industry, Rohm began slowly divesting itself of Exar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following Exar's [[initial public offering]] in 1985, Rohm's share of ownership had dropped to under 70%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Exar's acquisition of Exel Microelectronics in the mid-1980s contributed heavily to a financial downturn in the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Excar purchased Exel for its technology, but also for its chip fabrication facilities; however, unbeknownst to Exar at the time of purchase, those plants were not run-ready and required large amounts of capital investment, which ate into Exar profits through the end of the decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In response to these problems, Rohm reversed its position on Exar by purchasing outstanding stock, leading to its again fully owning the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reacquisition by Rohm freed Exar to fully capitalize assets acquired from Exel and turn up the investment in research and development, leading again to profitability based in large part of new introductions in the [[EEPROM]] and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] product spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After Rohm had rescued the company and supported its return to profitability, it changed course and began divesting again, leading in 1990 to holding less than 50 percent of Exar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From its inception, Exar's top executive staff and board had been picked by Rohm, and consisted largely of Japanese [[expatriate]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This changed in 1992 when Rohm removed Exar's [[chief executive officer]], Nabuo Hatta, who had served in an executive post since at least 1985, when he was [[President (corporate title)|president]] of the company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Exar's board subsequently hired George Wells, a Scotsman educated at the [[University of Glasgow]], as the company's new chief executive; Wells had previously held positions at [[General Electric]] and [[Lsi logic|LSI Logic]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wells oversaw a reorganization and re-prioritization of product offerings and introduced a culture of quality, leading to major increases in sales and income.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Armed with a large cash surplus, and following Rohm's final divestment of Exar assets in 1994, Wells went on an acquisition spree in 1994 and 1995 which led to the purchases of Origin Technology, Micro Power Systems, Startech Semiconductor and Silicon Microstructures&lt;!-- unsure if this is the same Silicon Microstructures which as a paragraph in the Elmos Semiconductor article. --&gt;; all in all, these purchases enriched the technologies available to Exar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Acquiring so many companies in such a short period had consequences for the company, and Exar lost its profitability by early 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On April 3, 2009,  Exar Corporation closed the acquisition of [[Hifn|hi/fn, inc.]], a transaction which included stock and about {{US$|67 million}} in cash.&lt;ref name=exar-pr&gt;{{cite press |title=Exar Corporation Closes Hifn Acquisition|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exar-corporation-closes-hifn-acquisition-61730682.html |date= April 3, 2009 |accessdate= September 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Form 8K: Changes in Control of Registrant |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065246/000119312509075549/d8k.htm |publisher= United States Securities and Exchange Commission |date= April 3, 2009 |accessdate= September 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Exar Corporation Announces Completion of Exchange |url= http://www.exar.com/Common/Content/News.aspx?id=5004 |archivedate= September 30, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110930091207/http://www.exar.com/Common/Content/News.aspx?id=5004  |date= April 3, 2009 |accessdate= September 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, 2013, Exar acquired the assets of Altior in [[Eatontown, New Jersey]].

An '''explosimeter''' is a [[gas detector]] which is used to measure the amount of combustible gases present in a sample.  When a percentage of the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) of an atmosphere is exceeded, an alarm signal on the instrument is activated.  "Explosimeter" is a registered trademark of MSA.[http://www.msanorthamerica.com/catalog/product1084.html]

The device, also called a [[combustible gas detector]], operates on the principle of resistance proportional to heat—a wire is heated, and a sample of the gas is introduced to the hot wire. Combustible gases burn in the presence of the hot wire, thus increasing the resistance and disturbing a [[Wheatstone bridge]], which gives the reading.

A [[flashback arrestor]] is installed in the device to avoid the explosimeter igniting the sample external to the device.

Note, that the detection readings of an explosimeter are only accurate if the gas being sampled has the same characteristics and response as the [[calibration gas]].  Most explosimeters are calibrated to [[methane]] or [[hydrogen]].

FOUPs began to appear along with the first 300mm wafer processing tools in the mid 1990s.  The size of the wafers and their comparative lack of rigidity meant that [[Smif interface|SMIF]] was not a viable technology.  FOUPs were designed with the constraints of 300mm in mind, with the removable cassette being replaced by fins in the FOUP which hold the wafers in place, and the bottom opening door being replaced by a front opening door to allow robot handling mechanisms to access the wafers directly from the FOUP.  The weight of a fully loaded 25 wafer FOUP at around 9 kilograms means that automated material handling systems are essential for all but the smallest of fabrication plants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} To allow this, each FOUP has various  coupling plates, pins and holes to allow the FOUP to be located on a load port, and to be manipulated by the AMHS (Automated Material Handling System).  FOUPs may also contain [[Radio frequency|RF]] tags that allow them to be identified by readers on tools, in the AMHS etc.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} FOUPs are available in several colors, depending on the customers wish.

'''Fusible links''' include mechanical and electrical devices.  

A '''mechanical fusible link''' is a device consisting of two strips of metal soldered together with a [[fusible alloy]] that is designed to melt at a specific temperature, thus allowing the two pieces to separate.  Mechanical fusible links are utilized as the triggering device in [[fire sprinkler]] systems and mechanical automatic door release mechanisms that close fire doors in warehouses, etc.  Some high-security safes also utilize fusible link-based [[relocking device|relockers]] as a defense against torches and heat-producing tools. Mechanical fusible links come in a variety of designs and different temperature ratings.

An '''electrical fusible link''' is a type of [[fuse (electrical)|electrical fuse]] that is constructed simply with a short piece of wire typically four [[American wire gauge]] sizes smaller than the wire that is being protected. For example, an AWG 16 fusible link might be used to protect AWG 12 wiring. Electrical fusible links are common in high-current automotive applications.  The wire in an electrical fusible link is encased in high-temperature fire-resistant insulation to reduce hazards when the wire melts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whiteproducts.com/fusible-faqs.shtml White Products Fusible Link Wire FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Jim Horner, ''Automotive electrical handbook'', Penguin, 1986, {{ISBN|0-89586-238-7}},  pages 36-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magellan GPS Blazer12.jpg|right|thumb|Civilian GPS receiver ("[[GPS navigation device]]") in a marine application.]]

'''[[Global Positioning System]]''' ('''GPS''') satellites broadcast [[microwave]] '''signals''' to enable GPS receivers on or near the Earth's surface to determine location and time and derive [[velocity]]. The GPS system itself is operated by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) for use by both the military and the general public.

[[GPS signals#Navigation message|GPS signals]] include ranging signals, used to measure the distance to the satellite, and navigation messages. The navigation messages include ''[[ephemeris]]'' data, used to calculate the position of each satellite in orbit, and information about the time and status of the entire satellite constellation, called the ''[[#Almanac|almanac]]''.

There are four signals available for civilian use. In order of date of introduction, these are: [[#Legacy GPS signals|L1&amp;nbsp;C/A]], [[#L2C|L2C]], [[#L5, Safety of Life|L5]] and [[#L1C|L1C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Civil Signals|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/modernization/civilsignals/}}&lt;/ref&gt; L1&amp;nbsp;C/A is also called the ''legacy signal'' and is broadcast by all satellites. The other signals are called ''modernized signals'' and are not broadcast by all satellites. In addition, there are ''restricted signals'', also broadcast to the general public, but whose encoding is secret and are intended to be used only by authorized parties. Nonetheless, some limited use of restricted signals can be made by civilians without access to the secret encoding details; this is called ''codeless'' and ''semi-codeless'' access, and is officially supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Codeless/Semi-Codeless GPS Access Commitments |url=http://www.gps.gov/technical/codeless/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interface to the User Segment ([[GPS receiver]]s) is described in the [http://www.gps.gov/technical/icwg/ Interface Control Documents (ICD)]. The format of civilian signals is described in the [[#Interface Specification|Interface Specification (IS)]] which is a subset of the ICD.

== Common characteristics ==
The GPS satellites (called ''space vehicles'' in the GPS interface specification documents) transmit simultaneously several ranging codes and navigation data using [[binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK).
Only a limited number of central frequencies are used; satellites using the same frequency are distinguished by using different ranging codes; in other words, GPS uses [[code division multiple access]]. The ranging codes are also called ''chipping codes'' (in reference to CDMA/[[DSSS]]), ''[[pseudorandom noise]]'' and ''[[pseudorandom binary sequence]]s'' (in reference to the fact that it is predictable, but statistically it resembles noise).

Some satellites transmit several BPSK streams at the same frequency in quadrature, in a form of [[quadrature amplitude modulation]]. However, unlike typical QAM systems where a single bit stream is split in two half-symbol-rate bit streams to improve [[spectral efficiency]], in GPS signals the in-phase and quadrature components are modulated by separate (but functionally related) bit streams.

{{further|List of GPS satellites#PRN to SVN history}}
Satellites are uniquely identified by a serial number called ''space vehicle number'' (SVN) which does not change during its lifetime. In addition, all operating satellites are numbered with a ''space vehicle identifier'' (SV ID) and ''pseudorandom noise number'' (PRN number) which uniquely identifies the ranging codes that a satellite uses. There is a fixed [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] between SV identifiers and PRN numbers described in the interface specification.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=tables 3-Ia, 3-Ib (p.&amp;nbsp;6&amp;ndash;8)}} Unlike SVNs, the SV ID/PRN number of a satellite may be changed (also changing the ranging codes it uses). At any point in time, any SV ID/PRN number is in use by at most a single satellite. A single SV ID/PRN number may have been used by several satellites at different points in time and a single satellite may have used different SV ID/PRN numbers at different points in time. The current SVNs and PRN numbers for the GPS constellation may be found at [http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=constellationStatus NAVCEN].

== Legacy GPS signals ==
The original GPS design contains two ranging codes: the ''coarse/acquisition'' (C/A) code, which is freely available to the public, and the restricted ''precision'' (P) code, usually reserved for military applications.

=== Coarse/acquisition code ===
The C/A PRN codes are [[Gold code]]s with a period of 1023 chips transmitted at 1.023&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, causing the code to repeat every 1&amp;nbsp;millisecond. They are combined with a [[#Navigation message|navigation message]] using [[exclusive or]] and the resulting bit stream is used for modulation as [[#Common characteristics|previously described]]. These codes only match up, or strongly [[autocorrelation|autocorrelate]] when they are almost exactly aligned. Each satellite uses a unique PRN code, which does not [[cross-correlation|correlate]] well with any other satellite's PRN code. In other words, the PRN codes are highly [[orthogonality#Communications|orthogonal]] to one another. The 1&amp;nbsp;ms&amp;nbsp;period of the C/A code corresponds to a 299,8&amp;nbsp;km symbol length, and the alignment of the C/A bit stream resolves phase information to a precision of 293&amp;nbsp;m.

The C/A codes are generated by combining (using "exclusive or") 2-bit streams generated by maximal period 10 stage [[linear feedback shift registers]] (LFSR). Different codes are obtained by selectively delaying one of those bit streams. Thus:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{C/A}_i(t)=A(t)\oplus B(t-D_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{C/A}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the code with PRN number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the first LFSR whose generator polynomial is &lt;math&gt;x\to x^{10}+x^3+1&lt;/math&gt;, and initial state is 1111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the second LFSR whose generator polynomial is &lt;math&gt;x\to x^{10}+x^9+x^8+x^6+x^3+x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; and initial state is also 1111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is a delay (by an integer number of periods) specific to each PRN number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;; it is designated in the GPS interface specification.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=tables 3-Ia, 3-Ib (p.&amp;nbsp;6&amp;ndash;8)}}
:&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; is exclusive or.
The arguments of the functions therein are the number of ''bits'' or ''chips'' since their epochs, starting at 0. The epoch of the LFSRs is the point at which they are at the initial state; and for the overall C/A codes it is the start of any UTC second plus any integer number of milliseconds. The output of LFSRs at negative arguments is defined consistent with the period which is 1,023 chips (this provision is necessary because &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may have a negative argument using the above equation).

The delay for PRN numbers 34 and 37 is the same; therefore their C/A codes are identical and are not transmitted at the same time{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.2.1.3, table 3-Ia (p.&amp;nbsp;4, 7)}} (it may make one or both of those signals unusable due to mutual interference depending on the relative power levels received on each GPS receiver).

=== Precision code ===
{{see also|Error analysis for the Global Positioning System#Anti-spoofing}}

The P-code is also a PRN; however, each satellite's P-code PRN code is 6.187104&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; bits long (773,388 GByte) and only repeats once a week (it is transmitted at 10.23 Mbit/s). The extreme length of the P-code increases its correlation gain and eliminates any range ambiguity within the [[Solar System]]. However, the code is so long and complex it was believed that a receiver could not directly acquire and synchronize with this signal alone. It was expected that the receiver would first lock onto the relatively simple C/A code and then, after obtaining the current time and approximate position, synchronize with the P-code.

Whereas the C/A PRNs are unique for each satellite, the P-code PRN is actually a small segment of a master P-code approximately 2.35&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; bits in length (235,000,000,000,000 bits, ~26.716 terabytes) and each satellite repeatedly transmits its assigned segment of the master code.

To prevent unauthorized users from using or potentially interfering with the military signal through [[spoofing attack|spoofing]], it was decided to encrypt the P-code. To that end the P-code was modulated with the ''W-code'', a special encryption sequence, to generate the ''Y-code''. The Y-code is what the satellites have been transmitting since the [[Selective availability anti-spoofing module|anti-spoofing module]] was set to the "on" state. The encrypted signal is referred to as the ''P(Y)-code''.

The details of the W-code are kept secret, but it is known that it is applied to the P-code at approximately 500&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a slower rate than that of the P-code itself by a factor of approximately 20. This has allowed companies to develop semi-codeless approaches for tracking the P(Y) signal, without knowledge of the W-code itself.

In addition to the PRN ranging codes, a receiver needs to know detailed information about each satellite's position and the network. The GPS design has this information [[modulated]] on top of both the C/A and P(Y) ranging codes at 50&amp;nbsp;bit/s and calls it the ''navigation message''. The navigation message format described in this section is called LNAV data (for ''legacy navigation'').

The navigation message conveys information which can be classified in 3 broad areas:
*The GPS date and time, plus the satellite's status and an indication of its health.
*The [[ephemeris]]: orbital information which allows the receiver to calculate the position of the satellite. Each satellite transmits its own ephemeris.
*The almanac data: contains information and status concerning all the satellites; each satellite transmits almanac data for several (possibly all) satellites, depending on which PRN numbers are in use.

Whereas ephemeris information is highly detailed and considered valid for no more than four hours, almanac information is more general and is considered valid for up to 180 days.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The almanac assists the receiver in determining which satellites to search for, and once the receiver picks up each satellite's signal in turn, it then downloads the ephemeris data directly from that satellite. A position fix using any satellite can not be calculated until the receiver has an accurate and complete copy of that satellite's ephemeris data. If the signal from a satellite is lost while its ephemeris data is being acquired, the receiver must discard that data and start again.

The navigation message consists of 1,500&amp;nbsp;bit long ''frames''. Each frame consists of 5 ''subframes'' of 300 bits, numbered 1 to 5. In turn each subframe consists of 10 ''words'' of 30&amp;nbsp;bit each and requires 6 seconds to transmit. Each subframe has the GPS time. Subframe 1 contains the GPS date (week number) and information to correct the satellite's time to GPS time, plus satellite status and health. Subframes 2 and 3 together contain the transmitting satellite's ephemeris data. Subframes 4 and 5 contain components of the almanac but each frame contains only 1/25th of the complete almanac; a receiver must process 25 whole frames worth of data to retrieve the entire 15,000&amp;nbsp;bit almanac message. At this rate, 12.5 minutes are required to receive the entire almanac from a single satellite. Each of the 25 versions of frames 4 and 5 is called a ''page'' and they are numbered 1 to 25.

Frames begin and end at the start/end of week plus an integer multiple of 30 seconds. At start/end of week the cycling between pages is reset to page 1.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;20.3.4.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;130)}}

There are two navigation message types: LNAV-L is used by satellites with PRN numbers 1 to 32 (called ''lower PRN numbers'') and LNAV-U is used by satellites with PRN numbers 33 to 63 (called ''upper PRN numbers'').{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;6.4.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64)}} The 2 types use very similar formats. Subframes 1 to 3 are the same{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;40.3.3 (p.&amp;nbsp;207)}} while subframes 4 and 5 use almost the same format. Both message types contain almanac data for all satellites using the same navigation message type, but not the other type.

Each subframe begins with a Telemetry Word (TLM), which enables the receiver to detect the beginning of a subframe and determine the receiver clock time at which the navigation subframe begins. The next word is the handover word (HOW), which gives the GPS time (actually the time when the first bit of the next subframe will be transmitted) and identifies the specific subframe within a complete frame.&lt;ref name="US Government"&gt;{{cite web |title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction |format=PDF |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf |publisher=US Government |accessdate=2013-07-24}} Section 1.4.2.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="u-blox.com"&gt;[http://www.u-blox.com/images/stories/Resources/gps_compendiumgps-x-02007.pdf "Essentials of Satellite Navigation Compendium"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107091706/http://www.u-blox.com/images/stories/Resources/gps_compendiumgps-x-02007.pdf |date=November 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining eight words of the subframe contain the actual data specific to that subframe. Each word includes 6 bits of parity generated using an algorithm based on Hamming codes, which take into account the 24 non-parity bits of that word and the last 2 bits of the previous word.

After a subframe has been read and interpreted, the time the next subframe was sent can be calculated through the use of the clock correction data and the HOW. The receiver knows the receiver clock time of when the beginning of the next subframe was received from detection of the Telemetry Word thereby enabling computation of the transit time and thus the pseudorange. The receiver is potentially capable of getting a new pseudorange measurement at the beginning of each subframe or every 6 seconds.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} &lt;!--The receiver knows that the message was sent approximately .065 seconds before it was received. This is true since &lt;math&gt;\frac {(orbital\; radius) - (earth\; radius)} {speed\; of\; light} = \frac {26000\ km - 6378\ km} {300000\ km/sec} = .065\ seconds&lt;/math&gt;. This is only an approximation but it is sufficiently accurate since it is very small relative to the 30 second interval between successive frames. Utilizing the clock correction data in the navigation message, the receiver can determine the 30 second epoch which is close to expected time sent to compute the actual time sent and the transit time of the message. --&gt;

==== Time ====
GPS time is expressed with a resolution of 1.5 seconds as a week number and a time of week count (TOW).{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;6.2.4 (p.&amp;nbsp;50), §&amp;nbsp;3.3.4 (p.&amp;nbsp;41)}} Its zero point (week 0, TOW 0) is defined to be 1980-01-06T00:00Z. The TOW count is a value ranging from 0 to 403,199 whose meaning is the number of 1.5 second periods elapsed since the beginning of the GPS week. Expressing TOW count thus requires 19 bits (2&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;524,288). GPS time is a continuous time scale in that it does not include leap seconds; therefore the start/end of GPS weeks may differ from that of the corresponding UTC day by an integer number of seconds.

In each subframe, each hand-over word (HOW) contains the most significant 17 bits of the TOW count corresponding to the start of the next following subframe.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;20.3.3.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;87)}} Note that the 2 least significant bits can be safely omitted because one HOW occurs in the navigation message every 6 seconds, which is equal to the resolution of the truncated TOW count thereof. Equivalently, the truncated TOW count is the time duration since the last GPS week start/end to the beginning of the next frame in units of 6 seconds.

Each frame contains (in subframe 1) the 10 least significant bits of the corresponding GPS week number.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;20.3.3.3.1.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;90)}} Note that each frame is entirely within one GPS week because GPS frames do not cross GPS week boundaries.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;20.3.4.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;130)}} Since rollover occurs every 1,024 GPS weeks (approximately every 19.6 years; 1,024 is 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;), a receiver that computes current calendar dates needs to deduce the upper week number bits or obtain them from a different source. One possible method is for the receiver to save its current date in memory when shut down, and when powered on, assume that the newly decoded truncated week number corresponds to the period of 1,024 weeks that starts at the last saved date. This method correctly deduces the full week number if the receiver is never allowed to remain shut down (or without a time and position fix) for more than 1,024 weeks (~19.6 years).

==== Almanac ====
The ''almanac'' consists of coarse orbit and status information for each satellite in the constellation, an [[ionospheric model]], and information to relate GPS derived time to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Each frame contains a part of the almanac (in subframes 4 and 5) and the complete almanac is transmitted by each satellite in 25 frames total (requiring 12.5 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |format=PDF |title=Interface Specification IS-GPS-200, Revision D: Navstar GPS Space Segment/Navigation User Interfaces |publisher=Navstar GPS Joint Program Office |accessdate=2013-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908003700/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }} Page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The almanac serves several purposes. The first is to assist in the acquisition of satellites at power-up by allowing the receiver to generate a list of visible satellites based on stored position and time, while an ephemeris from each satellite is needed to compute position fixes using that satellite. In older hardware, lack of an almanac in a new receiver would cause long delays before providing a valid position, because the search for each satellite was a slow process. Advances in hardware have made the acquisition process much faster, so not having an almanac is no longer an issue. The second purpose is for relating time derived from the GPS (called GPS time) to the international time standard of [[UTC]]. Finally, the almanac allows a single-frequency receiver to correct for [[ionospheric delay]] error by using a global ionospheric model. The corrections are not as accurate as [[GNSS augmentation]] systems like [[WAAS]] or dual-frequency receivers. However, it is often better than no correction, since ionospheric error is the largest error source for a single-frequency GPS receiver.

==== Data updates ====
Satellite data is updated typically every 24 hours, with up to 60 days data loaded in case there is a disruption in the ability to make updates regularly. Typically the updates contain new ephemerides, with new almanacs uploaded less frequently.  [[Global Positioning System#Control segment|The Control Segment]] guarantees that during normal operations a new almanac will be uploaded at least every 6 days.

Satellites broadcast a new ephemeris every two hours. The ephemeris is generally valid for 4 hours, with provisions for updates every 4 hours or longer in non-nominal conditions. The time needed to acquire the ephemeris is becoming a significant element of the delay to first position fix, because as the receiver hardware becomes more capable, the time to lock onto the satellite signals shrinks; however, the ephemeris data requires 18 to 36 seconds before it is received, due to the low data transmission rate.

=== Frequency information ===
[[Image:GPS signal modulation scheme.svg|thumb|right|300px|GPS [[broadcast signal]].]]

For the ranging codes and navigation message to travel from the satellite to the receiver, they must be [[modulated]] onto a [[carrier wave]]. In the case of the original GPS design, two frequencies are utilized; one at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] (10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz × 154) called L1; and a second at 1227.60&amp;nbsp;MHz (10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz × 120), called L2.

The C/A code is transmitted on the L1 frequency as a 1.023&amp;nbsp;MHz signal using a bi-phase shift keying ([[BPSK]]) modulation technique. The P(Y)-code is transmitted on both the L1 and L2 frequencies as a 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz signal using the same BPSK modulation, however the P(Y)-code carrier is in [[quadrature phase|quadrature]] with the C/A carrier (meaning it is 90° out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]]).

Besides redundancy and increased resistance to jamming, a critical benefit of having two frequencies transmitted from one satellite is the ability to measure directly, and therefore remove, the [[ionospheric delay]] error for that satellite. Without such a measurement, a GPS receiver must use a generic model or receive ionospheric corrections from another source (such as the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] or [[WAAS]]). Advances in the technology used on both the GPS satellites and the GPS receivers has made ionospheric delay the largest remaining source of error in the signal. A receiver capable of performing this measurement can be significantly more accurate and is typically referred to as a ''dual frequency receiver''.

== Modernization and additional GPS signals ==
{{see also|GPS Block IIIA#New navigation signals}}

Having reached full operational capability on July 17, 1995&lt;ref&gt;US Coast Guard [http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gpsFaq GPS FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; the GPS system had completed its original design goals. However, additional advances in technology and new demands on the existing system led to the effort to "modernize" the GPS system. Announcements from the Vice President and the White House in 1998 heralded the beginning of these changes and in 2000, the U.S. Congress reaffirmed the effort, referred to as ''GPS III''.

The project involves new ground stations and new satellites, with additional navigation signals for both civilian and military users, and aims to improve the accuracy and availability for all users. A goal of 2013 has been established with incentives offered to the contractors if they can complete it by 2011.{{Update after|2011|12|30}}

=== General features ===
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|frame|240px|A visual example of the GPS constellation in motion with the Earth rotating. Notice how the number of ''satellites in view'' from a given point on the Earth's surface, in this example at 45°N, changes with time.]]
Modernized GPS civilian signals have two general improvements over their legacy counterparts: a dataless acquisition aid and [[forward error correction]] (FEC) coding of the NAV message.

A dataless acquisition aid is an additional signal, called a pilot carrier in some cases, broadcast alongside the data signal. This dataless signal is designed to be easier to acquire than the data encoded and, upon successful acquisition, can be used to acquire the data signal. This technique improves acquisition of the GPS signal and boosts power levels at the correlator.

The second advancement is to use forward error correction (FEC) coding on the NAV message itself. Due to the relatively slow transmission rate of NAV data (usually 50 bits per second), small interruptions can have potentially large impacts. Therefore, FEC on the NAV message is a significant improvement in overall signal robustness.

=== L2C ===
One of the first announcements was the addition of a new civilian-use signal, to be transmitted on a frequency other than the L1 frequency used for the coarse/acquisition (C/A) signal. Ultimately, this became the L2C signal, so called because it is broadcast on the L2 frequency. Because it requires new hardware on board the satellite, it is only transmitted by the so-called Block IIR-M and later design satellites. The L2C signal is tasked with improving accuracy of navigation, providing an easy to track signal, and acting as a redundant signal in case of localized interference.

Unlike the C/A code, L2C contains two distinct PRN code sequences to provide ranging information; the ''civil-moderate'' code (called CM), and the ''civil-long'' length code (called CL). The CM code is 10,230 bits long, repeating every 20 ms. The CL code is 767,250 bits long, repeating every 1,500 ms. Each signal is transmitted at 511,500 bits per second ([[bit/s]]); however, they are [[multiplexed]] together to form a 1,023,000-bit/s signal.

CM is [[modulated]] with the CNAV Navigation Message (see below), whereas CL does not contain any modulated data and is called a ''dataless sequence''. The long, dataless sequence provides for approximately 24&amp;nbsp;dB greater correlation (~250 times stronger) than L1 C/A-code.

When compared to the C/A signal, L2C has 2.7&amp;nbsp;dB greater data recovery and 0.7&amp;nbsp;dB greater carrier-tracking, although its transmission power is 2.3&amp;nbsp;dB weaker.

==== CM and CL codes ====
The civil-moderate and civil-long ranging codes are generated by a [[Linear feedback shift register#Galois LFSRs|modular LFSR]] which is reset periodically to a predetermined initial state. The period of the CM and CL is determined by this resetting and not by the natural period of the LFSR (as is the case with the C/A code). The initial states are designated in the interface specification and are different for different PRN numbers and for CM/CL. The feedback polynomial/mask is the same for CM and CL. The ranging codes are thus given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \text{CM}_i(t) &amp;= A(X_i, t \bmod{10\,230}) \\
  \text{CL}_i(t) &amp;= A(Y_i, t \bmod{767\,250})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{CM}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{CL}_i&lt;/math&gt; are the ranging codes for PRN number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and their arguments are the integer number of chips elapsed (starting at 0) since start/end of GPS week, or equivalently since the origin of the GPS time scale (see [[#Time|§&amp;nbsp;Time]]).
:&lt;math&gt;A(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the LFSR when initialized with initial state &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; after being clocked &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; times.
:&lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; are the initial states for CM and CL respectively. for PRN number &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\text{mod}&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of division operation.
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the integer number of CM and CL chip periods since the origin of [[#Time|GPS time]] or equivalently, since any GPS second (starting from 0).

The initial states are described in the GPS interface specification as numbers expressed in octal following the convention that the LFSR state is interpreted as the binary representation of a number where the output bit is the least significant bit, and the bit where new bits are shifted in is the most significant bit. Using this convention, the LFSR shifts from most significant bit to least significant bit and when seen in big endian order, it shifts to the right. The states called ''final state'' in the IS are obtained after {{val|10229}} cycles for CM and after {{val|767249}} cycles for LM (just before reset in both cases).

The feedback bit mask is 100100101001001010100111100&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Again with the convention that the least significant bit is the output bit of the LFSR and the most significant bit is the shift-in bit of the LFSR, 0 means no feedback ''into'' that position, and 1 means feedback ''into'' that position.

The CNAV data is an upgraded version of the original NAV navigation message. It contains higher precision representation and nominally more accurate data than the NAV data. The same type of information (time, status, ephemeris, and almanac) is still transmitted using the new CNAV format; however, instead of using a frame / subframe architecture, it uses a new [[packet (information technology)|pseudo-packetized]] format made of 12-second 300-bit ''messages'' analogous to LNAV frames. While LNAV frames have a fixed information content, CNAV messages may be of one of several defined types. The type of a frame determines its information content. Messages do not follow a fixed schedule regarding which message types will be used, allowing the Control Segment some versatility. However, for some message types there are lower bounds on how often they will be transmitted.

In CNAV, at least 1 out of every 4 packets are ephemeris data and the same lower bound applies for clock data packets.{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;30.3.4.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;190)}} The design allows for a wide variety of packet types to be transmitted. With a 32-satellite constellation, and the current requirements of what needs to be sent, less than 75% of the bandwidth is used. Only a small fraction of the available packet types have been defined; this enables the system to grow and incorporate advances without breaking compatibility.

There are many important changes in the new CNAV message:
* It uses [[forward error correction]] (FEC) provided by a rate 1/2 [[convolutional code]], so while the navigation message is 25-bit/s, a 50-bit/s signal is transmitted.
* Messages carry a 24-bit [[cyclic redundancy check|CRC]], against which integrity can be checked.
* The GPS week number is now represented as 13 bits, or 8192 weeks, and only repeats every 157.0 years, meaning the next return to zero won't occur until the year 2137. This is longer compared to the L1 NAV message's use of a 10-bit week number, which returns to zero every 19.6 years.
* There is a packet that contains a GPS-to-GNSS time offset. This allows better interoperability with other global time-transfer systems, such as [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and [[GLONASS]], both of which are supported.
* The extra bandwidth enables the inclusion of a packet for differential correction, to be used in a similar manner to [[satellite based augmentation system]]s and which can be used to correct the L1 NAV clock data.
* Every packet contains an alert flag, to be set if the satellite data can not be trusted. This means users will know within 12 seconds if a satellite is no longer usable. Such rapid notification is important for safety-of-life applications, such as aviation.
* Finally, the system is designed to support 63 satellites, compared with 32 in the L1 NAV message.

CNAV messages begin and end at start/end of GPS week plus an integer multiple of 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.3.3.1.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;39)}} Note that synchronization is described in the IS in terms of X1 epochs, which occur each 1.5 seconds and are synchronized with start/end of GPS week.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the beginning of the first bit (with convolution encoding already applied) to contain information about a message matches the aforesaid synchronization. CNAV messages begin with an 8-bit preamble which is a fixed bit pattern and whose purpose is to enable the receiver to detect the beginning of a message.

==== Forward error correction code ====
The [[convolutional code]] used to encode CNAV is described by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_1(t) &amp;= d(t) \oplus d(t - 2) \oplus d(t - 3) \oplus d(t - 5) \oplus d(t - 6) \\
  X_2(t) &amp;= d(t) \oplus d(t - 1) \oplus d(t - 2) \oplus d(t - 3) \oplus d(t - 6) \\
  d'(t') &amp;= \begin{cases}
    X_1\left(\frac{t'}{2}\right)   &amp; \text{if } t' \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \\
    X_2\left(\frac{t'-1}{2}\right) &amp; \text{if } t' \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are the unordered outputs of the convolutional encoder
:&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the raw (non FEC encoded) navigation data, consisting of the simple concatenation of the 300-bit messages.
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the integer number of ''non FEC encoded'' navigation data bits elapsed since an arbitrary point in time (starting at 0).
:&lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; is the FEC encoded navigation data.
:&lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; is the integer number of ''FEC encoded'' navigation data bits elapsed since the same epoch than &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (likewise starting at 0).
Since the FEC encoded bit stream runs at 2 times the rate than the non FEC encoded bit as already described, then &lt;math&gt;t=\left\lfloor\tfrac{t'}{2}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;. FEC encoding is performed independently of navigation message boundaries;{{sfn|GPS-IS-200H|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.3.3.1.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;39)}} this follows from the above equations.

==== L2C frequency information ====
An immediate effect of having two civilian frequencies being transmitted is the civilian receivers can now directly measure the ionospheric error in the same way as dual frequency P(Y)-code receivers. However, users utilizing the L2C signal alone, can expect 65% more position uncertainty due to ionospheric error than with the L1 signal alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/IS-GPS-200D.pdf|title=Interface Specification IS-GPS-200 Revision D|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=7 December 2004|accessdate=2010-07-18|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military (M-code) ===
A major component of the modernization process is a new military signal. Called the Military code, or M-code, it was designed to further improve the anti-jamming and secure access of the military GPS signals.

Very little has been published about this new, restricted code. It contains a PRN code of unknown length transmitted at 5.115&amp;nbsp;MHz. Unlike the P(Y)-code, the M-code is designed to be autonomous, meaning that a user can calculate their position using only the M-code signal. From the P(Y)-code's original design, users had to first lock onto the C/A code and then transfer the lock to the P(Y)-code. Later, direct-acquisition techniques were developed that allowed some users to operate autonomously with the P(Y)-code.

==== MNAV navigation message ====
A little more is known about the new navigation message, which is called ''MNAV''. Similar to the new CNAV, this new MNAV is packeted instead of framed, allowing for very flexible data payloads. Also like CNAV it can utilize Forward Error Correction (FEC) and advanced error detection (such as a [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]]).

==== M-code frequency information ====
The M-code is transmitted in the same L1 and L2 frequencies already in use by the previous military code, the P(Y)-code. The new signal is shaped to place most of its energy at the edges (away from the existing P(Y) and C/A carriers).

In a major departure from previous GPS designs, the M-code is intended to be broadcast from a high-gain directional antenna, in addition to a full-Earth antenna. This directional antenna's signal, called a spot beam, is intended to be aimed at a specific region (several hundred kilometers in diameter) and increase the local signal strength by 20&amp;nbsp;dB, or approximately 100 times stronger. A side effect of having two antennas is that the GPS satellite will appear to be two GPS satellites occupying the same position to those inside the spot beam. While the whole Earth M-code signal is available on the Block IIR-M satellites, the spot beam antennas will not be deployed until the [[GPS Block IIIA|Block III satellites]] are deployed, tentatively in 2018.

An interesting side effect of having each satellite transmit four separate signals is that the MNAV can potentially transmit four different data channels, offering increased data bandwidth.

The modulation method is [[binary offset carrier]], using a 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz subcarrier against the 5.115&amp;nbsp;MHz code. This signal will have an overall bandwidth of approximately 24&amp;nbsp;MHz, with significantly separated sideband lobes. The sidebands can be used to improve signal reception.

=== L5 ===
The L5 signal provides a means of radionavigation secure and robust enough for life critical applications, such as aircraft precision approach guidance. The signal is broadcast in a frequency band protected by the [[ITU]] for [[aeronautical radionavigation service]]s. It was first demonstrated from satellite [[USA-203]] (Block IIR-M), and is available on all satellites from [[GPS Block IIF|GPS IIF]]. The L5 band provides additional robustness in the form of interference mitigation, the band being internationally protected, redundancy with existing bands, geostationary satellite augmentation, and ground-based augmentation. The added robustness of this band also benefits terrestrial applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/gps/policy/modernization/|title=Satellite Navigation - GPS - Policy - Modernization|last=|first1=|date=13 November 2014|website=FAA.gov|publisher=FAA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two PRN ranging codes are transmitted on L5 in quadrature: the in-phase code (called ''I5-code'') and the [[quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature-phase]] code (called ''Q5-code''). Both codes are 10,230 bits long, transmitted at 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz (1&amp;nbsp;ms repetition period), and are generated identically (differing only in initial states). Then, I5 is modulated (by exclusive-or) with navigation data (called L5 CNAV) and a 10-bit [[Neuman-Hoffman code]] clocked at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. Similarly, the Q5-code is then modulated but with only a 20-bit Neuman-Hoffman code that is also clocked at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;!-- probably need to add some text to explain this, and indicate why it was done --&gt;

Compared to L1 C/A and L2, these are some of the changes in L5:
* Improved signal structure for enhanced performance
* Higher transmitted power than L1/L2 signal (~3&amp;nbsp;dB, or 2× as powerful)
* Wider bandwidth provides a 10× [[processing gain]], provides sharper autocorrelation (in absolute terms, not relative to chip time duration) and requires a higher sampling rate at the receiver.
* Longer spreading codes (10× longer than C/A)
* Uses the Aeronautical Radionavigation Services band

==== I5 and Q5 codes ====
The I5-code and Q5-code are generated using the same structure but with different parameters. These codes are the combination (by exclusive-or) of the output of 2 differing linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) which are selectively reset.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \text{5}_i(t) &amp;= U(t) \oplus V_i(t) \\
           U(t) &amp;= XA((t \bmod{10\,230}) \bmod{8\,190}) \\
         V_i(t) &amp;= XB_i(X_i, t \bmod{10\,230})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ordered pair]] &lt;math&gt;(P, n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P \in \{\text{I}, \text{Q}\}&lt;/math&gt; for in-phase and quadrature-phase, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a PRN number; both phases and a single PRN are required for the L5 signal from a single satellite.
: &lt;math&gt;\text{5}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ranging codes for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;; also denoted as &lt;math&gt;\text{I5}_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Q5}_n&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; are intermediate codes, with &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; not depending on phase ''or'' PRN.
: The output of two 13-stage LFSRs with clock state &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; is used:
::&lt;math&gt;XA\left(x, t'\right)&lt;/math&gt; has feedback polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^{13} + x^{12} + x^{10} + x^9 + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and initial state 1111111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;XB_i\left(x, t'\right)&lt;/math&gt; has feedback polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^{13} + x^{12} + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and initial state &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is the initial state specified for the phase and PRN number given by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (designated in the IS{{sfn|GPS-IS-705D|loc=tables 3-Ia, 3-Ib (p.&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;7)}}).
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the integer number of chip periods since the origin of [[#Time|GPS time]] or equivalently, since any GPS second (starting from 0).

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are maximal length LFSRs. The modulo operations correspond to resets. Note that both are reset each millisecond (synchronized with [[#Coarse/acquisition code|C/A code]] epochs). In addition, the extra modulo operation in the description of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is due to the fact it is reset 1 cycle before its natural period (which is 8,191) so that the next repetition becomes offset by 1 cycle with respect to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|GPS-IS-705D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.3.2.2 (p.&amp;nbsp;14)}} (otherwise, since both sequences would repeat, I5 and Q5 would repeat within any 1&amp;nbsp;ms period as well, degrading correlation characteristics).

==== L5 navigation message ====
The L5 CNAV data includes SV ephemerides, system time, SV clock behavior data, status messages and time information, etc. The 50&amp;nbsp;bit/s data is coded in a rate 1/2 convolution coder. The resulting 100 symbols per second (sps) symbol stream is modulo-2 added to the I5-code only; the resultant bit-train is used to modulate the L5 in-phase (I5) carrier. This combined signal is called the L5 Data signal. The L5 quadrature-phase (Q5) carrier has no data and is called the L5 Pilot signal. The format used for L5 CNAV is very similar to that of L2 CNAV. One difference is that it uses 2 times the data rate. The bit fields within each message,{{sfn|GPS-IS-705D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;20.3.3 (p.&amp;nbsp;41)}} message types, and forward error correction code algorithm are the same as those of [[GPS signals#CNAV Navigation message|L2 CNAV]]. L5 CNAV messages begin and end at start/end of GPS week plus an integer multiple of 6 seconds (this applies to the beginning of the first bit to contain information about a message, as is the case for L2 CNAV).{{sfn|GPS-IS-705D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.3.3.1.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;39)}}

==== L5 frequency information ====
Broadcast on the L5 frequency (1176.45&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz × 115), which is an [[aeronautical]] navigation band. The frequency was chosen so that the aviation community can manage interference to L5 more effectively than L2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/IS-GPS-705.pdf|title=IS-GPS-705: NAVSTAR GPS Space Segment / User Segment L5 Interfaces|publisher=[[United States Coast Guard]]|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=2010-07-18|format=PDF}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== L1C ===
L1C is a civilian-use signal, to be broadcast on the L1 frequency (1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz), which contains the C/A signal used by all current GPS users. The L1C will be available with the first Block III launch, tentatively scheduled for the first half of fiscal year 2017.&lt;ref name="First GPS III Launch Slips to FY17"&gt;{{cite web|title=First GPS III Launch Slips to FY17|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/4270|website=Inside GNSS|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

L1C consists of a pilot (called L1C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) and a data (called L1C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) component.{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;ndash;3)}} These components use carriers with the same phase (within a margin of error of 100 [[milliradian]]s), instead of carriers in quadrature as with L5.{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.2.1.6.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;4)}} The PRN codes are 10,230 bits long and transmitted at 1.023&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. The pilot component is also modulated by an overlay code called L1C&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; (a secondary code that has a lower rate than the ranging code and is also predefined, like the ranging code).{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;ndash;3)}} Of the total L1C signal power, 25% is allocated to the data and 75% to the pilot. The modulation technique used is [[binary offset carrier modulation|BOC]](1,1) for the data signal and TMBOC for the pilot. The time [[MBOC|multiplexed binary offset carrier]] (TMBOC) is BOC(1,1) for all except 4 of 33 cycles, when it switches to BOC(6,1).

* Implementation will provide C/A code to ensure backward compatibility
* Assured of 1.5&amp;nbsp;dB increase in minimum C/A code power to mitigate any noise floor increase
* Data-less signal component pilot carrier improves tracking compared with L1 C/A
* Enables greater civil interoperability with Galileo L1

==== L1C ranging code ====
The L1C pilot and data ranging codes are based on a Legendre sequence with length {{val|10223}} used to build an intermediate code (called a ''Weil code'') which is expanded with a fixed 7-bit sequence to the required 10,230 bits. This 10,230-bit sequence is the ranging code and varies between PRN numbers and between the pilot and data components. The ranging codes are described by:&lt;ref&gt;The ranging codes are described in {{harvnb|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.2.2.1.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;7&amp;ndash;8)}} using a different notation.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \text{L1C}_i(t) &amp;= \text{L1C}'(t \bmod{10\,230}) \\
  \text{L1C}'_i(t') &amp;= \begin{cases}
    W_i(t')    &amp; \text{ if } t' &lt; p'_i \\
    S(t'-p'_i) &amp; \text{ if } p'_i \le t' &lt; p'_i + 7\\

             W_i(n) &amp;= L(n) \oplus L((n + w_i) \bmod{10\,223}) \\
               L(n) &amp;= \begin{cases}
                         1 &amp; \text{ if } n \neq 0 \text{ and there is an integer }

                         0 &amp; \text{ otherwise} \\
                       \end{cases}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{L1C}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ranging code for PRN number and component &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\text{L1C}'_i&lt;/math&gt; represents a period of &lt;math&gt;\text{L1C}_i&lt;/math&gt;; it is introduced only to allow a more clear notation. To obtain a direct formula for &lt;math&gt;\text{L1C}&lt;/math&gt; start from the right side of the formula for &lt;math&gt;\text{L1C}'&lt;/math&gt; and replace all instances of &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t \bmod{10\,230}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the integer number of L1C chip periods (which is {{frac|1|1.023}}&amp;nbsp;µs) since the origin of [[#Time|GPS time]] or equivalently, since any GPS second (starting from 0).
:&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ordered pair]] identifying a PRN number and a code (L1C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; or L1C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) and is of the form &lt;math&gt;(\text{P}, n)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\text{D}, n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the PRN number of the satellite, and &lt;math&gt;\text{P, D}&lt;/math&gt; are [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s (not variables) that indicate the L1C&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; code or L1C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; code, respectively.
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is an intermediate code: a Legendre sequence whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the set of integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;0 \le n \le 10\,222&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;W_i&lt;/math&gt; is an intermediate code called Weil code, with the same domain as &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The L1C navigation data (called CNAV-2) is broadcast in 1,800 bits long (including FEC) frames and is transmitted at 100&amp;nbsp;bit/s.

The frames of L1C are analogous to the messages of L1C and L5. While [[#CNAV_Navigation_message|L2 CNAV]] and [[#L5_navigation_message|L5 CNAV]] use a dedicated message type for ephemeris data, all CNAV-2 frames include that information.

The common structure of all messages consists of 3 frames, as listed in the adjacent table. The content of subframe 3 varies according to its page number which is analogous to the type number of L2 CNAV and L5 CNAV messages. Pages are broadcast in an arbitrary order.{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.5.5.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;69)}}

The time of messages (not to be confused with clock correction parameters) is expressed in a different format than [[#Time|the format]] of the previous civilian signals. Instead it consists of 3 components:
#The '''week number''', with the same meaning as with the other civilian signals. Each message contains the week number modulo 8,192 or equivalently, the 13 least significant bits of the week number, allowing direct specification of any date within a cycling 157-year range.
#An '''interval time of week (ITOW):'''  the integer number of 2 hour periods elapsed since the latest start/end of week. It has range 0 to 83 (inclusive), requiring 7 bits to encode.
#A '''time of interval (TOI):''' the integer number of 18 second periods elapsed since the period represented by the current ITOW to the beginning of the ''next'' message. It has range 0 to 399 (inclusive) and requires 9 bits of data.

TOI is the only content of subframe 1. The week number and ITOW are contained in subframe 2 along with other information.

Subframe 1 is encoded by a modified [[BCH code]]. Specifically, the 8 least significant bits are BCH encoded to generate 51 bits, then combined using [[exclusive or]] with the most significant bit and finally the most significant bit is appended as the most significant bit of the previous result to obtain the final 52 bits.{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.2.3.2 (p.&amp;nbsp;19&amp;ndash;20)}} Subframes 2 and 3 are individually expanded with a 24-bit [[cyclic redundancy check|CRC]], then individually encoded using a [[low-density parity-check code]], and then [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved]] as a single unit using a block interleaver.{{sfn|GPS-IS-800D|loc=§&amp;nbsp;3.2.3.1 (p.&amp;nbsp;18)}}

All satellites broadcast at the same two frequencies, 1.57542&amp;nbsp;GHz (L1 signal) and 1.2276&amp;nbsp;GHz (L2 signal). The satellite network uses a CDMA spread-spectrum technique where the low-bitrate message data is encoded with a high-rate [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random]] (PRN) sequence that is different for each satellite. The receiver must be aware of the PRN codes for each satellite to reconstruct the actual message data. The C/A code, for civilian use, transmits data at 1.023 million [[chip (CDMA)|chips]] per second, whereas the P code, for U.S. military use, transmits at 10.23 million chips per second. The L1 carrier is modulated by both the C/A and P codes, while the L2 carrier is only modulated by the P code.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120804185510/http://www.kowoma.de/en/gps/signals.htm How GPS works.] Konowa.de (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The P code can be encrypted as a so-called P(Y) code which is only available to military equipment with a proper decryption key. Both the C/A and P(Y) codes impart the precise time-of-day to the user.

Each composite signal (in-phase and quadrature phase) becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
  S(t) =
    \sqrt{P_\operatorname{I}} X_\operatorname{I}(t) \cos\left(\omega t + \phi_0\right) -
    \sqrt{P_\operatorname{Q}} X_\operatorname{Q}(t) \underbrace{\sin\left(\omega t + \phi_0\right)}_{-\cos\left(\omega t + \phi_0 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\operatorname{I}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\operatorname{Q}&lt;/math&gt; represent signal powers; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_\operatorname{I}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_\operatorname{Q}(t)&lt;/math&gt; represent codes with/without data &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (= \;\pm 1)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a formula for the ideal case (which is not attained in practice) as it does not model timing errors, noise, amplitude mismatch between components or quadrature error (when components are not exactly in quadrature).

== Demodulation and decoding ==
&lt;!-- Demodulation is done with carrier frequency; decoding is done with Gold Code. --&gt;

[[Image:gps ca gold.svg|thumb|400px|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals using the Coarse/Acquisition [[Gold code]].]]

A GPS receiver processes the GPS signals received on its antenna to determine position, velocity and/or timing. The signal at antenna is amplified, down converted to baseband or intermediate frequency, filtered (to remove frequencies outside the intended frequency range for the digital signal that would alias into it) and digitalized; these steps may be chained in a different order. Note that aliasing is sometimes intentional (specifically, when [[undersampling]] is used) but filtering is still required to discard frequencies not intended to be present in the digital representation.

For each satellite used by the receiver, the receiver must first '''acquire''' the signal and then '''track''' it as long as that satellite is in use; both are performed in the digital domain in by far most (if not all) receivers.

Acquiring a signal is the process of determining the frequency and code phase (both relative to receiver time) when it was previously unknown. Code phase must be determined within an accuracy that depends on the receiver design (especially the tracking loop); 0.5 times the duration of code chips (approx. 0.489&amp;nbsp;µs) is a representative value.

Tracking is the process of continuously adjusting the estimated frequency and phase to match the received signal as close as possible and therefore is a [[phase locked loop]]. Note that acquisition is performed to start using a particular satellite, but tracking is performed as long as that satellite is in use.

In this section, one possible procedure is described for L1 C/A acquisition and tracking, but the process is very similar for the other signals. The described procedure is based on computing the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] of the received signal with a locally generated replica of the ranging code and detecting the highest peak or lowest valley. The offset of the highest peak or lowest valley contains information about the code phase relative to receiver time. The duration of the local replica is set by receiver design and is typically shorter than the duration of navigation data bits, which is 20&amp;nbsp;ms.

=== Acquisition ===
Acquisition of a given PRN number can be conceptualized as searching for a signal in a bidimensional search space where the dimensions are (1) code phase, (2) frequency. In addition, a receiver may not know which PRN number to search for, and in that case a third dimension is added to the search space: (3) PRN number.

;Frequency space: The frequency range of the search space is the band where the signal may be located given the receiver knowledge. The [[carrier frequency]] varies by roughly 5&amp;nbsp;kHz due to the Doppler effect when the receiver is stationary; if the receiver moves, the variation is higher. The code frequency deviation is 1/1,540 times the carrier frequency deviation for L1 because the code frequency is 1/1,540 of the carrier frequency (see [[#Frequencies_used_by_GPS|§ Frequencies used by GPS]]). The down conversion does not affect the frequency deviation; it only shifts all the signal frequency components down. Since the frequency is referenced to the receiver time, the uncertainty in the receiver oscillator frequency adds to the frequency range of the search space.
;Code phase space: The ranging code has a period of 1,023 chips each of which lasts roughly 0.977&amp;nbsp;µs (see [[#Coarse/acquisition_code|§ Coarse/acquisition code]]). The code gives strong autocorrelation only at offsets less than 1 in magnitude. The extent of the search space in the code phase dimension depends on the granularity of the offsets at which correlation is computed. It is typical to search for the code phase within a granularity of 0.5 chips or finer; that means 2,046 offsets. There may be more factors increasing the size of the search space of code phase. For example, a receiver may be designed so as to examine 2 consecutive windows of the digitalized signal, so that at least one of them does not contain a navigation bit transition (which worsens the correlation peak); this requires the signal windows to be at most 10&amp;nbsp;ms long.
;PRN number space: The lower PRN numbers range from 1 to 32 and therefore there are 32 PRN numbers to search for when the receiver does not have information to narrow the search in this dimension. The higher PRN numbers range from 33 to 66. See [[#Navigation_message|§ Navigation message]].

If the almanac information has previously been acquired, the receiver picks which satellites to listen for by their PRNs. If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode and cycles through the PRN numbers until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then decode the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A code pattern.

==== Simple correlation ====
The simplest way to acquire the signal (not necessarily the most effective or least computationally expensive) is to compute the [[dot product]] of a window of the digitalized signal with a set of locally generated replicas. The locally generated replicas vary in carrier frequency and code phase to cover all the already mentioned search space which is the [[Cartesian product]] of the frequency search space and the code phase search space. The carrier is a complex number where real and imaginary components are both [[sinusoid]]s as described by [[Euler's formula]]. The replica that generates the highest magnitude of dot product is likely the one that best matches the code phase and frequency of the signal; therefore, if that magnitude is above a threshold, the receiver proceeds to track the signal or further refine the estimated parameters before tracking. The threshold is used to minimize false positives (apparently detecting a signal when there is in fact no signal), but some may still occur occasionally.

Using a complex carrier allows the replicas to match the digitalized signal regardless of the signal's carrier phase and to detect that phase (the principle is the same used by the [[Fourier transform]]). The dot product is a complex number; its magnitude represents the level of similarity between the replica and the signal, as with an ordinary [[cross-correlation|correlation]] of real-valued time series. The [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of the dot product is an approximation of the corresponding carrier in the digitalized signal.

As an example, assume that the granularity for the search in code phase is 0.5 chips and in frequency is 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, then there are '''1,023/0.5{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}2,046 code phases''' and '''10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz/500&amp;nbsp;Hz{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}20 frequencies''' to try for a total of '''20×2,046{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}40,920 local replicas'''. Note that each frequency bin is centered on its interval and therefore covers 250&amp;nbsp;Hz in each direction; for example, the first bin has a carrier at −4.750&amp;nbsp;Hz and covers the interval −5,000&amp;nbsp;Hz to −4,500&amp;nbsp;Hz. Code phases are equivalent modulo 1,023 because the ranging code is periodic; for example, phase −0.5 is equivalent to phase 1,022.5.

The following table depicts the local replicas that would be compared against the digitalized signal in this example. "•" means a single local replica while "..." is used for elided local replicas:

==== Fourier transform ====
As an improvement over the simple correlation method, it is possible to implement the computation of dot products more efficiently with a [[Fourier transform]]. Instead of performing one dot product for each element in the Cartesian product of code and frequency, a single operation involving [[FFT]] and covering all frequencies is performed for each code phase; each such operation is more computationally expensive, but it may still be faster overall than the previous method due to the efficiency of FFT algorithms, and it recovers carrier frequency with a higher accuracy, because the frequency bins are much closely spaced in a [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]].

Specifically, for all code phases in the search space, the digitalized signal window is multiplied element by element with a local replica of the code (with no carrier), then processed with a [[discrete Fourier transform]].

Given the previous example to be processed with this method, assume real-valued data (as opposed to complex data, which would have in-phase and quadrature components), a sampling rate of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz, a signal window of 10&amp;nbsp;ms, and an intermediate frequency of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. There will be 5&amp;nbsp;MHz×10&amp;nbsp;ms{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}50,000 samples in the digital signal, and therefore 25,001 frequency components ranging from 0&amp;nbsp;Hz to 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz in steps of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz (note that the 0&amp;nbsp;Hz component is real because it is the average of a real-valued signal and the 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz component is real as well because it is the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem#Critical frequency|critical frequency]]). Only the components (or bins) within 5&amp;nbsp;kHz of the central frequency are examined, which is the range from 2.495&amp;nbsp;MHz to 2.505&amp;nbsp;MHz, and it is covered by '''51 frequency components'''. There are '''2,046 code phases''' as in the previous case, thus in total '''51×2,046{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}104,346 complex frequency components''' will be examined.

==== Circular correlation with Fourier transform ====
Likewise, as an improvement over the simple correlation method, it is possible to perform a single operation covering all code phases for each frequency bin. The operation performed for each code phase bin involves forward FFT, element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. inverse FFT, and extra processing so that overall, it computes circular [[cross-correlation|correlation]] instead of circular [[convolution]]. This yields more accurate ''code phase determination'' than the [[#Simple correlation|simple correlation method]] in contrast with the previous method, which yields more accurate ''carrier frequency determination'' than the previous method.

=== Tracking and navigation message decoding ===
Since the carrier frequency received can vary due to [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] shift, the points where received PRN sequences begin may not differ from O by an exact integral number of milliseconds. Because of this, carrier frequency tracking along with PRN code tracking are used to determine when the received satellite's PRN code begins.&lt;ref name="gpslock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/gpslock.htm |title=How a GPS Receiver Gets a Lock |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earlier computation of offset in which trials of all 1,023 offsets could potentially be required, the tracking to maintain lock usually requires shifting of half a pulse width or less. To perform this tracking, the receiver observes two quantities, phase error and received frequency offset. The correlation of the received PRN code with respect to the receiver generated PRN code is computed to determine if the bits of the two signals are misaligned. Comparisons of the received PRN code with receiver generated PRN code shifted half a pulse width early and half a pulse width late are used to estimate adjustment required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction |format=PDF |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf |publisher=US Government |accessdate=2013-07-24}} Section 1.4.2.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of adjustment required for maximum correlation is used in estimating phase error. Received frequency offset from the frequency generated by the receiver provides an estimate of phase rate error. The command for the frequency generator and any further PRN code shifting required are computed as a function of the phase error and the phase rate error in accordance with the control law used. The Doppler velocity is computed as a function of the frequency offset from the carrier nominal frequency. The Doppler velocity is the velocity component along the line of sight of the receiver relative to the satellite.

As the receiver continues to read successive PRN sequences, it will encounter a sudden change in the phase of the 1,023-bit received PRN signal. This indicates the beginning of a data bit of the navigation message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction |format=PDF |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf |publisher=US Government |accessdate=2013-07-24}} Section 1.4.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt; This enables the receiver to begin reading the 20 millisecond bits of the navigation message. The TLM word at the beginning of each subframe of a navigation frame enables the receiver to detect the beginning of a subframe and determine the receiver clock time at which the navigation subframe begins. The HOW word then enables the receiver to determine which specific subframe is being transmitted.&lt;ref name="US Government"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u-blox.com"/&gt; There can be a delay of up to 30 seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data before computing the intersections of sphere surfaces.

After a subframe has been read and interpreted, the time the next subframe was sent can be calculated through the use of the clock correction data and the HOW. The receiver knows the receiver clock time of when the beginning of the next subframe was received from detection of the Telemetry Word thereby enabling computation of the transit time and thus the pseudorange. The receiver is potentially capable of getting a new pseudorange measurement at the beginning of each subframe or every 6 seconds. &lt;!--The receiver knows that the message was sent approximately .065 seconds before it was received.   This is true since &lt;math&gt;\frac {(orbital\; radius) - (earth\; radius)} {speed\; of\; light}  = \frac {26000\ km - 6378\ km} {300000\ km/sec} = .065\ seconds&lt;/math&gt;. This is only an approximation but it is sufficiently accurate since it is very small relative to the 30 second interval between successive frames. Utilizing the clock correction data in the navigation message, the receiver can determine the 30 second epoch which is close to expected time sent to compute the actual time sent and the transit time of the message. --&gt;

Then the orbital position data, or [[ephemeris]], from the navigation message is used to calculate precisely where the satellite was at the start of the message. A more sensitive receiver will potentially acquire the ephemeris data more quickly than a less sensitive receiver, especially in a noisy environment.&lt;ref name="ephemeris"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navsync.com/notes2.html |title=AN02 Network Assistance |accessdate=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and military career==
[[File:Portrait of George Owen Squier.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of George Owen Squier, by Harris &amp; Ewing, c. 1916.]]
George Squier wrote and edited many books and articles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=EG Squier and the Miskito |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=111–133 |author = M. D. Olien |date=1985 |jstor=482330 |last2=Squier }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of [[radio]] and [[electricity]].  An inventor, he and Dartmouth professor Albert Cushing Crehore developed a magneto-optical streak camera "The Polarizing Photo-chronograph" in 1896 to measure the speed of projectiles both inside a cannon and directly after they left the cannon barrel. This was one of the earliest photonic programs. They also worked to develop synchronous AC telegraphic systems. His biggest contribution was that of telephone carrier [[multiplexing]] in 1910 for which he was elected to the [[National Academy of Science]] in 1919.&lt;ref name=Geni/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARL/&gt;

As [[executive officer]] to the Chief Signal Officer, U.S. [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in 1907, Squier was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]], the first organizational ancestor of the [[US Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|isbn= 978-1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was the first military passenger in an airplane on September 12, 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=George Owen Squier

From May 1916 to February 1917, he was Chief of the [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]], the first successor of the Aeronautical Division, before being promoted to [[major general]] and appointed Chief Signal Officer during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|isbn= 978-1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, he created Wired Radio, a service which piped [[music]] to businesses and subscribers over wires.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt; In 1934, he changed the service's name to '[[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]'.

Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' it was pronounced like the word ''square''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles Earle |last=Funk |authorlink=Charles Earle Funk |title= What's the name, please?

'''Hispano-Moresque ware''' is a style of initially [[Islamic pottery]] created in [[Al Andalus]] or Muslim Spain, which continued to be produced under Christian rule in styles blending Islamic and European elements.  It was the most elaborate and luxurious  pottery being produced in Europe until the Italian [[maiolica]] industry developed sophisticated styles in the 15th century, and was exported over most of Europe.  The industry's most successful period was the 14th and 15th centuries.

Around 711, the [[Moors]] conquered [[Spain]]. Over the following centuries, they introduced two [[Pottery|ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[lustreware]], which imitates [[Metallic color|metallic]] finishes with [[iridescent]] effects.  Hispano-Moresque wares use both processes, applying the paint as an [[overglaze]] which is then fired again.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, chapters 12-14 gives very full accounts of the materials, techniques and science involved. Norman, pp. 2-3 is much briefer.&lt;/ref&gt;   Lustreware was a speciality of Islamic pottery, at least partly because the use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, when Christian medieval elites still normally used metal for both dishes and cups.

At first centred on [[Málaga]] in the south, and using typical Islamic decoration, by the 15th century the largest production was around [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], which had long been [[Reconquista|reconquered]] by the [[Crown of Aragon]].  Wares from [[Manises]] and other Valencian towns were mainly for the Christian market, and exported very widely.

==Centres of production==
[[File:Jarrón tipo Alhambra (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|200px|thumb|left|One of a number of large vases made for the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], 134 cm high]]

===Andalusian===
The earliest major centre of fine pottery in [[Al-Andalus]] was [[Málaga]] in southern Spain.  This is the major centre whose best-known wares were produced in a Muslim kingdom, as opposed to by a workforce presumed to be largely Muslim, or [[Morisco]], under Christian rule.  It was already celebrated for its [[gold]] lustrewares in the 14th century, and remained under Muslim rule until 1487, shortly before the fall of [[Granada]], the last Moorish kingdom.  [[Murcia]], [[Almería]], and perhaps Granada itself were also early centres of production.&lt;ref&gt;Nasrid; the tiles in the Alhambra may have been made locally, for example - see Jones &amp; Michell, p. 271, no. 424&lt;/ref&gt;   This pottery stayed much closer to styles seen in other Islamic countries, although much of it was being exported to Christian markets, as can be seen by the [[coats of arms]] on many pieces.

At least one authority, [[Alan Caiger-Smith]], excludes this pottery from the term "Hispano-Moresque", but most who use the term at all use it to include Malaga and other Andalusian wares from the Islamic period as well as the Valencian pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, has successive chapters called 6 "Moorish Lustre of Andalucia" and 7 "Hispano-Moresque Lustre", but most sources do not so distinguish, which given the difficulty of distinguishing the two reliably, and re-allocation of some types from one to the other, seems prudent.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Spanish medieval pottery was first studied in the 19th century, there was awareness of the Valencian centres but very little of the Al-Andalus ones, and there has been a steady re-attribution of types of pottery formerly attributed to Manises to Malaga and the south, which was still continuing in the 1980s, following archaeological discoveries in Malaga, and scientific analysis of the clays used.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 95 &amp; 100; Jones &amp; Michell, p. 272, no. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

Though other types of painted pottry, not usually called Hispano-Moresque ware, were produced in Al-Andaluz earlier, firm evidence of lustreware production is not found before the early or mid-13th century, when it may have been begun by Egyptian potters escaping political disturbances.  Already it was being exported, as some of the earliest evidence is bowls set as decoration into the facades of churches in [[Pisa]] when they were built.  An import from Malaga through [[Sandwich, Kent]] in England for the Spanish-born Queen [[Eleanor of Castile]] was recorded in 1289, consisting of "42 bowls, 10 dishes, and 4 earthenware jars of foreign colour (''extranei coloris'')".&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 84-86; quote from p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Malagan ware was also exported to the Islamic world, and has been found at [[Fustat]] (medieval [[Cairo]]) and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 271, no. 423&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Granada Alhambra gazelle Poterie 9019.JPG|thumb|Detail of two gazelles from an [[Alhambra]] vase, c. 1400]]

The best known and most impressive examples of Andalucian wares are the '''Alhambra vases''', a number of very large vases made to stand in niches in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], and perhaps elsewhere.  These are very atypical in Islamic pottery in having only a decorative function, with no practical purpose, and are "by far" the largest pieces of lustreware known.  They are based on traditional shapes descended from the ancient [[amphora]], but at about 115 to 170&amp;nbsp;cm tall are close to the height of a human.  They are thought to come from a range of dates covering the late 14th and the 15th centuries, and the decoration and precise shape of the body is different in each surviving example. According to Alan Caiger-Smith, "few other pots in the world make such a strong physical impression".&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 89-93; quotes on p. 90 and p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  

All are now in museums, five in Spain and others in [[St Petersburg]], [[Berlin]], Washington D.C., [[Stockholm]] and [[Palermo]]; various large fragments also survive.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 90-92; Kenesson, 113 n.1 has a fuller account&lt;/ref&gt; Lustre tiles are also still in place at the Alhambra.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 271, no. 424&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Fortuny Tablet", a unique plaque measuring 90 x 44&amp;nbsp;cm, has a garden-like design, inside a border with an inscription praising [[Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada]] (r. 1408-1417).  Its design resembles that of some Spanish carpets.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yusuf's throne was inherited by an eight-year-old in 1418, the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] kingdom went into a decline before its final conquest, and the production of fine pottery seems to cease abruptly about 1450, even though the name ''obra de Malequa'' ("Malaga work") continued to be used in Valencia for lustreware long afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valencia===

[[File:Schüssel mit Wappen des Königreichs Sizilien KGM K1682.jpg|thumb|Early 16th century Valencian dish with the arms of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].]]

[[File:C.sf., manises (valencia), piatto, XVi sec..JPG|thumb|16th century [[Manises]] dish, as quality began to fall off.]]

[[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] and its suburbs Manises and [[Paterna]] became important centres after potters migrated there from the south; the city had returned to Christian rule from 1238, and the immigration of skilled potters had been going on since at least the mid-14th century.  In 1362 a cardinal commissioned floor-tiles in "obra de Malicha" ("Malaga work", probably meaning lustreware) for the Pope's [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] from two masters in Manises, at least one with an Arabic  name (though "Juan" as his forename).  In 1484 a German traveller mentioned vessels "which are made by the Moorish potters".&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that the local lords of Manises, the family of Buyl, encouraged the immigration, and may have acted as distributors and agents for the product; certainly when [[Maria of Castile]], [[Queen of Aragon]], wanted to order a large service in 1454, she wrote to the Buyl lord for him to arrange it.  Several Buyl's had served as ambassadors, to Granada as well as Christian courts, giving them contacts in many markets.  They seem to have taken a 10% royalty on all sales of pottery, and enjoyed a very high income from these.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 101-103&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest deposit of Manises ware found by archaeology, apart from Manises itself, comes from [[Sluis]] in the [[Netherlands]], then part of the territories of the wealthy [[Duchy of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Manises also had [[clay]] and a cave nearby where a special sand used as a raw material for glazes was extracted.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalonia===
[[Barcelona]] in [[Catalonia]] in northeastern Spain, which was under Muslim rule from 718 to 801, became a centre for pottery much later, probably receiving immigrant Christian potters from Al-Andalus, especially Valencia, during the later [[Reconquista]] period. It was important at first for wares resembling the brown and green decorated pottery of Paterna and in the 16th century for lustreware in a "warm silvery-gold", either reflecting different materials available, or a deliberate change in style.  Several other towns began to produce lustreware in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 121-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
Much, in Valencia most, of the pottery was clearly made for a Christian market, as it includes [[coats of arms]] and other Western elements in the decoration. As well as the Christian [[Christogram|IHS]] monogram in the centre, the naturalistic vine-leaf decoration of the dish shown at top is derived from [[Gothic art]], probably via the border decoration of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 272, no. 425&lt;/ref&gt;  No pieces have yet been found that are signed (as many pieces from other Islamic regions are), and hardly any dated, so [[heraldry]], especially when pieces are assumed to have been commissioned to celebrate a wedding, is important evidence for dating.  The pieces "had to be spectacular and elegant, yet every category of vessel had a particular use" and on grand occasions all might be used, even though the largest platters spent most of the time on display propped up vertically on sideboards, as is shown in some contemporary paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 89, 105-109, 111, 113; p. 105 quoted.  On signed pieces from other regions, see Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206-207 and exhibits&lt;/ref&gt;

Andalucian designs use a repertoire of geometric motifs, many of which probably had a religious significance of which Christian buyers remained unaware. These are usually contained in painted compartments.  [[Pseudo-Kufic]] script is used, as well as inscriptions in proper Arabic.  The dominant colours of gold and blue perhaps represent the sun and sky; other colours available, such as brown, green and yellow, are much less used.  From about 1400 some elements, including the depiction of animals, which were probably first used for export wares seem to have become popular among local Muslim buyers also; two of the later "Alhambra vases" described above have pairs of [[gazelle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1250 Quantara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707071338/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1250 |date=2010-07-07 }}, "Large jar decorated with gazelles", now Alhambra&lt;/ref&gt;  By then the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]] kings of Granada had given themselves heraldic arms in the Christian way, which are also seen on pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 86-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large Valencian dishes with typical complicated designs centring on a coat of arms are also decorated on the underside with boldly-painted animal figures occupying the whole space, often also taken from heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;Norman illustrates both sides of numbers C1-C3; Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  Of Manises ware, [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] has written, "the sustained production of fine pieces at Manises during the years 1380–1430 is without parallel in the history of ceramics.  Many of these vessels will keep their place among the world's finest pottery for ever; regardless of changes and outlook."&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1973, p.65&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hispano-Moresque shapes of the fifteenth century included the ''[[albarello]]'' (a tall jar), large serving dishes with coats of arms, made for wealthy people all over Europe, jugs (some on high feet, the ''citra'' and the ''grealet''), a deep-sided dish (the ''lebrillo de alo'') and the eared bowl (''cuenco de oreja'').  Hispano-Moresque wares had a considerable influence on early Italian [[maiolica]],&lt;ref&gt;Nasrid&lt;/ref&gt; indeed two possible derivations of the name have connections with it.  Towards the end of the century designs began to incorporate raised elements in imitation of European silverware shapes, such as [[gadrooning]].&lt;ref&gt;Norman, 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Tiles were made in all centres, and the small ceramic tombstone of an Andalucian student who died in 1409 is one of the very few precisely datable pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Michell, p. 272, no. 427; Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and revival==
Alan Caiger-Smith describes the Valencian industry as the victim of its own success; as the wares initially produced for the very top of society, usually as [[bespoke]] commissions with personalized heraldry, were demanded by the expanding lesser nobility and [[bourgeoisie]], both the size of pieces and their quality of decoration declined, with painting becoming more routine repetitions of simple motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  The Italian maiolica industry, largely developed in imitation of the Spanish, was developing in directions where Valencia could or would not follow.  That the Italian figurative Renaissance painting was not attempted in Spain is perhaps not surprising, but Valencia only joined the Italians in copying simpler shapes from metalware, the Italians being more ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reconquista]] captured Valencia for the third and final time in 1238, and Malaga was one of the last cities to fall, after the [[Siege of Málaga (1487)]].  The remaining Islamic [[Mudéjar]] and converted [[Morisco]] populations were expelled from Spain in 1496 and 1609 respectively, the latter [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]] involving a third of the population in the province of Valencia.  But many of the craftsmen had long been Christians in any case, and the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia, although showing an immediate drop in quality.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster; by now their position as the most prestigious European pottery had been lost to Italian and other producers.

Wares continued to be produced in a slow decline, now relying on relatively local demand for tiles and other decorated items, including [[votive offering]]s.  There were still said to be thirty working kilns at Manises around 1800, by which time the first efforts to revive the industry's former glory had already been made.  The secrets of the techniques for making high-quality wares were largely lost, and after [[Carlos III of Spain]] took a personal interest a report was commissioned in 1785 to record the methods then being used, lest more was lost.  By the 1870s a market had developed for pieces as close to the early work as could be managed, and a number of new firms were set up, some of which continue today, although little original work in the tradition is done.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 166-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
The term "Hispano-Moresque" is also used to describe figured [[silk]] [[textile]]s with geometric patterns woven in Al-Andalus,&lt;ref&gt;Monnas, Lisa. ''Merchants, Princes and Painters: Silk Fabrics in Italian and Northern Paintings 1300-1550''. London and New Haven, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes to refer to [[Mudéjar]] or other work in other media, such as carpets, an industry which followed a similar pattern to pottery in Spain. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] uses the term to describe a gilded parade helmet in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eusi/ho_1983.413.htm Met Museum] Parade Helmet in Hispano-Moresque Style&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago. Until recent decades, it has been the story of what might be called  [[classical cryptography|classic cryptography]] — that is, of methods of [[encryption]] that use pen and paper, or perhaps simple mechanical aids. In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] [[rotor machine]], provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper.

The development of [[cryptography]] has been paralleled by the development of [[cryptanalysis]] —  the "breaking" of codes and [[cipher]]s. The discovery and application, early on, of [[frequency analysis]] to the reading of encrypted communications has, on occasion, altered the course of history.  Thus the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] triggered the United States' entry into World War I; and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reading of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ciphers shortened World War II, in some evaluations by as much as two years.

Until the 1970s, secure cryptography was largely the preserve of governments. Two events have since brought it squarely into the public domain: the creation of a public encryption standard ([[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]), and the invention of [[public-key cryptography]].

The earliest known use of cryptography is found in non-standard [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] carved into the wall of a tomb from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] circa 1900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Brief Hist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cypher.com.au/crypto_history.htm |title=A Brief History of Cryptography |publisher=Cypher Research Laboratories |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers.&lt;ref name="Brief Hist"/&gt;

In India around 400 BCE to 200 CE, [[Mlecchita vikalpa]] or ''the art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing of words in a peculiar way'' was documented in the [[Kama Sutra]] for the purpose of communication between lovers.

Another Greek method was developed by [[Polybius]] (now called the "[[Polybius#Cryptography|Polybius Square]]").&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew something of cryptography (e.g., the [[Caesar cipher]] and its variations).{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In early medieval England between the years 800-1100, substitution ciphers were frequently used by scribes as a playful and clever way encipher notes, solutions to riddles, and colophons. The ciphers tend to be fairly straightforward, but sometimes they deviate from an ordinary pattern, adding to their complexity and, possibly, to their sophistication as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saltzman|first=Benjamin A.|title=Ut hkskdkxt: Early Medieval Cryptography, Textual Errors, and Scribal Agency (Speculum, forthcoming)|url=https://www.academia.edu/35034685/Ut_hkskdkxt_Early_Medieval_Cryptography_Textual_Errors_and_Scribal_Agency_Speculum_forthcoming_|journal=Speculum|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period saw vital and significant cryptographic experimentation in the West.  

[[Ahmad al-Qalqashandi]] (AD 1355–1418) wrote the ''Subh al-a 'sha'', a 14-volume encyclopedia which included a section on cryptology. This information was attributed to [[Ibn al-Durayhim]] who lived from AD 1312 to 1361, but whose writings on cryptography have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both [[Substitution cipher|substitution]] and [[Transposition cipher|transposition]], and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each [[plaintext]] letter. Also traced to Ibn al-Durayhim is an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of [[letter frequencies]] and sets of letters which cannot occur together in one word.

The earliest example of the homophonic [[substitution cipher]] is the one used by [[Duke of Mantua]] in the early 1400s.&lt;ref&gt;David Salamon [https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=A88kvYwIVu0C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=homophonic+mantua+1400s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yFuWvMfqjC&amp;sig=1A9yxLbgHYsbL-LVmg9XatDGVxI&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEoMnxqvDKAhWGWCwKHXdPA_cQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coding for Data and Computer Communications]. Springer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Homophonic cipher replaces each letter with multiple symbols depending on the letter frequency. The cipher is ahead of the time because it combines monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic features.

Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to the cryptanalytic technique of frequency analysis until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, and many remained so thereafter. The polyalphabetic cipher was most clearly explained by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] around the year AD 1467, for which he was called the "father of Western cryptology".&lt;ref name="Brief Hist"/&gt; [[Johannes Trithemius]], in his work [[Polygraphia (book)|Poligraphia]], invented the [[tabula recta]], a critical component of the Vigenère cipher. Trithemius also wrote the [[Steganographia]]. The French cryptographer [[Blaise de Vigenère]] devised a practical polyalphabetic system which bears his name, the  [[Vigenère cipher]].&lt;ref name="Brief Hist"/&gt;

In Europe, cryptography became (secretly) more important as a consequence of political competition and religious revolution. For instance, in Europe during and after the [[Renaissance]], citizens of the various Italian states—the [[Papal States]] and the Roman Catholic Church included—were responsible for rapid proliferation of cryptographic techniques, few of which reflect understanding (or even knowledge) of Alberti's polyalphabetic advance. 'Advanced ciphers', even after Alberti, weren't as advanced as their inventors / developers / users claimed (and probably even themselves believed). They were regularly broken. This over-optimism may be inherent in cryptography, for it was then - and remains today - fundamentally difficult to accurately know how vulnerable one's system actually is. In the absence of knowledge, guesses and hopes, predictably, are common.

Cryptography, [[cryptanalysis]], and secret-agent/courier betrayal featured in the [[Babington plot]] during the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] which led to the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. [[Robert Hooke]] suggested in the chapter ''Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits'', that [[John Dee]] made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xVTAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke|page=203|author=Robert Hooke|year=1705|publisher=Richard Waller, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief cryptographer of King Louis XIV of France was Antoine Rossignol and he and his family created what is known as the [[Great Cipher]] because it remained unsolved from its initial use until 1890, when French military cryptanalyst, [[Étienne Bazeries]] solved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lund|first1=Paul|title=The Book of Codes|date=2009|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=9780520260139|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; An encrypted message from the time of the [[Man in the Iron Mask]] (decrypted just prior to 1900 by [[Étienne Bazeries]]) has shed some, regrettably non-definitive, light on the identity of that real, if legendary and unfortunate, prisoner.

Outside of Europe, after the Mongols brought about the end of the Muslim Golden Age, cryptography remained comparatively undeveloped. [[Cryptography in Japan]] seems not to have been used until about 1510, and advanced techniques were not known until after the opening of the country to the West beginning in the 1860s.

== Cryptography from 1800 to World War II ==
{{Main article|World War I cryptography}}
Although cryptography has a long and complex history, it wasn't until the 19th century that it developed anything more than ad hoc approaches to either encryption or [[cryptanalysis]] (the science of finding weaknesses in crypto systems). Examples of the latter include [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Crimean War]] era work on mathematical cryptanalysis of [[polyalphabetic cipher]]s, redeveloped and published somewhat later by the Prussian [[Friedrich Kasiski]].  Understanding of cryptography at this time typically consisted of hard-won rules of thumb; see, for example, [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]]' cryptographic writings in the latter 19th century.  [[Edgar Allan Poe]] used systematic methods to solve ciphers in the 1840s. In particular he placed a notice of his abilities in the [[Philadelphia]] paper ''Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger'', inviting submissions of ciphers, of which he proceeded to solve almost all. His success created a public stir for some months.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 152-3&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote an essay on methods of cryptography which proved useful as an introduction for novice British cryptanalysts attempting to break German codes and ciphers during World War I, and a famous story, ''[[The Gold-Bug]]'', in which cryptanalysis was a prominent element.

Cryptography, and its misuse, were involved in the execution of [[Mata Hari]] and in [[Dreyfus affair|Dreyfus' conviction]] and imprisonment, both in the early 20th century. Cryptographers were also involved in exposing the machinations which had led to the Dreyfus affair; Mata Hari, in contrast, was shot.

In World War I the [[Admiralty]]'s [[Room 40]] broke German naval codes and played an important role in several naval engagements during the war, notably in detecting major German sorties into the [[North Sea]] that led to the battles of [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]] as the British fleet was sent out to intercept them. However its most important contribution was probably in [[cryptanalysis|decrypting]] the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], a [[telegram|cable]] from the German Foreign Office sent via Washington to its [[ambassador]] [[Heinrich von Eckardt]] in Mexico which played a major part in bringing the United States into the war.

In 1917, [[Gilbert Vernam]] proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the cyphertext. This led to the development of electromechanical devices as cipher machines, and to the only unbreakable cipher, the [[one time pad]].

During the 1920s, Polish naval-officers assisted the Japanese military with code and cipher development.

Mathematical methods proliferated in the period prior to World War II (notably in [[William F.

[[Image:Enigma.jpg|thumb|The [[Enigma machine]] was widely used by Nazi Germany; its cryptanalysis by the Allies provided vital [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] intelligence.]]
By World War II, mechanical and electromechanical [[cipher|cipher machines]] were in wide use, although—where such machines were impractical—manual systems continued in use. Great advances were made in both cipher design and [[cryptanalysis]], all in secrecy. Information about this period has begun to be declassified as the official British 50-year secrecy period has come to an end, as US archives have slowly opened, and as assorted memoirs and articles have appeared.

The Germans made heavy use, in several variants, of an electromechanical [[rotor machine]] known as [[Enigma machine|Enigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egress.com/history-of-encryption-infographic/|title=Infographic - The History of Encryption|author=|date=|website=www.egress.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Marian Rejewski]], at Poland's [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]], in December 1932 deduced the detailed structure of the German Army Enigma, using mathematics and limited documentation supplied by Captain [[Gustave Bertrand]] of French [[military intelligence]]. This was the greatest breakthrough in cryptanalysis in a thousand years and more, according to historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rejewski and his mathematical Cipher Bureau colleagues, [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], continued reading Enigma and keeping pace with the evolution of the German Army machine's components and encipherment procedures.  As the Poles' resources became strained by the changes being introduced by the Germans, and as war loomed, the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]], on the Polish [[General Staff]]'s instructions, on 25 July 1939, at [[Warsaw]], initiated French and British intelligence representatives into the secrets of Enigma decryption.

Soon after the [[Invasion of Poland]] by Germany on 1 September 1939, key [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] personnel were evacuated southeastward; on 17 September, as the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union attacked Poland]] from the East, they crossed into [[Romania]]. From there they reached Paris, France; at [[PC Bruno]], near Paris, they continued breaking Enigma, collaborating with British [[cryptologist]]s at [[Bletchley Park]] as the British got up to speed on breaking Enigma.  In due course, the British cryptographers&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;whose ranks included many chess masters and mathematics dons such as [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Max Newman]], and [[Alan Turing]] (the conceptual founder of modern [[computer|computing]])&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;substantially advanced the scale and technology of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[decryption]].

[[German code breaking in World War II]] also had some success, most importantly by breaking the Naval Cypher No. 3.  This enabled them to track and sink Atlantic convoys.  It was only [[Ultra]] intelligence that finally persuaded the admiralty to change their codes in June 1943.  This is surprising given the success of the British [[Room 40]] code breakers in the previous world war.
&lt;!-- IMHO this is the biggest untold scandle of the war.  How many people died due to the gross incompetence of the admiralty cryptogrophers.  For the tiny amount of effort required to implement truely secure codes, they used weak systems.  I would be very interested to know what Naval Cipher No. 3 actually was, just how weak was it. --&gt;

At the end of the War, on 19 April 1945, Britain's top military officers were told that they could never reveal that the German Enigma cipher had been broken because it would give the defeated enemy the chance to say they "were not well and fairly beaten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/22/nenigma22.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/06/22/ixuknews.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ben | last=Fenton | title=Enigma and the British code of honour | date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US Navy]] cryptographers (with cooperation from British and Dutch cryptographers after 1940) broke into several [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] crypto systems. The break into one of them, [[JN-25]], famously led to the US victory in the [[Battle of Midway]]; and to the publication of that fact in the [[Chicago Tribune]] shortly after the battle, though the Japanese seem not to have noticed for they kept using the JN-25 system. A US Army group, the [[Signals Intelligence Service|SIS]], managed to break the highest security Japanese diplomatic cipher system (an electromechanical 'stepping switch' machine called [[Purple code|Purple]] by the Americans) even before World War II began. The Americans referred to the intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, perhaps especially that from the Purple machine, as '[[Magic cryptography|Magic]]'. The British eventually settled on '[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]' for intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, particularly that from message traffic protected by the various Enigmas. An earlier British term for Ultra had been 'Boniface' in an attempt to suggest, if betrayed, that it might have an individual agent as a source.

The German military also deployed several mechanical attempts at a [[one-time pad]]. Bletchley Park called them the [[FISH (cryptography)|Fish cipher]]s, and [[Max Newman]] and colleagues designed and deployed the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]], and then the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], to help with their cryptanalysis. The German Foreign Office began to use the [[one-time pad]] in 1919; some of this traffic was read in World War II partly as the result of recovery of some key material in South America that was discarded without sufficient care by a German courier.

The Japanese Foreign Office used a locally developed electrical stepping switch based system (called [[Purple code|Purple]] by the US), and also had used several similar machines for attaches in some Japanese embassies. One of the electrical stepping switch based systems referred to earlier as [[Purple code|Purple]] was called the 'M-machine' by the US, another was referred to as 'Red'. All were broken, to one degree or another, by the Allies.

[[Image:SIGABA-patent.png|right|320px|thumbnail|SIGABA is described in {{US patent|6175625}}, filed in 1944 but not issued until 2001.]]

[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cipher machines used in World War II included the British [[TypeX]] and the American [[SIGABA]]; both were electromechanical rotor designs similar in spirit to the Enigma, albeit with major improvements. Neither is known to have been broken by anyone during the War. The Poles used the [[Lacida]] machine, but its security was found to be less than intended (by Polish Army cryptographers in the UK), and its use was discontinued. US troops in the field used the [[M-209]] and the still less secure [[M-94]] family machines. British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents initially used 'poem ciphers' (memorized poems were the encryption/decryption keys), but later in the War, they began to [[Leo Marks|switch]] to [[one-time pad]]s.

The [[VIC cipher]] (used at least until 1957 in connection with [[Rudolf Abel]]'s NY spy ring) was a very complex hand cipher, and is claimed to be the most complicated known to have been used by the Soviets, according to David Kahn in ''Kahn on Codes''. For the decrypting of Soviet ciphers (particularly when ''one-time pads'' were reused), see [[Venona project]].

==Modern cryptography==
Encryption in modern times is achieved by using algorithms that have a key to encrypt and decrypt information. These keys convert the messages and data into "digital gibberish" through encryption and then return them to the original form through decryption. In general, the longer the key is, the more difficult it is to crack the code. This holds true because deciphering an encrypted message by brute force would require the attacker to try every possible key. To put this in context, each binary unit of information, or bit, has a value of 0 or 1. An 8-bit key would then have 256 or 2^8 possible keys. A 56-bit key would have 2^56, or 72 quadrillion, possible keys to try and decipher the message. With modern technology, cyphers using keys with these lengths are becoming easier to decipher.  DES, an early US Government approved cypher, has an effective key length of 56 bits, and test messages using that cypher have been broken by brute force key search. However, as technology advances, so does the quality of encryption. Since World War II, one of the most notable advances in the study of cryptography is the introduction of the asymmetric key cyphers (sometimes termed public-key cyphers).  These are algorithms which use two mathematically related keys for encryption of the same message. Some of these algorithms permit publication of one of the keys, due to it being extremely difficult to determine one key simply from knowledge of the other.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;

Beginning around 1990, the use of the [[Internet]] for commercial purposes and the introduction of commercial transactions over the Internet called for a widespread standard for encryption. Before the introduction of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), information sent over the Internet, such as financial data, was encrypted if at all, most commonly using the Data Encryption Standard (DES). This had been approved by NBS (a US Government agency) for its security, after public call for, and a comptetition among, candidates for such a cypher algorithm. DES was approved for a short period, but saw extended use due to complex wrangles over the use by the public of high quality encryption.  DES was finally replaced by the AES after another public competition organized by the NBS successor agency, NIST.  Around the late 1990s to early 2000s, the use of public-key algorithms became a more common approach for encryption, and soon a [[hybrid cryptosystem|hybrid of the two schemes]] became the most accepted way for e-commerce operations to proceed. Additionally, the creation of a new protocol known as the Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, led the way for online transactions to take place. Transactions ranging from purchasing goods to online bill pay and banking used SSL. Furthermore, as wireless Internet connections became more common among households, the need for encryption grew, as a level of security was needed in these everyday situations.&lt;ref name="Journal" /&gt;

===Claude Shannon===
[[Claude Shannon|Claude E. Shannon]] is considered by many{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} to be the father of mathematical cryptography. Shannon worked for several years at Bell Labs, and during his time there, he produced an article entitled "A mathematical theory of cryptography". This article was written in 1945 and eventually was published in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1949.&lt;ref name="Shannon1949"&gt;[http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/files/shannon1949.pdf Communication theory of secrecy systems], Claude Shannon, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly accepted that this paper was the starting point for development of modern cryptography. Shannon was inspired during the war to address "[t]he problems of cryptography [because] secrecy systems furnish an interesting application of communication theory". Shannon identified the two main goals of cryptography: secrecy and authenticity. His focus was on exploring secrecy and thirty-five years later, G.J. Simmons would address the issue of authenticity. Shannon wrote a further article entitled "A mathematical theory of communication" which highlights one of the most significant aspects of his work: cryptography's transition from art to science.&lt;ref name="Claude Shannon" /&gt;

In his works, Shannon described the two basic types of systems for secrecy. The first are those designed with the intent to protect against hackers and attackers who have infinite resources with which to decode a message (theoretical secrecy, now unconditional security), and the second are those designed to protect against hackers and attacks with finite resources with which to decode a message (practical secrecy, now computational security). Most of Shannon's work focused around theoretical secrecy; here, Shannon introduced a definition for the "unbreakability" of a cipher. If a cipher was determined "unbreakable", it was considered to have "perfect secrecy". In proving "perfect secrecy", Shannon determined that this could only be obtained with a secret key whose length given in binary digits was greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in the information being encrypted. Furthermore, Shannon developed the "unicity distance", defined as the "amount of plaintext that… determines the secret key."&lt;ref name="Claude Shannon" /&gt;

Shannon's work influenced further cryptography research in the 1970s, as the public-key cryptography developers, M. E. Hellman and W. Diffie cited Shannon's research as a major influence. His work also impacted modern designs of secret-key ciphers. At the end of Shannon's work with cryptography, progress slowed until Hellman and Diffie introduced their paper involving "public-key cryptography".&lt;ref name="Claude Shannon" /&gt;

===An encryption standard===
The mid-1970s saw two major public (i.e., non-secret) advances. First was the publication of the draft [[Data Encryption Standard]] in the U.S. ''Federal Register'' on 17 March 1975. The proposed DES cipher was submitted by a research group at [[International Business Machines|IBM]], at the invitation of the National Bureau of Standards (now [[NIST]]), in an effort to develop secure electronic communication facilities for businesses such as banks and other large financial organizations. After advice and modification by the [[NSA]], acting behind the scenes, it was adopted and published as a [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] Publication in 1977 (currently at [http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf FIPS 46-3]). DES was the first publicly accessible cipher to be 'blessed' by a national agency such as the NSA. The release of its specification by NBS stimulated an explosion of public and academic interest in cryptography.

The aging DES was officially replaced by the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) in 2001 when NIST announced FIPS 197. After an open competition, NIST selected [[Rijndael]], submitted by two Belgian cryptographers, to be the AES. DES, and more secure variants of it (such as [[Triple DES]]), are still used today, having been incorporated into many national and organizational standards. However, its 56-bit key-size has been shown to be insufficient to guard against [[brute force attack]]s (one such attack, undertaken by the cyber civil-rights group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] in 1997, succeeded in 56 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation, ''Cracking DES'', O'Reilly, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;) As a result, use of straight DES encryption is now without doubt insecure for use in new cryptosystem designs, and messages protected by older cryptosystems using DES, and indeed all messages sent since 1976 using DES, are also at risk. Regardless of DES' inherent quality, the DES key size (56-bits) was thought to be too small by some even in 1976, perhaps most publicly by [[Whitfield Diffie]]. There was suspicion that government organizations even then had sufficient computing power to break DES messages; clearly others have achieved this capability.

===Public key===
The second development, in 1976, was perhaps even more important, for it fundamentally changed the way cryptosystems might work. This was the publication of the paper [http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf New Directions in Cryptography] by [[Whitfield Diffie]] and [[Martin Hellman]]. It introduced a radically new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution, and has become known as [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]. The article also stimulated the almost immediate public development of a new class of enciphering algorithms, the [[asymmetric key algorithm]]s.

Prior to that time, all useful modern encryption algorithms had been [[symmetric key algorithm]]s, in which the same [[cryptographic key]] is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret. All of the electromechanical machines used in World War II were of this logical class, as were the [[Caesar cipher|Caesar]] and [[Atbash]] ciphers and essentially all cipher systems throughout history. The 'key' for a code is, of course, the codebook, which must likewise be distributed and kept secret, and so shares most of the same problems in practice.

Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system (the term usually used is 'via a [[secure channel]]') such as a trustworthy courier with a briefcase handcuffed to a wrist, or face-to-face contact, or a loyal carrier pigeon. This requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases, or when secure channels aren't available for key exchange, or when, as is sensible cryptographic practice, keys are frequently changed. In particular, if messages are meant to be secure from other users, a separate key is required for each possible pair of users. A system of this kind is known as a secret key, or [[symmetric key]] cryptosystem. D-H key exchange (and succeeding improvements and variants) made operation of these systems much easier, and more secure, than had ever been possible before in all of history.

In contrast, [[asymmetric key algorithm|asymmetric key]] encryption uses a pair of mathematically related keys, each of which decrypts the encryption performed using the other. Some, but not all, of these algorithms have the additional property that one of the paired keys cannot be deduced from the other by any known method other than trial and error. An algorithm of this kind is known as a public key or [[asymmetric key cryptography|asymmetric key]] system. Using such an algorithm, only one key pair is needed per user. By designating one key of the pair as private (always secret), and the other as public (often widely available), no secure channel is needed for key exchange. So long as the private key stays secret, the public key can be widely known for a very long time without compromising security, making it safe to reuse the same key pair indefinitely.

For two users of an asymmetric key algorithm to communicate securely over an insecure channel, each user will need to know their own public and private keys as well as the other user's public key. Take this basic scenario: [[Alice and Bob]] each have a pair of keys they've been using for years with many other users. At the start of their message, they exchange public keys, unencrypted over an insecure line. Alice then encrypts a message using her private key, and then re-encrypts that result using Bob's public key. The double-encrypted message is then sent as digital data over a wire from Alice to Bob. Bob receives the bit stream and decrypts it using his own private key, and then decrypts that bit stream using Alice's public key. If the final result is recognizable as a message, Bob can be confident that the message actually came from someone who knows Alice's private key (presumably actually her if she's been careful with her private key), and that anyone eavesdropping on the channel will need Bob's private key in order to understand the message.

Asymmetric algorithms rely for their effectiveness on a class of problems in mathematics called one-way functions, which require relatively little computational power to execute, but vast amounts of power to reverse, if reversal is possible at all. A classic example of a one-way function is multiplication of very large prime numbers. It's fairly quick to multiply two large primes, but very difficult to find the factors of the product of two large primes. Because of the mathematics of one-way functions, most possible keys are bad choices as cryptographic keys; only a small fraction of the possible keys of a given length are suitable, and so asymmetric algorithms require very long keys to reach the same [[level of security]] provided by relatively shorter symmetric keys. The need to both generate the key pairs, and perform the encryption/decryption operations make asymmetric algorithms computationally expensive, compared to most symmetric algorithms. Since symmetric algorithms can often use any sequence of (random, or at least unpredictable) bits as a key, a disposable ''session key'' can be quickly generated for short-term use. Consequently, it is common practice to use a long asymmetric key to exchange a disposable, much shorter (but just as strong) symmetric key. The slower asymmetric algorithm securely sends a symmetric session key, and the faster symmetric algorithm takes over for the remainder of the message.

Asymmetric key cryptography, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and the best known of the public key / private key algorithms (i.e., what is usually called the RSA algorithm), all seem to have been independently developed at a UK intelligence agency before the public announcement by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. GCHQ has released documents claiming they had developed public key cryptography before the publication of Diffie and Hellman's paper.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Various classified papers were written at GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s which eventually led to schemes essentially identical to RSA encryption and to Diffie–Hellman key exchange in 1973 and 1974. Some of these have now been published, and the inventors (James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson) have made public (some of) their work.

===Hashing===
[[Hash function|Hashing]] is a common technique used in cryptography to encode information quickly using typical algorithms. Generally, an [[algorithm]] is applied to a string of text, and the resulting string becomes the "hash value". This creates a "digital fingerprint" of the message, as the specific hash value is used to identify a specific message. The output from the algorithm is also referred to as a "message digest" or a "check sum". Hashing is good for determining if information has been changed in transmission. If the hash value is different upon reception than upon sending, there is evidence the message has been altered. Once the algorithm has been applied to the data to be hashed, the hash function produces a fixed-length output. Essentially, anything passed through the hash function should resolve to the same length output as anything else passed through the same hash function. It is important to note that hashing is not the same as encrypting. Hashing is a one-way operation that is used to transform data into the compressed message digest. Additionally, the integrity of the message can be measured with hashing. Conversely, encryption is a two-way operation that is used to transform plaintext into cipher-text and then vice versa. In encryption, the confidentiality of a message is guaranteed.&lt;ref name=CISSP /&gt;

Hash functions can be used to verify digital signatures, so that when signing documents via the Internet, the signature is applied to one particular individual. Much like a hand-written signature, these signatures are verified by assigning their exact hash code to a person. Furthermore, hashing is applied to passwords for computer systems. Hashing for passwords began with the [[Unix|UNIX]] operating system. A user on the system would first create a password. That password would be hashed, using an algorithm or key, and then stored in a password file. This is still prominent today, as web applications that require passwords will often hash user's passwords and store them in a database.&lt;ref name="Hash Function" /&gt;

===Cryptography politics===
The public developments of the 1970s broke the near monopoly on high quality cryptography held by government organizations (see S Levy's ''Crypto'' for a journalistic account of some of the policy controversy of the time in the US). For the first time ever, those outside government organizations had access to cryptography not readily breakable by anyone (including governments). Considerable controversy, and conflict, both public and private, began more or less immediately, sometimes called the [[crypto wars]]. They have not yet subsided. In many countries, for example, [[export of cryptography]] is subject to restrictions. Until 1996 export from the U.S. of cryptography using keys longer than 40 bits (too small to be very secure against a knowledgeable attacker) was sharply limited. As recently as 2004, former [[FBI]] Director [[Louis Freeh]], testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]], called for new laws against public use of encryption.

One of the most significant people favoring strong encryption for public use was [[Phil Zimmermann]]. He wrote and then in 1991 released [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] (Pretty Good Privacy), a very high quality [[crypto system]]. He distributed a freeware version of PGP when he felt threatened by legislation then under consideration by the US Government that would require backdoors to be included in all cryptographic products developed within the US. His system was released worldwide shortly after he released it in the US, and that began a long criminal investigation of him by the US Government Justice Department for the alleged violation of export restrictions.  The Justice Department eventually dropped its case against Zimmermann, and the freeware distribution of PGP has continued around the world. PGP even eventually became an open [[IETF|Internet]] standard (RFC 2440 or [[OpenPGP]]).

===Modern cryptanalysis===
While modern ciphers like [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and the higher quality asymmetric ciphers are widely considered unbreakable, poor designs and implementations are still sometimes adopted and there have been important cryptanalytic breaks of deployed crypto systems in recent years. Notable examples of broken crypto designs include the first [[Wi-Fi]] encryption scheme [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]], the [[Content Scrambling System]] used for encrypting and controlling DVD use, the [[A5/1]] and [[A5/2]] ciphers used in [[GSM]] cell phones, and the [[CRYPTO1]] cipher used in the widely deployed [[MIFARE]] Classic [[smart card]]s from [[NXP Semiconductors]], a spun off division of [[Philips Electronics]]. All of these are symmetric ciphers. Thus far, not one of the mathematical ideas underlying public key cryptography has been proven to be 'unbreakable', and so some future mathematical analysis advance might render systems relying on them insecure. While few informed observers foresee such a breakthrough, the key size recommended for security as best practice keeps increasing as increased computing power required for breaking codes becomes cheaper and more available.

'''Home appliances''' are [[electrical]]/[[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanical]] [[machine]]s which accomplish some [[household]] functions,&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; such as [[cooking]], [[cleanliness|cleaning]], or [[food preservation]].

Home appliances can be divided into three classifications, which include:
*[[Major appliance]]s, or white goods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/white-goods#white-goods_1|title=white goods|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Small appliance]]s,
*[[Consumer electronics]], or brown goods in regions with UK influence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/brown-goods|title=brown goods|work=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This division is also noticeable in the [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] of these kinds of products. Brown goods usually require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.

Given a broad usage, the domestic application attached to "home appliance" is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as "an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | publisher=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[Collins dictionary]] defines "home appliance" as: "devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,&lt;ref name="Bulletin 2014"/&gt; [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s&lt;ref name="Bulletin 2014"/&gt; and [[air conditioner]]s to [[light bulb]]s and [[water well pump]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ap.osu.edu/FileStore/PDFs/EM%20What%20size%20generator%20do%20I%20need.pdf | title=What size generator do I need? | publisher=Ohio State University | accessdate=24 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152539/http://ap.osu.edu/FileStore/PDFs/EM%20What%20size%20generator%20do%20I%20need.pdf | archivedate=2 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.daftlogic.com/information-appliance-power-consumption.htm | title=List of the Power Consumption of Typical Household Appliances | publisher=Daftlogic | accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]
&lt;!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be "refs at the end of each paragraph". Feel free to reference however you like, though--&gt;
While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.&lt;!--For this sentence only   &lt;ref name="George2003"/&gt;  . Also, research "Hotpoint Iron". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --&gt; In the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience. Increasing [[discretionary income]] was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.&lt;ref name="eai"&gt;{{cite book | title=Encyclopedia of American Industries Volume 1 | publisher=Gale Research | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="George2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=William George|title=Antique Electric Waffle Irons 1900-1960: A History of the Appliance Industry in 20th Century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rW5t4MIgx40C|year=2003|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-55395-632-7|page=1}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America during the 1980s, the industry shipped $1.5 billion worth of goods each year and employed over 14,000 workers, with revenues doubling between 1982 and 1990 to $3.3 billion. Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[anti-trust legislation]].

The [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.&lt;ref name="eai" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies. For example, in 1991, [[dishwasher]] manufacturing market share was split between [[General Electric]] with 40% market share, [[Whirlpool (company)|Whirlpool]] with 31% market share, [[Electrolux]] with 20% market share, [[Maytag]] with 7% market share and [[Thermador]] with just 2% of market share.&lt;ref name=eai /&gt;

==Major appliances==
[[File:Wascator.jpg|thumb|upright|Swedish washing machine, 1950s]]
{{main|Major appliance}}
Major appliances, also known as white goods, comprise major household appliances and may include: [[air conditioner]]s,&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[dishwasher]]s,&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[clothes dryer]]s, [[drying cabinet]]s, [[freezer]]s, [[refrigerator]]s,&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[kitchen stove]]s, [[water heater]]s,&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[washing machine]]s,&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[trash compactor]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, and [[induction cookers]].  White goods were typically painted or [[vitreous enamel|enameled]] white, and many of them still are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Goods|url=http://docslide.us/documents/white-goods.html|website=www.icfdc.com|publisher=Data monitor, Static.scrib|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small appliances==
{{main|Small appliance}}
Small appliances are typically small household electrical machines, also very useful and easily carried and installed.  Yet another category is used in the kitchen, including: [[juicer]]s, [[electric mixer]]s,&lt;ref name="Jubis 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jubis 2012" /&gt; [[meat grinder]]s, [[coffee grinder]]s, [[Deep frying|deep fryers]],&lt;ref name="Jubis 2012" /&gt; [[herb grinder]]s, [[food processor]]s,&lt;ref name="Jubis 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports News 2014" /&gt; [[electric kettle]]s, [[waffle iron]]s, [[coffee maker]]s, [[blender]]s&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports News 2014" /&gt; and [[dough blender]]s, [[rice cooker]]s,&lt;ref name="Bulletin 2014" /&gt; [[toaster]]s and [[exhaust hood]]s.

Entertainment and information appliances such as: [[home electronics]],&lt;ref name="NRDC"/&gt; [[TV set]]s,&lt;ref name="Bulletin 2014"/&gt; [[CD player|CD]], [[VCR]]s and [[DVD player]]s,&lt;ref name="Bulletin 2014"/&gt; [[camcorder]]s, [[still camera]]s, [[clock]]s, [[alarm clock]]s, [[computers]], [[video game consoles]], [[HiFi]] and [[home cinema]], [[telephone]]s and [[answering machine]]s are classified as "brown goods".  Some such appliances were traditionally finished with genuine or imitation wood, hence the name.  This has become rare but the name has stuck, even for goods that are unlikely ever to have had a wooden case (e.g. camcorders).

==Networking of home appliances==
{{main|Home automation}}
{{see also|Internet of Things}}
There is a trend of networking home appliances together, and combining their controls and key functions.&lt;ref name=landscape&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michelle|first1=Bangert|title=Getting Smarter All the Time: The Appliance Landscape Continues to Evolve with the Rise of Internet-Connected Devices|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-401777405.html|accessdate=5 May 2015|work=Appliance Design|publisher=BNP Media|date=1 September 2014|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, energy distribution could be managed more evenly so that when a [[washing machine]] is on, an [[oven]] can go into a delayed start mode, or vice versa. Or, a [[washing machine]] and [[clothes dryer]] could share information about load characteristics (gentle/normal, light/full), and synchronize their finish times so the wet laundry does not have to wait before being put in the dryer.

Additionally, some manufacturers of home appliances are quickly beginning to place hardware that enables [[Internet]] connectivity in home appliances to allow for [[remote control]], automation, communication with other home appliances, and more functionality enabling connected cooking.&lt;ref name=landscape /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Essers|first1=Loek|title=Home appliance makers connect with open source 'Internet of things' project|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2486668/consumerization/home-appliance-makers-connect-with-open-source--internet-of-things--project.html|website=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baguley|first1=Richard|last2=McDonald|first2=Colin|title=Appliance Science: The Internet of Toasters (and other things)|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/appliance-science-the-internet-of-toasters-and-other-things/|website=[[CNET]]|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hitchcox|first1=Alan|title=The Internet of uncertainty|journal=Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics|date=February 2015|volume=68|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-connected home appliances were especially prevalent during recent [[Consumer Electronic Show]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appliances of the Future Will Be Able to 'Talk' over Internet|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-355628014.html|accessdate=5 May 2015|work=[[The Mercury (South Africa)|The Mercury]]|date=15 January 2015|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling==
[[File:Low9AppliancePiles2 (1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|New Orleans after [[Hurricane Katrina]]: mounds of trashed appliances with a few smashed automobiles mixed in, waiting to be scrapped]]
{{Main|Appliance recycling}}
Appliance recycling consists of dismantling waste home appliances and [[scrap]]ping their parts for reuse. The main types of appliances that are recycled are T.V.s, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. It involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components and destruction of the equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading.&lt;ref name="buekens"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buekens | first1 = A. | last2 = Yang | first2 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Recycling of WEEE plastics: A review | url = | journal = The Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 415–434 | doi = 10.1007/s10163-014-0241-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:K-cash logo.jpg|right|thumb|K-CASH logo.]]
'''K-CASH''' is an [[electronic money]] system established by 'Korea Financial Telecommunication and Clearings Institute'.

K-CASH card is easily obtained from issuing bank. Several banks are issuing K-CASH card, including two credit card companies as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcash.co.kr/KCashWeb/KcashGuideIssue01.do K-CASH 발급안내]&lt;/ref&gt; Users can load or unload value from their own account at bank counter, store, ATMs and online. Unlike other market dominant "transport cards", unloading K-CASH value to owner's account is done real-time, as a law only permits real-time transaction to electronic money, not to prepaid card.

[[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean Army]], and  [[Chuncheon]]  .[[Hoengseong]] , [[Wonju]] buses adopt K-CASH as a major payment system. At first, K-CASH was mainly promoted as electronic fare collection system. Despite its advantage, such as bank guarantees its payment or real-time transaction, market dominant systems like [[T-money]] or [[Mybi]]/[[Cashbee]] system drive it out of the market. As of November 2011, following cities and railroad systems are using K-CASH as their public transport fare collecting system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcash.co.kr/KCashWeb/KcashGuideUse01.do K-CASH 사용안내]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisa C. Klein''' (born 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n85-352653}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]], Graduate Director at [[Rutgers University]] and President of the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) at the University.

She has made many breakthroughs in [[engineering]]. Klein's research focuses on the area of sol-gel science, a low-temperature process for making ceramic coatings. Her most important contribution to science has been the development of electrochromic window coatings that can be lightened or darkened through the use of a dimmer attached to a battery. This window coating is unique because it is manually controlled and can reflect the heat away, while still transmitting light in the summer or permit the solar heat in winter. This new development is more efficient than blinds, curtains, or tinted windows and can save on heating and cooling costs in the home or office.

Klein is also noteworthy for her status at Rutgers University: she was the first female faculty member in the Rutgers School of Engineering (1977), the first female faculty member in the department of Materials Science and Engineering, the first female faculty member elevated to the distinguished PII rank, and, as of January, 2008, the only female professor in the department.  As President of the Rutgers AAUP chapter Klein also concluded groundbreaking negotiations that lead to novel methods for expanding the number of tenure track faculty at Rutgers that have been cited &lt;ref&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/08/27/rutgers Bargaining for More Tenure-Track Lines :: Inside Higher Ed :: Jobs, News and Views for All of Higher Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as potential models for faculty efforts to halt the attrition in numbers of tenure track faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080201125144/http://sciencewomen.rutgers.edu/profiles/?a=display&amp;f=girlgeeks&amp;id=198 Rutgers: Women in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics- Girl Geeks/My Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mse.rutgers.edu/faculty.php?name=Klein Lisa C.

This is a '''list of smoked foods'''. [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] is the process of [[seasoning|flavoring]], [[cooking]], or [[food preservation|preserving]] [[food]] by exposing it to [[smoke]] from burning or smoldering material, most often [[wood]]. Foods have been smoked by humans throughout history. [[Meat]]s and [[Fish (food)|fish]] are the most common smoked foods, though [[cheese]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and ingredients used to make [[beverage]]s such as [[whisky]],&lt;ref&gt;McGee p. 767: "Malt whiskies from Scotland's west coast have a unique, smoky flavor that comes from the use of peat fire for drying the malt."&lt;/ref&gt; [[smoked beer]], and ''[[lapsang souchong]]'' [[tea]] are also smoked. Smoked beverages are also included in this list.

[[Smoked meat]] is a method of preparing [[red meat]] (and [[fish]]) which originates in [[prehistory]]. Its purpose is to preserve these protein-rich foods, which would otherwise spoil quickly, for long periods. There are two mechanisms for this preservation: dehydration and the antibacterial properties of absorbed smoke. In modern days, the enhanced flavor of smoked foods makes them a delicacy in many cultures.

[[Sausage]] is a food usually made from [[ground meat]] with a skin around it. Typically, a sausage is formed in a [[casing (sausage)|casing]] traditionally made from [[intestine]], but sometimes synthetic. [[Sausage making]] is a traditional [[food preservation]] technique. Sausages may be preserved by [[curing (food preservation)|curing]], [[Drying (food)|drying]], or smoking. Many types and varieties of sausages are smoked to help preserve them and to add flavor.

'''MEMS sensor generations''' represent the progress made in micro [[sensor]] technology and can be categorized as follows:

;1st Generation :[[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] sensor element mostly based on a [[silicon]] structure, sometimes combined with [[analog circuit|analog]] amplification on a [[integrated circuit|micro chip]].&lt;ref&gt;S.C.Terry,J.H.Jerman and J.B.Angell:A Gas Chromatographic Air Analyzer Fabricated on a Silicon Wafer,IEEE Trans.Electron Devices,ED-26,12(1979)1880-1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

;2nd Generation:MEMS sensor element combined with analog amplification and [[analog-to-digital converter]] on one micro chip.

;3rd Generation :Fusion of the sensor element with analog amplification, analog-to-digital converter and [[Digital data|digital]] intelligence for linearization and temperature compensation on the same micro chip.

;4th Generation :Memory cells for calibration- and temperature compensation data are added to the elements of the 3rd MEMS sensor generation.

A '''modular process skid''' is a [[Process engineering|process system]] contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported.  Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.

Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csidesigns.com/flowgeeks/what-is-a-skid-system/ |title=What Is a Skid System? &amp;#124; FlowGeeks |publisher=Csidesigns.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/advantages-of-modular-process-design-infographic |title=Advantages of Modular Process Design Infographic |publisher=Epicmodularprocess.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred.

==Skid design and layout==
Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proscon.com/solutions/modular.html |title=Modular Process Systems from |publisher=ProsCon |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All skids have the following characteristics in common:
* '''Portable design'''– because they are self-contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. 
* '''Small footprint''' – process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design
* '''Gathered process connections''' – process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. 
* '''Controlled assembly''' – skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. 
*[[Acceptance testing|'''FAT testing''']] before installation – Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time.
*'''Accessible layout''' – skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23191">'''Nanoarchitectures for lithium-ion batteries''' are attempts to employ [[nanotechnology]] to improve the design of [[lithium-ion batteries]]. [[Research in lithium-ion batteries]] focuses on improving [[energy density]], [[power density]], safety, durability and cost.

== Research areas ==

=== Energy density ===
Increased energy density requires inserting/extracting more [[ion]]s from the [[electrode]]s. Electrode capacities are compared through three different measures: capacity per unit of mass (known as "[[specific energy]]" or "gravimetric capacity"), capacity per unit volume ("volumetric capacity"), and area-normalized specific capacity ("areal capacity").

=== Power density ===
Separate efforts focus on improving power density (rate of charge/discharge). Power density is based upon mass and charge transport, electronic and ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], and electron-transfer kinetics; easy transport through shorter distance and greater surface area improve the rates.&lt;ref name="NatMat2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aricò | first1 = A.

=== Anodes ===
[[Carbon]] [[anode]]s are traditionally used because of lithium's ability to [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalate]] without unacceptable volumetric expansion. The latter damages the battery and reduces the amount of lithium available for charging. Reduced intercalation limits capacity. Carbon based anodes have a gravimetric capacity of 372 mAh/g for LiC&lt;sub&gt;6.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="ECSL2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Graetz | first1 = J. | last2 = Ahn | first2 = C.

The specific capacity of [[silicon]] is approximately ten times greater than carbon. The atomic radius of Si is 1.46 [[angstrom]]s, while the atomic radius of Li is 2.05 angstroms. The formation of Li&lt;sub&gt;3.75&lt;/sub&gt;Si causes significant volumetric expansion, progressively destroying the anode.&lt;ref name="JMC2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Larcher | first1 = D. | last2 = Beattie | first2 = S. | last3 = Morcrette | first3 = M. | last4 = Edström | first4 = K. | last5 = Jumas | first5 = J.

Nanoscale particles are below the critical flaw size within a conductive binder film.&lt;ref name="ECSL2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Talyosef | first1 = Y. | last2 = Markovsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Lavi | first3 = R. | last4 = Salitra | first4 = G. | last5 = Aurbach | first5 = D. | last6 = Kovacheva | first6 = D. | last7 = Gorova | first7 = M. | last8 = Zhecheva | first8 = E. | last9 = Stoyanova | first9 = R. | doi = 10.1149/1.2736657 | title = Comparing the Behavior of Nano- and Microsized Particles of LiMn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Spinel as Cathode Materials for Li-Ion Batteries | journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume = 154 | issue = 7 | pages = A682 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing transport lengths(the distance between the anode and cathode) reduces ohmic losses (resistance).

Nanostructuring increases the surface area to volume ratio, which improves both energy and power density due to an increase in the electrochemically active area and a reduction in transport lengths. However, the increase also increases side reactions between the electrode and the electrolyte, causing higher self-discharge, reduced charge/discharge cycles and lower calendar life. Some recent work focused on developing materials that are electrochemically active within the range where electrolyte decomposition or electrolyte/electrode reactions do not occur.&lt;ref name="NatMat2005" /&gt;

=== Nonconventional architectures ===
A research concept has been proposed, in which the major parts of lithium-ion batteries, that is, anode, electrolyte and cathode are combined in one functional molecule. A layer of such functional molecules aligned by the use of Langmuir-Blodgett method than placed in between two current collectors.&lt;ref name="Figshare1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aliev| first1 = A. | title = Energy conversion and storage nanodevices based on monolayer architecture. | doi = 10.6084/m9.figshare.3442784 | journal = figshare }}&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility is not confirmed yet.

==Nanostructured architectures==

A significant majority of battery designs are two–dimensional and rely on layered construction.&lt;ref name = CR2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Long | first1 = Jeffrey W. | last2 = Dunn | first2 = Bruce | last3 = Rolison | first3 = Debra R. | last4 = White | first4 = Henry S. | year = | title = Architectures, Three-Dimensional Battery | doi = 10.1021/cr020740l | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 4463–4492 | pmid=15669159 | date=Oct 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has taken the electrodes into three-dimensions. This allows for significant improvements in battery capacity; a significant increase in areal capacity occurs between a 2d thick film electrode and a 3d array electrode.&lt;ref name = ESI2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Long | first2 = Jeffrey W. | last3 = Rolison | first3 = Debra R. | year = | title = Rethinking Multifunction in Three Dimensions for Miniaturizing Electrical Energy Storage | url = http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/fal/fal08/fal08_p49-53.pdf | journal = Electrochemical Society Interface | volume = 2008 | issue = | pages = 49–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three-dimensional thin–films===

Solid state batteries employ geometry most similar to traditional thin-film batteries. Three-dimensional thin-films use the third dimension to increase the electrochemically active area. Thin film two dimensional batteries are restricted to between 2-5 micrometres, limiting areal capacity to significantly less than that of three-dimensional geometries.

Dimensionality is increased by using a perforated substrate. One way to create perforations is through inductive coupled plasma etching on silicon.&lt;ref name=JMS2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nathan | first1 = M. | last2 = Golodnitsky | first2 = D. | last3 = Yufit | first3 = V. | last4 = Strauss | first4 = E. | last5 = Ripenbein | first5 = T. | last6 = Shechtman | first6 = I. | last7 = Menkin | first7 = S. | last8 = Peled | first8 = E. | doi = 10.1109/JMEMS.2005.851860 | title = Three-dimensional thin-film Li-ion microbatteries for autonomous MEMS | journal = Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 879–885 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approached used highly [[anisotropic]] etching of a silicon substrate through electrochemical or reactive ion etching to create deep trenches. The requisite layers, an anode, separator, and cathode, for a battery were then added by low-pressure [[chemical vapor deposition]]. The battery consists of a thin active silicon layer separated from a thin cathodic layer by a solid-state electrolyte. The electrochemically active area consists of 50&amp;nbsp;nm nanoparticles, smaller than the critical size for crack propagation.&lt;ref name="AD2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pikul | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Gang Zhang | first2 = H. | last3 = Cho | first3 = J. | last4 = Braun | first4 = P. V. | last5 = King | first5 = W. P. | title = High-power lithium ion microbatteries from interdigitated three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporous electrodes | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2747 | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | pages = 1732 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23591899| pmc = | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E1732P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdigitated electrodes===

Another architecture is a periodic grouping of anodic and cathodic poles. For this design power and energy density is maximized by minimizing electrode separation. An innate non-uniform current density occurs and lowers cell efficiencies, reduces stability and produces non-uniform heating within the cell. Relative to a two dimensional battery the length (L) over which transport must occur is decreased by two-thirds, which improves kinetics and reduces ohmic loses. Optimization of L can lead to significant improvement in areal capacity; an L on the size scale of 500 micrometres results in a 350% increase in capacity over a comparable two dimensional battery. However, ohmic losses increase with L, eventually offsetting the enhancement achieved through increasing L.

For this geometry, four main designs were proposed: rows of anodes and cathodes, alternating anodes and cathodes, hexagonally packed 1:2 anodes:cathodes, and alternating anodic and cathodic triangular poles where the nearest neighbors in the row are rotated 180 degrees.

The row design has a large, non-uniform current distribution. The alternating design exhibits better uniformity, given a high number of electrodes of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]. For systems with an anode or cathode that is sensitive to non-uniform current density, non-equal numbers of cathodes and anodes can be used; the 2:1 hexagonal design allows for a uniform current density at the anode but a non-uniform current distribution at the cathode. Performance can be increased through changing the shape of the poles. The triangular design improves cell capacity and power by sacrificing current uniformity.&lt;ref name="CR2006" /&gt;  A similar system uses interdigitated plates instead of poles.&lt;ref name="CR2006" /&gt;

In 2013 researchers used [[additive manufacturing]] to create stacked, interdigitated electrodes. The battery was no larger than a grain of sand. The process placed anodes and cathodes closer to each other than before. The ink for the anode was nanoparticles of one lithium metal oxide compound, and the ink for the cathode from nanoparticles of another. The printer deposited the inks onto the teeth of two gold combs, forming an interlaced stack of anodes and cathodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = K. | last2 = Wei | first2 = T.

===Concentric electrodes===

The concentric cylinder design is similar to interdigitated poles. Instead of discrete anode and cathode poles, the anode or cathode is kept as a pole that is coated by electrolyte. The other electrode serves as the continuous phase in which the anode/cathode resides. The main advantage is that the amount of electrolyte is reduced, increasing energy density. This design maintains a short transport distance like the interdigitated system and thus has a similar benefit to charge and mass transport, while minimizing ohmic loses.&lt;ref name = CR2006/&gt;

===Inverse opal===

A version of the concentric cylinder packed particles or close-packed polymer to create a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon anode. This system is fabricated by using colloidal crystal templating, electrochemical thin-film growth, and soft sol–gel chemistry. 3DOM materials have a unique structure of nanometer thick walls that surround interconnected and closed-packed sub-micrometer voids. The 3DOM structure is coated with a thin polymer layer and then filled with second conducting phase. This method leads to a battery with short transport lengths, high ionic conductivity and reasonable electrical conductivity. It removes the need for additives that do not contribute to electrochemical performance. Performance can be improved by coating with tin oxide nanoparticles to enhance the initial capacity.&lt;ref name = AM2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ergang | first1 = N.  S. | last2 = Lytle | first2 = J.  C. | last3 = Lee | first3 = K.  T. | last4 = Oh | first4 = S.  M. | last5 = Smyrl | first5 = W.  H. | last6 = Stein | first6 = A. | doi = 10.1002/adma.200600295 | title = Photonic Crystal Structures as a Basis for a Three-Dimensionally Interpenetrating Electrochemical-Cell System | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 18 | issue = 13 | pages = 1750–1753 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coating infiltrates the network formed by the 3DOM structure to produce uniform thickness.

===Nanowires and nanotubes===

[[Nanowire]] and [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]]s have been integrated with various battery components. The reason for this interest is because of shortened transport lengths, resistance to degradation and storage. For carbon nanotubes (CNT), lithium-ions can be stored on the exterior surface, in the interstitial sites between the nanotubes and on the tube's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Landi | first1 = B. J. | last2 = Ganter | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Schauerman | first3 = C. M. | last4 = Cress | first4 = C. D. | last5 = Raffaelle | first5 = R. P. | title = Lithium Ion Capacity of Single Wall Carbon Nanotube Paper Electrodes | doi = 10.1021/jp710921k | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry C | volume = 112 | issue = 19 | pages = 7509–7515 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanowires have been incorporated into the anode/cathode matrix to provide a builtin conductive charge collector and enhancing capacity. The nanowires were incorporated through a solution-based method that allows the active material to be printed on a substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kiebele | first1 = A. | last2 = Gruner | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1063/1.2795328 | title = Carbon nanotube based battery architecture | journal = Applied Physics Letters | volume = 91 | issue = 14 | pages = 144104 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2007ApPhL..91n4104K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach uses a CNT-cellulose composite. CNTs were grown on a silicon substrate by thermal-CVD and then embedded in [[cellulose]]. Finally a lithium electrode is added on top of the cellulose across from the CNTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pushparaj | first1 = Victor L. | last2 = Shaijumon | first2 = Manikoth M. | last3 = Kumar | first3 = Ashavani | last4 = Murugesan | first4 = Saravanababu | last5 = Ci | first5 = Lijie | last6 = Vajtai | first6 = Robert | last7 = Linhardt | first7 = Robert J. | last8 = Nalamasu | first8 = Omkaram | last9 = Ajayan | first9 = Pulickel M. | title = Flexible energy storage devices based on nanocomposite paper | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0706508104| journal = PNAS | year = 2007 | issue = | pages = 13574–13577 | volume=104| pmc = 1959422 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10413574P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Si [[Nanowire battery|nanowires]] were fabricated on a steel substrate by a vapor-liquid solid growth method. These nanowires exhibited close to the theoretical value for silicon and showed only minimal fading after a 20% drop between the first to second cycles. This performance is attributed to the facile strain relaxation that allows for accommodations of large strains, while maintaining good contact with the current collector and efficient 1D electron transport along the nanowire.&lt;ref name="NatNan2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = C. K. | last2 = Peng | first2 = H. | last3 = Liu | first3 = G. | last4 = McIlwrath | first4 = K. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = X. F. | last6 = Huggins | first6 = R.

===Aperoidic electrodes===
Periodic structures lead to non-uniform current densities that lower efficiency and decrease stability. The aperoidic structure is typically made of either [[aerogels]] or somewhat more dense ambigels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eng.thesaurus.rusnano.com/wiki/article507|title = Glossary - ambigel|date = |accessdate = April 2015|website = Glossary of nanotechnology terms|publisher = |last = Shlyakhtin|first = Oleg A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that forms a porous aperiodic sponge. Aerogels and ambigels are formed from wet gels; aerogels are formed when wet gels are dried such that no capillary forces are established, while ambigels are wet gels dried under conditions that minimize capillary forces.&lt;ref  name = CSR2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rolison | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Long | first2 = J. W. | last3 = Lytle | first3 = J. C. | last4 = Fischer | first4 = A. E. | last5 = Rhodes | first5 = C. P. | last6 = McEvoy | first6 = T. M. | last7 = Bourg | first7 = M. E. | last8 = Lubers | first8 = A. M. | doi = 10.1039/B801151F | title = Multifunctional 3D nanoarchitectures for energy storage and conversion | journal = [[Chemical Society Reviews]]| publisher = [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]| volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 226–252 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19088976| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerogels and ambigels are unique in that 75-99% of the material is ‘open’ but interpenetrated by a solid that is on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;nm, resulting in pores on the order of 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;nm. The solid is covalently networked and resistant to agglomeration and [[sintering]]. Beyond aperiodicity, these structures are used because the porous structure allows for rapid diffusion throughout the material, and the porous structure provides a large reaction surface. Fabrication is through coating the ambigel with a polymer electrolyte and then filling the void space with [[RuO2|RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] colloids that act as an anode.&lt;ref name = ACR2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Long | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Rolison | first2 = D. R. | doi = 10.1021/ar6000445 | title = Architectural Design, Interior Decoration, and Three-Dimensional Plumbing en Route to Multifunctional Nanoarchitectures | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 854–862 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17530736| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conformal coatings==

Most designs were half-cell experiments; testing only the anode or cathode. As geometries become more complex, non-line-of-sight methods to in-fill the design with electrolyte materials supply the oppositely charged electrode is essential. These batteries can be coated with various materials to improve their performance and stability. However, chemical and physical heterogeneity leaves molecular-level control a significant challenge, especially since the electrochemistry for energy storage is not defect-tolerant.&lt;ref name = ACR2007/&gt;

===Layer-by-layer (LbL)===

[[Layer by layer|LbL]] approaches are used to coat 3d nanoarchitecture. Electrostatically binding a charged polymer to an oppositely charged surface coats the surface with polymer. Repeated steps of oppositely charged polymer build up a well-controlled thick layer. [[Polyelectrolyte]] films and ultrathin (less than 5&amp;nbsp;nm) of electroactive polymers have been deposited on planar substrates using this method. However, problems exist with the deposition of polymers within complex geometries, e.g. pores, on the size scale of 50-300&amp;nbsp;nm, resulting in defective coatings. One potential solution is to use self-limiting approaches.&lt;ref name = ACR2007/&gt;

===Atomic layer deposition (ALD)===

Another approach to coating is [[Atomic layer deposition|ALD]] which coats the substrate layer-by-layer with atomic precision. The precision is because reactions are confined to the surface containing an active chemical [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] that reacts with a precursor; this limits thickness to one monolayer. This self-limiting growth is essential for complete coatings since deposition does not inhibit the access by other polymeric units to non-coated sites. Thicker samples can be produced by cycling gases in a similar manner to alternating with oppositely charged polymers in LbL. In practice ALD may require a few cycles in order to achieve the desired coverage and can result in varied morphologies such as islands, isolated crystallites, or nanoparticles. Morphology can alter electrochemical behavior and therefore must be carefully controlled.&lt;ref name = ACR2007/&gt;

ALD was also used to deposit iron oxide on 3DOM carbon to enhance reactivity between lithium and oxygen. The iron was then coatedwith palladium nanoparticles, which effectively reduced carbon's destructive reaction with oxygen and improved the discharge cycle. Wang said the findings show 3DOm carbon can meet new performance standards when it is stabilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Boosting carbon’s stability for better lithium-air batteries|last = Hayward|first = Ed|date = 2015-02-25|work = R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electropolymerization===

Electropolymerization supplies a thin polymer film, 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;nm. The electropolymerization of an insulating polymer results in self-limiting deposition as the active moiety is protected; the deposition can also be self-limiting if the polymer can block the solubilized monomer and prohibit continued growth. Through the control of electrochemical variables, [[polyaniline]] and [[polythiophene]] can be deposited in a controlled manner. [[Styrene]], [[methyl methacrylate]], [[phenols]] and other electrically insulating polymers have been deposited on the electrodes to act as a separator that allows ionic transport, but inhibits electrical transport to prevent shorts. Mesoporous manganese dioxide ambigels have been protected by 7-9&amp;nbsp;nm films of polymer such that dissolution of the manganese dioxide in aqueous acid was avoided. Uniform coatings require the architecture to be wetted by the monomer solution; this can be achieved through a solution that displays a similar surface energy to that of the porous solid. As the scale continuous to decrease and transport through the solid becomes more difficult, pre-equilibration is needed to ensure coating uniformity.&lt;ref name =CSR2009/&gt;

'''OpenSeaMap''' is a [[Free Software|software project]] collecting freely usable nautical information and [[geospatial]] data to create a worldwide  [[nautical chart]]. This chart is available on the OpenSeaMap website, and can also be downloaded for use as an electronic chart for offline applications.&lt;ref name="Hydro International"&gt;[http://openseamap.org/fileadmin/user_upload/inhalt/PDF/Artikel_Hydro_International-2013-02.pdf Hydro International: OpenSeaMap - the Free Nautical Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is part of [[OpenStreetMap]]. OpenSeaMap uses the same database, and complements the spatial data with nautical information. Such data may be used in accordance with the [[Open Database License]]. This ensures integration into printed materials, websites and applications is possible, without being limited by restrictive [[licenses]], or having to pay fees.

== History ==
The idea for the project was born at an OpenStreetMap developer conference in autumn 2008 at the Linux Hotel in [[Essen]], [[Germany]]. A group of boaters and programmers decided to extend the coverage of OpenStreetMap to the seas and fresh water bodies. From the start the project has been worldwide and multilingual. By the end of 2009, the design and architecture of the project had been created, and a sample harbor "[[Warnemünde]]" was created to serve as an example chart. Since autumn 2009, a dedicated server has been available and the project is engaged in several collaborations with other free projects and organizations.
In January 2010 OpenSeaMap was given a stand at [[boot Düsseldorf]], Europe's largest boat show, allowing volunteers to present the project to a large audience of specialists for the first time.

== Contents of the chart ==

Charts will show [[lighthouses]], [[lateral buoy]], [[cardinal mark]]s and other [[navigational aids]]. In the ports, facilities will be mapped (port wall, pier, walkways, docks, fueling stations, loading cranes, access roads, railway lines, ferry lines). Similarly, public authorities, shipbuilders and repairers, as well as sanitation and utility facilities will be displayed. The navigational attributes correspond to the international standard [[IHO]] S-57.

Water depths are not yet covered, because the database is not designed for three-dimensional coordinates.  However, the plan is to eventually integrate a [[Bathymetry|bathymetric]] model to describe the [[ocean floor|seabed]].

The data are presented in multiple levels with [[OpenLayers]] on the base map of OpenStreetMap. The base map contains all the possible objects from OpenStreetMap.&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenStreetmap: EN: Map Features|map elements "Map Features "]]&lt;/ref&gt; OpenSeaMap includes additional layers such as aids to navigation, ports and temporary racing events.

== Applications ==
The chart is for planning [[sailing]] and boat trips. It will also be useful as a guide for tourists. It is not intended to replace official [[charts]].

; Online Map
: The map is available to any computer with an internet connection from the website OpenSeaMap.org. This map is updated daily.

; Offline Map
: The map can also be loaded on local [[computer data storage|data storage]] and can be used on any PC without internet access. This map will also permit use on other devices, such as GPS devices from Garmin and Lowrance, phones, and PDAs. The off-map is regularly updated, usually every week.

; App for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch
: The free [[Mobile app|App]] for OpenSeaMap works on [[iPad]], iPhone und iPod touch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/openseamap/id495210783?mt=8 App for OpenSeaMap for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual position is shown on the chart. Each downloaded chart is cached on the device and can be used without internet connection. With internet connection the app checks if there is a newer version of the chart. The Apple location search finds the fitting map section. The app works worldwide.

; Navigation
: With certain navigation programs, it is possible to display the current position directly on the chart via a connected [[GPS]] device, tracking a vessel's movement. An [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA interface]] can run an [[autopilot]] and thus  control the ship. Also, the display of [[Automatic Identification System|AIS signals]] on the chart is possible. Appropriate navigation tools from the open source area are [http://www.sping.com/seaclear/ SeaClear], [[OpenCPN]] and [https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpsangler/ GPSANGLER].

== Internationalization ==
The site is translated into six languages: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. The tools and the legends are available with a German, English and French interface. On the map the place names are always written in local language and script. The geographical coverage is worldwide. Depending on the region and the active [[cartographer]]s, the coverage varies but is growing daily.

== Timeliness ==
Data is stored in the database as soon as it has been entered, and is immediately available worldwide. Base map data is visible on the map after a few minutes. Navigational data is currently (2010) visible on the chart about two days after it has been entered.

== Editing tools ==
[[Image:JOSM-ss.png| thumb | [[JOSM]] Editor]]

; Offline Editor JOSM with navigational enhancements
: [[JOSM]] is the default editor for OpenStreetMap. It has been extended for use on navigational charts with a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]. It is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and runs on multiple desktop platforms &lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/de:JOSM JOSM Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

To edit you must register with a verified email address. Registration is free and will encourage high data quality. Read access  does not require registration.

Other programs can access the [[XML-RPC]] interface to the data on the server in order to read and write OpenSeaMap data.

== Harbor pilots ==
On the map are the world [[port]], [[marina]] and [[anchorage]].  Via a pop-up window these are linked with a port guide containing detailed port information. This guide is organized as a [[Wiki]] and is shaped by the users. Included is the free wikiproject "SkipperGuide".&lt;ref&gt;[http://SkipperGuide.de port manual "SkipperGuide"]&lt;/ref&gt;  5000 ports are accessible worldwide, including detailed descriptions of 600 marinas.&lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Weather information ==
[[Image:Wetter Luftdruck.jpg|thumb|Air pressure]]
In worldwide [[weather chart]]s there are shown weather data like wind speed, air pressure (isobars), etc., each actualised two to three times per day, and with weather forecast up to three days.

For each harbor there is a [[Meteogram]] with detailed wind forecasts and weather information for eight days. Available weather data for wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, cloudiness, precipitation. From this worldwide available data the captains can predict the marine weather. &lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Bathymetric data ==
[[File:GEBCO-Waterdepth-OpenSeaMap-Atlanitct-1024x513.jpg|thumb|Bathymetric data]]
Worldwide, depths between 100 and 10,000 m are shown in a blue colour scale of 23 steps, together with depth shading. At higher zoom levels [[Isobath|depth contours]] are also displayed. The data is given through cooperation with [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans|GEBCO]] and its bathymetric GEBCO_08-database.

== Water depths by crowdsourcing ==
[[File:Tiefen-Tracks Palma.jpg|thumb|Depth tracks near Palma (ES)]]
[[File:15-11-01-Schweriner See-RalfR-WMA 3263.jpg|thumb|OpenSeaMap Data Logger]]
OpenSeaMap measures water depths by [[Crowdsourcing]]. Sailors, motor boaters, commercial shipping, divers, fishermen collect water depths between 0 and 100m with sounder and GPS. Divers work with a [[dive computer]]. Coastal water, lakes and rivers are surveyed. Result wil be an elevation model and derived depth lines.&lt;ref name="Hydro International" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhyg.de/images/hn_ausgaben/HN095.pdf OpenSeaMap – Wassertiefen per Crowdsourcing].

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2009}}
In the [[drilling industry]], the '''rate of penetration''' ('''ROP'''), also known as '''penetration rate''' or '''drill rate''', is the speed at which a [[Drill bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] breaks the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] under it to deepen the [[borehole]].  It is normally measured in feet per minute or meters per hour, but sometimes it is expressed in minutes per foot.

Generally, ROP increases in fast drilling formation such as [[sandstone]] (positive drill break) and decreases in slow drilling formations such as [[shale]] (reverse break). ROP decreases in shale due to [[diagenesis]] and overburden stresses. Over pressured zones can give twice of ROP as expected which is an indicative of a ''well kick''. Drillers need to stop and do the bottoms up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">SML,''' Sistema de Pagamentos em Moeda Local''' (en: ''Local Currency Payment System'')

The SML was established on October 3, 2008. It allows that payment orders are paid and received in local currency. Initially, the SML was used only in transactions between [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], but recently Brazilian Central Bank is studying the expansion of the system to other countries like [[Uruguay]] &lt;ref&gt;http://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI100451-16359,00-BRASIL+E+URUGUAI+VAO+INTEGRAR+SISTEMA+DE+PAGAMENTOS+EM+MOEDA+LOCAL.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paraguay]]. More countries, like [[Russia]], [[India]] and [[China]] have shown interest in adopting the system in bilateral trade with Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Economia_Negocios/0,,MUL1253389-9356,00-PARA+MEIRELLES+BRASIL+JA+SAIU+DA+RECESSAO.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Senders and recipients have the option of paying or receiving payment in their own local currency. This supposedly makes life easier for small producers, which until then were used to sell and buy goods only in their own currencies. They don’t have to fix their prices in US-Dollars or calculate exchange-rates their own currency and the currency of the other country, intermediating with the [[US-dollar]].
&lt;br&gt;
The system includes by the central banks authorized financial institutions. Transactions are made between the financial institutions and the Central Banks. The importers and exporters fix their prices using the SML-rate published by the Central Banks.
&lt;br&gt; 
In the first year Brazilians and Argentines only used the SML in transactions involving goods,&lt;ref&gt;http://jus.com.br/artigos/13180&lt;/ref&gt; but central banks are considering enable operations of trade in services and payments of social benefits.

[[File:Raketa Samara.jpg|thumb|200px|Soyuz carrier rocket monument and the Space museum building]]
The '''Soyuz carrier rocket monument''' ({{lang-rus|Монумент ракета-носитель «Союз»}}) is a monument in [[Samara]] (former Kuybyshev), [[Russia]] dedicated to Samara rocket builders. It is located at the center of Samara on Lenina Avenue between Novo-Sadovaya and Chelyuskintsev Streets next to [[Rossiyskaya (Samara Metro)|Rossiyskaya metro station]]. The opening ceremony took place on 1 Oktober 2001 and was held in conjunction by the 50-year anniversary of the First Manned Spaceflight performed by [[Yuri Gagarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://samara.onfoot.ru/sights/museums/5.html|title =Музей "Самара космическая" имени Дмитрия Козлова (Памятный комплекс ракеты-носителя "Союз"|publisher = onFoot|accessdate = 2018-03-20|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Governor of [[Samara Oblast]] [[Konstantin Titov]], aerospace engineer, founder of the [[Progress Rocket Space Centre|Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center]] [[Dmitri Ilyich Kozlov]], members of [[Roscosmos]] and staff of [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] and [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome|Plesetsk]] Cosmodromes attended at the ceremony. The monument consists of the intact [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 11A511]] ([[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]])  which is fixed on the Space museum building. The rocket is 50 m height; mass is 20 tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://samaracosmos.ru/|title = Самара космическая|publisher = Музейно-выставочный центр|accessdate = 2018-03-20|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facility which provides required support for the rocket weighs 53 tones. The rocket R-7 11A511 was built at the Kuybyshev Progress Rocket Space Centre in 1984. It was used for crew training at [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]]. The rocket was ending one's lifespan in 1999 and then it was transferred to the production plant. The transfer was held in conjunction by the 40-year anniversary of the plant. The space center dismantled equipment and  exhibited the carrier rocket. The missile body was painted with white and orange colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://gubernya63.ru/dostoprimechatelnosti/museums/kosmos.html|title = Самара космическая|publisher = Самарская губерния|accessdate = 2018-03-20|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Space museum was opened on 12 April 2007. The museum building was designed by architects Zhukov and Checherin.  The museum is occupied by the collections of rocket-and-space equipment  samples. Also this exhibition include: Yantar 4K1 and Resurs F1 landing sections, rocket engine mockups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.museum.ru/M3175|title = Музейно-выставочный центр "Самара космическая"|publisher = Музеи России|accessdate = 2018-03-20|language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sébastienne Guyot''' (26 April 1896 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1941) was a French [[engineer]] who specialized in [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] flying. She was born in [[Pont-l'Abbé|Pont l'Abbé]] in the [[Finistère]].

A teacher, Guyot resigned in 1917 to prepare for the competition of the Ecole Centrale of the Paris [[Lycée Jules-Ferry (Paris)|Lycée Jules-Ferry]] when she learned that the school would accepts girls into its ranks. She graduated in 1921 from the first class of [[École Centrale Paris|Central School of Paris]] to accept women. She ranked  45th  of 243 graduates (425 students were received in the contest).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=biographie/Sébastienne Guyot|url=http://centrale-histoire.centraliens.net/pdfs/biographies/SebastienneGUYOT.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also a [[Athlete|top athlete]], she participated in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam]] in the [[800 metres|800 meters]].  She was also [[:fr:Championnats de France de cross-country|French Cross Country Champion]] in 1928. Arrested by the Germans in 1940, she died in 1941 in [[Paris]]

== Legacy  ==
Guyot was awarded the medal of the resistance posthumously. She is the only woman whose name is on the war memorial  of the Ecole Centrale. Since 2010, a scholarship in her name is given annually to five young Ecole Centrale students to fully fund their studies at the School. In 2015, her name was given to one of the eight streets in the new university area of Moulon in Gif-sur-Yvette, an area that will accommodate [[CentraleSupélec]] in 2017, following the merger and Centrale Paris and [[Supélec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|language=fr|title=Conseil municipal du 10 février 2015.|periodical=Bulletin municipal de Gif-sur-Yvette|date =March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new method can play a significant role in a number of industries for materials characterization applications where precision thickness mapping (to assure product dimensional tolerances within product and from product-to-product) and density mapping (to assure product quality within product and from product-to-product) are required.&lt;ref name=RandT-FT/&gt;

==Nondestructive evaluation==
Sensors and instruments are employed in the 0.1 to the 10 THz range for [[nondestructive evaluation]], which includes detection.&lt;ref name=RandT-FT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Argone-research/&gt;

===Terahertz Density Thickness Imager===
The Terahertz Density Thickness Imager is a nondestructive inspection method that employs [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] energy for density and thickness mapping in [[dielectric]], [[ceramic]], and [[composite material]]s. This non-contact, single-sided terahertz [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic]] measurement and [[Geophysical imaging|imaging]] method characterizes [[microstructure|micro-structure]] and [[Optical thickness|thickness]] variation in dielectric ([[insulator (electrical)|insulating]]) materials. This method was demonstrated for the [[Space Shuttle external tank]] sprayed-on foam insulation and has been designed for use as an inspection method for current and future NASA [[thermal]] protection systems and other dielectric material inspection applications where no contact can be made with the sample due to fragility and it is impractical to use [[ultrasonic testing|ultrasonic]] methods.&lt;ref name=RandT-FT&gt;
Nondestructive inspection method uses terahertz energy.

===Rotational spectroscopy===
Rotational spectroscopy uses electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range from 0.1 to 4 terahertz (THz). This range includes millimeter-range wavelengths and is particularly sensitive to chemical molecules. The resulting THz absorption produces a unique and reproducible spectral pattern that identifies the material. THz spectroscopy can detect trace amounts of explosives in less than one second. Because explosives continually emit trace amounts of vapor, it should be possible to use these methods to detect concealed explosives from a distance.&lt;ref name=Argone-research/&gt;

===THz-wave radar===
THz-wave radar can sense gas leaks, chemicals and nuclear materials. In field tests, THz-wave radar detected chemicals at the 10-ppm level from 60 meters away. This method can be used in a fence line or aircraft mounted system that works day or night in any weather. It can locate and track chemical and radioactive plumes. THz-wave radar that can sense radioactive plumes from nuclear plants have detected plumes several kilometers away based on radiation-induced ionization effects in air.&lt;ref name=Argone-research/&gt;

===THz tomography===

THz tomography techniques are nondestructive methods that can use THz pulsed beam or millimeter-range sources to locate objects in 3D.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques include tomography, tomosynthesis, synthetic aperture radar and time of flight. Such techniques can resolve details on scales of less than one millimeter in objects that are several tens of centimeters in size.

===Passive/active imaging techniques===
Security imaging is currently being done by both active and passive methods. Active systems illuminate the subject with THz radiation whereas passive systems merely view the naturally occurring radiation from the subject.

Evidently passive systems are inherently safe, whereas an argument can be made that any form of "irradiation" of a person is undesirable. In technical and scientific terms, however, the active illumination schemes are safe according to all current legislation and standards.

The purpose of using active illumination sources is primarily to make the signal-to-noise ratio better. This is analogous to using a flash on a standard optical light camera when the ambient lighting level is too low.

For security imaging purposes the operating frequencies are typically in the range 0.1 THz to 0.8 THz (100&amp;nbsp;GHz to 800&amp;nbsp;GHz). In this range skin is not transparent so the imaging systems can look through clothing and hair, but not inside the body. There are privacy issues associated with such activities, especially surrounding the active systems since the active systems, with their higher quality images, can show very detailed anatomical features.

It should be noted that active systems such as the L3 Provision™ and the Smiths eqo™ are actually mm-wave imaging systems rather than Terahertz imaging systems like Millitech™ systems. These widely deployed systems do not display images, avoiding any privacy issues. Instead they display generic "mannequin" outlines with any anomalous regions highlighted.

Since security screening is looking for anomalous images, items like false legs, false arms, colostomy bags, body-worn urinals, body-worn insulin pumps, and external breast augmentations will show up. Note that breast implants, being under the skin, will not be revealed.

Active imaging techniques can be used to perform medical imaging. Because THz radiation is biologically safe (non ionisant), it can be used in high resolution imaging to detect skin cancer.&lt;ref name=Argone-research&gt;

==Space Shuttle inspections==
[[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]] inspections are an example of this technology's application.

After the [[Shuttle Columbia]] accident in 2003, [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] recommendation R3.2.1 stated “Initiate an aggressive program to eliminate all External Tank Thermal Protection System debris-shedding at the source….” To support this recommendation, inspection methods for flaws in foam are being evaluated, developed, and refined at NASA.&lt;ref name=RF-Anastasi&gt;

[[STS-114]] employed [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']], and was the first "Return to Flight" [[Space Shuttle]] mission following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]]. It launched at 10:39 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]], 26 July 2005. During the [[STS-114]] flight significant [[foam shedding]] was observed. Therefore, the ability to nondestructively detect and characterize crushed foam after that flight became a significant priority when it was believed that the staff processing the tank had crushed foam by walking on it or from [[hail|hail damage]] when the shuttle was on the [[launch pad]] or during other preparations for launch.

Additionally, [[density]] variations in the foam were also potential points of flaw initiation causing foam shedding. The innovation described below answered the call to develop a nondestructive, totally non-contact, non-[[liquid-coupled]] method that could simultaneously and precisely characterize thickness variation (from crushed foam due to worker handling and hail damage) and density variation in foam materials. It was critical to have a method that did not require fluid (water) coupling; i.e.; [[ultrasonic testing]] methods require water coupling.

There are millions of dollars of ultrasonic equipment in the field and on the market that are used as [[thickness gauge]]s and [[density meter]]s. When ''terahertz nondestructive evaluation'' is fully commercialized into a more portable form, and becomes less expensive it will be able to replace the ultrasonic instruments for structural [[plastic]], [[ceramic]], and [[polystyrene foam|foam]] materials. The new instruments will not require liquid coupling thereby enhancing their usefulness in field applications and possibly for high-temperature in-situ applications where liquid coupling is not possible. A potential new market segment can be developed with this technology.&lt;ref name=RandT-FT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Argone-research/&gt;

'''Theodore Yue Tak Ts'o''' (曹子德) (born 1968) is a [[software engineer]] mainly known for his contributions to the [[Linux kernel]], in particular his contributions to [[file system]]s.  He is the primary developer and maintainer of [[e2fsprogs]], the userspace utilities for the [[ext2]], [[ext3]] and [[ext4]] filesystems, and is a maintainer for the ext4 file system.

== Biography ==
Ts'o graduated from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] with a degree in [[computer science]] in 1990, after which he worked in MIT's Information Systems (IS) department until 1999. During this time he was project leader of the [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] V5 team.

In 1994, Ts'o created the &lt;code&gt;[[/dev/random]]&lt;/code&gt; [[Device file|Linux device node]] and the corresponding kernel driver, which was Linux's (and [[Unix]]'s) first kernel interface that provided high quality cryptographic random numbers to user programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=blob;f=drivers/char/random.c;hb=HEAD | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120714200124/http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=blob;f=drivers/char/random.c;hb=HEAD | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-14 | title = Linux | type = source code | contribution = random.c }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;code&gt;/dev/random&lt;/code&gt; works without access to a [[hardware random number generator]], allowing user programs to depend upon its existence.  Separate [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]s such as &lt;code&gt;rngd&lt;/code&gt; take random numbers from such hardware and make them accessible via &lt;code&gt;/dev/random&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.linuxcertified.com/hw_random.html | contribution = Randomness shouldn't be left to chance | type = howto | title = Linux certified}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its creation, &lt;code&gt;/dev/random&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/code&gt; have become standard interfaces on Unix, Linux, [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[macOS]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=How good is LavaRnd?: Detailed Description of Test Results and Conclusions |url=http://www.lavarnd.org/what/nist-test.html |date=22 Sep 2004 |work=LavaRnd |accessdate=21 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403160136/http://www.lavarnd.org/what/nist-test.html |archivedate=2007-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After MIT IS, Ts'o went to work for [[SourceForge, Inc.|VA Linux Systems]] for two years. In late 2001 he joined [[IBM]], where he worked on improvements in the Linux kernel's performance and scalability. After working on a [[Real-time computing|real-time kernel]] at IBM, Ts'o joined the [[Linux Foundation]] in late 2007 for a two-year fellowship. Initially he served as Chief Platform Strategist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">The term '''thermal interface material''' (shortened to '''TIM''') describes any material that is inserted between two parts in order to enhance the thermal coupling between these two components. A large portion of those application are related to the heat dissipation and the TIM is inserted between the heat producing device (e.g. the heat source) and the heat dissipation device (e.g. the heat sink).

There are several kind of TIM with different target applications:

*[[Thermal grease]]: Mostly used in the electronics industry, it allows a very thin bond line and therefore a very small [[thermal resistance]]. It has no mechanical strength (other than the surface tension of the grease and the resulting adhesive effect) and will need an external mechanical fixation mechanism. Because it does not cure, it is used only where the material can be contained or in thin application where the [[viscosity]] of the grease will allow it to stay in position during use.
*[[Thermal adhesive]]: As for the thermal grease, it allows a very thin bond line but will additionally provide some mechanical strength to the bond after curing. Thermal glue allows thicker bond line than the thermal grease as it cures.
*[[Thermal gap filler]]: It could be described as "Curing Thermal Grease" or "Non-adhesive Thermal Glue". It allows thicker bond lines than the thermal grease as it cures while still allowing an easy disassembly thanks to limited adhesiveness.
*[[Thermally conductive pad]]: As opposed to previous TIM, Thermal pad does not come in liquid or paste form but in solid state (albeit often soft). Mostly made of [[silicone]] or silicone-like material, it has the advantage to be easy to apply, it can allow thicker bond lines but will usually need higher force to press the heat sink on the heat source so that the thermal pad conform to the bonded surfaces
*[[Thermal tape]]: It adheres to surface, requires no curing time and are easy to apply. It is essentially a thermal pad with adhesive properties.
*[[Phase-change materials]] (PCM): Naturally sticky materials, used as replacement of [[thermal grease]]s. Application is similar to solid pads. After achieving melting point - 55-60 degrees change to half liquid status and fill all gaps between heat source and [[heat sink]].

'''Thermalright Inc.''' is a Taiwan-based company&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madshrimps.be/?action=getarticle&amp;articID=540 madshrimps.be] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207084424/http://www.madshrimps.be/?action=getarticle&amp;articID=540 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in Taipei, established in 2001.

Its products include aftermarket [[heat sink]]s for desktop computers, [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[iPhone]] cases. It also produces components for other manufacturers, including [[AMD]] and [[Intel]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Thermalright products are primarily marketed towards gamers and enthusiasts who commonly [[Overclocking|overclock]] different parts of their computer which can generate large amounts of heat.

== Company history ==

Since the release of AMD's Thunderbird CPU in 2002, Thermalright has been making high-performance heat sinks, not only for AMD processors, but Intel as well. Their current product line includes heatsinks for [[CPU]]s, [[GPU]]s, [[RAM]], and Motherboard components. Thermalright's primary focus is fanless heatsinks which can be used passively, making [[Quiet PC|quiet computers]]; however many enthusiasts choose to use the heat sinks with a fan for better heat dissipation.

In the year of 2012, Thermalright established the Leetgion brand, starting to extend its business to peripheral and game related products. At the same time, Thermalright set its oversea branch, 索魔乐 in Shanghai, China.

* '''2001: SK6'''
The SK-6 was Thermalright's first heatsink, sold as a standalone product with clips for users' fans (up to 80mm) instead of as an HSF (heatsink-fan) combo. Apart from being the first heatsink to offer a custom fan mounting system, it was also the first to be manufactured in 100% fin-tube copper instead of the die-cast aluminum that was common in the day. With copper having significantly superior thermal conductivity properties to aluminum, the product caught on with enthusiasts and spurred a new era of copper-based cooling. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:SK6.jpg|SK6
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* '''Feb. 2002: AX7'''
AX-7 is the second heat sink by Thermalright. With the size of 70mm and soldered by copper and aluminum, AX-7 is different from the mainstream of 60mm fan and heat sink at that time.

* '''Dec. 2002: SLK800'''
SLK800 is covered and piled by [[fin-tube copper]] as well as SK-6. With the size of 80mm and weight of 400g, SLK800 was kept an eye on its thickness of 38mm fix fan.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:SLK800.jpg|SLK800
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2003: SP94'''
SP94 is the first heat sink manufacturing with the heat pipe as a medium of [[thermal conductivity]]. With the size of 90mm and capability to fix 80mm fan, SP94 is undoubtedly a cutting edge heat sink at that time. SP series have two kinds of product collocating different [[CPU]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:SP94.jpg|SP94
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2004: XP120'''
The XP120 was the first heatsink to support a 120mm fan, and violated many motherboards' Keep-Out Zones (perimeter of a certain size set around the CPU die, in which no components above a certain height can be placed). Slowly the Keep-Out Zone standard began to be updated, and bigger coolers like the XP120 proliferated. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:XP120.jpg|XP120
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2005: Ultra120'''
AS the trend of overclocking becomes a global [[phenomenon]] and [[niche market]], the design of heat sinks transformed from horizontal cooler to tower cooler. Ultra120, with the size of 160mm, is the first tower cooler by Thermalright. Even today, the computer case manufacturers set the height of widely used 160mm of tower cooler as the design standard.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ultra120.jpg|Ultra120
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2005: HR-01'''
The HR-01 was developed to satisfy the market segment that demanded complete silence, and it did so by being capable of operating without a fan while still offering fan ducts for attachment. In this way Thermalright was able to satisfy 2 segments of the market in one go by allowing the silence enthusiasts to run the cooler as boxed and allowing the performance enthusiasts to attach a fan for maximum cooling potential. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:HR-01.jpg|HR-01
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2006 Ultra120 extreme'''
Ultra120 extreme (also called U120E) has six [[thermal conductors]]. From the appearance, we can tell Ultra120E is an updated version of old heatsink. However, not only is it a brand new one, but also, from the efficiency test report issued by Anandtech, the efficiency of U120E was proved to be a better version. Thermalright then declared that the copper-base heatsink is manufactured with protruding face, not flat one, which is different from the concept of thermal conduct as convention would have it. Afterwards, Thermalright manufactured the Ultra120E heatsink with protruding face, fascinating other heatsink manufacturers following with this concept.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ultra120E.jpg|Ultra120 extrem
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* '''2010: HR-02'''
HR-02 is another product designed for the need of mute cooler in demand by Thermalright. The combination of fin-tube and thermal conductor is not centered and symmetrical. If HR-02 is installed in the case, the system fan is close to heat sink itself enough to fulfill the need of passive heat sink passively.

[[File:Women in Waldorf-Astoria.jpg|thumb|right|Watching the ticker tape, 1918]]

'''Ticker tape''' was the earliest [[digital electronics|digital electronic]] communications medium, transmitting [[stock]] price information over [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines, in use between around 1870 through 1970. It consisted of a paper strip that ran through a machine called a '''stock ticker''', which printed abbreviated company names as alphabetic symbols followed by numeric stock transaction price and volume information. The term "ticker" came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.

Paper ticker tape became obsolete in the 1960s, as [[television]] and [[computers]] were increasingly used to transmit financial information. The concept of the stock ticker lives on, however, in the scrolling electronic tickers seen on brokerage walls and on news and financial television channels.

Ticker tape stock price telegraphs were invented in 1867 by [[Edward A. Calahan]], an employee of the [[American Telegraph Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians|publisher=FT Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5SgX5q5sQEC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=Edward+A+Calahan+and+ticker+tape#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-13-705944-7|date=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although [[Printing telegraph|telegraphic printing systems]] were first invented by [[Royal Earl House]] in 1846, early models were fragile, required hand-cranked power, frequently went out of synchronization between sender and receiver, and did not become popular in widespread commercial use. [[David E. Hughes]] improved the printing telegraph design with clockwork weight power in 1856,&lt;ref&gt;David E Hughes, {{US patent|14917}} ''Telegraph'' (with alphabetic keyboard and printer) issued May 20, 1856&lt;/ref&gt; and his design was further improved and became viable for commercial use when [[George M. Phelps]] devised a resynchronization system in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casale|first=John|title=George M. Phelps: Master Telegraph Instrument Maker and Inventor|url=http://www.telegraph-history.org/george-m-phelps|date=1997–2008|publisher=Telegraph-History.org|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stock price ticker system using a telegraphic printer was invented by [[Edward A. Calahan]] in 1863; he unveiled his device in New York City on November 15, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stocktickercompany.com/stc/history The History of the Stock Ticker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225041242/http://www.stocktickercompany.com/stc/history|date=2014-12-25}} Stock Ticker Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile for Edward A.

In its infancy, the ticker used the same symbols as [[Morse code]] as a medium for conveying messages. One of the earliest practical stock ticker machines, the Universal Stock Ticker developed by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1869, used [[alphanumeric]] characters with a printing speed of approximately one character per second.

Previously, stock prices had been hand-delivered via written or verbal messages. Since the useful time-span of individual quotes is very brief, they generally had not been sent long distances; aggregated summaries, typically for one day, were sent instead. The increase in speed provided by the ticker allowed for faster and more exact sales. Since the ticker ran continuously, updates to a stock's price whenever the price changed became effective much faster and trading became a more time-sensitive matter. For the first time, trades were being done in what is now thought of as [[near real-time]].

[[File:Edison Stock Telegraph Ticker.jpg|thumb|left|Edison gold &amp; stock ticker]]

By the 1880s, there were about a thousand stock tickers installed in the offices of New York bankers and brokers. In 1890, members of the exchange agreed to create the New York Quotation Co., buying up all other ticker companies to ensure accuracy of reporting of price and volume activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tickertapedigest.com/articles/visitor/visitor.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980629095540/http://www.tickertapedigest.com/articles/visitor/visitor.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1998-06-29|title=Ticker Tape Digest|work=tickertapedigest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:Hughes telegraph.jpg|right|thumb|Hughes telegraph (1866-1914), first telegraph printing text on a paper tape. Manufactured by [[Siemens &amp; Halske]], Germany; range: 300-400 km]]

Stock ticker machines are an ancestor of the modern [[computer printer]], being one of the first applications of [[teleprinter|transmitting text over a wire to a printing device]], based on the [[printing telegraph]]. This used the technology of the then-recently invented [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph machines]], with the advantage that the output was readable text, instead of the dots and dashes of [[Morse code]]. A special [[typewriter]] designed for operation over telegraph wires was used at the opposite end of the telegraph wire connection to the ticker machine. Text typed on the typewriter was displayed on the ticker machine at the opposite end of the connection.

The machines printed a series of ''[[ticker symbol]]s'' (usually shortened forms of a company's name), followed by brief information about the price of that company's stock; the thin strip of paper on which they were printed was called ''ticker tape''. The word ''ticker'' comes from the distinct tapping (or ''ticking'') noise the machines made while printing. Pulses on the telegraph line made a letter wheel turn step by step until the correct symbol was reached and then printed. A typical 32-symbol letter wheel had to turn on average 15 steps until the next letter could be printed resulting in a very slow printing speed of one character per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prc68.com/I/WU5A.shtml|title=Western Union 5A Stock Quotation Machine|work=prc68.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, ticker transmitter keyboards resembled the keyboard of a piano with black keys indicating letters and the white keys indicating numbers and fractions, corresponding to two rotating type wheels in the connected ticker tape printers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officemuseum.com/communications_equipment.htm "Sending Messages over Ticker System,"] '' Scribner's Magazine,'' July 1889&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer and more efficient tickers became available in the 1930s, but these newer and better tickers still had an approximate 15-to-20-minute delay.  Ticker machines became obsolete in the 1960s, replaced by [[computer network]]s; none have been manufactured for use for decades. However, working reproductions of at least one model are now being manufactured for museums and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stocktickercompany.com/stc/universal|title=Stock Ticker Company: The Universal Stock Ticker|work=stocktickercompany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulated ticker displays, named after the original machines, still exist as part of the display of television news channels and on some websites&amp;nbsp;— see [[news ticker]]. One of the most famous outdoor displays is the simulated ticker scrolling marquee located at [[One Times Square]] in New York City.

Ticker tapes then and now contain generally the same information. The ticker symbol is a unique set of characters used to identify the company. The shares traded is the volume for the trade being quoted.  Price traded refers to the price per share of a particular trade. Change direction is a visual cue showing whether the stock is trading higher or lower than the previous trade, hence the terms ''downtick'' and ''[[uptick]]''. Change amount refers to the difference in price from the previous day’s closing. Many today include color to indicate whether a stock is trading higher than the previous day’s (green), lower than previous (red), or has remained unchanged (blue or white).

==Other usage==
In the early days of [[baseball]], before electronic scoreboards, manual score turners used a ticker to get the latest scores from around the league. Today, computers and electronic scoreboards have replaced the manual scoreboard and the ticker.

Used ticker tape was cut into a form of [[confetti]], to be thrown from the windows above [[parade]]s, primarily in lower [[Manhattan]]; this became known as a [[ticker tape parade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/216006.stm Glenn's second ticker tape parade] BBC News, November 17, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Ticker tape parades generally celebrated some significant event, such as the end of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], or the safe return of one of the early [[astronaut]]s. Ticker tape was also incorporated into some of the innovative weaver [[Dorothy Liebes]]' unusual art textiles.&lt;ref name=dlp&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/dorothy-liebes-papers-9143/more|title=Dorothy Liebes Papers|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ticker tape parades are still held in [[New York City]], specifically in the "[[Broadway (Manhattan)#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]" in [[Manhattan]], most often when local sports teams win a championship. However, actual ticker tape is not used during these parades any longer; often, pieces of paper from [[paper shredder]]s are used as a convenient source of confetti.

A '''tide mill''' is a [[watermill|water mill]] driven by [[Tide|tidal]] rise and fall. A dam with a [[sluice]] is created across a suitable tidal inlet, or a section of river [[estuary]] is made into a [[Reservoir (water)|reservoir]].  As the tide comes in, it enters the mill pond through a one-way gate, and this gate closes automatically when the tide begins to fall.  When the tide is low enough, the stored water can be released to turn a water wheel.

Tide mills are usually situated in river estuaries, away from the effects of waves but close enough to the sea to have a reasonable [[tidal range]].  Cultures have built such mills have existed since the [[Middle Ages]], and some may date to the Roman period.

A modern version of a tide mill is the electricity-generating [[tidal barrage]].

== Early history ==
{{See also|List of early medieval watermills}}Possibly the earliest tide mill in the Roman world was located in London on the [[River Fleet]], datingto [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/authors/005.pdf Spain, Rob: "A possible Roman Tide Mill", Paper submitted to the ''Kent Archaeological Society'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Three Mills, Stratford.jpg|thumb|277x277px|Three Mills, Stratford, one of the world's earliest recorded tide mills.]] Since the late 20th century, a number of new archaeological finds have consecutively pushed back the date of the earliest tide mills, all of which were discovered on the Irish coast: A 6th-century [[Water wheel#Types|vertical-wheeled]] tide mill was located at Killoteran near [[Waterford]].&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twin-flume, [[Water wheel#Types|horizontal-wheeled]] tide mill, dating to c. 630, was excavated on [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] in Cork.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rynne 2000, 10, fig. 1.2; 17; 49"&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=10, fig. 1.2; 17; 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside it, another tide mill was found that was powered by a vertical undershot wheel.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rynne 2000, 10, fig. 1.2; 17; 49" /&gt; The [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 was situated on an island in [[Strangford Lough]] in Northern Ireland. Its millstones are 830mm in diameter and the horizontal wheel is estimated to have developed 7/8HP at its peak. Remains of an earlier mill dated at 619 were also found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Recently discovered Tide Mill from 787 AD at Nendrum Monastic Site]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:House Mill 2009a.JPG|thumb|277x277px|Three Mills, House Mill and Miller's House at low tide ]]
The earliest ''recorded'' tide mills in England are listed in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086). Eight mills  are recorded on the [[River Lea]] (the site at [[Three Mills]] remains, with Grade I listed buildings and a small museum), as well as a mill in [[Dover]] harbour. By the 18th century, there were about 76 tide mills in London, including two on [[London Bridge]].

[[Woodbridge Tide Mill]], an excellent example, survives at [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]], England. This mill, dating from 1170 and reconstructed in 1792, has been preserved and is open to the public. It was further restored in 2010 and re-opened in 2011 in full working order. It is the second working tide mill in the United Kingdom that is regularly producing flour. [[Carew Castle]] in Wales also has an intact tide mill, but it is not operating. The first tide mill to be restored to working order is [[Eling Tide Mill]] in [[Totton and Eling|Eling]], [[Hampshire]]. Another example, now extant only in historic documents, is the mill in the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Tide Mills, East Sussex]]. Traces of a tide mill may be seen at [[Fife Ness]], revealed through an archaeological survey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/category/arch-prosp/page/7/ ''Day of Archaeology'']&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Moulin maree brehat.jpg|thumb|Tidal mill at l'île de [[Île-de-Bréhat|Bréhat]]|275x275px]]

A mediæval tide mill still operates at [[Rupelmonde]] near Antwerp, and there are several that have survived in the Netherlands.

At one time there were 750 tide mills operating along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean: approximately 300 in North America,&lt;ref&gt;Peveril Meigs, "Historical geography of tide mills on the Atlantic coast," ''American Philosophical Society Yearbook 1970'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: American Philosophical Society, 1971), pp. 462-464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peveril Meigs, "Tide mills on the Atlantic," ''Old Mill News'', no. 7, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; including many in colonial Boston over a 150-year span. &lt;ref&gt;http://thewestendmuseum.org/exhibitions/tide-power-in-colonial-boston/&lt;/ref&gt;In addition, 200 have been documented in the British Isles, and 100 in France.&lt;ref&gt;Minchinton, W. E. : "Early Tide Mills: Some Problems", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct. 1979), pp. 777-786&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rance River|Rance]] estuary in France was also home to some of these mills.

By the mid-20th century,  the use of water mills had declined dramatically.  In 1938, an investigation by [[Rex Wailes]] discovered that of the 23 extant tidal mills in England, only 10 were still working by their own motive power.  Of one at [[Beaulieu, Hampshire|Beaulieu]], [[H. J. Massingham]] wrote in the 1940s, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Part of the mill is built on piles into the river and is weatherboarded, while the rest of the building is a warm red brick roofed with lozenge-shaped and rounded tiles which I believe are called fish-tiles.  All the interior is of wood - ladders, bins for the meal, floor-boarding, square pillars, beams, narrow passages, fittings, shaft rising to the first floor and all.  So ramshackle is the arrangement of the props and supports that it is a wonder that the whole edifice does not tumble about the miller's ears like a pack of cards.  The point is that it has stood in this way for something like six centuries, and that gives the explorer into its dusky depths a more penetrating notion of how the old builders could build, more than does a Gothic church or even a cathedral.  The pulse and swing of the great wheel sets the whole building in an ague, but it will still be standing when all the flimsy excrescences of development between Beaulieu and Poole have fallen down."&lt;ref&gt;Skelton, C.P. ''British Windmills and Watermills'', Collins, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Modern examples ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{further|Tidal power}}
Newer types of [[tidal power]] often propose construction of a dam across a large river estuary.  Although hydroelectric power represents a source of [[renewable energy]], each proposal tends to come under local opposition because of its likely adverse effect on coastal habitats.  One proposal, which was developed in 1966, is the [[Rance tidal power plant|Rance barrage]], which generates 250MW.  Unlike historical tide mills, which could operate only on an [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]], the Rance barrage can generate electricity on both flows of the tide, or it can be used for [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]], depending on demand. A less intrusive design is a 1MW free-standing turbine, constructed in 2007 at [[Strangford Lough]] Narrows; this site is close to an historic tide mill.

Traction can also refer to the ''maximum'' tractive force between a body and a surface, as limited by available friction; when this is the case, traction is often expressed as the ratio of the maximum tractive force to the [[normal force]] and is termed the ''coefficient of traction'' (similar to [[coefficient of friction]]).

==Definitions==
Traction can be defined as:
{{quote|a physical process in which a tangential force is transmitted across an interface between two bodies through dry friction or an intervening fluid film resulting in motion, stoppage or the transmission of power.|Mechanical Wear Fundamentals and Testing|Raymond George Bayer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical Wear Fundamentals and Testing| first=Raymond George|last=Bayer|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8247-4620-1|page=3|chapter=Terminology and Classifications|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q64Kq2HlyucC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA3,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In vehicle dynamics, [[tractive force]] is closely related to the terms [[tractive effort]] and [[drawbar pull]], though all three terms have different definitions.

The ''coefficient of traction'' is defined as the usable force for traction divided by the weight on the running gear (wheels, tracks etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Management Fundamentals|first1=Clifford J.|last1=Schexnayder|first2=Richard|last2=Mayo|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2003|isbn=0-07-292200-1|page=346|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxrvnfEwWMkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA346,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of ground vehicles|first=Jo Yung|last=Wong|isbn=0-471-35461-9|page=317|chapter=4.1.3 Coefficient of Traction|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH8wd8im13AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA317,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.:

:usable traction = coefficient of traction x normal force

===Factors affecting coefficient of traction===

Traction between two surfaces depends on several factors:
* Material composition of each surface.
* Macroscopic and microscopic shape ([[wikt:texture|texture]]; [[macrotexture]] and [[microtexture]])
* [[Normal force]] pressing contact surfaces together.
* Contaminants at the material boundary including lubricants and adhesives.
* Relative motion of tractive surfaces - a sliding object (one in kinetic friction) has less traction than a non-sliding object (one in static friction).
* Direction of traction relative to some coordinate system - e.g., the available traction of a tire often differs between cornering, accelerating, and braking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=J670 Vehicle Dynamics Terminology|url=https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j670_200801/|publisher=[[SAE International|SAE]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For low-friction surfaces, such as off-road or ice, traction can be increased by using traction devices that partially penetrate the surface; these devices use the shear strength of the underlying surface rather than relying solely on dry friction (e.g., aggressive off-road [[tread]] or [[snow chains]])....

===Traction coefficient in engineering design===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
In the design of wheeled or tracked vehicles, high traction between wheel and ground is more desirable than low traction, as it allows for higher acceleration (including cornering and braking) without wheel slippage. One notable exception is in the motorsport technique of [[Drifting (motorsport)|drifting]], in which rear-wheel traction is purposely lost during high speed cornering.

Other designs dramatically increase surface area to provide more traction than wheels can, for example in [[continuous track]] and [[half-track]] vehicles.{{Citation needed|reason= The total traction force is completely independent of surface contact area -- see equation above. Is this misunderstanding (increased surface area allegedly gives more traction) common enough that this article needs to specifically debunk it? |date=July 2017}} A tank or similar tracked vehicle uses tracks to reduce the pressure on the areas of contact. A 70-ton M1A2 would sink to the point of high centering if it used round tires. The tracks spread the 70 tons over a much larger area of contact than tires would and allow the tank to travel over much softer land.

In some applications, there is a complicated set of trade-offs in choosing materials.  For example, soft rubbers often provide better traction but also wear faster and have higher losses when flexed—thus reducing efficiency. Choices in material selection may have a dramatic effect. For example: tires used for track racing cars may have a life of 200&amp;nbsp;km, while those used on heavy trucks may have a life approaching 100,000&amp;nbsp;km.  The truck tires have less traction and also thicker rubber.

Traction also varies with contaminants.  A layer of water in the [[contact patch]] can cause a substantial loss of traction.  This is one reason for grooves and [[Siping (rubber)|siping]] of automotive tires.

The traction of trucks, agricultural tractors, wheeled military vehicles, etc. when driving on soft and/or slippery ground has been found to improve significantly by use of Tire Pressure Control Systems (TPCS). A TPCS makes it possible to reduce and later restore the tire pressure during continuous vehicle operation. Increasing traction by use of a TPCS also reduces tire wear and ride vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.roadex.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/TPCS-Trial-RIII.pdf|title=Tyre Pressure Control on Timber Haulage Vehicles: Some observations on a trial in Highland, Scotland|first1=Ron|last1=Munro|first2=Frank|last2=MacCulloch|date=February 2008|publisher=ROADEX III Northern Periphery|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:waxedpaper.jpg|thumb|Wax paper]]

'''Wax paper''' (also '''waxed paper''' or '''paraffin paper''') is [[paper]] that has been made moisture-proof through the application of [[wax]].

The practice of oiling [[parchment]] or paper in order to make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the [[Middle Ages]]. Paper impregnated or coated with purified [[beeswax]] was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. [[Gustave Le Gray]] introduced the use of waxed paper for [[photographic negative]]s in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jawadonweb.com/?page_id=900|date=December 29, 2008|title=9 Inventions Edison Did Not Make|author=Jawad Shuaib|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural wax was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after [[Herman Frasch]] developed ways of purifying [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and coating paper with it in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CAB|wstitle=Frasch, Herman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wax paper is commonly used in [[cooking]] for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as [[cookie]]s, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in [[handicraft|arts and crafts]].

==Food preparation==
Oven: wax paper is not recommended for baking use as it will smoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reynoldskitchens.com/media/7606859/cut_rite_faq.pdf] Reynolds company, frequently asked questions. Retrieved October 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parchment paper]] is better for this use.

Microwave: wax paper can be used to prevent splatters by covering the food when [[microwave cooking]]. Since the paper is mostly unaffected by [[microwaves]], it will not heat to the point of [[combustion]] under normal usage. This makes wax paper more functional than [[plastic wrap]] which will melt at higher temperatures, or [[aluminium foil]] which is not safe for use in most [[microwave oven]]s.

==Other uses==
Safety [[safety razor|razor blades]] are traditionally wrapped in wax paper to make handling them less dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/papier/wachs/wachs.htm|title=Waxed paper|website=www.tis-gdv.de|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wax paper can also be used to make long lasting paper boats because of its high resistance to water.

From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, wax paper was used as a common wrapping for sports card packages (O-Pee-Chee, Topps, Donruss, etc.). It was notorious for leaving wax markings on the back card where the wax paper was heated to be sealed. Wax paper was used as a way to keep the enclosed piece of [[bubble gum]] protected.

In the mid-1990s, sports card manufacturers stopped including pieces of bubble gum in packs of sports cards, thus ending the need for wax paper packs. [[Plastic]] ([[mylar]]) or other [[plastic-coated paper|plastic/paper blends]] were used from then on.

Wax paper is also commonly used to attach pattern pieces to fabric while cutting it for sewing. One presses an iron over the wax paper briefly and attaches it to the cloth, making it easier to trace while cutting.

When children's playground slides were made of metal, it was common to sit on a piece of wax paper. This would not only lessen the heat, it would make the ride much faster.

Wax paper's particularly high [[dielectric strength]] makes it a practical [[electrical insulator]], although modern materials have surpassed and mostly replaced it. Common applications are coil winding separators and [[capacitor]] dielectrics, and other applications requiring resilience against a potential difference up to the order of a few thousand volts per layer.

Turntablists (DJs) commonly place one or multiple sheets of wax paper under their records to increase record slip and aid in scratch (where the record is rotated in a number of different ways by a finger to create special sound effects) routines.

In [[photography]], wax paper can be used as a light diffuser.

==Environmental issues==
There are multiple environmental issues concerned with wax paper. Though it is biodegradable in its unaltered form{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, oft-applied additives such as petroleum rid it of that quality. Wax paper also cannot be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wills|first1=Amanda|url=http://earth911.com/food/ask-the-editor-recycling-wax-paper/|website=earth911.com/|publisher=Earth911|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welltec''' is an international provider of robotic well [[solution]]s for the oil and gas industry. The company's flagship is the “Well Tractor”, a remote-controlled device that is able to convey other intervention tools and perform operations on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]]. The Well Tractor enables operators to run operations on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] in the entire length of horizontal and highly deviated wells. With the ability to reach the end of these well types, recoverable reserves are increased.

Services range from [[well logging|logging]] and [[perforation (oil well)|perforation]] to mechanical services such as plug pulling/setting, valve manipulation, clean-up, milling and many more. 
 
The company was established in 1994; today the company has established over 45 offices worldwide and employs more than 1,000 people.

==History==
Jørgen Hallundbæk, the founder and CEO of Welltec, conceived the idea behind the Well Tractor while he was a graduate student at the [[Technical University of Denmark]]. The idea consisted of eliminating the large and expensive amounts of equipment needed for conveying tools and performing interventions in oil and gas wells. The Well Tractor enabled operators to reach the horizontal part of oil and gas wells and getting past the deviated sections using standard electrical [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]]. Generally, wells are considered deviated when they reach an inclination higher than 60°. Previously, interventions in horizontal and deviated wells were considered a lengthy and costly process.

New technology in the oil and gas industry is not readily accepted due to the costs of failure. The multinational oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] has estimated that new technology requires 20–30 years to achieve broad acceptance [http://www.oilonline.com/news/features/oe/20070514.Wireless.23608.asp]. The Well Tractor performed its first job in 1996, an operation that took place in the North Sea offshore Norway [http://www.statoil.com/STATOILCOM%5CSVG00990.nsf/UNID/41256A3A0055DD31C1256ECF002C4A14?opendocument].

In 2003 the company went from being a sub contractor to other service companies to being a direct contractor to the operators.

Today, Welltec has more than 45 offices and service facilities worldwide including Headquarters located in Allerød, Denmark.

In July 2007, Welltec partnered with [[Summit Partners]], a [[growth capital]] private equity investor.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Summit-Partners-Invests-in-Welltec-755591.htm Summit Partners Invests in Welltec], Marketwire, July 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service Range==

Welltec provides a range of services to international oil and gas companies from the drilling &amp; evaluation phase to the [[completion (oil well)|completion]] and production phases. Services are delivered on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]]. The proprietary technology is developed and manufactured at headquarters in Allerød.

Services solve problems across different well types and environments. Welltec’s technology is applicable in vertical, horizontal, deviated and technologically advanced wells. Challenging conditions may be [[oil well|wells]] such as deepwater, Subsea, extended reach, high-yield, heavy oil, Arctic conditions and unconventional gas environments.

[[Wireline (cabling)|Wireline]] technology is by many people in the oil and gas industry viewed as a focus area with potential for development, and Welltec has expanded their technology portfolio during the years. Most services are performed with the Well Tractor that conveys [[well logging|logging tools]] or intervention tools to the desired point in the well where an intervention is needed. Originally, the Well Tractor was designed as a tool conveyor but today it is also able to perform interventions.

Initially, the Well Tractor formed Welltec’s tool portfolio, but in 2003 the so-called mechanical down hole services were added to the portfolio of technology. These intervention services are intended for electric wireline operations such as valve manipulation, scale milling, setting and pulling plugs, milling plugs and sand bailing.
To date, Welltec has developed and produced seven tools with different areas of operation. Apart from the [[Wireline (cabling)|Wireline]] Well Tractor, a [[Coiled tubing]] Well Tractor has been manufactured, which instead of running on wireline is fluid-driven. The mechanical down hole services consist of the Well Stroker, the Well Key, the Well Cleaner, the Well Miller and the Welltec Release Device. All tool names are registered trademarks of Welltec.
